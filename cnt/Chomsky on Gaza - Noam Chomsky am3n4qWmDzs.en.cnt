okay thank you for waiting I'm John
chairman of the Center for International
Studies which is sponsoring this talk
today along with the program on human
rights and justice before we begin a few
quick announcements one is that we will
have some time for questions at the end
of Professor Chomsky's talk and what
we'll do is at the end of the talk we
can line up on either side in front of
the microphone I think is the best way
to do it we'll just go back and forth
with questions I hope rather than
statements or manifestos also the the
senator is sponsoring a couple of talks
that potentially of interest to this
audience in the next month or so one is
coming on January 29th I think in late
afternoon you'll have to check our
website for exact time and location on
refugees remarkable book assembled on
refugees refugee voices by the actress
Mia Kirchner and she will be here
actually for an i AP activity for the
next two weeks starting next week and
we'll cap it off with the public talk
that's on the 29th and then on the 19th
of February we will have Eyal Weitzman
who is a Israeli architect and critic
social critic who will be here also a
late afternoon lecture on February 19th
again location you can find on our web
site today I am introducing the man who
no introduction so I won't give him much
of one except to say that we're really
delighted that Noam Chomsky can join us
today certainly one of the world's most
important intellectuals and activists
and speaking today on a subject he knows
well so please help me in welcoming Noam
Chomsky
as you know on Saturday December 27 the
latest US Israeli attack on hopeless
Palestinians was launched it had been
meticulously prepared we know from the
Israeli press that both aspects of the
campaign had long been carefully
prepared both the military aspect and
the propaganda aspect learning from the
lessons of the 2006 invasion of Lebanon
which it was argued was not planned well
from a military point of view and was
not advertised properly so this time
both of those aspects were under control
with extensive programs and that means
we can be reasonably confident that
anything that's happening or that is
said is purposeful its planned that way
maybe not everything but most of it one
thing that was planned carefully was the
time of the launching of the war was
carefully chosen it was shortly before
noon on Saturday when children are
returning from school and crowds are
milling around in the streets of densely
populated Gaza City and it took only a
few minutes to kill well over 200 people
and wound around 700 which is an
auspicious opening to the mass slaughter
of defenseless civilians trapped in a
tiny cage with nowhere to flee that was
Saturday December 27th last Saturday
two weeks later Israel barred
humanitarian shipments the Gaza Strip
because we have to after all honor the
holy days
none of this is at all surprising it's
familiar just to mention one parallel
which is relevant we'll come to it later
in June 1982 when Israel launched its
us-backed invasion of Lebanon the first
target attacked was a Sabra and Shatila
refugee camps later to become famous
because of a major massacre the bombing
hit the hospital the Gaza hospital
killed more than 200 people that was the
opening day of the invasion which killed
maybe fifteen to twenty thousand people
destroyed much of southern Lebanon which
parts of Beirut it was able to proceed
as usual because of us support us
authorization us arms diplomatic support
which included vetoing a series of
Security Council resolutions calling for
an end to the carnage the aggression was
undertaken also as usual and as conceded
in fact to defend Israel namely from the
threat of a peaceful political
settlement that's contrary to much
routine deceit in the United States
particularly but it's all so well
documented it's hardly necessary to talk
about it oh this is normal and it's not
concealed by high Israeli officials just
give one example thirty years ago the
chief of staff of the army more Figur
pointed out that quote him since 1948 we
have been fighting against a population
that lives in villages and cities
Israel's major military analysts say if
Schiff summarized his remarks it said
the Israeli army has always struck Civ
in populations purposely unconsciously
the army Gorsedd has never distinguished
civilian from military targets but has
purposely attacked civilian targets and
the reasons were explained at the same
time by the distinguished statesman of
Evan considered dove he said there was a
rational prospect ultimately fulfilled
that affected populations would exert
pressure for the cessation of
hostilities satisfying Israel's goals
Evan happened to be commenting on a
speech by Menachem Bagan which presented
a picture Evan said of an Israel
wantonly inflicting every possible
measure of death and anguish on civilian
populations in a mood reminiscent of
regimes which neither mr. Vega nor I
would dare to mention by name Evan did
not contest the facts he criticized
vagin for speaking about them so frankly
which could be harmful the Israeli image
his own views which I just quoted could
also be attributed to countries that we
dare not mentioned by name well as the
latest US Israeli assault on Gaza began
a small boat the dignity was traveling
from Cyprus to Lebanon there were
doctors and human rights activists
aboard and they intended to violate
Israel's criminal blockade and to bring
supplies to the trapped population the
boat was intercepted far out at sea in
international waters the Israeli Navy
rammed it without warnings really
damaged the boat it managed to limp to a
Lebanese harbour Israel provided the
routine lives of terrorists etc and
claimed that the boat wasn't around but
unfortunately for the propaganda system
there were respected journalists on
board including CNN correspondent Karl
Penhaul who reported there were other al
Jazeera reporters but Penhall is hard to
dismiss though he was dismissed also
aboard was cynthia mckinney the former
representative a candidate presidential
candidate for the green party and she
and other passengers verified called
Penhall's account which I've just stated
this is all quite a serious crime
for example of ramp ramming and almost
sinking a boat in international waters
is a much more serious crime than piracy
off the coast of Somalia for example it
received very little notice you know few
words here and there it's which reflects
a tasin tacit acceptance of the
principle that Israel is authorized to
carry out crimes on the high seas in
order to defend itself against any
interference with its illegal military
occupation by trying to provide some
sucker to the victims also tacitly
accepted is that the Gaza Strip isn't is
occupied territory that is Israel has a
right to impose a siege on it
well that lack of attention again makes
good sense it's all very familiar for
decades Israel has been hijacking ships
in international waters between Cyprus
and Lebanon killing passengers
kidnapping them many of them brought to
Israel some held as hostages for a long
time in prison sometimes in the secret
prison torture chambers which have been
exposed in Israel in Europe but not
reported here
and it's known occasionally see a
mention of it in US commentary but never
considered very serious so there's no
particular reasons why this new crime
should be greeted with anything more
than a yawn
these regular practices are quite
significant they underscore the utter
hypocrisy of the standard claim that
Israel had the right to invade Lebanon
once again in 2006 v invasion because
soldiers were captured at the border
actually as I say this has been Israeli
practice over many years has been far
more extreme killing intercepting ships
killing people they're capturing them as
hostages oh that is far more extreme
crime than capturing soldiers out of
order
most think what you do about that but it
doesn't rank anywhere near it so if that
justifies the invasion which again once
again devastated southern Lebanon and
parts of Beirut if principals operated
you can draw your own conclusions
but fortunately they don't operate
fortunately for the US and its clients
this cross-border operation of Hezbollah
in 2006 was its first cross-border
action of any kind in six years since
Israel had withdrawn from southern
Lebanon where it had occupied southern
Lebanon with us support for 22 years in
violation of Security Council
resolutions meanwhile Israel daily
violates the border throughout these six
years as indeed it is doing today and
again that's with impunity and nothing
were they on if it's even mentioned well
these new crimes that began on December
27th there they don't fit easily into
any of the standard categories
except for one namely familiarity they
do fit into that category I've given a
couple of examples and there's time I'll
return two more literally the current US
Israeli invasion falls under the
category of terrorism at least according
to the US official definition of the
word but that does not capture the
enormity of the crime it cannot be
called aggression and the reason is that
it's taking place in occupied territory
that's accepted in the West tacitly and
it's basically beyond question it's
recognized by Israeli scholarship so the
most important case I know is
comprehensive the one and only
comprehensive scholarly history of
Israeli settlement in the occupied
territories it's been translated now in
English called Lords of the land by IDI
Zaire tel on Akiva Eldar they point out
that quote after Israel withdrew its
forces from Gaza in August 2005 the
ruined territory was not released for
even a single day from Israel's military
grip or from the price of the occupation
that the inhabitants pay every day
Israel left behind scorched earth
devastated services and people with
nearly with neither a present or a
future the settlements were destroyed
the Jewish settlements in an ungenerous
move by an unenlightened occupier which
in fact continues to control the
territory and kill and harass its
inhabitants by means of its formidable
military might which is extra not
exercised with extraordinary savagery
always with firm US support and
participation crucial fact for us even
before the latest onslaught the US
Israeli assault on Gaza escalated in
January 2006 a few months after the
formal withdrawal
because Palestinians committed a real
crime they voted the wrong way in a free
election and that's a serious crime
you have to they have to learn that like
others easy to add examples that there's
a cost to disobeying the commands of the
master who incidentally continues to
pray about is yearning for democracy
without eliciting ridicule from the
educated classes which is quite an
achievement of their educational and
cultural system one of many
well since terrorism the terms terrorism
and aggression are inadequate some new
term is needed for the sadistic and
cowardly torture of people who are caged
with no possibility of escape while
they're being pounded daily by the most
sophisticated products of US military
technology provided in the certain
knowledge that this is how they'll be
used happens to be in direct violation
of US law of course also international
law but for self declared outlaw States
that's just another minor technicality
so there's no need to comment on it just
how serious these weapons are remains to
be completely verified they apparently
include white phosphorus according to
Human Rights Watch which is another
violation of the laws of war and who
knows what else one of the heroic
volunteers in Gaza a Norwegian doctor my
Gilbert describes his sense of her as an
all-out war goes on against the civilian
population of Gaza he estimates that
half the casualties are women and
children the men who are killed are also
civilians by any reasonable legal
standards almost all he says that he has
scarcely seen a militant
a casualty among the hundreds of
shredded bodies but that's in accord
with the gore Evan Evan principles which
I mentioned and in fact with consistent
practice his estimate is confirmed by
the UN humanitarian chief John Holmes
who informed reporters that it's a fair
presumption that most of the civilians
killed were women and children in a
humanitarian crisis that is worsening
day by day as the violence continued
those who don't like that story can be
comforted by the words of CP Livni who
is the leading dove in the electoral
system who assured the world that there
is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza
thanks to Israeli benevolence like
others who care about the human beings
and their fate Gilbert and Holmes called
for pleaded in fact for cease fire but
not yet the u.s. blocked the Security
Council from issuing a formal statement
calling for a ceasefire there was an
official reason which I'll quote there
was no indication that Hamas would abide
by any agreement of all the
justifications that have been offered
for delighting and slaughter this must
rank among the most cynical of course
that was bush and rice they're soon to
be replaced by Barack Obama who
compassionately repeats that if missiles
were falling where my two daughters
sleep I would do everything everything
in order to stop that he's talking about
Israeli children beyond that he's
maintained its silence a few days later
under intense international pressure the
u.s. did back a Security Council
resolution which called for what they
called a durable ceasefire it passed 14
to 0 United States abstaining Israel and
us Hawks were angered that the United
States did not veto it
as the usual practice is the Upstate
abstention however does give Israel if
not a green at least a yellow light to
continue with the slaughter the
resolution called for stopping the flow
of arms into Gaza though not into Israel
in fact vast quantities of arms
continued to flow into Israel on
December 30th three days after the
latest invasion now the Pentagon
released the fact that huge but the US
has commissioned several German ships to
bring huge quantities of arms from
Greece to Israel they're just I would
notice that they are they're labeled
ammunition I think it was 3,000 tons the
very few inquiries to the Pentagon about
what's going on were answered with
assurance that the arms would arrive too
late to be used in the current assault
against Gaza which is probably correct
and I can also said that they're not
really intended for Israel which is also
probably correct but rather they are
being pre positioned in Israel Israel is
regarded as an offshore US military base
right in the periphery of the most
important region of the world the oil
energy producing region it's one of its
contributions one of the services the
u.s. power and the arms that are
pre-positioned there will be if the
Pentagon is accurate not for Israeli
violence but for us violence so the next
act of aggression and the region can
make use of the arms stored there for
the purpose is much more if it ever gets
reported it will be you can predict that
it will be explained that this is to
defend to protect the free flow of oil
and to assure stability the
the technical terms used for aggression
and criminal violence standardly well
going back to the UN resolution did call
for stopping the flow of arms into Gaza
in fact but it also quote ensures the
sustained reopening of the crossing
points on the basis of the 2005
agreement on movement and access between
the Palestinian Authority and Israel
what was the 2005 agreement that
determined that the crossings to Gaza
would be operated on a continuous basis
that is never closed and that Israel
would also allow the crossing of goods
between Gaza and the West Bank for two
parts of Palestine in January 2006 the
US and Israel abandoned the agreement
that's part of the punishment of
Palestinians for voting the wrong way in
a free election we take democracy very
seriously here must be understood
there's a good deal of sober debate
these days on what the attackers hope to
achieve I don't think that's very
obscure when we took a take a brief look
at recent history Israel abandoned Gaza
in September 2005 why well rational
Israeli hardliners like Ariel Sharon as
the patron saint of the settler movement
understood that it was senseless to
subsidize a few thousand settlers to
live illegally of course in the ruins of
Gaza protected by a large part of the
IDF the Israeli army while they took
over used much of the land and the
scarce resources of the territory
including its water it made much more
sense to turn Gaza into what's properly
been called the world's
are just prison and two unlit the people
just rot and to transfer the settlers to
the West Bank which is much more
valuable territory and they can be
subsidized illegally to live there a
couple other places
Israel's quite explicit in its
intentions about the West Bank in Word
and in deed
the goal is clearly to and they say it
to annex the heir of the arable land
that's the water supplies the pleasant
suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv all of
those that lie within what they call the
separation wall an annexation wall it
was declared illegal by the World Court
the u.s. just disagreeing but of course
that's again irrelevant and outlaw
states the territory to be annexed
includes vastly expanded Jerusalem
that's in violation of Security Council
orders that go back to 40 years
in addition Israel will take over and in
fact has been taking over the Jordan
Valley it's about a third of the West
Bank that imprisons what's left the part
that's imprisoned is broken into
fragments by settled salience to major
said ants that basically trisect the
territory and many other settlements and
hundreds of mostly arbitrary checkpoints
which are designed to make life
impossible for the two-headed beasts who
may remain and will be like a drugged
roaches scurrying around in a bottle I'm
quoting the highest Israeli political
and military leaders in this case their
revered Prince's as they're called the
owners of the land may grant the drug
roaches a few scattered parcels but
that's out of good will not buy right
Prime Minister Olmert she may recall
addressed a joint session of Congress in
May 2006 and 2008 of Asian he said I
believed and to this day still believe
in our peoples eternal and historic
right to this entire land his start the
entire land includes at least everything
from the Jordan to the sea and given his
background it may include Jordan as well
to which it laid this party laid claim
the he also announced the program that's
for what he called conversions that's
for taking over a program for taking
over whatever is valuable in the West
Bank
leaving the Palestinians and isolated
Canton's
such plans tres are not new you know
maybe the details are but they traced
back to the earliest days of the
occupation a few days after the end of
the war defense minister Moshe Dayan who
among the Israeli leadership is perhaps
the most sympathetic to the palestinian
plight
he explained poetically that the
situation today resembles the complex
relationship between a Bedouin man and a
girl he kidnaps against her will you
Palestinians as a nation don't want us
today but will change your attitude by
forcing our presence on you you will
live like dogs and whoever will leave
will leave and meanwhile we'll take what
we want that's 1967 at the very moment
there was no doubt that these Paul
announced policies were criminal
immediately after the 1967 war the
Israeli government was informed by its
highest legal authority Theodor meron
well-known international figure and
international law
they were informed that the civilian
settlement in the administered
territories what they call them
contravenes the explicit provisions of
the Fourth Geneva Convention that's a
serious crime and it's incumbent on all
of the High Contracting Parties that
parties that sign the Geneva Convention
it's incumbent on them to act to prevent
such crimes of course they don't do it
the United States no it doesn't do it
but that's the crimes but again in an
outlaw State that's an irrelevant so
he's no discussion of it
that's Theodor meron he was supported by
the Israel Israel's justice minister
concurred in his judgement and the World
Court unanimously endorsed that
conclusion and its decision in 2004 on
the annexation wall meanwhile the
Israeli High Court formally agreed with
the world Court while disagreeing in its
usual convoluted style if you look at
the judgments in the West Bank Israel
can pursue its criminal programs with us
support and with no disturbance that's
thanks to its effective military control
and by now also the cooperation of the
collaborationist Palestinian security
forces that have been armed and trained
by the United States and its allies it
can also carry out regular
assassinations and other crimes while
the settlers rampage under IDF
protection but while the West Bank has
been effectively subdued by terror there
still is resistance in the other half of
Palestine the Gaza Strip that too has to
be quelled for the us-israeli programmes
of annexation and destruction of
Palestinians to proceed
hence the invasion of Gaza the timing of
the invasion was probably presumably
influenced by the
coming Israeli elections a hood Barak
who runs the invasion had been lagging
badly in the polls but one Israeli
commentator run huh Kahane in the early
days of the slaughter calculated that
for every four eight forty Arabs killed
Barak gains one parliamentary seat
however the reasons lie much deeper than
winning an election I think the reasons
are those that I mentioned and they're
really on the surface doesn't take much
insight to perceive them
well aggression always has a pretext in
this case there's a mantra that's
endlessly repeated you've heard it a
thousand times in Israel in the United
States and in Europe and the mantra is
that Israel has the right to use force
to defend itself against custom rockets
and that's partially accurate the
rocketing is a criminal act and it's
true that a state has the right to
defend itself against criminal attacks
but the claim that a right that the
state has the right to use force to do
so goes far beyond any principle that we
would or should accept so for example I
doubt that there are many people here
who think that Nazi Germany had a right
to defend itself against the Terrorism
of the partisans which was quite real
Kristallnacht in 1938 was not justified
by the fact that Hershel Greenspan
assassinated a German embassy official
in Paris
the British were not justified in
terrorizing Irish Catholics in response
to IRA terror and incidentally when they
finally sensibly turned to the sensible
policy of addressing legitimate
grievances in the territory they
occupied the terror ended it's not a
matter of proportionality a widely-used
word it's a matter of choice of action
in the first place proportional or not
is there a more justified response than
violence forgetting proportionality well
any resort the force always carries a
heavy burden of proof and in every case
including the present case we have to
ask whether it can be met can it be met
in the case of Israel's effort to quell
any resistance to its criminal actions
both in Gaza and in the West Bank where
the criminal actions continue
relentlessly perhaps I may quote myself
if you don't mind in an interview in the
Israeli press a couple of years ago on
all Nertz announced convergence plans
for the West Bank what I said is that
the US and Israel do not tolerate any
resistance to these plans preferring to
pretend falsely of course that there is
no partner as they proceed with programs
that go back a long way we may recall
that Gaza and the West Bank are
recognized to be a unit so if resistance
to the u.s. Israeli annexation
canonization programs is legitimate in
the West Bank than it is in Gaza - I
think that's correct
the respected a separate question is
whether the modality of resistance is
legitimate the totally separate question
we may agree that Herschel green spend
committed a criminal act and that the
partisans committed terror but there's
nothing to do with the question whether
Germany had a right to respond with
force same in the British case so those
are just two questions that should be
separated well dr. Mustafa Barghouti is
highly respected Palestinian
parliamentarian and official he reported
that since George Bush's Annapolis
extravaganza in November 2007 may recall
much impressive rhetoric about
dedication to peace and justice he
reports that since
November 2007 Israeli attacks on
Palestinians escalated sharply with an
almost 50% increase in the West Bank
along with a sharp increase in
settlements and Israeli checkpoints
quite obviously these criminal actions
are not a response to rockets from Gaza
although the converse may well be the
case as he in fact suggests Israel has a
straightforward means to defend itself
easy put an end to the criminal actions
and they occupied territories that means
accept the long-standing international
consensus on a two-state settlement on
the international border with perhaps
minor mutual modifications that's has
been a overwhelming international
consensus for over 30 years
blocked by the United States and by
Israel that began officially in 1976
Washington's first veto of a Security
Council resolution calling for a
two-state settlement I'm not going to
run through the rest of the record
there's no time but it's very clear
today u.s. Israeli rejection ISM is even
more blatant than it has been in the
past in part because of the Arab
League's formal proposal for a
settlement that goes beyond the
international consensus calling for a
normalization of relations a ssin of
relations with Israel every time you see
the word Hamas in the newspapers it's
accompanied by Iranian supplied Hamas
not us supplied Israel and Hamas which
is committed to the destruction of
Israel which you don't read is Hamas
which long ago joined the international
consensus on a two-state settlement that
the US and Israel bar that would be
excluded in the Free Press biased but
it's a fact
so the Arab League's calling for
normalization Hamas is calling for a
two-state settlement Iran and Hezbollah
have made it clear explicitly that they
will not they will abide by any
agreement the Palestinians accept that
leaves the United States and Israel in
splendid isolation both in word and also
of course in actions they are acting to
undermine it and make it impossible day
by day
now there is one exception crucial
exception to the persistent rejection
ism of the United States and Israel
you'll recall that in 2000 the year 2000
there were negotiations in Camp David
which collapsed contrary to the standard
story that President Clinton recognized
that the u.s. Israeli proposals at Camp
David were quite unacceptable and in
December 2000 he presented what he
called his parameters they were kind of
vague but they were more forthcoming you
could at least imagine a settlement in
those terms Clinton also pointed out
gave a speech in which he pointed out
that both sides had accepted the
parameters and that both sides had
reservations they then met in Taba Egypt
in January 2001 to resolve the
differences and they came very close to
a settlement in fact in their final
press conference they said if they'd had
a few more days they could have reached
a settlement the negotiations were
cancelled at that point by prime
minister Barak of Israel that's the one
break in 30 years of us Israeli
rejection ISM and I should say that it's
not that many years ago there's no
reason why that one break can't be
resumed if an American president decides
to allow it to be resumed in which case
there will be those shrieks from the
famed Israeli Lobby just as there were
none at that time and it could easily be
implemented well it's up to us to
determine well that I've just reported
the fact it can easily firm that though
I'd urge that you verify them it's not
that hard give you the sources if you
like but there's a preferred version
which as usual is quite different from
the facts the preferred version quote
Ethan Branagh or the New York Times
correspondent in Israel a preferred
version is that many abroad recall mr.
Barack as the Prime Minister who in 2000
went further than any other Israeli
leader in peace offers to the
Palestinian only to see see the deal
fail and explode in a violent
Palestinian uprising that drove him from
power
well he's partly right it's true that
many abroad believe these fairytales
thanks to it Brunner and all too many of
his colleagues called journalism there's
also a narrower question than the one
I've just been discussing let's the
narrower question puts aside resistance
to Israel's ongoing West Bank crimes and
again when I say Israel I mean us Israel
crimes because can't be done without us
authorization and material and
diplomatic and in fact ideological
support so put a put aside all that and
just consider Gaza alone does Israel
have peaceful alternatives to the use of
force in response to attacks on its
territory just keeping to Gaza alone
well the answer is it surely does it
could accept the ceasefire sometimes in
fact it has accepted a ceasefire while
instantly violating it in the most
recent case crucial case is June 2008
there was a ceasefire that was
instituted it called for opening the
border crossings quote
to allow the transfer of all goods that
were banned and restricted to go into
Gaza Israel agreed but immediately
announced that it would not open the
borders until Hamas released Gilad
Shalit an Israeli soldier who was
captured by Hamas in June 2006 the end
of that ceasefire well that's another
mantra incidentally everybody's heard
about Gilad Shalit and the terrible
crime of capturing him and how till he's
released you know how can you move
towards peace but that's just more
hypocrisy in fact the apocrypha of so
blatant it really is an impressive feat
for Western journalism especially
American journalism and intellectual
culture to suppress it one day before
Hamas captured shall eat Israeli
soldiers entered Gaza Gaza City and
kidnapped two civilians the muammar
brothers their names are not known they
brought them to Israel and of course in
violation of international law to join
the thousands of other prisoners held
there close to a thousand without charge
and of course that had been regular
Israeli practice for a long time I
mentioned some of the cases now
kidnapping civilians is a far more
serious crime than capturing a soldier
of an attacking army but all that
remains in memory allegedly blocking
peace is the capture of Shalott again
that reflects the difference in
treatment between human beings on the
one side and two-legged beasts on the
other shall eat should be returned in a
fair prisoner exchange but try to find
an honest comment on this anywhere it
was after the capture of Shalott that
israel's military attacked past from
vicious to truly sadistic but it's well
to remember that even before his capture
in june 2006
Israel had fired more than 7,700 shells
at northern Gaza since its September
withdrawal of listening virtually no
comment maybe none Israel has maintained
the siege ever since it rejected the
June 2008 ceasefire that it accepted a
siege is an act of war justifying
massive violence in response that's a
point on which Israel has always
insisted when its own access to the
outside world is hampered in any way in
fact it's the justification for major
Wars so if that's true surely should be
a justification for rockets the Israel
went so far in the siege is to prevent
the UN relief and Works Administration
the UN agency that keeps Palestinian
alive I kept them from even replenishing
their stores so when the ceasefire broke
down we ran out of food for the 750,000
people who depend on us that's John King
the Irish director of Lanois informing
the BBC well despite the continuing
Israeli siege again a serious act of war
rocketing sharply reduced during the
period of the ceasefire the ceasefire
broke down last November November 4th
with an Israeli raid into Gaza the raid
was very carefully timed as usual it
came shortly before Hamas talks with
Hamas Fatah talks in Cairo that were
aimed at reconciling their differences
and creating a single unified government
that would have been the first such
meetings since the Civil War
in June 2007 that left Hamas in control
of Gaza and it would have been a
significant step towards advancing
diplomatic efforts so it was quite
useful to undercut that
danger by violating the ceasefire and
invading Gaza killing six people the
civil war itself was instigated by the
United States and Israel it was a very
crude attempt to set up a military to
carry out a military coup to overthrow
the democratically elected government
that the United States opposes again
pretty standard practice
well the blockade was tightened further
after November 4th disastrous
consequences for the population both
Scott sighs escalated violence all the
deaths were Palestinian and that
continued until the ceasefire formally
ended on December 19th and Prime
Minister Olmert authorized the
full-scale invasion a few days before
that about a week before Hamas had
proposed to return to the original July
ceasefire agreement which Israel had not
observed the that offer was transmitted
to a senior official in the Israeli army
by Robert pastor he's a academic
historian and a firm former Carter
Administration high official but Israel
did not respond except by launching the
invasion of course Israel was aware that
the head of Shin bait that's the
Internal Security Agency it was quoted
in Israeli sources on December 21st as
saying that Hamas is interested in
continuing the calm with Israel while
its military wing is continuing
preparation for conflict okay so no calm
we'd rather have conflict Israel's
senior diplomatic correspondent Akiva
Eldar reports that shortly before Israel
launched its full-scale invasion on
Saturday December 27th Hamas I'm quoting
him Hamas bulletproof followed Michelle
proposed ceasefire and return to the
arrangement of 2005 which permitted
continuous opening of the cross at
crossings to for desperately needed
supplies the response was the invasion
in a front page think piece on the
latest Gaza invasion New York Times
correspondent Steven Lee Myers writes
that in some ways the attack on Gaza was
reminiscent of the gamble Israel took in
Lebanon in 1982 when it invaded to
eliminate the threat of Yasser Arafat's
forces is correct there is a similarity
and the threat is the same he's correct
but not in the sense he had in mind in
1982 as in 2008 the threat was the
threat of political settlement and it
was crucially necessary to eliminate
that threat that's again standard
practice I mean it's not that Israel
does not want peace of course it wants
peace everyone wants peace Hitler wanted
peace for example the question is on
what terms from its origins long before
the establishment of the state the
design until to delay political
settlement that meanwhile slowly
building facts on the ground as the
basis for some eventual settlement even
the occasional agreements as in 1947
were recognized by the leadership to be
temporary steps towards further
expansion the 1982 war is a dramatic
illustration of the need for
undercutting the threat of political
settlement it was called a pretty openly
in Israel a war for the West Bank we can
get rid of the diplomatic efforts of
Palestinians which were becoming very
annoying we can continue to take over
the West Bank at the cost of the
destruction of Lebanon and the killing
of thousand
people the 1982 Lebanon War was followed
by Israeli support for Hamas so as to
undermine the secular PLO and it's
dangerous peace initiatives another case
that should be familiar if it isn't is
Israeli provocations before the 1967 war
which were designed to elicit a Syrian
response that could be used as a pretext
for Israeli violence and for the
takeover of more land that's at least 80
percent of the incidents according to
defense minister Moshe Dayan the F this
efforts persistent effort to delay
political accommodation has always made
perfect sense it's not irrational and
the same is true of the hysterical lies
about how there is no partner there
simply is no other way to take over land
where you're not wanted
so it's sensible and for the same reason
similar reasons Israel has consistently
preferred expansion through security
particularly that's been particularly
evident since 1971 when Israel made a
really fateful decision I think backed
by Henry Kissinger namely the decision
to reject the offer of a full peace
treaty by President Sadat of Egypt which
incidentally offered nothing to the
Palestinians it's an agreement that
Israel and the United States were
compelled to accept at Camp David eight
years later it's after a major war which
was a near disaster for Israel and
immense suffering now that goes down in
history as a wonderful achievement of US
involvement in the bringing peace in
fact it was a diplomatic tast Rafi for
the reasons I mentioned but that's you
know beyond the capacity of educated
people to discuss or think about again I
urge you to look at the facts if you're
interested now a priest peace treaty
with Egypt in
1971 which the US and Israel rejected
that would have ended any significant
security threat
it was none when the Palestinians and
Egypt is the major Arab military force
by far but there was an unacceptable
quid pro quo
so that insisted that Israel abandon its
extensive settlement programs in Egypt
mainly in the northeastern Sinai and as
usual security was a lower priority than
expansion as it still is today Israel
could have security normalization of
relations integration into the region
but it very clearly prefers illegal
expansion conflict a repeated exercise
of violence to teach lessons to the
two-legged beasts actions that are
severely eroding its security even if it
gains short-term military victory one of
the wisest voices in Israel
unfortunately a tiny minority weary of
nary recently wrote that after an
Israeli military victory in Gaza what
will be seared into the consciousness of
the world will be the image of Israel as
a blood-stained monster ready at any
moment to commit war crimes and not
prepared to abide by any moral
restraints this will have severe
consequences for our long-term future
our standing in the world our chance of
achieving peace and quiet in the end
this war is a crime against ourselves -
a crime against the State of Israel
it's good reason to believe that he's
right if I can quote myself again
several decades ago 30 years ago I wrote
that those who call themselves
supporters of Israel are in reality
supporters of its moral degeneration and
it's probable ultimate destruction and
regrettably that judgment looks more and
more plausible meanwhile we're observing
a very rare moment in history
it's what the late Israeli sociologist
kimberlyn called politicized politicize
that's the murder of an Asian at our
hands thanks
if you have questions for professor
Chomsky should go to the mics as I said
earlier and just line up and will
recognize you as time permits okay yes
good morning out all good evening
professor my questions about the
consensus the American Census about the
support or Israel's role as part of
America's geopolitical future recently
there was a letter in the Financial
Times about how our support for Israel
is such a huge duty geostrategic gift to
China and other competitors it's a huge
one geo strategic gift to China to try
and the other competitors yeah does are
we seeing a crack in the consensus about
the role of Israel it's a serious
question one can debate whether it's
been wise for the United States to take
the position of extreme support for
Israeli violence and terror expansion
criminal acts to reject political
settlement that's a question that can be
asked what we do know is that the
American elites think it's right
I mentioned the military which is very
happy with it
partly because Israel is just a major
and obedient military base in fact back
in 1958
US intelligence concluded that support
for Israel is a what they sorta called I
think a logical it's a logical corollary
of our opposition to what they call
radical Arab nationalism radical just
means independent not following orders
so yes it's a logical corollary to
support for opposition to Arab
independent Arab nationalism and if you
look at in 1967 when the relations
really became firm there was a reaction
immediate reaction to a
major service that the United States
that Israel performed for the United
States and for its major allies Saudi
Arabia namely destroying the basis for
secular Arab nationalism in the region
Abdel Nasser is Egypt and so it
continues and up till today the military
is quite happy to have a an obedient
powerful military force according it's a
Israel's air and armoured forces small
country but it's air and armoured forces
are larger and technologically more
advanced than any NATO power outside the
United States of course it's because
it's an offshoot of the United States
Israeli and US military industry are
very highly integrated so much so that
one of Israel's major arms producers
actually shifted its executive offices
to the United States American high-tech
industry is very enthusiastic about
Israel you can tell that just by looking
at investment flows they've been
shooting up including the major
corporations if you look Packard
Microsoft Intel Warren Buffett and so on
so they apparently think it's fine
American educated elites think it's fine
ever since 1967 they were very impressed
by Israel's military capacity and have
maintained that you know that delight
and being supportive of major powerful
military force of course always with a
humanistic cover but that's normal
so the fact of the matter is that across
the spectrum of major actors well they
seem be pretty happy about it is it wise
you could debate it I mean I don't think
it's wise as I said I think I don't
think it's good for Israel I think they
made a terrible mistake in 1971 by
refusing peace security and insisting on
expansion in effect they were later
compelled by force to back away from
that expansion that's Camp David
continue with other expansion but you
that's my judgment I don't determine
policy but yes it's a fair question
good could be asked thank you first of
all I just would like to offer my
condolences I would like you to
elaborate a little on on you talked
about the plan this was planned planned
in a military sense and planned in a
propaganda sense and I would like to ask
you to elaborate on aspects of the way
in which the propaganda side has been
given expression in a couple of areas
first of all I noticed that CNN and
Reuters among other major corporate
media used the term incursion repeatedly
secondly another reporter from the New
York Times you mentioned Ethan Bronner
Steven Erlanger who's reporting from
Jerusalem had a story reporting on what
Israeli military sources had reported
had discussed with him apparently
regarding people with weapons in Gaza in
civilian clothes popping out of holes
and and and and went into other details
and thirdly there was interesting timing
to me of a major front page feature
story based presumably on timed leaks
regarding Iran and Iranian the the fact
that the Bush administration had
supposedly said to Israel that they
would not be authorized to fly over Iraq
to bomb alleged nuclear facilities but
that instead the Bush administration
were intensifying covert operations
against those alleged programs in Iran
and finally the interesting fact that
Olmert supposedly spoke out against the
occupation only weeks before launching
this major invasion
okay I'm not sure I got everything but
the meticulous planning of the invasion
is discussed extensively in the Israeli
press and to some extent here too so and
it describes both aspects the military
planning and the propaganda effort and
it's how effective it's been you know
one could argue it's there's one area
which is very effective in American
elite opinion and in the press but
probably not among the population the
only poll I've seen shows the population
very divided roughly 50/50 on the
invasion despite the massive propaganda
which is just replicated on us without
deviation in the media including the
examples you mentioned as for reliance
on Israeli military sources well of
course that's part of the part of the
propaganda system kind of like the US
and Iraq where reporters could do in if
they were embedded and meaning
propaganda agents and the freelance
reporters who tried to report some of
them were just dropped out of the
corporate media others could do it as
freelancers the in the case of Gaza
Israel has simply barred all reporters
foreign or or it's even Israeli because
they don't know I make sure that there's
no direct reporting I mean what you get
is you know cell phone calls or
something like that and reports from
people like not Gilbert this Norwegian
doctor and UN officials and so on but
you know that's all part of let the go
there how's about campaign that Israel
has to word Hebrew there are two words
for propaganda one of them is standard
word for propaganda the other hospira is
for their own propaganda and the word
means explanation the tacit assumption
is that everything we do is so obviously
right that all we have to do is explain
it to people so it and then they'll
understand why we're
actually exactly right and that hospira
campaign it does work among the American
intellectuals and Western European
intellectuals generally as for the
populations it's an open question I
should say even on the rejection isn't
although it's almost a hundred percent
supported by the educated sectors and
the media and so on of course it's not
cold that the facts are always
suppressed it's not among the population
roughly two-thirds of the population is
in favor of the Arab League plan
normalization of relations within the
international borders basically the
international consensus but as usual
public opinion has almost no effect on
policy it's an interesting fact about
American democracy it's in fact a matter
of principle there's kind of principal
reasons which go back to James Madison
or why that has to be the case and it
clearly is the case and the public knows
it so about 95 percent of the public
objects that public opinion is not taken
into account by the government but you
know there are two legged beasts - they
don't really understand important things
the but that's part of the control about
the civilians popping out of holes yeah
I didn't pull that straight out of Nazi
propaganda
British propaganda during the
Revolutionary War in fact any Imperial
War I mean any invading Imperial power
would be delighted if resistance if
people who are resisting put on uniforms
and stood out in an open field so they
could be destroyed by overwhelming
military force and they get very upset
when you know Minutemen and others don't
accept these rules they should be
wearing red coats like the Hessian
soldiers the British mercenaries so sure
that's standard I mean what's
interesting is that I think you said air
languor could even repeat such nonsense
without collapsing and ridicule about
Iran
we don't know the details but the
reports are interesting they do indicate
two things one that the u.s. barred
Israel from overflying Iraq which would
make it very difficult for them to
attack Iran and the other aspect is that
they apparently admitted that they're
carrying out terrorist actions inside
Iran that's not the first time there's
been evidence so that for some time
including major terrorist acts from from
Pakistan and Afghanistan but again
that's normal for an outlaw State the
failure to the the lack of support for
an Israeli attack is interesting I mean
I think it's pretty clear that Israel
does not want that the United States
does not want Israel to attack Iran that
could lead to a major conflagration with
huge effects for American troops for oil
supplies everything else it wasn't much
discussed but there was a resolution
congressional resolution debated in the
house HR 362 I think it was which called
for the u.s. to and in effect impose a
blockade on Iran bar shipping in the
Gulf and so on
it had an enormous support a pact the
Israeli Lobby was passionately in
support of leveling out all the strings
it initially had some very overwhelming
congressional support but it was voted
down it was voted down in part thanks to
lobbying by the anti-war movement which
is hardly a massive Lobby in the United
States but it was voted down mainly
because the US government didn't want it
and the lobby consistently slinks away
silently when it comes into conflict
with us power for good reasons they know
they haven't got a chance and they don't
want to harm themselves and this past
very calmly as well any other such cases
as for all merit
he did say in basically in his
resignation speech he had to resign
because of charges of corruptions so he
resigned and he's still in office
basically resigned and he didn't make a
speech it didn't make a speech he had an
interview in the press at that time and
which he withdrew all of his earlier
positions all of them and said that
Israel must accept the international
consensus as to withdraw from the
occupied territories and maybe some shit
modification of borders agreed upon
mutual modification agreed upon by both
sides in fact he went back to the
essentially the table proposals which as
I say were almost realized except that
Israel blocked them at the end that was
his resignation speech and it's
interesting it shows that he understood
and as you say it was followed very
shortly by rejection of possibilities of
political settlement crucial rejection
several times and the US Israeli
invasion of Gaza which is now underway
you can make of all of that what you
want
professor Chomsky you've almost entirely
glossed over the numerous war crimes and
violations of international law which
have committed by Hamas the ruling party
in Gaza these include the targeting of
civilian populations by sending
thousands of rockets into southern
Israel and Hamas is well documented use
of human shields by doing things like
hiding their armaments in preschools
ambulances and hospitals I was wondering
if you had a response to these crimes
yeah well actually I did talk about the
first as I pointed out Israel's Hamas is
targeting of Israeli civilian targets
yeah that's there's a criminal act as
well as politically stupid but and
therefore I think it would make good
sense for us to stop our enormous
military diplomatic
ideological support for Hamas okay
that's what we can do about it
of course these crimes like Hershel
green sponge or like those of the
partisans during the Second World War it
didn't come out of nowhere these are a
reaction to ongoing Israeli crimes
naari in Gaza but extensively in the
West Bank and those who have another
proposal as to what come assorted is
what resistance ought to take do have a
moral ground to moral grounds to
criticize those actions okay just as
those in Germany who were calling for an
end to Nazi aggression you know they
couldn't because they did killed but
we're free to do it here would have had
a justification in condemning the
terrorism of the partisans they didn't
have a justification for supporting the
Gestapo slogan terror against terror you
commit there will commit worse terror
the only people in Germany who had a
right to criticize the terror that they
were attacking were those who were
trying to stop the far greater
atrocities of the Nazis same with her
style not same with many other cases the
same with the American Revolution I mean
the American you know the Patriots as we
call them were KarenT we're terrorist
forces carrying I mean in those days
terrorism wasn't as extreme as it is
today nor was military conflict but yeah
it was serious I mean that's why the
number of people who fled the colonies
after independence was higher or
approximately the same as the proportion
of the population that fled Vietnam
after after the u.s. withdrew they fled
the terror of the of the victors I mean
there were people fleeing from Boston
Harbor writing pathetic letters about
how they were dying in the snow and Nova
Scotia because they just had to get away
from these terrorists who won the war
this is not a major theme of American
history but you can find the facts if
you like
and they had good reason to because yes
Nathanael greens forces for example were
straight terrorist forces and of course
the British objected to this how dare
they hide you know in civilian places to
shoot at our soldiers as for the
well-documented facts that you mentioned
the documentation is zero the sole sole
source for those claims is Israeli armed
Israeli propaganda maybe it's true maybe
it isn't there it's hard to imagine
where you get hide in Gaza or live in
Gaza except near a civilian target
Israel of course does it all the time so
if you ask where the Israeli military
command is that's right in the middle of
the cities where they going to put it so
sure this is even though the
documentation happens to be zero not
well documented and nevertheless it's
almost certainly true and it offers no
justification whatsoever for destroying
the university's destroying the school's
mental health clinics attacking
hospitals shooting at ambulances all the
other crimes that you can read about if
you want to bother looking and the
crimes are really serious so which I
brought with me a report which I have
not seen reported in the American press
from the find it from the Gaza water
utility this is January 10th the press
release they described won't bother
reading it but they essentially
described how hundreds of thousands of
people in Gaza or without water because
of Israeli attacks on water systems and
also attacks on sewage systems and in
fact power plants which make everything
run so that one discharging pond is
leading to a major catastrophe that
threatens the lives of thousands of
people just by drowning and sewage
flooding well okay
sure some Israeli propagandists can tell
you yeah there was a mortar hidden in
the sewage system maybe there was does
that have anything to do with these
atrocities yeah nothing you know for
very simple reasons the ones I mentioned
there is a right to resort to violence
in self-defense
if there are no alternatives and in this
case there are very clear alternatives
stop the criminal activities and accept
the peace treaty okay not very hard
stop your crimes that'll end the the
rocketing that you're concerned with
professor Chomsky while this may seem
obvious because you've touched on at a
time and time again why is it that the
US media appears to completely lap up
the propaganda while appearing to not do
any sort of objective journalism which
is what every single journalist student
has you know study to do what in the
world is going on well for one thing I
think I'm in the US media are just as
good as any others if I had one
newspaper in the world to read I
couldn't read any other I picked New
York Times doesn't you know I don't love
it as you know and the reporters
themselves not so much in the case of
Israel but in many cases are courageous
honest you know they report what's
before their eyes objective if you like
but very typically consistently within a
framework of interpretation that's
subordinated to state corporate
propaganda that's unconscious and it's
true of the intellectual community
generally I mean I one of those I write
about the media it was easier to study
the New York Times systematically then
say to study academic scholarship
systematically that's a huge effort
beyond my resources but it's basically
the same you know there aren't many
differences and it's the same in the
general
educated population we can see there is
an assumption that the u.s. cannot do
anything wrong
it can make mistakes but can't do
anything wrong
individuals may do things wrong like
there may be a bad apple here and there
but we can't do anything wrong as a
people so it takes a the invasion of
Iraq Barack Obama is praised even by the
left for what's called his principled
opposition to the Iraq war
what was his principled opposition
basically we can't get away with it he
says it was a strategic blunder okay you
go back to Providence when the Russians
were invading Afghanistan there are
plenty of people saying it's a strategic
blunder we don't call that principled
opposition to the war after Stalingrad
there were plenty of Nazi generals who
say look was a strategic blunder to open
a two-front war
are they principled opponents of the
Nazis I mean the very idea that this is
called principled opposition is a very
interesting insight into our own
intellectual and moral culture it's
totally unprincipled it's based on
nothing except cost to us and maybe
there's a couple of words about you know
I don't like civilian casualties but
it's very hard to find any principled
opposition in the culture in the
intellectual culture generally that's
also true of things that go way back I
said they say take the Vietnam War
imagine you know reams of material on
that but try to find a principled
criticism of it in the mainstream if you
look at the literature of say diplomatic
history today or anything that goes way
back you find two positions there the
Hawks who say with more force we could
have won and there the doves who say it
was a lost cause which was a mistake say
take take Arthur Schlesinger is a
leading American historian Kennedy
advisor and one of the most outspoken
did become his strong supporter of the
war under Kennedy to the extent that he
paid any attention to it at all
effective paid almost no attention to it
even though Kennedy did directly attack
South Vietnam and carried out many
atrocities but if you look in
Schlesinger's journals which just
appeared almost day to day record of
everything he did there's even a mention
of Vietnam until the Johnson years
there's a lot about swimming pools who
jumped in naked and that sort of thing
but nothing about the Vietnam but by you
know 1966-67 he was like others becoming
critical of the war and he wrote a book
which is considered one of the important
criticisms of the war it's called bitter
heritage it was very explicit you know
nothing hidden he described his
controversy with his friend Joseph Alsop
major journalist it was a strong
supporter of the war and Schlesinger
said something like this she said we all
pray that mr. Alsup is right and that
with more force you know the surge of
the day we will be able to win victory
in a land of wreck and ruin with
everything destroyed and so on and so
forth that's what we all pray but it
probably won't work and then he said if
mr. Alsup is right and we do win victory
in this devastated land we will all be
praising the wisdom and statesmanship of
the American government and it wasn't
ironic he meant it you know and yes
that's the attitude of liberal does
that's why when US casualties decline in
Iraq you know people say well you know
maybe it really was a success
okay killed a million people drove
millions out of the country destroyed
the society left it as a total ruin okay
but not too many American casualties and
the big problem is they're not doing
what we say you know they're not ola
there is mass nonviolent resistance in
Iraq to actually a major triumph of
nonviolent resistance has compelled the
invaders to back down from there at
least in words you know if they live up
to it
from their major goals okay but who
describes things that way you know where
can you find a principled criticism and
this is not a critique of the press
because the press are reflecting the
educated culture they're reflecting the
mentality of Harvard MIT Yale so on
that's the culture from which they come
and I think the reporting is very
accurate in fact a large part of what
I've written is actually defensive the
press for its professionalism and
objectivity you may know of a book that
Edward Herrmann and I wrote called
manufacturing consent it's about the
media there's a lot of condemnation of
the book but nobody looks at it that's
this material not allowed to look at it
doesn't keep the party line but a large
part of it if anybody wants to look at
it is a detailed analysis of media
coverage after that of the Tet Offensive
Tet Offensive is crucially important
event and after the Tet Offensive
Freedom House you know great defender of
freedom published too thick volumes
denouncing the press for their lack of
patriotism because they didn't report
the Tet Offensive in a manner glorifying
the United States sufficiently you know
straight out of Stalinist Russia that's
Freedom House two volumes one of
commentary one of documents and they
claimed the volume commentary you know
condemned the press for being on the
side of the Vietcong and hating America
and you know all the usual stuff and
then there was the volume of kind of
documents that's supposed to back it up
well you know I carried out the heinous
act of actually reading the documents
the volume of documents completely
refuted everything that they said in the
volume of commentary line by line if you
want details look at the book we went
through it and we concluded that
contrary to the Freedom House Stalinist
style attack
the press was very courageous competent
accurate people described what they said
but entirely within the framework of us
doctrine
you know us propaganda so like
everything we're everything we're trying
to do is right and Noble but you know we
just had to destroy half the place cuz
what the choice was choice do we have
but it's described accurately now it's
interesting that the media hated that
defense of their objectivity and
professionalism that would much rather
be portrayed the way Freedom House
portrayed them and it's stolen a style
attack as traitors you know challenging
us already so on and so forth they like
that what they don't like is you're
doing your job very competently and
courageously but you're completely
subservient to propaganda and the party
line nobody likes that so that part of
the book can't be read but yeah I think
it's generally true and I think those
are the reasons I mean there are other
reasons too like the media after all are
big corporations you know selling the
product audiences to other corporations
that truly has an effect and so on I
forget which side you've said a lot
about sources that you've cited versus
propaganda from various governments and
I I imagine that a lot of the propaganda
is written to look very similar to what
you're citing as appropriate sources and
to act like facts and my question is how
do you personally differentiate between
facts and facts like how do you decide
what you want to trust you an MIT
student yes because he's taken science
courses yes how do you decide what to
believe it's the same in this case you
know you don't believe every paper you
see in the journals because some of them
don't seem to make sense and if they
don't you look back and see whether
their data are correct and are the
sources right
was the doctor who wrote it in the pay
of the drug companies and so on and so
forth
sure that's the same here he has used
the normal common sense that you use
when your act as a scientist I'm it's a
little different in the case of Public
Affairs than science I mean mother
nature is a hard taskmaster but she
doesn't purposely put up barriers in the
way of understanding okay as when you're
reading say the press or academic work
and so on but it's pretty on the other
hand it's a lot easier in the case of
public affairs because it's all on the
surface now there's no series to speak
of and try to find a theory in
international relations theory what's
called a theory is laughable there's a
you read just what's called Just War
Theory I could go through details if you
like but what it comes down to is I
believe you know that's way every
argument runs and so it's all on the
surface everything that I talked about
today is on the surface you can check it
it's just you know like bear data if you
don't think it's right look it up that's
why I continually said verify very
simple you'll find plenty of propaganda
like a couple of examples that I've read
but you can also find the facts and you
can make your your own mind it's way
easier than in the sciences in that
respect though harder and that you have
to overcome barriers but there's no
special tricks in fact you know them all
if he's taken science courses
professor Chomsky good afternoon in your
opinion what is the responsibility of
the Arab League who the Arabic there is
particularly the neighboring countries
like Lebanon Syria Jordan and even the
oil-producing countries like Saudi
Arabia and going back to Lebanon why do
you think Hezbollah hasn't took any
action firm action yet either
like tactical action or I mean you just
they just stuck to speeches thank you
well with regard to Hezbollah I mean I'm
not privy to their internal thinking but
I can guess that the reason they're not
reacting is they know if they do
Lebanon gets turned into a charnel-house
I remember Israel has repeat what I said
armed air armed an air force greater
larger and scale and technologically
more advanced than any NATO power
outside the US and if they unleash it
against Lebanon okay
as for the Arab League they've taken
mixed positions for example Prince
Turkey office I saw one of the leading
figures in Saudi Arabia and one of those
considered the most moderate you know
pro-american he gave a very powerful
speech at the Gulf forum a couple of
days ago and which he bitterly condemned
the u.s. Israeli invasion said we're all
Palestinians now we have to martyr
ourselves to defend the Palestinians we
should do it now the government's aren't
doing much but exactly what are they
supposed to do they've got to control
their own populations which is hard it's
one of the reasons the u.s. sends some
armaments tons of armaments and in fact
Israel has always been regarded as part
of the defense of the ruling clerics
against their populations but first of
all then they're not inclined to oppose
us power because they more or less
except agree with it for themselves they
have no use for the Palestinians of the
population
does and even if they wanted to do
something there's not much you can do
you know it's pretty hard to stand up
against the Godfather it is
international about the only theory I
know of an international relations
theory that's moral it's not trivial or
obviously false is that international
relations is very much like the Mafia
and the Godfather does not rook
disobedience and has plenty of ways of
reacting to it and you take your fate in
your hands if you do something like vote
in a election of the way the master
doesn't want a little own interfere in
some fashion so you know I don't like
their position at all but it's pretty
hard to blame and you mentioned one of
the one of the reasons for the strong US
support of Israel being the the military
base that they provide us in the Middle
East and it seems that the more support
we give to Israel the less secure the
area really is a weak the less popular
America seems to be in that region and I
don't know if there's a point at which
that'll actually are supportive Israel
actually undermine our security so my
real question is can you shed any more
light on other reasons that America is
so strongly allied with Israel other
places it says strongly allowing no
other reasons that u.s. is so strongly
allied with Israel besides it being just
the best place to park our tanks so oh I
see me yeah well yeah it's cause there's
plenty of anti-american feeling among
the population but you know nobody cares
about that as long as they're under
control and that goes long before wait
way back long before us support for
Israel I mean us support for Israel as I
mentioned it was always there but it
became really strong the Alliance was
really established in 1967 well ten
years before that in 1958 which happened
to be a pretty turbulent period their
president and Eisenhower inquired with
his staff this is secret and
public for a long time he asked why is
there such a campaign of hatred against
us in the Arab world among the people
not the government's the government's
mostly go along with but why is there
such a campaign of hatred against us
among the people
that's George Bush's why do they hate us
and there was a response there was an
analysis which has just been produced by
the National Security Council the
highest Planning Council which explained
the reasons it said there is a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States opposes democracy and
development and supports tyrannies
because the United States wants to get
control of air energy sources and it
said basically the perception is correct
and that's what we ought to be doing
okay because okay so the campaign of
hatred against us but as long as we've
got what we want what are we here you
know I mean back to the Mafia done I
mean maybe the people on the street hate
him you know long isn't it run his
affairs who cares about the two-legged
beasts and that remains true and that
Israel was not an issue at that time but
after after 9/11 one newspaper to its
credit the Wall Street Journal did a
study of opinions and among Muslims
not all Muslims just the ones they cared
about what they called moneyed Muslims
like managers of you know multinational
corporations and lawyers and people like
that just and this is after Bush's why
do they hate a speech and they did an
analysis of what the opinion was and I
found the same answers it's not
opposition to you know globalization or
capitalism but so-called capitalism or
you know us power or anything in fact
they're right in the middle of it that
said that they found overwhelmingly
pretty much with the NSC reported in
1958
they oppose the u.s. support for brutal
autocracies its opposition to democracy
and development because of its interest
to gain control of our resources now by
nineteen by 2001 they added other
reasons one of them was US involvement
in a crushing of the Palestinians and
the second another topic we're not
allowed to talk about here was the
sanctions against Iraq which were
genocide 'el you know I mean Clinton
probably killed more Iraqis than Saddam
Hussein and they protested against that
well it's kind of like off the agenda
here but the reasons yeah well I
mentioned some of the reasons so I'll
just go over it again one is it's a
major military base to is what I quoted
from US intelligence back in 58 it's a
logical corollary of us opposition to
Arab nationalism to support Israel as
the only reliable base in the region
third is it's a very closely integrated
with the u.s. high-tech that's a big
part of the US economy we got to know
that at MIT when Microsoft and HP and
those guys are in love with Israel that
has an effect on policy and of course
they are in love with it as you can just
tell the investment patterns for good
reasons you know it's a nice
relationship and same another respect
it's a there's an ideological connection
especially among intellectuals since
1967 since Israel's victory there are
other reasons that go sort of deep in
the culture
what Israel's doing has been doing
resonates pretty well with our own
history I mean the you know forcible and
violent displacement of the two-legged
beasts and settlement by a superior race
that's American history a very explicit
American history back to the 17th
century
very explicit and the same is true of
the providential ISM look back over
American history and American culture a
very strong theme all right to the
present and you know including people
who call themselves secular is that
everything that's happening is
fulfilling God's will God has a has a
plan for the universe and we're filling
it we're carrying out a mission by
wiping out the indigenous population by
stealing their lands by the conquering
half of Mexico
you know evading Vietnam whatever it may
be we're fulfilling the divine mission
that's the providential ISM very strong
theme in u.s. culture all the way back
and it's very similar in Israel if you
read them it takes to say the book that
I mentioned the book on the settlement
it's a very valuable book one of its
main a lot of it is concerned with the
thinking of the major groups of the
settlers Bouchet moaning who are not
marginal in Israel in fact they're
highly honored as capturing the real
essence of Israel and Zionism and what
it is and it's basically providential is
by settling every inch of the land we
are carrying out God's will we're
bringing the Messiah
if you think Kumada Nejad is extreme you
ought to read american history and the
ideology the settler that's I don't know
how to measure it but I suspect that
this resemblance between our own history
what we call our own history and
Israel's settlement no replacement of
the two-legged beasts by a superior race
is probably significant and in the
United States it's not it's not the
right wing they read this and Walt
Whitman for example then Amerson you
know people like that so there are
plenty of reasons and they may not be
good reasons but certainly not
insignificant
and when Israel goes against US policy
the u.s. stops them of course the case I
mentioned about attacking Iran is one
that there are many others
dr. Chomsky I'm Jim Schneider I sell the
herald in the globe in front of a
doughnut shop in Bunker Hill Mall in
Charlestown I was wondering if you had a
chance to notice the October 6th article
in the oil and gas Journal which
describes the delineation of some super
giant oil fields off the coast of Israel
and there also and I also say that it's
an arc that goes from Syria follows the
coast of Israel and then goes over to
Egypt and what's kind of embarrassing is
to look at this full colored chart on
the first page and there's a nice the
positive higher-quality condensates
under Gaza but there's no reference in
the article that the Palestinian
Authority is going to have any access to
whatever monies are derived from what
offshore territorial rights they would
have I guess evidently they don't have
any because the you could if you can
have a the Israeli Navy off the coast
well you probably can't have your own
oil field business but they found 15
billion barrels of oil and a hundred
trillion cubic feet of gas so far but
nobody seems to mention it you know it's
about well it's about rockets and it's
about who killed whose kids first it's
not about dirty old oil especially if
it's a hell of a lot of it yeah I'm kind
of skeptical I didn't read that article
but there has been reporting and
reporting but there are plenty of
studies about that and it's been known
for a long time that there are a gas and
oil mostly gas I think yeah I think as
you said mostly gas resources off the
coast of Gaza not much off of Israel or
they would have exploited it but I
frankly doubt that there has much to do
with what's going on I mean it suppose
that the United States stopped its
rejection ISM and permitted weak
defenseless unarmed
Austan Ian state to survive in accord
with the national consensus they'd have
no trouble getting that oil you know
thank you sir they don't have to let
israel conquer it to do the fact they'd
probably get it more easily from a
Palestinian state than from Israel which
is strong enough to have its own
interest suicide doubt very much that
that's a factor in what's going on
professor Chomsky given the fact that
there are dozens of schools in the
Boston area and over at least over a
hundred thousand students that could
pretty easily organize themselves would
you support an area divestment campaign
divesting University and college funds
in those businesses that are doing
business with Israel on the model of the
South African anti-apartheid partite
divestment campaign and I'm not hearing
very well I'm afraid would you support a
divestment campaign publicly on the
model at the South African yeah well
that Naomi Klein is cadet analogy is
brought up a lot but I'd urge you to pay
some serious attention to the South
African boy cut it was important and it
had an effect but look at when it had an
effect on the South African there was an
academic boycott of South Africa back in
the 60s but on very narrow grounds
because the universities were excluding
blacks okay so you know it didn't want
to support racist universities but that
doesn't work in this case the the real
boycott that you know began to be a mass
movement with effect was mostly in the
1980s that was after decades of serious
education and organizing it was at a
time when American business was opposed
publicly opposed to apartheid when
congressional resolutions were
condemning apartheid when mayor's were
getting arrested
you know protesting this and that by the
time you had really mass public
opposition to apartheid yes then you
could have a boycott movement but that
preliminary work has not been done and
call for you know a call for a boycott
is a tactical move it's not a principled
move it's a tactic you know I have to
ask what its consequences are and I
think if you think through the
consequences before you've done the work
the educational organizing work
that's probably backfire I don't we just
you know screams about anti-semitism or
support for Israeli atrocities and so on
so take a look at the history it's worth
looking at incidentally by the 80s it
did get to the point where Congress
passed legislation and barring a US
trade with South Africa that's very
different from where we are now where
Congress almost unanimously supports
every Israeli atrocity that comes along
with Dennis Kucinich and two other
people voting against it also it's worth
remembering that the Reagan
administration violated the
Congressional legislation and in fact
trade with South Africa increased after
the legislation and at the peak of of
the administration that's Reagan Colin
Powell and the rest as late as 1988 just
right before the collapse of apartheid
the US the Pentagon Palace Pentagon
declared that the African National
Congress was one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world
that's Nelson Mandela and the African
National Congress in Colin Powell's
Pentagon 1988 in fact Mandela was on the
terrorist list until a couple of months
ago they finally took him off
because the African National Congress
was a terrorist organization that did
carry out terror undoubtedly and I'm you
know know the South African literature
but I'm sure they condemned it for you
know hiding in public places and not
standing out in a field with uniforms so
they could be shot down and so on and so
yes I think it's something to think
about but also to think about see in
fact if we could ever get to the point
where you had enough active activism and
organization to even think about a
boycott you could do something much
simpler get the u.s. to join the
international consensus as the majority
the population already wants them to do
then you don't talk about boycotts so I
don't think it's a it just doesn't seem
to me like a sensible tactic that's
quite apart from any question of
principle professor Chomsky I just had a
two-part question
what the first part of the question is
what exactly is the plan the outcome is
Israel's plan to come after the recent
bombings and recent action against the
Gaza Strip and post-invasion do they are
they really after just disarming Hamas
is military wing or do they have a
complete coup planned and also my second
question is where could people find
reliable death tolls and information
about destruction in Gaza and in Israel
because I see you know a variety of
numbers being thrown around about how
many thousands of rockets are launched
into Israel but I never see much of a
death toll associated with the thousands
of rockets I'm not sure really what
their capacity is and you know some
people say that they're resembling of
bottle rockets I don't know but I'd like
to know more about them and I'd like to
see if there is legitimately collateral
damage in being you know conducted in
Palestine or if it is in fact overkill
well you know I don't think there's any
question that its massive overkill let
me just look at the official casualty
figures in the current invasion the
latest I saw it's coming close to a
thousand Palestinians which is almost
undoubtedly an under estimate because
they don't count people who died because
you know they starve or can't get water
or can't go to a hospital and so on and
I think I don't know I think that's like
a maybe half a dozen Israeli soldiers or
something like that some of them killed
by friendly fire I mean you can't talk
about overkill you know we're out of
that League for reliable information
about the questions you're asking the
best place I know to look is in the
major Israeli human rights group
B'Tselem which has regular publications
in english pamphlets you can find them
on the web be apostrophe TSE lem and
they give very judicious careful
analyses of everything that's going on
as to the numbers killed by the rockets
in the last year's I mean you know I
forgot the exact number maybe a dozen or
something like that and it's just you
know but but you can find them and as
for numbers of rockets well you can find
them too like I quoted the figure 77
hundred shells attacking northern Gaza
before the onslaught in July in June 19
2013
2006 that comes from Human Rights Watch
and you know they do analysis one
information on white phosphorus yeah
it's coming from Human Rights Watch
which is which tends to be pretty
supportive of Israel incidentally no
although they do good work but it's
elements best source I know as to
Israel's plans well maybe you know I
told you what I think about the reasons
for the invasion and I presume if that's
correct that the plans are to make those
reasons work the plan is to get quiet
peace and quiet quiet of the graveyard
if it has to be which will enable Israel
to carry out its criminal acts on the
west bank with us support and without
any or Ference I presume that's the plan
Thanks
