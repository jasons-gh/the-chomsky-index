as the announcement indicates this is a
personal perspective there's no
consensus on the topics that I'm going
to talk about and I presume my own view
is a minority view in the whole range of
related fields that intersect more or
less in this area there is a consensus
on one matter from the second half of
the 20th century there's been a huge
explosion of inquiry into language by
any means we take say counting the
number of people at this Congress and
the range of topics they're talking
about and the depth of the commentary a
far more penetrating work has been
underway on the vastly greater a variety
of typos logically varied languages that
many new topics that have been opened
the kinds of questions that students are
working on today that could not be
formulated or even imagined half a
century ago or for that matter
considerably more recently and the new
problems and puzzles are coming into
view more rapidly than older ones are
being at least partially resolved those
are all exciting signs of a lively array
of interlinked disciplines I have my own
reservations which I'll come back to I
think it's fair to change to trace this
quite sharp and unmistakable change in
large part to new options that became
available by mid 20th century for
considering more seriously the most
fundamental question we can ask about
language
namely what is it by that point advances
in the formal sciences enabled a clear
formulation of what we should recognize
to be the most basic property of
language i'll just refer to it as the
basic property that each language
provides an unbounded array of
hierarchically structured expressions
which receive interpretations that in
roughly thought and roughly sound to
interfaces that allows a substantive
formulation of common-sense dictum
Aristotle's dictum that language is
sound with meaning although work of
recent years has shown and some of the
talks here discuss it that sound is too
narrow and there's good reason to which
I'll return to think that the common
sense classic formulation is misleading
in significant ways at the very least
each language incorporates a
computational procedure satisfying the
basic property therefore every theory of
a particular language is by definition
what's called a generative grammar and
each language is at least of what has
come to be called an eye language I here
stands for individual internal and
intentional intentional that's with an
ass for the technically minded among you
we're interested in discovering the
actual computational procedure not some
set of objects that it enumerates what
in technical terms what it strongly
generates there's there are other
notions of week generation and what some
people not me call ye language
they are maybe nothing those are
derivative notions at best if they're
even definable for natural language
probably not in my opinion but these are
topics discussed extensively 5060 years
ago and they seem to have been often
forgotten among the various approaches
to language and questions of language
each should recognize at least that
language is a property of an individual
person internal mostly to the mind brain
it's what's now called the bio
linguistic framework this framework
should be uncontroversial and recognized
to be a prerequisite to other inquiries
numerous other questions that can be
raised questions of the kind that are
discussed in the talks here questions
about acquisition use of language
language in society internal mechanisms
that implement the system both the
system of knowledge itself and the
system and the various uses of it
different but related questions
evidently inquiry into those further
questions must rely on guidelines that
are provided by an answer to the
question of what language is maybe tacit
answer but some answer that shouldn't be
controversial either so for example no
biologist would propose an account of
the development or evolution of the eye
without telling us something about what
an eye is and the same holds for
inquiries into language in earlier years
the basic property resisted clear
formulation I'll just illustrate with
some of the classics so for example for
this issuer the language and the
relevant sense
is a storehouse of quoting a storehouse
of word images in the brains of a
collectivity of individuals founded on
what he called a sort of contract for
Leonard bloomfield the language is an
array of habits to respond the
situations with conventional speech
sounds and to respond to these sounds
with actions he actually gave a
different conception and his postulates
for the science of language he defined
language as the totality of utterances
made in a speech community that's
something like William Dwight Whitney's
earlier conception of language as the
sum of words and phrases by which any
man expresses his thought so audible
thinking and his freight is all of
that's actually a slightly different
conception and waste which I'll return
the other grand old man of American
linguistics Edward Sapir defines
language as a purely human and non
distinctive method of communicating
ideas emotions and desires by means of a
system of voluntarily produced symbols
with conceptions like these it's natural
to follow what Martin Jose Portland
linguist of sixty years ago what he
called the Boas Ian tradition named
after Franz Boas which holds that
languages can differ arbitrarily and
that each new language must be studied
without any preconceptions so according
to that view the linguistic theory just
consists of analytic procedures to
reduce a collection of material corpus
of material to some organized form
basically techniques of segmentation and
classification the shift of perspective
to generative grammar within the bio
linguistic framework opened the way too
much more
far-reaching inquiry into language
itself and language related topics and
it also greatly enriched the variety of
evidence that bears on the study of each
individual language so it can include
essentially anything acquisition use
neuroscience dissociations much else and
it can also include what has been
learned from the study of other
languages that's on the quite well
confirmed assumption that the capacity
for language relies on shared biological
properties that's the topic of what in
the last 50 years has been called
universal grammar ug said dapping a
traditional term to a different
framework different concept in earlier
years it was understandable that the
question what is language received only
such indefinite answers as the ones I've
mentioned all of them notice ignoring
the basic property it's however I think
surprising to find that similar answers
remain current in contemporary cognitive
science one typical example current
study on evolution of language in the
journal frontiers of psychology a
character characterizes language only as
the full suite of abilities to map sound
to meaning that's basically a
reiteration of Aristotle's dictum it's
much too empty to ground the further
inquiry again no biologist would study
evolution of the visual system
paraphrasing assuming no more about the
phenotype that it provides the full
suite of abilities to map stimulative
persitz couldn't get anywhere with that
and you couldn't publish a paper on it
either the editors and the audience
might take that to heart
there are also broader reasons to be
concerned with the question what is
language as a rather clear indication of
these given in a recent book by one of
the leading scientists who studies human
evolution in tattersol as a recent
review of the currently available
scientific evidence he observes quote
him now it was once believed that the
evolutionary record would yield early
harbingers of our late ourselves the
reality however is otherwise for it's
becoming increasingly clear that the
acquisition of the uniquely modern human
sensibility was instead an abrupt and
recent event which he dates and a very
narrow window of roughly fifty to a
hundred thousand years ago from an
evolutionary point of view that's a
flick of an eye and they need a quote
the expression of this new sensibility
was almost certainly crucially abetted
by the invention of what is perhaps the
single most remarkable thing about our
modern cells language and therefore an
answer to the question what is language
matters very greatly to anyone concerned
with understanding our modern selves
what kind of creature we are the
founders of modern biology of course
lacked the evidence of current science
but they adopted a general view that's
not too different so Darwin for example
wrote that man differs from animals
solely in his almost infinitely larger
power of associating the most
diversified sound and ideas modern terms
that means in having a generative
grammar phrase almost infinite as a
traditional phrase that we have to
interpret today is actually infinite as
domine makes no sense to contemplate
Hugh
non extendable hit list that's meanings
much earlier at the origins of modern
science that Galileo was entranced by
what he called that marvelous invention
he's referring to the alphabet that
provides the means to construct from 25
or 30 sounds that infinity of
expressions that enable us to reveal
everything that we think and all the
movements of our soul it's horrible
thought and whitney's phrase although
Galileo went far beyond Whitney and that
he recognized the unbounded character of
the language it's kind of an obvious
point but very hard to find anyone who
noticed it in the 2500 years of serious
investigation of language the same
recognition and a much deeper concern
for kind of a creative character of the
normal use of language shortly after
little after Galileo that was to become
a core element of Cartesian science
which nowadays called philosophy same
thing at science in those days there's
no reason today to doubt the fundamental
insight of Descartes that use of
language normal use of language is
indeed a creative activity it is
typically innovative without bounds so
in principle infinite it's appropriate
the circumstances but not caused by
circumstances it's a crucial distinction
and it can engender thoughts and others
that they recognize they could have
expressed themselves that's normal use
and the observation appears to be
correct as far as we know there's there
is a an aphorism of Villa hum von
Humboldt that's commonly quoted pointing
out that language involves infinite use
of finite
means but it's worth bearing in mind
that he's talking about use its infinite
use of finite means more fully he
described the unending and truly
boundless domain of language as the
essence of all that can be thought that
places him in the tradition of Galileo
and others who associated language
closely with thought he actually went
beyond to assert the identity of
language and thought much stronger claim
while recognizing that still quoting
language must make infinite employment
of finite means in confronting its
boundless domain there has been great
progress in understanding the finite
means that make possible infinite use
but the infinite use itself remains
pretty much a mystery despite despite
significant progress in some particular
areas like understanding some of the
conventions that God appropriate use but
the basic problem remains as mysterious
as it was for for Descartes and the
Cartesian a century ago another great
linguist Otto yes person raised the
question of how the elements of language
come into existence in the mind of a
speaker on the basis of finite
experience another mystery yielding he
said a notion of structure that's
definite enough to guide him in framing
sentences of his own crucially free
expressions typically new to speaker in
here over an unbounded range hence
infinite range and then the task of the
linguist what she said is to discover
these mechanisms and how they arise in
the mind and to gain quoting him a
deeper insight into the innermost nature
of human language and of human thought
those ideas sound much less strange
today than they did during the
structuralist the behavioral science
irri that came to dominate much of the
field marginalizing a yes persons
insights so for example when I was a
student in the late 1940s nobody ever
heard of them I found his work when
wandering around the Harvard library
well reformulating yes persons program
the basic task is to investigate the
true nature of the interfaces and the
generative procedures that relate them
to determine how they arise in the mind
and how they are used with the primary
focus of concern and naturally being
free expressions the typically
innovative creative behavior as soon as
the earliest attempts were made roughly
60 years ago to deal with these
questions to construct the explicit
generative grammars many puzzling
phenomena were discovered which hadn't
been noticed although they're kind of
obvious when you think about them that
hadn't been noticed as long as the basic
property that was not clearly formulated
and addressed and syntax was just
considered use of words often use of
words following the sequence of thoughts
d drove famously argued that French
would be the language of science and
German and English would be the language
of language of poetry because in French
the words follow exactly the order of
thoughts whereas in the other languages
it's kind of mixed up a bit so it's
better for fancy now you can determine
how well that follow this would all of
this is somewhat reminiscent of the
earliest stages of modern science early
17th century so for millennia scientists
had been satisfied with very simple
explanations for quite familiar
phenomenon so rock
full steam rises because they're seeking
their natural place objects interact
because of what we are called sympathies
and antipathy which bring them together
push on the park we perceive a triangle
because the shape of the triangle
literally flits through the air and
imprints itself on our on our brain and
so on lots of simple explanations that
when galileo and others allowed
themselves to be puzzled about these
facts modern science began and it was
quickly discovered that our beliefs are
mostly senseless and our intuitions are
all wrong and it's worth remembering
that the willingness to be puzzled is a
very valuable trait to cultivate it's
from early education to the most
advanced inquiry one puzzle about
language that came to light 60 years ago
and remains alive and i think is highly
significant in its import has to do a
very simple but curious fact that we
ought to find puzzling so it takes a the
sentence instinctively eagles that fly
swim the adverb instinctively is
associated with a verb but its
associated with swim not fly similarly
if you ask the question can evils that
fly swim that's about ability to swim
not ability to fly there is a thought
that the sentence fails to express and
it's quite difficult to formulate
without circumlocution as you can
determine by trying that impedes
communication one of many such cases
what's puzzling is that the association
of the clause initial element
instinctively or can to the verb is
remote
and based on structural properties not
proximate and based on linear properties
it's a far simpler computational
operation but ever used the language
makes use of a property of minimal
structural distance never uses the much
simpler property of minimal linear
distance and the puzzle is why this
should be so and not just for English
but for every language not just for
these constructions but for every
relevant construction he and children
acquire it they never make mistakes
about it acquired reflexively even if
they have no data or a very limited data
there is a very simple and plausible
explanation for the fact that a child
reflexively knows the right answer in
these cases even though evidence is slim
or in fact none existent often the
explanation is that linear order is
simply not available to the language
learner it's one of those great
principles that yes person was talking
about it's not available to the learner
for the child so never picks it the
child is is guided by a principle of
universal grammar that restricts search
to minimal structural distance the more
complex motion I guess the only
explanation I know there's no other
explanation that's ever been proposed
many have been suggested but that
obviously don't work this principle of
minimal distance is quite extensively
employed in a design of language and
struck nature of language it's
presumably one case of a much more
general principle that enters into
that enters also into design and
acquisition of language in other forms
that not restricted the language may
actually be a law of nature call it
minimal computation and the evidence
shows overwhelmingly in fact without
exception that invariably languages use
the property of minimal structural
rather than linear distance every
relevant case even though again the one
that's not used is computationally far
simpler there's actually some supporting
evidence in this case from neuroscience
as a research group in Milan aundrea
moreover many of you know is the
linguist in the group they studied the
brain activity of subjects were
presented with two types of stimuli
these are invented systems embedded
systems conforming to ug and others not
conforming to ug so for in the latter
case for example a invented language
that puts the negative particle after
the third word of a sentence in order to
negate it that's a rule which is far
simpler than the one that's
computationally than the ones used in
every language it's known what they
found is that in the cases of conformity
to ug the language areas normal language
areas of the brain are activated not
other part but when linear order is used
like in that role for negation I
suggested they suggest that I repeated
when the linear orders use this kind of
diffuse activation in the brain
suggesting that the people are treating
it as a kind of a puzzle that not as
language and there's other work by neil
smith and the auntie maria simply with a
cognitively impaired but linguistically
fluent subject they've worked with and
reach pretty much the same conclusion
actually there is a small industry
computational cognitive science that's
attempted to show that these properties
of language can be acquired by
statistical analysis of massive data
after that's about the only topic that's
been investigated beyond
superficialities every attempt that's
clear enough to be investigated has been
shown to fail or immediately but it
really doesn't matter because the
efforts are beside the point in the
first place I suppose they worked which
is virtually impossible that would still
leave untouched the only serious
question why does language invariably
use the complex computational property
of minimal structural distance while
never employing or even entertaining the
far simpler option of minimal linear
distance that industry is a good
illustration of the unwillingness to be
puzzled that I mentioned earlier and
again the willingness to be puzzled is
the first step in serious scientific
inquiry as has been recognized in the
hard sciences since Galileo a broader
thesis is that linear order is never
available for computation in the core
parts of language that involve syntax
and semantics of course there is linear
order but the thesis would be that it's
a peripheral part of language kind of
tacked on it's a reflex of properties of
the sensory motor system sensory motor
system doesn't allow us to speak in
parallel or to produce structures we
have to to get it through the sensory
motor system we have to put things in a
linear order so the order could just be
a reflex of the fact that whatever is
going on
mine has to pass through this filter to
get externalized but has nothing special
to do with language and the sensorimotor
system itself is not specially adapted
for language except maybe in peripheral
aspects the parts that are essential for
external ization and also perception
appear to have been in place hundreds of
thousands part millions of years before
languaging murders they're just kind of
there well the matter is not settled
this is one of the topics that is open
but I think there's quite substantial
evidence to show that the broader thesis
may in fact be correct so if that's true
as I suspect it is then the basic
property has to be reformulated not the
way it's been in recent literature
including papers of my own rather the
basic property would be generation of an
unbounded array of hierarchically
obstructed expressions as mapping to the
CI the content conceptual intentional
interface basically the system of
thought well if that turns out to be
true as I think evidence is pointing to
then there's good reason to return to it
traditional conception of language as an
instrument of thought and to revise the
common sense dictum accordingly language
is not sound with meaning but meaning
with sound were generally some form of
externalization typically sound that
appears to be modality independent in
fact externalization is rarely even used
by far the most use of language never is
externalize it's called internal
dialogue or inner speech that's 99.9
percent of your use of language it's
virtually impossible to takes a
tremendous active will not to talk to
yourself when you're awake winters
walking down the street whatever maybe
it's just going on all the time now
there isn't much research on this topic
unfortunately there some goes back to
the Gonski there's been little research
it conforms to what introspection seemed
to suggest my introspection at least you
can try yours what reaches consciousness
I think is just small fragments and then
fully formed expressions can be
instantly produced instantly produced
internally but usually aren't and
produced far too quickly for articulate
errs to be involved or even instructions
to articulate errs and they're often not
produced even internally that's quite an
interesting topic which as I say has
been barely explored could be subjected
to inquiry I think the reason it's not
explored is that there's kind of a
prejudice against studying mental
crossett mental actions that don't reach
consciousness which is probably well
almost everything is but while the dog
was about you shouldn't study that it
should actually well putting aside this
issue and just looking at the what we
know about the way language is designed
and constructed like the examples I gave
that gives good reason to take seriously
the intuitions of Galileo many others
that language is essentially an
instrument of thought it would then
follow that externalization is in
ancillary process not just a reflex of
properties of sensory motor system which
have nothing special to do with language
and there is further investigation that
I think supports this conclusion now if
it's established a lot of things follow
one thing that follows is the particular
uses of language that depend on external
ization among them communication which
is one of the only one are even more
peripheral aspects of language that's
contrary to virtual dogma in the Fiat
various fields dogma that however has no
serious support it would also follow
that much of the extensive speculation
about language evolution language
origins is just on the wrong track to
begin with because if you look at it
most of it is about speculations about
evolution of communication which is
something looks like some peripheral
aspect of language well that's this
matter has not been studied but I
suspect that the modern doctrine think
dogma that holds that communication is
somehow the essential function of
language I suspect that that derives
from the influence of Association
estandar assumptions which retain quite
a strong grip even among those who
reject them along with the highly
oversimplified and quite untenable
interpretations of modern evolutionary
theory evolutionary biology that's an
interesting question I'll put it aside
here well let's return to the basic
property that now reformulated the
computational system of I language
yields an unbounded array of
hierarchically structured expressions
mapping to the system of thought that
conceptual intentional interface all of
course unconscious and inaccessible to
consciousness there are then ancillary
processes which may or may not
externalize these internal objects in
some sensory modality and there are
analogous observations about perception
naturally we seek the simplest property
of the simplest theory of the basic
property of the theory with the fewest
arbitrary stipulations each stipulation
of course a barrier to some eventual
account if attainable of the origin of
language
stress eventual I think we're very far
from it that's standard scientific
method so nothing to say about it but we
can ask how far this resort to
elementary scientific method will take
us well so we ask look into the nature
of computational operations well every
there is a simple computational
operation which is embedded in some
manner every company grow every relevant
computational procedure it's a an
operation that takes two objects Coulomb
x and y that have already been formed
and constructs a new object call it Z
let's call this operation merge so it's
called now we now resort to the
principle of minimal computation
overriding principle that dictates that
neither X nor why is modified in the
course of the operation merge it'll it
also follows that they're unordered
because that would be a further
complication and that's a conclusion
that's quite plausible for language on
other grounds the kind I indicated well
that means that merge X merge of XY
merging swai that just gives the set
containing X and Y that does not mean of
course that the brain contains sets as
some current misinterpretations claim
and dispute but what it means is that
whatever is going on in the brain about
between oh very little has properties
that can properly be car characterized
in these terms just as we don't expect
to find the tech related ayah gram for
benzene and a test tube understood in
the science is a lot of confusion about
it in linguistics well suppose x and y
are merged
and neither is part of the other so
let's say combining read that book to
form the syntactic object that
corresponds to read that book name for
that is external merge two things
separate from one another suppose that
one of them is a part of the other say
why is part of X so as in combining
which book and John read which book
taking which books contained in John
read which book you merge it you get
which book John read which book that
surfaces as which book did John read by
further operations I'll come back to
that's an example of a ubiquitous
property of language ubiquitous
phenomenon called displacement that
phrases are heard in one place but
they're interpreted both there and
somewhere else and the sentence in this
question case is understood as for which
book x John read the book x that's
interpreting which book John read which
book okay that goes straight to the
thought system comes out the right way
well in this case the result of merge of
X and Y is again the set containing X
and Y but now it has two copies of why
one of them is the original one
remaining in place the other is the copy
that's merged with the whole thing
that's called internal merge sometimes
called the copy theory of movement but
it's it's the minimal degree the optimal
Theory comes for free external and
internal merge are the only two possible
cases of binary merge and there's pretty
good evidence that these operations are
binary and it's important to bear in
mind that both of them come free it
would be a complication if you had
one and not the other whichever way it
went it would require a stipulation of
some kind the bar one of them because
they're free and that's an important
fact its importance has gradually sunk
in since it was noticed about 15 years
ago for many years it was assumed by me
as well that displacement this
ubiquitous phenomena is a kind of an
imperfection of language kind of a
strange fact that has to be explained
the way but some more complex devices
complex assumptions about universal
grammar but that turns out to be
incorrect displacement is what you
should expect on the simplest
assumptions something with no
stipulations just everything works
perfectly language forms kind of like
the way a snowflake does just simple as
possible way it would be an imperfection
if what displacement were lacking that's
significant and another important fact
is that internal emerged in its simplest
form satisfying the overarching
principle of minimal computation a
yields the structure that's appropriate
for semantic interpretation just
illustrated in the simple case of which
book did John Green this right forum for
semantic interpretation is which book
John read which book goes right to the
thought system gets interpreted the
right way however these are of course
the wrong structures for the
sensorimotor system universally in
language only the structurally more
prominent copy is pronounced as in the
case I mentioned the lower copy is
deleted there actually is a revealing
class of exceptions which in fact
support the general thesis but i'll put
that assad why deletion of copies well
that follows from another application of
the overarching principle of minimal
computation the namely compute
internally and articulate as little as
possible that's
is principle of minimal computation
there's a result the result is that the
articulated sentences have gaps and
celly the same is true for inner speech
so we talked yourself has gaps and
that's tricky because the hero has to
figure out where the missing element is
that it's well known in the study of
perception and parsing that that yields
quite difficult problems of
interpretation filler gap problems there
cause when hardest problems if you're
writing a person for a program and
similarly for perception now in this
very broad class of cases something
interesting has happened the design of
language the basic structure of language
is favoring minimal computation that's
disregarding the complication of the use
of language that's significant to notice
also that if some Theory comes along
there are many of them that replace
internal merge by some other mechanism
that theory has a double burden of proof
to bear the first part is to explain why
it has the stipulation barring internal
merge which otherwise comes free and
secondly it has to justify whatever new
devices are formulated to yield
displacement in fact displacement with
copies notice which is generally the
right forum for semantic interpretation
strain your imagination a little by
giving one more complex case not too
complex I hope but so take the sentence
which of his pictures did they persuade
the museum that every painter likes best
okay that's derived by internal murder
from the underlying structure which of
his pictures did they persuade the
museum that every painter likes which
pictures of his which of his pictures
best
by the lesion of copies from that now
that one is formed directly by internal
merge with displacement and two copies
so same as which book into John Reed
which book in this case which of his
pictures did they persuade the museum
that every painter likes which of his
pictures best the phrase which of his
pictures is understood to be the object
of likes where the gap is in
pronunciation it's quite analogous to
one of his pictures in they persuaded
the museum that every painter likes one
of his pictures best get the same
interpretation even if there's a guy and
that's just what the underlying
structure with two copies provides and
that has further consequences there's a
quantifier variable relationship between
every in his and that carries over so
which of his pictures suppose you say
which of his pictures did they persuade
the museum that every painter likes best
the answer can be his first one that's
different for every painter it's exactly
the same as the one of the
interpretations of they persuaded the
museum that every painter likes one of
his pictures best now in contrast no
such answer is possible for the
structurally similar expression in which
of his pictures persuaded the museum
that every painter likes flowers
structurally the same but you don't get
the point of our variable interpretation
in that case his pictures doesn't fall
within the scope of every painter well
evidently it's the unpronounceable
that's required for quantifier variable
binding the results follow directly from
the simplest form of merge
merge and copy deletion also required by
minimal computation very much as in the
simpler case that I mentioned and if you
go on there are many much more intricate
cases well in all of these cases just
like instinctively Eagles that fly swim
it's inconceivable that some form of
data processing yields these outcomes
there is no point even trying no
conceivable way that could be relevant
data simply are not available to the
language learner the results must
therefore it derive from what David Hume
called the original hand of nature our
terms that means genetic endowment
specifically ug universal grammar and in
ways like this we can derive quite far
reaching and quite firm conclusions
about the nature of ug solving some
strange puzzles well there are many
claims in the literature that there are
no general genuine linguistic universal
since no ug linguists above among you
are familiar with this however the
preference is proof it's not just
confusion the reference is presumably
not to ug to universal grammar but
rather to descriptive generalizations
Joseph greenberg's famous universals for
example but generalizations are quite
likely to have exceptions that's the
nature of generalizations and these are
very valuable as a stimulus to inquiry
exceptions to deletions of copies for
example which I mentioned and in fact
reinforce the main principle when you
look at them closely that's quite
standard in the sciences so take one
famous case discovery of perturbations
in the orbit of uranus did not lead to
the abandonment of Newton's principles
and Kepler's laws or to the broader
confute conclusion that there are no
physical laws kind of thing that happens
in linguistics and cognitive science
the sciences it didn't lead to that and
what it led to was inquiry postulation
later discovery of another planet
Neptune they turned out everything work
exceptions to largely valid
generalizations play a similar role
quite generally in the sciences and have
done so repeatedly in the study of
language another point to bear in mind
or what we conclude I think is that if
language is optimally designed it will
provide structures which are appropriate
for semantic interpretation but that
yield difficulties for perception hence
for communication there are many other
examples that lead to the same
conclusion so structural ambiguities
garden path sentences at one case of
particular interest is what's called
islands as illustrated so called ecp
constructions sentences constructed from
the underlying expression they asked if
the mechanics fix the cars you can ask
how many cars you ask how many mechanics
that gives respectively how many cars
did they ask if the mechanics fixed how
many mechanics did they ask if fix the
cars there are quite different in status
and how many mechanics did they ask you
fix the cars is a perfectly fine fall
but you can't say it that way you have
to say it with some circumlocution again
impeding communication there are plenty
of similar cases a lot of them are
understood but to the extent that
they're understood invariably I think
the examples the structures result from
free functioning of the simplest
possible rules yielding difficulties for
perception tense communication were
where there are if you look hard you can
find quite a few conflicts between
communicative efficiency and
computational efficient
like the kind I just Illustrated and in
every known case communicative
efficiency is sacrificed it's never
considered just go for computational
efficiency meaning again that language
looks as if it's designed the way a
snowflake is that's just the way the
principles of nature work and if it
impedes communication to bed as it often
does well that lends further support to
the revision of the common sense or
Institute in dictum and support for the
view of language as an instrument of
thought with communication and other
uses being ancillary properties kind of
tacked on nothing special to say about
language and I think that conclusion
fits very well with the very limited
evidence that we have about the
emergence of language apparently quite
suddenly in the evolutionary time scale
as tattersall discussed that one of the
misinterpretations of modern biology
that I referred to is the idea that
changes have to be gradual that was
thought at one time but by now massive
evidence that's not true which is why
tattersall proposes this without comment
because it would be normal evolution
evolution is not natural selection of
course and doesn't have to be graduate
there's a fair guess that infects the
only guess I know that some slight
rewiring of the brain you'll demurred
roughly and Tattersalls window say fifty
to a hundred thousand years ago that
provided the basis for unbounded and
creative thought what's sometimes called
the Great Leap Forward that's revealed
in the archaeological record right about
that period and the remarkable
difference is separating modern humans
from their predecessors any
that we know of and the rest of the
animal kingdom will another comment is
that is that every computational system
has to have a collection of elements
that are atomic for the purposes the
computation though like atoms they can
be decomposable by other means for
language these are were called the
lexicon it roughly word like elements
though I think it's I think they're good
reasons to accept the proposals at the
origins of generative grammar about 60
years ago that the notion word is really
a phonological notion not a syntactic
notion I think so and we'll go into it
well whatever these elementary units are
they pose another problem very serious
and deep problem for some eventual study
of the origin of language if it's ever
possible to undertake it the problem is
and also for acquisition of language
problem is that these elementary
elements these atoms concepts if you
like are quite different from anything
found in animal systems animal symbolic
of communication systems in the animal
systems it seems to be true that symbols
conform to what sometimes called the
referential is doctrine namely that a
symbol perhaps a animal cry is
associated with some mind independent
entity so you have a you know vervet has
a certain cry that means the leaves are
fluttering or something just one the one
associated with that that seems to be
universal for animal systems but the
doctrine is typically assumed for
language to
all the relevant fields except the
doctrine almost without exception but
it's just totally untenable as soon as
you look closely at even the simplest
words you find that just doesn't begin
to hold there's just no connection
between an internal element however
simple you know the river table anything
rock anything you pick up that no direct
connection between that and some mind
independent entity always involves some
metal constructions of a much more
complex kind a lot of study of this in
the last 40 years I think the doctrine
though it's still whole held almost
universally just can't be accepted
that's another important topic that will
just mention and put aside and it's the
only one that's very poorly understood
and insufficiently studied because of
the power of the referential is doctrine
I think it's false but it's very
powerful so it's funded everywhere
another topic to be discussed be
investigated well these remarks of
course only scratched the surface and
what I hope is that they'll illustrate
why the answer to the question what is
language actually matters a lot and also
will illustrate how close attention to
this fundamental question can yield
conclusions with considerable
ramifications for the study of what kind
of creatures we are thanks
ok this one both sequels both sides
equally been we have a little over 20
minutes for discussion I'm will be aided
in this activity by assistance with
microphones who will and I'll ask you to
pose your questions to the microphone
I'll also be added by my youngster
colleague over here dominates parties
whose ears are very good who will help
make sure that your questions get
through to professor Chomsky I'll also
ask you to follow some ground rules in
order to make best use of the time we
have first I'll ask you to keep your
questions to issues raised by his
remarks here rather than to broader
range of topics I'll also ask you to
keep your questions short because
they'll have to be repeated and finally
I'll ask you to keep your questions
questions rather than statements
I'll do my best to nothing there are
lights up there they're in my eyes which
may make it a little hard for me to keep
track but I'll do my best to distribute
questions around the room but please
don't be upset if you're trying very
hard and somehow you don't get my
attention okay so oh yes right also
because a professor as multi she's here
to assist questions can be entrenched
but they have to be short and to the
point too but of course we know they
will follow the natural logic of thought
okay so surprisingly I don't see any
hands up
there's a hand all right could we have
the microphone over here please
is it on yes I would like to know
something about the emergence or how can
I say that internal was I know how to
how to formulate that exactly because
it's not reached my consciousness yet so
it has to do with that you mentioned the
fact that you know we have internal or
personal language even before it reaches
consciousness I don't mean articulation
with the consciousness itself and I was
wondering whether what precedes that can
be considered language in the sense that
do you think it is structured and you
think that it corresponds to what we
think languages I don't know whether
white portions clear yes or even
translate these new crimp all right oh
so you you get me I get that gets his
answer okay thank you he's got a double
translation problem has translated the
French and translating the English for
me Oh ca va Kofi like this young and
Papas if I've understood correctly your
question you're asking something about
the subconscious yes the question is the
following language that we call
subconscious or unconscious can it be
considered to be language does it have a
structure or is it when it reaches
conscience that this can be considered
to be language so our subconscious
language in what sense is it a language
what kind of structure does it have what
kind of properties can we attribute it I
think it's it actually is language
what's not beyond the level of
consciousness looks like just some kind
of fragments that reach consciousness
occasionally or externalized usually not
and that doesn't seem to be surprising
most most of all what's going on in the
mind is completely and accessible to
consciousness and by now there's even
experimental work showing it
it's against that's contrary to dogmas
there's a philosophical thought move
it's pretty strong that says anything in
the mind has to be accessible to
consciousness because way back modern
versions attributable to WV quine and
John thorough others but old doctrines
just seems to be completely false most
of what's going on is it appears to be
inaccessible to consciousness so what
properties does it have well as the
properties that we try to discover by
looking at the scattered evidence that
does is available to us and that's just
normal science you don't see in fact a
couple of days ago there was the first
picture ever of what happens to a
molecule in the course of a chemical
process plenty was known about it lot
was assumed about it and then we ever
saw it before so it is a nice
technological development that's not
going to change chemistry for hundreds
of years the chemical theory was
developed just looking at whatever data
you have and that's the way science
works in one famous line is that science
is concerned with discovering hidden
simple Invisibles that account for
complex visibles that's science in fact
it's rational inquiry and we shouldn't
be surprised that the same holds in this
case doesn't think it does so what
properties does this internal system
have well apparently it has the kind of
problems that properties i mentioned so
for example it doesn't use linear order
it just uses minimal structural distance
which probably follows from minimal
computation which probably means this is
a further guess that when language
emerged it emerged without any selection
ille pressures so it just took the form
of a
natural object kind of like a snowflake
it since there were no selection
pressures that's mutation whatever it is
is happening to individual it's just
going to take the form of a object
naturally formed an accord with the
principles of natural law probably
minimal computation in this case as far
as we understand anything which is
pretty limited that seems to be pretty
much the case and not surprising if you
think about if tattersall was right you
know that this is sudden emergence of
something at a narrow time skill that's
what you'd expect thank you very much
thanks very much for a very interesting
lecture I like to ask about the
relationship between atoms of thought
and atoms of language and is all for
language am I thinking when I'm driving
down the freeway for example is that is
that thought involving language go Kelly
Kelly la hora co2 laser tom de la pase
la zatim didn't gather they oughta to
create a camila sweet talk on you
eternal to halt exactly so so it's all
for is all thought language and OSS go
to topple say a longass you know so is
what's the relation between the atoms of
language and the atoms of thought is is
and is any kind of thought language or
not well we we have very little
information about what thought is in
fact not very clear how you could have
such information but a lot of our the
mass of our information about thought is
what we get by looking at language so
that yields the suggestion that say
humble took to an extreme that they're
the same but again you can introspect if
you like it's the only kind of evidence
we have doesn't look at if they're the
same there seems to be lots of kinds of
thought that just never can get
articulated and I don't see any reason
to doubt that some kind of thought is
going on with non-working those which
organisms don't have language there is
you know there's a in cognitive in
computational cognitive science there's
a big enterprise which in my view is a
total waste of time which goes back to a
Miss reading of a very short paper by
Alan Turing back in nineteen fifty Alan
Turing's great mathematician the founder
of modern computational science and so
on he had a paper called them something
like do machines think and that's led
and he devised the test it's now called
the Turing test he called it an
imitation game and there's been a lot of
effort to try to any what he argued is
if or what he's been interpreted as
arguing you didn't say it is that if a
machine machine means program not a
physical computer but a program if a
program can pass this test that will
show that it thinks and if you're an
employee of IBM you get paid to
construct Watson
huge programs that are supposed to pass
the test you know they defeat people in
chess or jeopardy or something what
everyone and he can get a hundred
thousand dollars if you if you passed
the if you construct such a program
there's one line in Turing's paper which
seems to have been ignored what he said
is the question whether machines think
is to meaningless to deserve discussion
okay and he's right the question whether
machines think is like asking whether
submarine swim let's say if you want to
call that swimming they swim if you
don't want to call it swimming they
don't but it's not a factual question
it's the humans fly I think in Japanese
they do somebody told me but in English
they don't but but these are not factual
questions there are questions about how
we only use the word now there is
something going on that we loosely refer
to as thought but we don't know much
about what it is and so I will never
find out as long as attention is
restricted to what's accessible to
consciousness some of you may know that
there are recent experimental results
showing that decisions about same motor
action like whether to pick this up that
the decision is actually made
microseconds before you're aware of
making a decision that's been
misinterpreted as an argument about
freedom of will there'll be nothing to
the freedom will what it means that
decisions are made in a way that's
inaccessible to consciousness okay I
don't think that should surprise anyone
who's alive and has ever thought about
what they do but it is contrary to a
widely held a dogma and Isis I think
that dog has to collapse if we're going
to learn about these things
professor Chomsky how would you qualify
the influence of new technologies on the
traditional languages I mean by that
especially which is used now by well
younger generations pull those chats
tweets SMS where you have shortcuts you
have segments you have smileys all of
that which is probably much more used
than you know the normal words nowadays
so how would you think what kind of
influence it has and how can evolve them
afterwards the language we are used
toward we were trained to use in our in
our school time pass a voki d'onofrio
the technology mow down the
communication kinetics to the chart it's
a terrestrial organza hey no curse is he
we can tell what kind of influence do
you think modern technologies have such
as you know text messages chats and so
on on language you gotta ask somebody's
60 years younger than I am but I can
answer that you can
I don't think it has any effect on
language except kind of the way say
teenage slang constantly has effects on
language so it's one of the ways
languages change teenagers have slang
becomes the accepted language of the
next generation and I guess that's
probably going on here too I know I get
lots of letters especially for my
grandchildren which I can barely
understand that they have to pick
somebody has to decode them for me there
for things like LOL and all sorts of
other stuff so it's a kind of a
superficial impact that i can't imagine
it has much of an effect
professor Chomsky you did lots of a lot
of work in politics and as you know a
language has a crucial role in politics
and society I just wondering how it is
possible to decontextualized language
and from society and politics everything
thank you so we missed a crucial piece
of your question you're talking about
the relationship between language and
politics right and society so the we do
so with her a vm lavalas from kill
existent hold longer la politique a las
OCT
a
I can't thank you
too much Roy
from the formulas point of view
professor is a big normal east and from
the other point are he's very big
political person he did a very great
work in a political and he yes so I just
wondering how it is possible to
decontextualized language from society
of map politics everything doc the
community in perceive the deconstructed
echo text really juicy pave low long
gowns do the the contacts Nanak led to
td's a come by example ability lastly
the consideration sociality data so how
is it possible to deconflict textual
eyes language from its context of use
such as politics social contacts and so
on well the way I was discussing I mean
in the examples I was discussing I
didn't pay any attention to how the
sentences like these are used and the
same would be true if these were
sentence is not just picked for examples
but used for say some political purpose
mainly for maybe for propaganda for
domination or control or whatever the
language can be used for all kinds of
things and if you want to understand the
nature of language you have to kind of
factor that out and ask what is what are
the means that are being used for this
wide variety of purposes that's you know
again that's just if you're interested
in the question what's the nature of
language what kind of creatures we are
how does the creative abilities reside
in something that emerged maybe seventy
five thousand years ago that's what you
have to do you're certainly right and
that the uses of language have Oh
kinds of consequences but but but that's
the language itself doesn't care about
that the language doesn't care if you
use it to tell the truth or if you lie
or you for liberation or use it for
domination or whatever it's just kind of
a tool a hammer for example it's a tool
the hammer doesn't care if you use it to
build a house or crush somebody skull
whatever else you do it it's just there
it has certain properties and language
is just a complex tool it's one that's
at the core of our existence and it's
internalized in our minds but the way
you use it is up to you that's a
different question you can use in North
kind of ways
my question is why is language so
efficient and are there perhaps alien
life-forms who are more unfortunate and
have more complex operations than merge
the Pop Warner long gallery till to see
if he casts cpfr know he existed till
daughter from v keepo said the system is
on are there aliens with more complex
operations photo image email existence
next catalyst abeg the system we complex
emerged so why is language so efficient
and can we imagine extraterrestrial
beings or aliens with more powerful
systems well actually language is not
efficient i gave examples to show that
the actual design of language is such
that its use is often highly inefficient
it impedes communication so it takes a
filler gap problems or use of structural
versus linear distance this all makes
language hard to use actually there's a
sentence that i wrote once about 20
years ago which scandalized lots of
people so maybe i'll repeat it routing
it says it there's a certain sense in
which language looks like it's beautiful
but unusable of course an exaggeration
but that's intended to capture what i
think is something that does emerge from
the study of language that it's basic
design is kind of like a snowflake as i
said it's just beautifully designed but
that gives many cases where it's hard to
use gave some examples are plenty of
others i'm an ambiguous answer for
example the structural ambiguity is not
purple ambiguity
not interesting but we use it in of all
the possibilities of using it you use
the ones that are easy to comprehend I
mean just don't use the others they're
hard for you to produce their hard for
other people understand that doesn't
tell you what the design of languages
find out what it is you have to do the
kind of inquiry that I was talking about
here there is a question yes about ten
years ago there was a study published in
science with a comparison of the genome
of the chimp and humans and was found
that some of the main differences was in
the proteins in the genes involved in
hearing so that chimps may actually not
understand words because they don't hear
the words so I wonder whether you could
speculate to what extent you think that
the ability to hear has contributed to
the ability to attribute meaning to
sounds and to develop thought I repeat
hardware ya des oh yeah violated policy
of CR science geometry kapa kapa Lu
genome the chimpanzee element among take
a family difference with you must all
citizens
get on between the we do that change
don't the Marshallese particular listed
on the hearing we on contribute I'll a
possibility that we are in a significant
I don't they develop l upon safe well if
I understand the question is about the
very close overlap between genes of
humans and chimps active is pretty close
overlap between the genes of humans and
yeast the reason is that as is now
increasingly coming to be understood
there's just not a lot of variation in
organism and at the time when martin jos
person i quoted gave the bow as ian
tradition but languages can vary in
arbitrary ways and each one has to be
studied independently was also believed
by leading biologists at the same store
of organisms that you look at the
variety of organisms it just looks
endless so it was proposed that
organisms can differ in every possible
way and everyone you study has to be
studied on its own by now that's been
chipped away very significantly a lot of
it by leading french scientists like
logic oh no and others had discovered
regulatory genes genes that control the
operation of other genes and it's since
then they've discovered that there's a
very high degree of conservation in
genetic structure in fact it's even been
proposed by an american molecular
biologist and it's taken seriously maybe
people don't agree but it's not
considered observed that there's only
one animal
just minor variations of it they all
fall the animals and infect plants that
we know came around the Cambrian
explosion and a forum was established
and after that you get minor variations
doesn't look absurd and serious
biologists take it seriously and that's
so the overlap between chimps and humans
and the number of genes just doesn't
meaning you'd get very small differences
in say the operation of timing of
regulatory mechanisms which give you
totally different organism Jacobs
proposal I think maybe 40 years ago is
that slight changes in timing and
organization of regulatory mechanisms
could give the difference between a fly
and an elephant let's say and that's
something like that seems to be true so
there are slight differences between
humans and chimps or humans and mice and
humans and yeast but those slight
differences make quite a difference
phenomenally I'm sure that there's no
one in the room
wouldn't like to speak further with
professor Chomsky but I'm afraid our
time is up and we have to thank him
