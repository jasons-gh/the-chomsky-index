well it's been exciting exhilarating in
fact to see the occupied Boston program
develop and spread and from what I can
see to see the directions has been
moving there's no question that the
country desperately needs something like
this not just protest against the pretty
awful things that are happening but some
ideas and proposals and suggestive
constructive proposals about how to
organize to achieve a very different
kind of world and there's not a lot of
time to do it so the the fact that this
is beginning to happen here Wall Street
a couple other places has a lot of
potential and significance that could
turn the country around so it's real
exciting to watch I'll try to calm if I
can match them how would you know of my
schedule it's like hard to find five
minutes to make a telephone cool yeah
but I will try to work it in somehow
