question yes I don't keep you sluggish
she checked in an interview to the new
statement in 2009 said about you my
friend told me Chomsky said something
very sad
he said that today we don't need Theory
all we need to do is tell people
empirically what is going on here I
violently disagree facts are facts and
they are precious but they can work in
this way or that facts alone are not
enough you have to change the
ideological background I'm sorry I'm an
old-fashioned continental European
theory is sacred and we need it more
than ever how would you respond to this
claim first of all I quite agree that
just spewing enough facts means nothing
and in our discussion here we haven't
just been spewing out of facts within a
framework it's in the frame of
understanding some principles and so on
in the European intellectual is he's
talking about half a concept of theory
which in my view is totally devoted
almost radically divorced from facts and
radically divorced from theory it's
mostly big complicated words that may be
fun for intellectuals to throw around to
each other but most of it I think it's
gibberish
data the honest truth it's not theory in
any sense that I understand and I've
been involved most of my life in the
sciences were their theories and so on
so I sure if you can find a theory that
has some real principles and which are
some interest and you can draw
conclusions from them which you can
apply to interpreting the actual world
around sure it's wonderful but and if
there are such theories you know happy
to see them but I don't find them when I
read the Paris post modernist thought
what I see his intellect
interacting with one another in ways
which are incomprehensible to the public
and to be frank incomprehensible to me
so sure let's have theories that have
some intellectual content some
consequences can be refined and changed
Lee just a better understanding it's
fine all right good thank you so much I
really
