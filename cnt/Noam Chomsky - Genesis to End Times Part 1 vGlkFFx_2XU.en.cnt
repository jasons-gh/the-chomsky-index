it's tempting go back beginning to be
getting this pretty boy back but just it
is useful to think a little bit about
some elements of American history which
they are quite directly on American
koala trend policy in the Middle East
the United States a pretty unusual
country in many ways welcome is that it
just may be the only country in the
world was founded as an empire it was an
infant empires George Washington globe
and the founding fathers had pretty
broad aspirations the right area of
Thomas Jefferson a thought that the
disadvantaged by Richard spread and
become we called the nest for which the
entire continent will be colonized don't
get rid of the red in
driven away are exterminated black so
finally sent back to Africa immune
anymore and the Latins will be
eliminated by a superior race very basis
country literally through its history
not just any black that is Jefferson
image and there's no street it was in
addition but so it is a separate
colonialist society a settler
colonialism is far and away the worst
kind of imperialism I think no savage
tribe because it requires eliminating
the indigenous population not just got
that Rolie exploiting and that's not
unrelated I think to let the kind of
reflexive us work for Israel which is
also a settler colonial society and its
policies that kind of resonate with a
sense of American history and of
reliving it i goes beyond that because
the early settlers in the united states
i'm sure you know were religious
fundamentalists who regarded themselves
as the children of israel with following
the divine commandment severally
promised land the slaughter the
Amalekites insulins over that's right
around here in the early settlers in
massachusetts of course all of this was
done with the utmost benevolence so for
example the Massachusetts Bay flower
the Massachusetts was given its charter
by the King of England in 1629 and the
Charter that commissioned the settlers
to save the native population from their
misery of paganism and in fact if you
look at the grape seals that they call
in Massachusetts which he didn't find on
the internet looking at should be on the
walls of every classroom the country f
depicts an Indian with this holding two
Spears pointed down sign peace and out
of his mouth is coming a scroll which is
written come over and help us somebody
that's the frickin one of the first
examples of what's called humanitarian
intervention sake they were evidence
about typical of other cases up to the
present the Indians were pleading with
the Communists come over and help them
and the colonists were benevolently
following the divine command than their
plea to come over here and help well
turned out that they were helping the
way exterminated and that was considered
rather hustling around the 1820s when
Supreme Court Justice wrote about it
because it's kind of strange that
despite all their benevolence love for
the Indians they are withering
dispersing like the leaves of autumn
helping to speed is about the Divine
Will of providence's beyond human
comprehension disability we can't hope
to understand this conception book
profits called providential ISM that
we're always following God's will I was
right to the President to the present
moment whatever we're doing on the
following God's will extremely religious
country kind of off the spectrum and
religious belief very large percentage
of population
members of handles right hi who believes
in the literal word of the Bible and
part of that means supporting everything
that Israel does because God promised
promised land Israel suppose yet
supporting these same people it's a
substantial core of solid support for
anything that Israel because they also
happen to be most extreme anti-semites
in the world and then a Hitler Fremont
they they're looking forward to the
total annihilation of the Jews to a
small number or permitted to survive as
a person but Muslim going to be
annihilated after Armageddon
story about this which is glee literally
in high places might be liberating
virtually bush
and that ties in with the kind of
settler colonial history to provide a
solid base Christian Zionist ins for
long since Jewish times and then as much
stronger is a kind of solid base for
reflexive supported was relaxin duty the
just conquest of the national territory
because i have to tell you a pretty ugly
affair that was recognized by something
we're honest figures like John Quincy
Adams was the great grand strategist
expansionism theorists manifest destiny
and so on in his later years long after
his own horrifying crimes were in the
past he did lament when he called the
fate of that hapless races with Native
Americans who we have exterminated with
sexual malicious and savage and karate
and he said that's one of the sins that
the Lord is going to punish us for days
waiting for that his doctrines are
highly praised right to the president so
big there's one major scholarly book
let's go perverts in the Bush Doctrine
Bush number two by john dos gatos with
leading American Historians University
and he he he correctly plausibly
describes the Bush Doctrine as the
cepa's incentive directly of drunken see
Adams as Manifest Destiny dr.
inconsistencies conception of runs right
through American history president it's
the right conception is the conception
that of course we have to protect our
security and expansions the path the
security and he can't really have
security control arity so close to
extend not just over the hemisphere but
the world that's the wished up so so
great thing new respect to the origins
of the most vital trade figures by the
they're going to the details by the
Second World War the US had longed in by
far the richest country in the world who
is still playing a kind of a secondary
role with little fair name accurate
global reach Sarah were changed American
planners during Second World War results
planners understood very well from
inward the works went to end with the US
and a position of overwhelming power and
has the world in on and Russians
ground-bound the Germans much London
European war was understood that the US
would be more dominant and they laid
planets careful plans during the war for
what to post-war world would look like
the US would have total control over a
region that we include the Western
Hemisphere Far East the former British
Empire and you're as much of Eurasia as
possible in virtually it's cool that
commercial
stroke or was demure that's the minimum
maximum this world and which we need
that for security within this region the
US would have total control unquestioned
control and would limit any extra effort
at sovereignty by others who try to
interfere Lee it's a quite an expensive
doctrine and it was based on a certain
sense of reality that the u.s. ended the
war with in a position of dominance and
security that had no remote counterpart
in history had half the world's wealth
that can fold hemisphere the oceans the
opposite sides of both the oceans it was
just was in total Russians are there
some things were still under control the
road it was remarkably expensive right
at the center of it wasn't at least one
taught Roosevelt planner a burly long
time high-level planner
many years leading figure health
planning he pointed out that control of
Middle East oil will yield substantial
controlled world that doctrine remains
doctrine this property at this moment
and it will continue when fine Middle
East scholar sugar rush card that points
out sort of ironically in a recent book
that Saudi Arabia will be a leading ally
of the United States as long as they're
Stewart in one drop of oil left in the
desert after that they could go the way
Native Americans but and that remains a
leading theme policy for a long time
during the Cold worriers the policies
were invariably justified
Russians mostly invented for it the
Russians ran their own snore Empire the
similar pretext threatened Americans
this said these clouds were lifted after
the collapse of the Soviet Union for
this one understand American foreign
policy an obvious place to look is what
happened and Soviet Union disappeared
that's the natural place to look and it
follows almost automatically that nobody
looks like it's not disgusting scholarly
literature boats obviously where he
looked at my notable world as well and
in fact if you look you get very clear
answers the president that x 31 and
immediately after the collapse of red
bull there was a new national security
strategy that's budget they make very
interesting recent meeting the basic
message is nothing is going to change
except pretext so we still need they
said the huge military force not
to defend ourselves against the Russian
words wrong but because of that they
quote the technological sophistication
of third world powers if you're well
trained educated person and corporate
and so you're not supposed to laugh near
that reading reported but there is we
gotta have this to protect ourselves
from the technological sophistication of
third world powers I mean we have to
maintain what they call the defense
industrial base defense industrial base
is a euphemism for high-tech industry
which much that comes out of state
sector computers someone so if we're
under the pretext of the defense I have
to maintain that with regard to the
Middle East they said we must maintain
the intervention forces most of them
came with abilities and then comes an
interesting phrase that we have to end
the maintain the intervention force and
the Middle East really serious threats
to our interest could not have been laid
at the Kremlin's door so in other words
sorry folks we've been lying to you for
50 years but now that protects is gone
so at the truth the problem in the
Middle East is and has been what's
called radical nationalism radical
distance
pendants turned them into the pendant OU
followers the radical nationalism could
be of any kind of errands good chase so
in 1953 the Iranian threat with secular
nationalism after 1978 its religious
nationalism but it remains the threat I
1953 was taken care of by overthrowing
the parliamentary regime and installing
a dictator was highly praised wasn't
secret highly praised the New York Times
for example an editorial describe
praising it as the overthrow of the
government does a an object lesson two
countries that go to small countries
that go berserk with rep radical
nationalism and seek to control their
own resources this will be an object
lesson to try any of that nonsense but
certainly not in an area but we need for
control the world I was nineteen fifty
three uh since the overthrow of the u.s.
imposed tyrant 1979 erin has been
constantly under us tak have stopped
right away first Carter Carter tried to
reverse the overthrow of the Shah
immediately by trying to start up a
instigate a military coup that didn't
work the Israeli wasn't called it affect
the Ambassador there have been a very
close relation between Israel around
under the shop the theoretically formal
relations and the top visually and
affect the Ambassador were the brawny
advised that if we could find a military
officer military officers who are
willing to shoot down ten thousand
people in the streets that we could
restore the Shah that's big new
Brzezinski quarters foreign policy
national security advisor and pretty
much the same advice well that didn't
quite work right away the US turned the
support for Saddam Hussein and his
invasion of Iraq of Iran which was no
small affair hundreds of thousands of
Iranians were slaughtered the people who
are now running the country are veterans
of that war and they deepen their
consciousness as the understanding that
old world was against the Russians the
Americans all sporting said on the
saying and the effort to overthrow the
new Islamic state that was established
and after the end was up it was a small
thing I mean the u.s. support for Saddam
Hussein was so extreme that of course
that I'm Hussein's crimes were just deny
the 11 photo massacres and massacres of
Kurds the Reagan administration Justin
I've been putting on Iran Iraq was even
given a very rare privilege it's the
only country other than Israel which has
been granted the privilege of attacking
a u.s. naval vessel and killing dozens
of soldiers and getting away with it
with complete impunity in the Israeli
cases with the Liberty in 1967 in the
racks case it was the USS stark 1987
vessel which was part of the u.s. fleet
protecting Iraqi shipment from Iran
during the during war and they attacked
it with French missiles xss missiles
which killed a dozen soldiers the
sellers and it's got a light tap on the
risk that nothing beyond that the u.s.
support was so strong but after the war
was over the u.s. basically won the war
for Iraq it continued 1989 it's now
George Bush number one he invited
erratic Iraqi nuclear engineers to the
United States for advanced training in
the nuclear weapons development was one
of those little things that I guess hush
topological insulator Saddam became a
bad boy isolated orders and then right
after that came our sections and so I'm
right up till today well coming up till
today in the foreign policy literature
in general commentary which read
commonly is that the major foreign
policy problem for the United States is
how to deal with the threat of Iraq
remains a threat just as it's been ever
since it became independent well what
exactly is the threat of red do we have
an authoritative answer to that came out
a couple of months ago in a publication
of the International Institute of
Strategic Studies technically
independent that Institute is very
closely linked to the government they
come out every year with the analysis
that world military situation for
military balance which was April it's
called military balance to
of course is section my brand new agey
threat and they go into it's important
reading what they say is whatever the
Iranian credit is not a military threat
they said that Iranian military spending
is quite low even by regional standard
and it's compared with the United States
of course it's invisible that's the ten
percent of u.s. military spending for
the way they do it to Iranian military
doctrine and they say writing military
doctrine is geared toward defense of the
national territory they remember the
iraqi invasion back but with Russia a
small thing and their military doctrine
is designed to slow down an invasion
sufficiently so that it will be possible
for diplomacy to begin to operate that's
the military doctrine they say they say
it's possible that Iran is thinking
about nuclear weapons
okay but if they're developing the clear
weapons it would be as part of the
deterrence strategy what is an effort to
prevent the attack which is not a
unlikely it's not a remote contingency
the most massive military power in
history namely us which has been
extremely hostile to those occupying two
countries on their borders it's openly
threatening them with attack constantly
so as its Israeli client so it's some
small things so they say well they may
be thinking about the Greer weapons for
deterrence that's the military side of
your right hand thrill nevertheless
there they go under a major threat the
threat is the primary threat is that
they're attempting to expand their
influence in neighboring countries
that's called destabilization they're
carrying out destabilization in
neighboring countries by trying to
expand their influence that's a problem
for the United States because the United
States is trying to bring about
stability the US invades another country
that's to improve about stability
stability is a technical parenting
international relations literature it
means obedience to us orders so when we
invade Iraq and Afghanistan that's
degrade stability if the Iranians try to
extend their influence in these two
neighboring countries that's
destabilizing and this is kind of built
in to scholarly and other doctrine it's
even possible to say without ridicule
that was not
bloody liberal commentator was former
editor foreign affairs game's changed
once pointed out the US had to
destabilize chewy under I ended to
reinvest ability that's not a
contradiction undermined the government
destabilize it in order to bring about
stability namely obedience the US orders
perfectly straight forward on
contradictory so the main threat of Iran
is its destabilization of neighboring
countries by trying to extend its
influence and the secondary threat of
Iran is it support for terrorism and
what's terrible well that's two examples
of support for terrorism when is it
support for Hezbollah in Lebanon the
other is it support for kawasan in
Palestine whatever you think about
Hezbollah Hamas maybe you think of the
worst thing in the world what exactly is
their tourism well the terrorism of
Hezbollah is actually celebrated in
Lebanon every year made 25th having to
give a talk in Beirut that day his last
May twenty-fifth that's Levin's national
holiday one national holiday in schools
are closed banks are closed and so on
and its celebrating the expulsion of
Israeli invaders from Lebanese territory
in the year 2000 as well that resistance
really work their kid finally force
Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon
which it had been occupying for 22 years
in violation of security council orders
with plenty of terror and violence and
virtue and sirloin so they finally left
and that's Lebanese liberation bid so
that's remain poor as well as terrorism
and that's the way it's described
actually is really seemed describes
aggression read Israeli press these days
pilot little figures that argument was
sick to withdraw from 7-11 because that
permits he ran to renew its aggression
against the United State against Israel
was carrying out aggression up until
2000 by supporting resistance to the
Israeli occupation that's aggression
against Israel that for our principles
in the citizen thing let's as well some
of their other acts you can criticize or
that's the core of because what I
terrorism but what about the months well
Hamas became a serious threat to serious
terrorist organization in January 2006
when Palestinians committed a really
serious crime those a was the date of
the first free election in any country
in the Arab world and they voted the
wrong way that's completely unacceptable
and immediately without the length of an
eye but the United States and is
returned very publicly towards punishing
the Palestinians for that crime you can
read in the New York Times parallel
columns right afterwards one of them
talking about our love for democracy and
so on right back to the Great Seal they
call it in Massachusetts and right
alongside of the plans to punish
Palestinians for the way they were
in January election which were no Joe
been plenty of punishment of
palestinians before including gaza
escalated sharklet after january 2006
section israel and so far as evil to cut
off the flow of water to the arid guests
trip but within a couple of months but
June Israel who fired that seven without
7700 Rockets of Gaza plus its letter
attacks all of us defense against
terrorism
you have escalated later escalated
sharp-looking Hamas carry out a really
major terrorist course in june two
thousand seven when the US and Israel of
its cooperation of the Palestinian
Authority that tried to carry out a
military coup to overthrow
germany and was be back nice took
control after that day he came to see
terrorist forces and prisons and makeup
way to treat their own population for
example but must terrorism were part of
seven the current claim is the terrorism
consists of Rockets Kassam rockets from
Gaza it is room for cities and that's
the justification that was given for the
operation cast lead us Israeli invasion
of the is networking 2008 and also for
media after the attack on the prison
facility
the reason is to stop the Rockets it's
on me and I deeply indoctrinated country
that people can hear that I am laughter
ridicule I'm putting aside the
comparison between cousin rockets and
the terror that the u.s. measure would
constantly carrying out the apartment
has absolutely no credibility or very
simple reason that Israel knows exactly
how the United States knows exactly how
to stop the Rockets exactly by peaceful
moment there was a ceasefire in june two
thousand eight his really reduces fire
with us israel didn't really live up to
what are supposed to open the borders
maybe the hamas did live up to you could
take a look at the official was early
government website listen to their
official spokesman mark very good and
they agreed that during the ceasefire
there wasn't a single from us right the
ceasefire was broken by israel
made when it invaded chasm and killed a
dozen Hamas activists and then there was
some rocket fire and far greater tax
lien is really people were killed
Palestinians as usual Hamas then offered
to renew the ceasefire Israel considered
a cabinet considered and rejected
preferring to use violence a couple days
later came the USS early attack on Gaza
now in the wet and the United States in
fact in the West generally Israel it's
taken for granted by the human rights
groups bolts limit report and so on that
Israel had the right to use for some
self-defense and then there's a
criticism that it was disproportionate
but they absolutely no right to use
force in the first place you have no
justification for the use of force
unless you've exhausted peaceful names
and in this case the US and is really
are just not exhausted when they refused
him to try peaceful names which that
every reasonable belief would succeed
accordingly I continue to call it you
it was what is real is in tandem with
the united states that invasion was
complicit to criminal act of aggression
in the first place and the human rights
recruits are basically irrelevant
details and the concession that Israel
had a right to attack is a just an
amazing gift if Israel was acting
rationally when the Goldstone report
came out instead of turning it into a
major international affair is Richard
welcome the Goldstone report thank them
for having accepted the Israeli position
that as they did that they give Israel
had the right to attack and then publish
the 2,000 page document which never
looked at going through the specific
plans
minus approved instead they turned it
into a major activity Semitism
comfortable follicles that's sure
rationality but we're striking as the
peers and invert it's accepted as
legitimate Israa pass the right to use
force even though it knows perfectly
well there are peaceful means that could
achieve the lads we just sort of same
farce reacted with the hotel Israel
claims that they couldn't let with
Attila come in because they are carrying
cement that Hamas might use the cement
to build bunkers for Rockets but that's
very bility victa this in first place
but it has no credibility if only
because they'd stop the rock is easily
adjust
super policies that far-reaching
policies well that's the Iranian threat
what's the were about the
israel-palestine issue it strongly
argued now Taylor tomorrow's papers you
see that of us well studying Brett
Minister made a speech in Washington
ambition said will vote for a two-state
solution is fading maybe but give it up
and it's a pretty common noun for
supporters of the Palestinians and
Palestinians leaders themselves to say
what we have to abandon both the
two-state solution we should the city
leaders said we should give Israel Kate
let them take over Old West Bay one
state will then carry out a civil rights
throw but Heidi apartheid struggle in
south africa that's a very common view
scourge the Palestinians and policy
leadership it looks simple point of
logic those are not the two options
there's a third option then with the US
and Israel continue doing exactly what
they're doing they're going to take
control the aesthetic good what they
want the Palestinians they need analogy
to South Africa with the apartheid
struggle is pretty misleading South
Africa needed its black population they
were his work for who they couldn't get
rid of eighty-five percent of the
population to work of the country so
kind of as under slavery they had take
care got to take care of your workforce
and so banter stands were been up there
we're going to intended to be more
viable because it was necessary
reproduce the workforce but that's not
true for Israel and Palestinians as no
interest in the Palestinian people and
what they did expensive the way for once
can get out it's like the United States
and ambitions population here I'm
attention
just exterminate that hapless race of
Native Americans they can ship murder
can get rid of that these days look at
the United States good condition sure so
just let him leave it's no big secret
they done who's the weird fetish members
of the Israeli elite defense minister to
charge the occupied territories 1967 and
he advised the time but through his
colleagues that we should tell the
Palestinians that we had nothing for you
you're going to live like dogs and
whoever was who would that answer and
that's exactly the policy before I get
him to live like dogs and whoever leaves
will leave now in recent years Israel s
some with us in Israel again my sages
ruining us Israel at somewhat modified
policy they are taking the advice of
Israeli industrialists who some years
ago suggested that Israel should shift
from a policy of colonialism to a posse
of neocolonialism neocolonialism is for
example
standard model that's where many of the
modern programs of me according doesn't
work carefully crafted I should very
good site as a detailed study which is
worth looking at
historian how the u.s. subdued the
philippines after the conquest we know
what happened during the conquest it was
conquered the philippines as usual with
most benevolent attention which
crystallizes join and so forth slower a
hundred thousand people
massive for crimes and so then what
happened well what happened after that
goes into a hundred page invito is that
they crafted a new technique of control
population using the most advanced
high-tech technology of the day they
impose the system of close surveillance
over the entire population co-opting
innately too westernized elite luxury
breaking up nationalist groups by
various methods silly rumors by Google
and so on and of course the paramilitary
force that's the muscle in case things
go wrong philippine constabulary it
turned out to be very effective in fact
it's still in place in philippines if
you look up today's paper he would
notice that the u.s. welcomes the new
philippine government and she read your
articles or front page articles masiela
that they didn't point out much of the
population lives miseries in fact if you
think about it that's the one part of
East and Southeast Asia that hasn't
taken Dennis hasn't taken part in me
east asian economic growths affected
good at the West generation not the
Philippines it's also the one you are
strong for mekonom be alone and still
run the same weight one hundred years
ago virtual elements Constabulary aims
and so on with the US just in the
backward but that's an extremely
successful model the colonization it
became the model for Haiti Republic many
other naval colonies later that it also
turn back to the Imperial countries both
the United States and Britain adopted
similar measures of population control
of domestically the first turning first
world war ii
mursel till today so Britain was maybe
look for the leading surveillance
societies in the world is not that far
behind and they're using the modified
versions of what was crafted with great
care and success in the Philippines the
century well Israel finally understood
that that's the right way to proceed so
in fact a few if you can read about say
Allah the west bank should report
reports which are accurate say that it's
kind of like Paris London for the
Palestinian elite nice life fine typical
third row
the rich collaborationist a bleed in a
sea of misery and suffering the room
nestled in a third world a structure
that is really sensitive the advice of
Industrialists term Palestine into neo
colony and it can be praised for
so on but you have to have control of
course there has to be Diana the
philippine constabulary and it's there
it's an army marimba and Martin general
Keith Dayton said school costs idiot but
it's actually its constitutive
Palestinian so typically quoting
struttin do colonial structures the
repressive forces domestic car and run
that's written by an American general
that's trained by Jordan which is a
partial dictatorship police state and
the Israel Israel Jordan my trainer
forces the United States runs them and
there are successful in fact they're
highly praised by American liberals so
