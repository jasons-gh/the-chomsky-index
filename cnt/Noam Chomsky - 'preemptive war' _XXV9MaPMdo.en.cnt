this is sometimes called preemptive a
preemptive war doctrine that's just
propaganda it's not a pre-emptive word
document preemptive war means something
a preemptive war under charitable
interpretation falls within the existing
framework of international law okay so
those of you memories are long enough
may remember that the present incumbents
in Washington one of the ways they kept
the country terrified through the 1980s
as they did one of them was to conjure
up an air base in Grenada which the
Russians were going to use that bama's
fortunately our great cowboyed leader
who saved us and time did six thousand
special forces who managed to overcome
the resistance of a couple of dozen
cuban paramilitary workers with pistols
and actually got eight thousand medals
of Honor for it and we were standing
tall after that if you remember so we
were safe but for a while it looked like
the Russians were going to bomb us from
Grenada assuming they couldn't find it
on a map somewhere
suppose they found it sometimes it's
called preventive or but that's not
right either it's not preventing
anything the only thing is preventing is
any potential challenge that the u.s.
government invents claims to be a
challenge that's just a open license to
go to war with anybody and destroy
anybody which we can do because we have
overwhelming power and that's the way
it's understood that's one thing that
happened in September another thing that
happened in September is is that the it
was the opening of the midterm election
campaign September was the opening of
the campaign for the congressional
elections well the Republicans
understood very well that they can't
possibly win the elections if the issues
are those that concern people such a
economic issues basically and the reason
is they're cutting a revised threat and
they'll get smashed if that's the issue
so they had to do what they did right
through the 1980s through the 1980s
their policies were extremely unpopular
they were able to stay in for good
reason there will stay in office by
frightening people and that's what they
did again Karl Rove just was kind enough
yesterday in the New York Times to
explain it all those obvious before it
was necessary to frighten people into
believing that there's a threat to their
security in that case they'll rally
around the strong leader the brave
cowboy another one because I'll suppress
their concerns over things like you know
where's my job or what's happening to my
pension or how am I going to take care
of my elderly my mother and so on and so
forth if those issues are voting on
those issues the administration didn't
have a chance and as Rove just pointed
out yesterday if we want to produce a
want to pursue their domestic agenda
very harsh agenda which would change
that would return the country back 200
years ago if they want to do that I
they're going to have to frighten people
and that's correct and they did starting
in September there was a drumbeat of
propaganda about the several things
first that Saddam Hussein is an imminent
threat to our survival just like a
grenade 1983 an imminent threat to our
survival another was the constant
insinuation that he was behind he
carried out the organized the September
11th of texts and that they were
planning new ones well that was a it
this was a spectacularly successful
government media propaganda campaign you
can see it by looking at the polls by
the ends of tember
and since round sixty percent of the
population believes that Saddam Hussein
is a imminent threat to us security and
survival by now over a majority think
that Iraq was behind September 11th and
it's finding new things that Iraqis were
on the plains if you go back before that
it was like three percent and the whole
life it's totally outlandish and
furthermore these attitudes these police
are very highly correlated with sports
reward and it's understandable I mean if
I believe those things I've been favored
the word too if you think that Saddam
Hussein is an imminent threat to your
existence that he carried out the
September 11th attacks and it's powerful
enough to carry out new ones and
arguments for war and people in the
united states are genuinely frightened
this is unique to the United States no
one else believes any of this even the
neighboring countries that were attacked
by Saddam Hussein is considered insane
but here it dominance and this is not
the first time that the end they did it
did work for the election barely if you
take a look at the election the
Republicans managed to maintain power to
pursue their domestic and international
agendas by a very small number of votes
of what tens of thousands of votes is
essentially a statistical tie but just
enough to maintain power and they did it
exactly this way people call show that
people maintain their preferences that
suppress their concerns over issues that
matter in your life because under this
press that below the security threat so
your le around the leader this is the
story that went right through the 1980s
for these guys in office it is
absolutely second nature that they did
come into offices plays pointed out
correctly and importantly announcing a
war on terror which of course instantly
became a major terrorist war but they
also started right off with threats to
our existence so in 1981 first year the
cowboy was hiding in the White House
surrounded but tanks because Libyan hit
men were wandering the streets of
Washington and I'm going to assassinate
our leader miraculous escape from that
one then came then came Renee de there
were other living threats in fact he
told us that the told the country that
Libya is trying to expel in the United
States from the world been on a small
objectives then came grenada
Obama's from grade safe from that one
then came Nicaragua which was only two
days driving time from Harling in Texas
it was a cancer right in our land mass
says that moderate George Shultz
Secretary of State put told Congress we
gotta save her though furthermore
they're following the script from mine
humph he said planning to conquer the
world at reagan declared a national
emergency in 1985 because of the threat
to the security of the United States
posed by the government of Nicaragua you
know and people outside the united
states were looking in amazement as all
this stuff was going on but it worked
checked the population frightened enough
to keep them in office i went on right
through the 80s 1988 george bush was
able to get elected by just pulling a
straight race car Willie Horton you know
black good criminal it's gonna rip your
sister unless I get elected what
in those words that was so close to the
surface he couldn't visit that crime
people were terrified about crime they
were terrified about drugs one thing
after another these are all problems but
they're no different than any other
industrial country and the united states
at a level of security that's just
beyond what anybody even dreaming but
the population is a very it's a very
frightened population this goes way back
it's easy to scare people work than the
80s they're doing exactly the same thing
now and it did succeed in building up
enough support so that even though
opposition to the war is enormous and
affects never been this guy it was
enough to sort of given some kind of
basis to go to war that's an impressive
achievement and it also frightens people
you know very much frightened I mean
today in the New York Times you can big
page showing pictures of Marines and
other explaining why they're going to go
to why they want to go to war with Iraq
and killed her actives it's because they
remember 911 okay no you know somebody's
watching this anywhere else in the world
they can only conclude one of two things
either this country is so fanatically
racist that if some error did something
to you want to kill all Arabs and it's a
level of racism pretty hard to imagine
either that or the country is so deeply
indoctrinated that people believe
