one of the most significant and
successful and in fact courageous
attempts to break the siege and express
the opposition strong opposition that
should be felt towards maintaining the
siege has been the flotilla movement
sending ships to tours sure with
humanitarian aid medic equipment and so
on to the people of Gaza there almost
everyone is just stopped by the Israeli
Navy sometimes violently Lamar's a
famous case but they keep coming I was
in Gaza with some friends last October
and one of the ships was coming in right
at that time was stopped by the Navy
press conference but they've been
regularly coming there's now a new
initiative and exciting new initiative
to build an ark in Gaza from
reconditioned fishing boat and to break
the siege by sending the boat out of
Gaza to the outside which is a very
powerful symbolic gesture implying that
the people of Gaza should have freedom
they should be able to leave their
prison and this Ark is in the process of
construction at wilson i hope you
completed there may be difficulties
because of the difficulty doing anything
in gaza but if it it can get out it will
be a very important development and will
signify to the world would it ought to
understand that the outside world should
be humiliated by their own will
us to break the siege and allow freedom
for the people who've been imprisoned
there for half a century but more
intensively since the ozil accord which
20 years ago it happens one of its major
provisions that Gaza and the West Bank
would be the territorial integrity
freedom function posted in control
assumes that was established
