those who cannot remember the past are
condemned to repeat it
that famous saying is credited to George
Santayana a Spanish born American author
of the late 19th and early 20th
centuries and it is those words that
drive this week's from the vault hi I'm
Bryan DeShazer director of the Pacifica
Radio Archives and this is from the
vault the archives weekly program that
brings our history out of the vault and
onto the radio for those who do remember
the past the summer of 2006 bears a
striking familiarity to the summer of
1980 two days before the invasion of
Lebanon by Israel MIT professor Noam
Chomsky sat down with KPFA Philip
Madhuri for a lengthy in-depth interview
on the Middle East and Israeli invasion
which Trump's key predicted I'm speaking
with Professor Noam Chomsky from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
professor Chomsky I want to talk about
the Middle East and it's such a
confusing issue that we've myzel starts
not with square one which would be going
back prior to 1948 but let's start with
Camp David I want to get a sense from
you of exactly what you thought of first
of all Kissinger diplomacy in the Middle
East and then the negotiations and the
resultant agreement at Camp David well
to understand the Kissinger diplomacy
and what ultimately led to Camp David
one has to go back to about 1970 which
is when Kissinger took over control of
Middle East policy and what happened
then is very poorly understood although
the documentation is easily accessible
if anybody wants to check up what I'm
not going to say what in fact happened
is this at the time the Kissinger took
over American policy was oscillating
between two positions one was what is
called the Rogers plan Secretary of
State William Rogers position and that
position was essentially that the United
States should join the international
consensus on this issue which was to
restore the pre June 1967 borders with
some modifications and to arrange for a
peaceful negotiated political
and on that basis it's only there was no
talk about the Palestinians at that time
so this would have meant in effect
return of the West Bank to Jordan and
the cyanide to Egypt and the Golan
Heights to Syria in return for a
comprehensive peace settlement that was
the Rogers plan Kissinger had a very
different position his position was that
the United States should support Israeli
control of the occupied territories
without any concessions at all and in
fact even in his memoirs he describes
how he deflected efforts on the part of
the State Department or others which
aimed at trying to set up some kind of
negotiated political settlement because
he didn't want one
he thought that one should rely on his
relayed power now this was part of the
whole Kissinger Nixon system of relying
on surrogate states like Iran and Israel
to projected to be the base for the
projection of American power and Israel
at that point appeared to be in a
position of just overwhelming military
dominance and same with Iran and this
seemed to be from the point of view of
someone like Kissinger who's who's I
should say whose understanding of
history and politics is extremely
limited and primitive but who does
understand violence very well he
understands the mailed fist and from
that point of view from the point of you
have a real primitive like Kissinger
this seemed a very plausible position
well this came into sharp conflict with
Sadat's diplomacy a fact which has been
very effectively suppressed in the
United States in Sadat came into into
office in late 1970 and in February 1971
he made a peace offer to Israel a
comprehensive peace offer which went far
beyond what he proposed in his trip to
Jerusalem in 1977 specifically in that
he too made no mention of the
Palestinians which is supposed to be the
big stumbling block the proposal that he
made was that actually he accepted a
proposal of Gunnar hearing of the United
Nations which was that there should be a
peace settlement with recognized borders
and
the rhizomes and the whole panoply of
conditions that have been associated
with the UN resolutions on approximately
I'm essentially the June pre June 67
borders this proposal was read this
entailed effectively recognition of
Israel and a comprehensive peace
settlement and again let me stress it
said nothing about the Palestinians gave
them nothing now this was rejected by
Israel and was rejected by the United
States it included the return of the
Sinai to Egypt right they returned it an
effect meant that compass it it meant
peace in return for evacuation of the
occupied territories well this was
rejected by Israel although they
recognized it as a genuine peace offer
in their terms and it was rejected by
Kissinger in accordance with his
position well then since that for
several years after that Sadat continued
to press for a negotiated settlement and
the United States can under Kissinger
direction of the Middle East continually
refused Sadat pointed out an in fact
American oil companies pointed out and
so on that this was going to lead the
war that so that would be compelled to
go to war to achieve what he and his
aims if if the diplomacy failed and
Kissinger in effect rejected that
because he assumed as as did most
intelligence estimates that it would be
crazy for Egypt to go to war because
Egypt was a basket case they couldn't
possibly compete with the Israeli power
well that led to the October 1973 war
for which Kissinger has primary
responsibility now the October 73 war
was a big surprise to the Israel and to
Western intelligence because in fact
Syria and Egypt came very close to
winning in the early stages of the war
it was a very close thing in fact it
appears that Israel threatened the use
of nuclear weapons unless the United
States
sent massive conventional arms they were
so they expected such at the possibility
they anticipated in the early stages the
possibility of a serious defeat well
that the effect of the war was to sort
of dispel some of the clouds and
Kissinger's mind that's the right term
for it and to get him to comprehend
that in fact it would be wiser from his
point of view to accept Sadat's offer to
incorporate Egypt within the American
system as an American client state in
return to some sort of a peace
settlement with Israel and he then
undertook the so-called shuttle
diplomacy the purpose of which was to
arrange for some sort of a settlement it
was a kind of compromise between Sadat's
position and his former position the
purpose was to basically eliminate Egypt
from the Middle East conflict by some
sort of an interim settlement in the
Sinai and in fact attorney took towards
Africa and in fact they tried to turn
Egypt into a surrogate state like Iran
in Israel for American power in Africa
that's a not well known but true and at
the same time it retained the earlier
aspects of the Kissinger program and
that this policy was to permit Israel to
retain control over the occupied
territories the West Bank in the Gaza
Strip
well that policy went along for several
years by now Kissinger was incidentally
in January 1976 the the Arab states
including the confrontation States
including Egypt and the Jordan and Saudi
Arabia and Syria and in fact back then
even the PLO came to the Security
Council of the United Nations with a
proposal which again called for a
comprehensive settlement on the June 67
borders with mutual with recognized
borders and demilitarized zones on the
rest of it and that was again v2 this at
this time was vetoed by the United
States this went on for several years by
by 1977 so that was becoming desperate
and he then made this dramatic trip to
Jerusalem which was impossible to
suppress I mean the February 71 offer
was effectively suppressed that was
quiet diplomacy but the trip to
Jerusalem was just too dramatic and in
fact it took the apparently took the
United States by surprise and now it's
Carter not Kissinger and the United
States essentially went along with it
and tried to take it over and tried to
utilize it as a way of achieving what is
one of the main purposes of the United
States in the region and that is to
prevent Europe from playing any role and
coordinating Affairs in the Middle East
so that course also Bergkamp David of
course also preventing the Soviet Union
well that's what they talk about but
they really don't care I'm that's that's
propaganda cover nobody expects the
Soviet Union to play a major role in
areas of prime concern to the United
States they know if the Soviet Union's
been very cautious not to interfere and
regions which it knows to be at the core
of American interest like the Middle
East because they know that there'd be
in the clear war if they did and in fact
though we constantly talk about defense
of some region against the Soviet Union
if you really sort of unpack those
remarks it turns out that we're really
talking about defense against the
indigenous population and in the Middle
East against European intrusion the
Europeans are real rivals in the Middle
East when Russia is not the Europeans
will get the contracts from Saudi Arabia
Soviet Union won't let's go back to Camp
David Camp David not only provided for
the return of the Sinai to Egypt it also
provided for autonomy negotiations for
the Palestinians of Gaza and the West
Bank well that's just a cover for
ensuring that the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip stay within Israeli control and in
in this respect Camp David was an
extension of the Kissinger diplomacy
with did Sadat basically agree with the
notion that the West Bank in Gaza should
remain under nominal Israeli control so
that was intelligent enough to realize
that his interests and in fact the
interests of a leap groups throughout
the Arab world would be best served by
suppressing radical nationalism and the
main sort of what inflames radical
nationalism in the Middle East in the
Arab countries is the Palestinians and
Palestinian problem so Sadat like the
Saudi Arabians and other conservative
groups that want to be American clients
like them he assumed that the best
solution would be to constrain the
Palestinians in some mini state which
would be basically bound controlled by a
Jordanian Israeli military alliance and
supported by the most conservative
deeply reactionary forces in the Arab
world like Saudi Arabia that's that what
Sadat regarded
suspect as as the best solution from the
point of view of the ruling elites in
the Arab states and most of the world
agrees into Ned Lee but the United
States and Israel object and I tender
the autonomy provisions of the Camp
David Accord are just a very transparent
fig leaf intended primarily for American
public opinion which will have which it
was obvious at the time would have
exactly the effect that now everybody
can see they have had namely just to lay
the basis for further steps towards
Israeli annexation this was quite
obvious at the time but people who said
it were of course dismissed and you know
attacked in the usual fashion now I
don't think any rational person can deny
it it's just obvious that that's what
it's leading towards in fact it's even
reached the point where to my
astonishment the leading Israeli
military historian almost Perlmutter
who's very hawkish himself incidentally
I had an article in New York Times a
couple of days ago in which he stated
the general sharin the defense minister
who's really in many ways the leading
figure in Israel that he no he stated
barometer that Sharon his plan is to
simply drive expel the Arabs out of the
occupied territories let's go and talk
about the West Bank for a while under
the Labour government there were
elections in the West Bank in Gaza and
which mayor's were elected and in every
case sets candidate sympathetic with the
PLO were elected in those in those
elections since then those mayor's have
become the only official representatives
of the Palestinian people under Israeli
occupation and they have been a center
for opposition to Israeli occupation
most recently the Israeli occupiers have
put out of office several of the of the
Palestinian mayors and have attempted to
set up what are called village leagues
which would work more closely with a
civilian
a leadership in the in the occupied area
under professor Menachem Nielsen what
what is really happening here well first
of all we should recognize the
significance of the change from military
to civilian control there is a
significance but I think one should be
aware of what it is a Milton himself for
example I think is a reserve of colonel
in the Army and the shift from military
civilian control simply means a shift
towards annexation just as it did in the
Golan Heights what what we'd correctly
call the virtual annexation of the Golan
Heights in effect was a switch from
military to civilian military to
civilian legal structure that's the
device that's used to take the next step
towards annexation so the the likud
policy the policy that you're describing
that's associated with Milson and Sharan
of extending civilian rule over the West
Bank while that has a sort of a benign
sound to it after all we'd prefer
civilian ruled a military rule in effect
that's quite the opposite what it means
is it's a step towards actual annexation
and the next thing after civilian rule
is to is further integration and the
ultimate result of that is outright
annexation it's clear that that's
Whitley Cudas drifting towards now the
Labour Party program was quite different
I would argue more cynical but at least
different of the Labour Party position
associated with Moshe Dayan and actually
it's called the alone plan named after
Yigal Allon
it was the foreign minister at one time
that this plan was for Israel to
essentially take what it wanted in the
occupied territories so to take the
Jordan Valley and substantial area
around Jerusalem and the water and
agricultural resources is essentially to
take what it needed but to not take over
the areas of heavy population
concentration and the reason was and the
people who lived in the the population
at least the heavy concentrated
population they would either be left
they would be if they wanted if Jordan
would agree they could become Jordanian
citizens under Israeli military control
or off they'd simply be left stateless
which is the worst possible position for
a human being in a world of nation
states that means no protection against
any arbitrary act of state power that
was the Labour Party position and the
reason for it was that they are
concerned with what they call somewhat
euphemistically the demographic problem
namely if the under the pagan plan under
the plan which is plainly going towards
annexation there will be a very
substantial Arab population in the
Jewish state by the year 2000 that might
be say half and the question is what
happens then well what happens is you
just become like South Africa I mean you
know already the the Arab population and
the Jewish state is necessarily
second-class citizens but within the
borders of Israel it's like 15 percent
you know if in expand that Israel pretty
soon be something like 50 percent and
the mechanisms that are used to deprive
them of the primary rights of
citizenship while they can easily be
disguised or readily easily disguised
when it's a much small minority
that'll be extremely difficult as
they're a larger part of the population
now the people have to disguise them
from a primarily American public opinion
that's the important thing
and that'll become harder and harder the
Labour Party realized that they're much
more attuned to American public opinion
and the need to propagandize effectively
than the Likud is and for that reason
they wanted to exclude the areas of
heavy population concentration and to
essentially leave them to their own
devices that's why they had the
elections so what is bagans solution
you're saying why they had egg Bagan
wants to invade 2nx and then what
happens to the population well you know
it's not clear no you know promoter
statement that I just quoted the
statement of this Israeli military
historian is rather close to shore on
that Sharron intends to simply drive
them out that certainly is a position
which is well represented in the
population polls indicate that but the
government has been very careful never
to express itself in those terms this is
the first time I've ever seen it stated
boldly on the part of anyone
close to the government and the
parameters not part of the government
he's a military historian but he does
reflect the opinions in the it is not
his opinions and he's critical of it but
he was willing to state it no that's the
logic of it the logic of the annexation
program is expulsion now I don't know if
Israel will be willing to but I think
that probably that could only be not in
the context of a military conflict so
for example let's say I mean it I think
it's not unlikely that Israel will
invade Lebanon soon there they've been
trying to provoke a PLO action that
would lead to invasion for months and
sooner or later they'll do it in the
content that could lead to a more
general regional war and in that context
it could be quite possible to expel the
population we're talking about basically
going through Palestinian cities on the
West Bank and using weapons and threats
to force people across the Jordan River
you know in the in the context of a war
all sorts of things can be done I mean
there can be there will be atrocities
not necessarily programmed atrocities
they just happen you know they'll be
active resistance they'll be repression
of resistance and in any in that context
there tends to be population flight I
mean you can you know you can take apart
all the details and they're different
from sometimes it's outright expulsion
sometimes it's people fleeing and fear
you know sometimes they're fleeing
because they think maybe they'll get
back and doing better all sorts of
reasons but in both 1948-49 and in 1967
there was a very substantial departure
of the population part of it expulsion
part of it flight in fact after the 1967
war well as certainly as late as
November of that year according to the
UN commander in Norwegian on Bull Ezra
was still expected literally expelling
Palestinians across the river but the
point is in the complex conditions of
actual war a departure to put it in the
most neutral terms a departure of the
population or a large part of it is not
at all unlikely
in the past and it could happen again
short of that it's extremely hard to in
fact there are plans the general yariv
who's formerly forget exactly what but
associated intelligent announced in
Israel a couple of years ago that there
were explicit plans for expulsion of the
population in the event of war and these
remarks attributed this position
attributed the shower on the other day
is a much stronger statement of that but
it's hard to I mean you have to be
pretty naive to doubt that that's you
know in the background of thinking and I
don't really see any other solution
within the within the bay and framework
unless they're willing to go towards
basically South Africa you know simply
open and blatant denial of rights to
well what will soon be a majority of the
population again that was MIT professor
Noam Chomsky speaking in April of 1982
just days before the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon to KP a phase Philip Madhuri
