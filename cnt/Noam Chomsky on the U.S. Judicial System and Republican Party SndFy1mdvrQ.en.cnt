um there's been a lot of talk in the
presidential debates regarding the
Supreme Court how it could be reformed
what is your take on that what are some
ways that the Supreme Court could be
reformed and and you know I guess what's
a what's a would it be a better judicial
system well it really comes down to
what's happening in the country the
court sort of reflects that one of the
McCollum's main policies smart policy
has been to pack the judiciary
I mean you recall of course they he
managed to block the consideration even
the consideration of the garland
appointment to ensure that the be a very
reactionary Supreme Court judge but at
the lower level they're just flooding
that they had blocked Obama's
appointments for a long time now they're
flooding them with far-right young
mostly young the judges of the lower
courts that's gonna have an effect for a
generation even after these guys are
won't go on so it's not just a matter of
reforming the Supreme Court the whole
judicial system is being very
consciously driven to the right former
president didn't do that they picked you
know they think judges who were kind of
on their side but not extreme when they
allowed a certain mix these guys are
fighting for survival for them it's the
under Republicans understand very well
they're a permanent minority party and
they have to therefore pull out every
stop to try to maintain their total
subservience to will corporate power you
can see it in the hearings not a single
health Republican as we like to break
with drone I mean you know you might not
agree with the
indictment but you gotta recognize
there's something there not a single one
says a word that totally bought
subservient to the far-right no
principles do you can't be a Republican
and have the slightest bit of principle
but this is on the issue after issue
that exceed climate change the central
issue you go back a decade the
Republicans were considering legislation
to deal somehow with global warming John
McCain ran for president in 2008 he had
a global warming provision and his
platform do something about a
cantankerous was the same Koch brothers
got wind of this launched a huge
campaign to buy off the Senate
intimidate them lobbying and so on they
switched whole party switched at a
hundred percent now you can't be a
Republican and see global warming
matters I mean though it's just total
lack of principle I don't think there's
been anything like this and uh maybe
during the the Democrats when they were
a slave for tea but then at least they
had convictions they really believed in
slavery these guys don't they just
believe in their own survival and it was
pretty unusual so you know to overcome
this will take really large-scale
popular mobilization
