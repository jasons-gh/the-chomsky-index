then Ellsberg describes his remarkable
new book which is essential reading as a
chronicle of human madness and the
record that's reviewed easily lives up
to the title and raises serious
questions about whether the human
species is an evolutionary error an
objective and informed observer might
conclude that since World War two the
species has been dedicated to
establishing the thesis that humans are
simply a mistake that actually should
have occurred to everyone with eyes open
on August 6 1945 day that I remember all
too vividly both the horrifying news and
the casual reaction to it actually it
resonated when I read recently William
Perry's comment that he's doubly
terrified both by the extreme and
mounting dangers and by the lack of
concern over the threat of terminal
destruction those awful events of August
6th taught us that human intelligence in
its glory had devised means of
destruction that would ensure leave soon
escalate to the point where a mass
suicide would be imminent and that's
indeed what has ensued those familiar
with the record will be aware that it's
a near miracle that we've survived this
far and such miracles cannot be expected
to persist it's all too easy to list
flash points around the world
no that might right now tomorrow
explode to terminal conflagration and
it's useful to remember that when the
Doomsday Clock was first set back in
1947 it was seven minutes to midnight
which seems like halcyon days today from
our perspective well in 1945 we did not
yet know that the nuclear age the onset
of the nuclear age that coincided with
the onset of a new geological epoch
so-called Anthropocene in which humans
are laboring and not only to destroy
organized human life but many other
species too because of the accompanying
sixth extension that proceeds along with
the Anthropocene proceeds on its lethal
course well there have been debates
about the onset of the Anthropocene but
last year the world geological
organization settled on the aunts on the
end of the the beginning of the post-war
era because of the sharp escalation in
environmental destruction that has taken
place since that time and when the
Doomsday Clock was moved to two minutes
to midnight last January the
accompanying statement opened by quote
morning of the failure to respond
effectively to the looming threats of
nuclear war and climate change making
the world security situation more
dangerous than it was a year ago and as
dangerous that has been since world war
ii which i think is an understatement
our prime concern here is on the first
of these threats the nuclear age but
it's hard to avoid mention of the
utterly astonishing fact that the most
powerful state in human history with
unparalleled advantages is not only
refusing to join the rest of the world
in making at least some effort to deal
with the imminent and quite devastating
threat of global warming but worse yet
is devoting its energies to accelerating
the races to destruction and all for the
exalted purpose of stuffing a few more
dollars into overstuffed pockets before
we say goodbye to the hopes for survival
and also it's hard to mention the no
less astonishing fact that so little
notices taken of this amazing spectacle
it's hard to find you can't find the
historical president for it and what it
all tells us about our society and our
culture and again that's doubly
terrifying but let's keep the nuclear
threat now there will be little
disagreement here I'm sure on the
compelling need to eliminate to rid the
earth of the scourge of nuclear weapons
and others today will surely discuss the
many ways to approach this goal but I'd
therefore like to say a few words about
a different topic different though
clearly related one which I don't think
receives the attention that it deserves
and we might approach the topic that I
have in mind by formulating a simple
question it's worth some reflection what
would happen if political leaders
decided to obey the supreme law of the
land just our own laws
in particular to obey the United Nations
Charter treaty made by the United States
in the words of the Constitution Article
six thus part of the supreme law of the
land that supreme law of the land
obligates us to resort to peaceful means
in the event of international disputes
and to refrain from the threat my stress
threat or use of force and international
affairs that's an obligation under the
Constitution and you might ask yourself
when that legal obligation was last
observed by the President or any other
high officials and we might you know the
answer to that and we might also reflect
on what that means well
adherence to the supreme law of the land
in the past would have spared us many
tragedies as well as some very near
super tragedies one crucial case
instantly comes to mind should not be
forgotten adherence to the supreme law
of the land would have saved us from
what arthur schlesinger rightly called
the most dangerous moment in history
Schlesinger's term for the Cuban Missile
Crisis in 1962 the frightening story
should be familiar I won't review it
except to mention that washington's
kennedy's terrorist war against cuba
which of course was a serious violation
of the u.s. constitution it was a
significant factor in inducing
Khrushchev to undertake the reckless act
of placing missiles in Cuba as
scholarship no fully recognizes Dan Dan
Ellsberg
who followed the events closely from a
privileged position within the
government at that time he now concludes
that the terrorist war was probably the
prime factor and four shifts decision
the facts about that are not as
well-known as they should be but you
should recall that Kennedy's official
plan for the terrorist war was
formulated in national security
memorandum 181 September 1962 and I'll
quote it the plan was to engineer an
internal revolt in October that would be
followed by US military intervention
that was a month before the Missile
Crisis and in fact terror was being
escalated at that point in preparation
and it was a very serious matter the
record reveals that quite clearly and
more than enough was surely known to
Russia and China at Cuba and Russia well
in brief respect for the US Constitution
would very likely have averted the most
dangerous moment in history and it was
no small matter those of you familiar
with it know that we escaped by a near
miracle and it's much too little
understood well legality aside now there
are some other reasons that other
questions that might be raised about a
murderous and destructive terrorist war
or so one might assume but mistakenly
there's a review of released government
documents on the terrorist war by
Harvard Latin America scholar Jorge
domain yes and he writes that only once
in these nearly thousand pages
documentation that a US official raised
something that resembled a faint moral
objection to US government sponsored
terrorism a member of the National
Security Council staff suggested that
the terrorist raids are haphazard and
kill innocents which might mean a bad
press in friendly countries that's it so
perhaps it's not a good idea that's it
in a thousand pages of documentation the
terrorist war is a crime if not the
prime example of that of the fact that
engendered the crisis and incidentally
for those of you who've read the XCOM
transcripts fueled the detailed
transcripts of the deliberations about
the crisis it is literally not mentioned
once not just doesn't matter it's our
right our right to conduct terrorist
wars which lead to virtual destruction
and there's no need to even think about
it
very few people even know about it well
respect for elementary moral values as
well as respect for law would have
spared the world very likely would have
spared the world this close brush with
terminal disaster it's not the first
time it's not the last time up till the
moment and the same guiding principles
that is simply observing the law offer
promising ways to deal with the crises
that led to quote the Doomsday Clock
announcement again led to a world
security situation as dangerous that has
been since World Wide World War two
that's the latest setting of the
Doomsday Clock as close as it's come to
disaster since 1953 when also two
minutes to midnight when the United
States and later the Soviet Union
exploded thermonuclear weapons so let's
take a look at the examples the that are
mentioned the cases that are mentioned
in the current Doomsday Clock statement
well the first one is North Korea so has
there been a diplomatic path in the case
of the North Korea situation now there
is one possibility it's been advanced by
China for some years support of Russia
intermittent support from North Korea
that's a double freeze
North Korea would freeze its development
of nuclear weapons and missiles the
United States in response would cease
its military actions threatening
military actions on the borders that
includes menacing flights by nuclear
capable bombers the most advanced u.s.
bombers and that's not a laughing matter
in a country that was flattened by u.s.
bombs
merciless u.s. bombing in Easy memory
and in fact when there was nothing left
to destroy because all the targets were
done the US Air Force simply have
destroyed the dams zoltan comments about
it in the official documents the Air
Force quarterly this was if anybody
cares a crime for which Nazi war
criminals were hanged at Nuremberg well
a double freeze it would have opened the
way to further negotiations the might
have gone as far as what has it been
what was achieved in 2005 that's worth
bearing in mind what that was because
the press has been seriously distorting
what happened in 2005 was that under
international pressure President Bush
agreed to enter into the six power
negotiations and there was success
substantial success all quote North
Korea agreed I'm now quoting the
agreement North Korea agreed to abandon
all nuclear weapons and existing weapons
programs and allow international
inspections so let me repeat that
because there are constant lies about it
every time you open the newspaper North
Korea agreed to abandon all nuclear
weapons and existing weapons programs
and allow international inspections the
in return the United States was to
provide a light water reactor for
medical use issue a non-aggression
pledge and join an agreement that the
two sides on quoting would respect each
other's sovereignty exist peacefully
together and take steps to normalize
relations that was 2005 so what happened
instantly within days the Bush
administration tore the agreement to
shreds it renewed the threat of force
it froze North Korean funds and foreign
banks and it disbanded the consortium
that was to provide North Korea with a
light water reactor the Bruce Cummings
the leading career scholars you know
writes that the sanctions were
specifically designed to destroy the
September pledges and to head off the
accommodation between Washington and
Pyongyang
that's 2005 the I won't review the press
common press coverage of this but open
the newspaper and you'll see it says
exactly the opposite
the path could have been pursued for
several years and now as we know there
are even better options so a couple of
weeks ago on April 27th North and South
Korea launched signed a historic
document on the JEM declaration for
peace prosperity unification of the
Korean Peninsula and the words of the
document are worth reading closely and
carefully in the declaration I'm quoting
it now the two Koreas affirmed the
principle of determining the destiny of
the Korean nation on their own accord on
their own accord there's a very
important words they went on to call for
to completely cease all hostile acts
against each other in every domain to
actively cooperate to establish a
permanent and solid peace regime on the
Korean Peninsula to carry out this
armament in a phased manner in order to
achieve the common goal of realizing
through complete denuclearization a
nuclear-free Korean Peninsula to
strengthen the positive momentum towards
continuous advancement of inter-korean
relations as well as the peace
prosperity and unification of the Korean
Peninsula and they further agreed to
actively seek the support and
cooperation of the international
community which means the United States
for the denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula and furthermore as Korea
specialists from in Moon reviews in a
current issue of foreign affairs journal
Foreign Affairs of the two Koreas did
not just make high-level commitments on
quoting him they also laid out specific
timetables for implementing them and
took concrete steps that will have
immediate effect
it's in facilitating cooperation and
preventing conflict which is as he
points out something new and significant
there have been agreements before but
never with this specificity and again
it's important to read the words of the
Declaration carefully their import is
very clear the United States should back
off and allow the two Koreas to achieve
peace disarmament unification and
complete denuclearization we should
accept the call for support and
cooperation of this with this endeavor
on the part of the Korean nation it's
two parts to determine their destiny on
their own accord crucial words of the
Declaration so to put it more simply the
declaration as a white letter or saying
dear mr. Trump declare victory if you
want to bounce around and public but
please just go away and let us move
towards peace denuclearization and
disarmament and the plea would hardly be
more clear it's very far from the
interpretation here and that's worth
paying attention to as well so the
general reaction here was lucidly
articulated by Mark Lander foreign
policy specialist in The New York Times
and he explained that the declaration
complicates Washington's strategy
quoting him mr. Trump will find it hard
threatened military action against the
country that's extending an olive branch
that's true it's pretty hard to threaten
military action which incidentally is a
criminal act remember the threat of
force is a criminal act it's hard to do
that when the target is extending an
olive branch
so we really have some problems it's
clearly that it's very clear that
peaceful means are available to mitigate
one of the most serious of the threats
that's bringing the world as close to
terminal disaster as it's been since
World War two since the onset of the
nuclear age and citizen efforts can be
significant maybe even decisive in
realizing the prospects for peace in
Northeast Asia that now are indeed
before us and realizing the efforts to
ensure that Washington does not once
again undermine the prospects for peace
in Northeast Asia and I stress once
again since it is not the first time
it's also worth noting that US analysts
have been very clear and quite frank
about the real nature of the North
Korean threat
so here's foreign affairs commentator
max Fisher in The New York Times he
writes that North Korea has achieved
what no country has since China
developed its own program a half-century
ago
a nuclear deterrent against the United
States they've achieved that and Trump's
threats and sanctions he says have not
succeeded to reverse or stall these
gains so clearly we must do something to
prevent anyone from deterring our resort
to force and violence that's a
fundamental principle of u.s. foreign
policy well let's turn to Iran which
poses a similar problem similar to North
Korea among specialists across the
spectrum political spectrum they find
very few who would disagree with the
conclusion of the respect
properly conservative International
Institute of Strategic Studies this is
2010 when there was still some thought
that maybe Iran is developing nuclear
weapons
they concluded that Iran's nuclear
program and the willingness to keep open
the possibility of developing nuclear
weapons is a central part of its
deterrent strategy US intelligence
concurs they were reporting to Congress
regularly that the Iranian threat is
part of their deterrent strategy and
again it's intolerable to the two rogue
states that rampage in the region that
anyone should have a deterrent well
there's much talk about Iran's possible
violations of the jcpoa the joint
program the Iran deal even though the
International Atomic Energy Agency
concurrence of us intelligence has
repeatedly given around a clean bill of
health
there however is virtually no talk about
the fact that the US has been violating
the agreement from the very beginning
and is continuing to do so so the u.s.
if you read the agreement it says the
u.s. the US has in fact been repeatedly
seeking to block Iran's reintegration
into the global economy particularly the
global financial systems controlled
right here in New York and to undermine
I'm quoting the agreement to undermine
the normalization of trade and economic
relations with Iran all of that is in
violation of the agreement strict
violation it's ignored on the prevailing
tacit assumption that the indispensable
nation stands above the law will
Trump's decision couple days ago to
effectively withdraw from the agreement
was not surprising it was of course
anticipated and contrary to what's all
often said Trump is actually highly
predictable he's constantly described as
unpredictable but that's simply untrue
in fact that you can predict with close
precision exactly what he's going to do
simply by recognizing the guiding
principle which is quite simple the
guiding principle is me me me
exclamation mark and there's a corollary
the namely if anything was done by the
black demon maybe Antichrist who
preceded then you do the opposite just
think through the policy decisions of
the last couple of years and predicts it
with virtual precision so the and it
just doesn't matter what the
consequences are that's kind of
irrelevant they're just like on
destroying the climate it's somebody
else's business and in this case the
consequences it might be we don't know
to induce Iranian hardliners to return
to nuclear programs which they had
abandoned that could provide an opening
for John Bolton Netanyahu the rest of
them to realize their openly stated
goals of direct aggression with
consequences that range from awful to
horrendous well are there peaceful
options and in this case the question
simply doesn't even arise the US could
rejoin the world could permit the jcpoa
to function effectively as it's been
doing and perhaps the u.s. might even
refrain from regular and constant
violations of the agreement all of thats
possibility but actually we can do a lot
better than that
now this one point on which I agree with
president Trump he's constantly talking
about ways to improve the agreement and
there are ways very interesting ways and
the most obvious and constructive ones
for some odd reason or never mentioned
so let me mention them the agreement
could be extended to a stet to moving
towards establishing a nuclear weapons
free zone in the Middle East the spread
of such zones around the world is
valuable in itself for mitigating
threats but it also has symbolic
significance of no slight importance and
simply as an expression of the global
determination to rid the world of these
monstrous devices and in the troubled
Middle East region it would be of
particular importance just come back to
that in a moment but as an aside and we
might bear in mind that in other regions
such positive steps to reduce the threat
of nuclear weapons have been attempted
but they've been impeded and by the
refusal of one country to permit the
zones to go into effect so there's an
Africa and nuclear weapons-free zone but
it can't go into effect it's held back
by Washington's development of nuclear
facilities in Diego Garcia just
regularly used for bombing Central Asia
it's particularly true under Obama who
rapidly extended it to include nuclear
submarines nuclear pre positioning the
pastaza Pacific nuclear
free war zone nuclear weapons-free zone
that can't go into effect because of us
insistence US military bases they're
accommodate nuclear weapons so that's
more work for us to do make it public do
something about it well coming back to
the Middle East serious steps towards a
nuclear weapons free zone would undercut
any imaginable threat that Iran is
alleged to pose and there's no need to
obtain Iran's acquiescence
they have been vociferous Lee calling
for it for years particularly as the
spokesperson for the g77 the former
non-aligned countries which are strongly
calling for this for years and what
about the Arab states absolutely no
problem they're the ones who initiated
the proposal starting with Egypt about
twenty years ago so they're strongly in
favor was overwhelming international
support so why doesn't it happen well
actually as a matter does come up every
five years in the NPT review sessions
and there's one problem the United
States feet doesn't that's why it
doesn't happen last one was Obama in
nineteen twenty fifteen and the reason
is perfectly obvious to everyone don't
even have to bother stating and Israel's
nuclear weapons systems must not be
subject even to inspection let alone
steps towards dismantling there's
various reasons given for this but
they're below even
discussion that not even worth
mentioning we understand the reasons and
so I understand we cannot improve the
jcpoa in the obvious manner it's
important to add to this that the United
States along with the United Kingdom
have a special responsibility to work to
establish a Middle East nuclear
weapons-free zone they're committed to
this goal these two countries
specifically are committed to this goal
by a important Security Council
resolution 687 article 14 if you want to
look it up it commits the those who
initiated and voted for the resolution
US and Britain to a stop move to
establish a nuclear weapons free zone
and that commitment takes on even
greater force because it's this
resolution to which the US and Britain
appealed when they were seeking
desperately to find some shred of a
legal pretext for invading Iraq well
it's another example that illustrates
the value of observing the supreme law
of the land and even of referring to it
you might find and see if you can find
anyone even discussing these facts well
I won't go on but case by case if you
run through the record you'll find that
serious investigation it does reveal the
wisdom of the principles of the Charter
and actually the principles of the
founders who created the constitutional
obligation to abide by valid treaties
well it could be argued and indeed often
is argued that law including
international law is a living instrument
and it's substance changes depending on
prevailing practice which would of
course include the practices of the
global hegemonic power and we need not
tarry on the conclusions that would
follow from this line of reasoning but
concerned citizens should not tolerate
these conclusions and it's unnecessary
to stress that a great deal is at stake
in reversing them reaching as far as
safeguarding the future of humanity
