no one just like came from a survey John
and about their research on the Shiite
Muslim and Christian relationship and I
was very surprised to see over there
there are mosques people Sunni and
Shiite they are playing together which
we see they're worried peace for
centuries ready and but pray together in
fact there are some places there they
have if you look at this picture they
have basically altars three authors in
the same mosques and churches there is a
kind of tolerance cultural tolerance the
question would be about two issues one
is the sunni-shiite conflict in the past
it was very bloody but for centuries in
many countries they had in UTS living
together and also the United States
interesting the area once ability but it
seems that there is more right now it
seems to me that there's provocation
trying to kind of let it drop of this
conflict to maybe I don't know for
certain but whether there is a
contradiction between the policies
strategy in the Middle East when you say
the u.s. 6th ability you have to
understand the technical meaning of the
words
ability stability stability means
following us workers so and so for
example of take an illustration one
leading far affairs specialist James J
smaller editor the journal foreign
affairs and liberal analyst that once
wrote that regretfully that it was
necessary to destabilize chile by
overthrowing the parliamentary regime
installing a vicious dictatorship in
order to bring about stability so you
have to stabilize the country in the aim
of stability it's not a contradiction if
you understand the technical meaning in
order to ensure that the society follows
us orders who was necessary overthrow
the government and elected government
slowly parachute when the US invades
Iraq the goal is to establish stability
by destroying the society and in fact
inflaming the shia-sunni conflict which
was not there before it was very much
like what you described in her marriage
living together and so on now it's a
bitter brutal conflict just this morning
with pressing else another fifty people
killed yesterday and it spread
throughout the region inflamed by the
invasion but that's nest that's bringing
about bill the phone and effort bring
about obedience to the united states
that when iran in contrast isn't accused
of destabilizing its neighbors if iraq
and afghanistan how by trying to extend
its cultural
mercial influence that's destabilizing
because it draws them out of the US
orbit so there's no contradiction when
you understand the religion the state
religion that governs the way these
things are discussed and what about the
conflict in Syria and then became began
is it an effort to extend extend what
was happening in these of Arab Spring
efforts by Democratic performers to gain
some is a pretty harsh brutal
dictatorship to gain some livid
democratic and human rights the Assad
regime reacted with extreme violence and
brutality the dynamics finally led to an
armed conflict the witch has been moving
towards if she has any conflict it's
part of what the US the fires that the
US live in Iraq are held burning
throughout the region in the background
is a conflict between Iran and the oil
dictatorship of the Gulf region extreme
Islamic fundamentalists and Saudi
Arabians of the Gulf states are in the
dictators are in conflict with the
ranging for influence and that's turned
into a kind of it's an issue
as well none of these as you mentioned
these things go back centuries there's
always something zimmer and if you take
a complex social situation and you hit
it with a sledgehammer a lot of awful
things can happen and in fact that's
what the invasion of Iraq did I'm
serious case in point it's become a
semi-sheer partly also Kurdish so
Assyria is in the process of moving
that's moving to his kind of suicide the
part of it will probably be partitioned
tripartite partition with the Kurdish
area is drifting towards an Iraqi
Kurdistan maybe I'll assimilating to
them the rest divided between a
government-run most Alawite kind of
initiative region and the Sunni regions
were divided of dictatorship and do you
see any kind of future what kind of any
progress without a new issue right now
the grossest looks extremely grim Iran
Iraq has been torn shreds by the
invasions recover in words
anyway the serious heading toward
suicide the conflict is indeed spreading
over the region and very dangerous it's
kind of interesting to see the way
American commentators discuss it so for
example David Brooks New York Times
conservative intellectual commentator he
had a column recently to which he
pointed out accurately that we're all
concerned about the bloodshed and
massacres in Syria but we should
understand that in the background is a
raging growing sunni-shia split
throughout the region and then he added
something he said this is the result of
this is an indication of the failure of
the US policy of withdrawing from the
region and removing our moderating
influence well that he's are reflecting
the state religion the state religion is
that what we do is banai so if we
destroy another country that's helpful
our moderating influences what set off
the conflict that person not entirely
and other factors that that was what
stimulated the horrors that are
happening but you can't see that if
you're a dedicated believer in the state
religion which is a kind of fanaticism
there's a fanatic belief in the purity
of American motives that's what's called
American exceptionalism we have to
believe in that matter what the facts
are and it's not unique to the United
States was also proved if they're
terminate you fast and Lauren once a day
the sense of yours
magnificent that doesn't is not affected
by date by fact it really is a
fundamentalist religion secular
fundamentalist religion thank you very
much that said and wonderful I really
appreciated
