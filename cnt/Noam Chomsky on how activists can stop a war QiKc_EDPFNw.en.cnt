preventing works really hard because the
timing is very short than the eye can
make it costly which is important I mean
even if it doesn't stopped it's
important for the word to be costly
because to try maybe stopped an
excellent you know as compared with the
Vietnam War movements just in comprehend
now I mean people talk about the Vietnam
War movement but they forget or don't
know what it actually was like I mean
the the war in Vietnam started in 1962
publicly you know I was the public
attack on South Vietnam Air Force you
know chemical warfare from concentration
camps old business no protest now
practice didn't build up for years for
five years and the protests that did
build up four or five years later was
mostly about the bombing of the north
which was a sight it was you know
terrible beside you the main attack was
against South Vietnam and there's never
any serious protest against them this
time there's protest before the word and
got started I don't I don't think I've
been asking people to reminding of
something but I can't think of an
example in the entire history of Europe
including the United States when there
was ever protest before the war of any
substantial level you know people have
pointed out those little protests before
Suez but yeah nothing a small war here
you got massive protest before were even
started out and it's it's a tremendous
you know the kind of its tribute to the
changes in popular culture that have
taken place in the Western countries in
the last 30 or 40 years it's just novel
actually the same was true in the 80s
I'm the Solidarity movements in the
1980s we were totally new in the
entire history of European imperialism
these were coming from Middle America
you know church groups and the Midwest
and stuff like that and there were tens
of thousands of people who would went to
live with the victims to help them and
to try to protect them and a lot of them
are still there you know witnesses for
peace and group like that now they're
all over the world you know they're in
occupied territories and so on that's
never happened before and the whole
history of European imperialism or the
Vietnam War say or anything nobody ever
dreamed is going to live with the
victims some kind of thing he did you
test it in the streets of the North or
something if you did anything I mean
that's completely new you know and very
important didn't get any coverage but
that's because it wasn't in a leak
sectors like it wasn't students and rich
universities it was people from rural
churches and stuff like that actually a
lot of them evangelical Christians know
so it's just not a right-left issue
witnesses for peace which is probably
most important comes from evangelical
Christian circles same guys who produce
Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell and so
it's a kind of a United States a funny
country has no politics just right or
left or anything like that but this was
just the effects of the change in
popular consciousness be found in
Britain for probably majority people
against the war coming opinion polls and
you do the same thing here thinks that
I'm Essenes gonna attack you in West the
shows but and I was wondering what he
thought about that in a way they need
the doves you know that we respect your
idea your view that you're against the
walnuts respect and so on as soon as use
a break out of quite narrow like a March
every six months maybe if you break out
of that and actually
you anything you guys I'm relevant brain
a seaside town they're teenagers wood
paper speed and bound for just sitting
down in a street and that's going to be
on the peel know what you think that
there's a bit of a taking and what do
you think those ovations more protest
there is more tightening there's going
to be that's routine I mean when the
vietnam war protest really began to
build up so the repression COINTELPRO
which isn't much study does was far more
serious than Watergate and comparably
worse and it was that was going on
before but it built up after by that
time you know I always said very close
to the long jail sentence myself just
stop by the Tet Offensive they called
off the trials after the Tet Offensive
the establishment turned against the war
and they called off the trial so we're
going but and you know right now I mean
a lot of people could end up in
Guantanamo only if there's real practice
and people are aware of it but you know
these are all the question and all of
these things is how much popular
resistances are going to be if there's a
lot pardon what you mean like anything
from you know writing a letter to your
representative to you know or organizing
resistance among soldiers whatever if
there's protest in the country there's
going to be refreshing okay it's like
flicks kind of get away with it depends
a lot on the reaction i mean take say
the United States and the early 50s not
other what there was what was called
repression McCarthyism but the only
reason it succeeded is because there's
no resistance to it when they tried the
same thing in the sixties it instantly
collapsed because people simply left on
it and it they couldn't do it into these
countries I mean even a dictatorship
can't do anything at once no sky have
some degree of popular complacent and in
a more democratic country they're very
very fragile power system
if there's sufficient to resistance and
opposition they can't do it
