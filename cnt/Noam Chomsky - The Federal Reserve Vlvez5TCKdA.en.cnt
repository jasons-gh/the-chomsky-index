frankly I there's a lot of feeling about
that
but I really think it's misguided I
don't think the problem is printing fiat
currency that's I mean just in a my I
mean if you eliminate capitalism you
know okay then there are other options
but in a but but that's but that's not
on the agenda we have a state capitalist
economy you know maybe in the long term
it can be burnt away maybe ever thrown I
hope so but the issue now is how do you
function in a sensible state capitalist
economy and you cannot do that without a
central bank that controls currency in
fact if it wasn't for the Federal
Reserve's ability to print money we'd be
in a deep depression right now the worst
depression than the 1930s and what's you
know since the sensible thing isn't
being done for political reasons the
sensible thing would be creating demand
by government investment but for reasons
that we can go into that's not being
done in our state capitalist economy the
only alternative is the one that
Bernanke is used and if it wasn't for
their option we would be in a deep
depression now what's the debt debt
ceiling issue well that's first of all
it should be recognized that the debt is
not a serious problem
certainly the deficit is not a serious
problem um there are long-term problems
about the debt that they are so remote
they don't bear on policy as far as the
deaf it is concerned deficit is
concerned remember that's not the same
as a debt as Clinton left office it's
not that long ago we had a surplus no
deficit and it's not a deep structural
problem the current deficit as the
result of bush's tax cut the crazy wars
the virtually criminal behavior of the
corporate system that led
the financial the housing crisis finally
financial crisis all of that has
increased the deficit but not out of
sight the deficit is chrysalis declining
and it's it would be overcome by actual
growth I mean the the government
economic offices Bureau the budget and
so on they calculate that there's about
a trillion dollars of unused capacity I
mean the real problem of the economy is
not the debt and the deficit it's the
fact that the economy is so kind of
grotesque that you have tens of millions
of people wanting to work and not able
to you have huge financial resources
corporate the corporations that you
don't know what to do with their money
huge profits huge bank profits there's
an enormous amount that has to be done
just walk around any city you can think
of a million things that have to be done
and all kind of you know just the
numerator at will so a huge number of
idle hands enormous resources tremendous
amount of work that has to be done and
the economy is so dysfunctional it can't
put them together that's the problem and
it's destroying a generation of young
people it's harming severely harming the
economy under current circumstances the
way out is pretty well known it's to
stimulate the economy through government
demand since corporations aren't doing
it and to devalue the dollar so that we
import less and export more these are
methods that are technically feasible
but not politically feasible and I think
we have to ask about that
