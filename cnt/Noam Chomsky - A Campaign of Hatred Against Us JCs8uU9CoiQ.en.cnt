very popular phrase now Samuel
Huntington's clash of civilizations
writers like Bernard Lewis say what went
wrong that in fact there might be a
clash of civilizations between an
Islamic culture and a Western
judeo-christian culture they resent us
there's enormous amounts of hatred that
goes back in history but because of
resentment you want to know the answer
to the question which they Bernhard
Lewis certainly knows it he's not
telling you Bertha was not telling you
what happened in the 19th century he
didn't talk about what Lord Palmerston
and the British did the Egypt for
example but let's be more recent yes
there's hatred against us why it's easy
to find out the u.s. is a very free
country we have enormous internal
Declassified records so let's look at
them in 1958 the US government faced we
know from internal records three major
crises in the world North Africa Middle
East and Indonesia all with
oil-producing States all Islamic states
President Eisenhower in internal
discussion observed to his staff that
I'm quoting it now there's a campaign of
hatred against us in the Middle East not
by governments but by the people the
National Security Council discussed that
question and said yes and the reason is
there's a perception in that region that
the United States supports status quo
governments which prevent democracy and
development and that we do it because of
our interest in Near East oil
furthermore it's difficult to counter
that perception because it's correct and
furthermore it ought to be correct we
ought to be supporting brutal and
corrupt governments which prevent
democracy and development because we
want to control Middle East oil and it's
true that leads to a campaign of hatred
against us now until Bernard Lewis tells
us that and that's only one piece of a
long story we know that he's just
evolved for propagandists not a scholar
so yes as long as we are supporting
harsh brutal governments blocking
democracy and development because they
are interested in controlling the oil
resources of the region there will be a
campaign of hate
