thank you well let me begin with a few
words about the choice of topics
actually that list over there is quite a
good choice and I'll pick a few of them
it's no it's no great insight that we
live in a world of conflict and
confrontation and that one crucial
element of it is class war class war has
lots of dimensions and complexities but
in recent years the lines have been
drawn very sharply to oversimplify but
really not too much on the one side
there are concentrate concentrated power
centers state and private very closely
linked on the other side is much of the
population worldwide and the one you
can't estimate with any precision I
think it's fair to guess a large
majority of the world population that's
in any way involved and able to become
involved in issues of broad significance
which requires a degree of privilege of
worse concentrated power they pursue
their war relentlessly they never stop
they use every opportunity to press
their agenda forward in the harshest
possible way in particularly used crises
so an earthquake or a war or September
11th and its aftermath and in such
circumstances you can expect and you
discover that they will exploit the
atmosphere of fear and anguish and
concern and they hope that their popular
adversary will be distracted focused
attention elsewhere being frightened
while they continue to pursue their
programs
without any pause in fact increasing
them using the window of opportunity and
that's what's happening right now the
adversary should of course refuse to
accept this cynical framework it should
focus its efforts also relentlessly on
the primary issues which remain as they
were before the latest crisis the issues
include the threat of militarism which
is indeed a threat to the survival of
the species at this point and a very
far-reaching assault against democracy
and freedom which is part of the core of
the neoliberal programs of the past 2025
years
well those are the things I'd like to
talk about everything of course is open
for later discussions I don't feel
constrained by that well I though that
is what I want to talk about I can't
really bring myself to turn to those
topics without at least a word on the
immense human tragedy that is unfolding
before us right now that is being
planned and implemented very consciously
by the United States and its allies
since September 11 the High Commissioner
of Human Rights of the United Nation was
Mary Robinson as she was not
exaggerating when she pleaded with the
United States to stop the bombing and
warned that if it continued there would
be a Rwanda style slaughter in fact she
may have been underestimated according
to US estimates the number of people at
risk of starvation which was about 5
million has increased by 50% since the
bombing started that's
Nadeem people who are being put pressed
right across the border of deaths from
starvation Mary Robinson's appeal was of
course rebuffed that was also unreported
literally it received three sent
scattered sentences in the entire US
press other appeals from high UN
officials aid agencies and others we're
similar ones were not even mentioned on
September 16th is just five days after
the terrorist attacks in New York and
Washington on September 16th the u.s.
demanded of Pakistan that it terminate
food supplies to Afghanistan the country
has been on a kind of a lifeline as one
aid worker said afterwards we've just
cut the lifeline the decision on
September 16th to cut food supplies was
a decision a conscious determined
decision to starve several million
people to death there was no reaction to
that the next day just happened I was on
radio and television around Europe
mostly Europe national radio television
that no one was aware of it or could
think of a single reaction in their own
country there was no reaction in the
United States so apparently it's
considered entirely normal for Western
civilization to make a decision to kill
two and a half million people in the
next few months and that shouldn't
surprise anyone who's familiar with
history it is in fact normal which is
why there is no reaction to the silent
genocide that's underway the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization FAO already
before the bombing they had warned that
if the threat of bombing itself had
driven out the aid agencies
driven people out of the cities into the
countryside and fear and desperation and
they warned that a humanitarian
catastrophe was taking place after the
bombing began they reported further that
about 80% of the crops plantings had
been disrupted which means that what is
being planned is a even more severe
famine for next spring the bombing
itself has turned major cities into
ghost towns about 70% of the population
is fled the bombing as in other cases
Iraq Serbia the bombing is directed
against power stations of electrical
supplies water supplies sewage and so on
that's a form of biological warfare
that's exactly what it means to do that
in an urban area the population is
fleeing either they flee the borders
which are mostly closed or they most of
them flee into the countryside in the
countryside they're heading into areas
which are the most heavily mined in the
world 10 to 20 people there 10 to 20
deaths or injuries every day even in
normal times many of them children that
increases sharply now for one reason
because the United Nations has been
compelled to terminate its mine clearing
operations for another reason because
the mines are now superseded by much
more lethal weapons namely the cluster
bombs from the US bombing these are
anti-personnel weapons which they're
designed to murder of people they don't
affect tanks or buildings or anything
like that little things that somebody
will pick up the child will pick up or
Oh hit with a PO and then it exploded
some sentence flesh X the theorem shreds
and there are extremely hard to
dismantle some areas where they've been
used like northern Laos in what was then
the heaviest bombing in history and
isolated as in society it's still
littered with millions of cluster bombs
hundreds or thousands of people killed
every year
no demining efforts the manufacturer
says that twenty thirty percent of them
don't explode which can mean only one of
two things either incredibly incompetent
quality control or else a purposeful
concern to murder civilians take your
choice well all of this is happening
without essentially without comment
because in a way it is kind of normal
that's what the West has been doing to
the rest of the world for hundreds of
years but the millennium is beginning
with two monstrous atrocities the
terrible terrorist crime of September 11
and an even worse atrocity that's
following it namely purposeful conscious
program of mass murder which could have
expert any dimensions and well this is
regrettably normal business in Europe
and its offshoots its kind of remarkable
to see that a country like India which
has been subjected to this torture for
hundreds of years and you might think
would have some appreciation for what it
means is nevertheless enthusiastically
the bandwagon that's your problem
these accumulating cars they are very
directly on the question of the people's
right to information it's extremely
important to ensure that that right is
denied so what I've just said although
it's not really controversial it's
almost totally unknown in the United
States there wouldn't be a person in a
million who would be aware of this and
there's a good reason for that
if people did have the slightest idea of
what's being done in their names there's
no doubt that there would be mass
protests and the policies would have to
change the United States is a very free
country it's uniquely free I think the
most free country in the world with
regard to right information and the task
of suppression of that right is not
undertaken by the state they may try now
and then but they're pretty ineffectual
the task of depriving the population of
the right of information that is the
solemn duty of the alleged intellectuals
of the educated classes to train for
when you go to a good university end of
the Free Press it's their task to ensure
that the right to information is denied
that's why things like this remain
unknown you can't carry out mass
genocide if the population is aware of
what is what is being done and when
these controls break down you do get
strong popular reactions well we're now
living through this it's not the first
case by any means we're now living
through an illustration which is so
shocking that words fail at least my
words it's not novel we should be aware
of that it's not restricted to the
United States in Europe it goes back
through history
as does the role of the the priesthood
either religious or in modern days
secular priesthood well with these
hopelessly inadequate words on a crime
that we shouldn't be working day and
night to try to bring to a quick end
let's turn to the topics at hand perhaps
the best way to approach them is within
the framework of this fashionable notion
of globalization but before doing that
it's important to clarify what it means
and like most terms of political
discourse it has a literal meaning and
kind of a technical propagandistic
meaning in the literal sense
globalization just means international
integration here mostly economic
integration and that's neither good nor
bad you know it's a justice trade is
neither good nor bad it depends what its
human consequences are he carried out in
many different ways the that's the
general meaning the specific meaning
that's in fact use and enforced by
concentrated power the term
globalization refers to a very specific
form of international integration one
which has been implemented with
considerable intensity in the past 25
years approximately and which is
designed in the interests of private
concentrations of power the interests of
others are incidental they may gain
lose it doesn't really matter fact of
the matter is most of them lose but
that's just kind of a consequence oh
sorry
hold the people in the back can't hear
is that true can you hear me back there
yeah I know what to do about it much I
can't yell any louder well that's the
technical sense of globalization and
with that ridiculous terminology in
place the great mass of the people of
the world who object can be labelled
anti-globalization so they must be
primitive ist's who want to go back to
the Stone Age and are resisting
inevitable forces they are they want to
harm the poor and all other terms of
abuse that I'm sure you're familiar with
opponents of globalization I think make
a very great mistake if they accept this
framework of power and agree to call
themselves anti-globalization no one
sensible as opposed to international
integration least of all the left the
left has been animated by a vision of
globalization since its origins the
whole vision of the left has been
internationalism international
solidarity and cooperation localization
that's certainly since its modern
origins and there have been very
important strides in this direction many
achievements in recent years and we
should be committed to that we should be
committed to far-reaching
globalization but designed to improve
the lives and opportunities of people
the people of the world and the people
of the future generations that's
tasks that cannot be put all these
aren't empty words the possibilities for
moving forward are very real
they are illustrated in many ways the by
now annual meetings at Porto Alegre and
Brazil are a important expression of
this they bring together a very broad
pardon they bring together a very broad
international constituency Brazilian
workers the landless workers movement
north american unionists
environmentalists peasant movement
women's rights activist very wide range
of people who in the past have had
nothing much to do with one another
they went in separate paths but now
thanks to a constructive form of
globalization that we ought to try to
advance and in fact it is the
traditional vision of the left are
moving forward in ways that are
impressive but their defensive defending
themselves against attack but in part
quite constructive working on ways to
dismantle it concentrated power systems
to extend the popular control worldwide
well that's the form of globalization
that should be pursued at least by
people who want to create a world in
which a decent person would want to live
the specific form of globalization
that's being officially pursued is quite
different that's called as you know
neoliberal that's also highly misleading
it's not new and it's by no means
liberal that should be obvious in India
if it isn't more than any other place
this is the whole history of India for
the last several hundred years a classic
example of how liberalism can be
distorted into an end
the power and destruction and the
current version of neoliberalism is
similar to what destroyed India with a
combination of imposed liberalisation on
India and massive state power and
protectionism and the imperial power and
the current version adopts that
traditional double-edged doctrine of
liberalism and free trade the doctrine
is it's fine for you so that I can
demolish you but I'm going to insist on
the protection of the nanny state and
other devices to make sure that I'm
protected from the costs of market
discipline except with this one
exception when the use the usual term
when the playing field is level which
means when it's tilted so sharply in my
direction and in my favor that I'm
confident that I can win in that case Oh
favor free trade the fact that the new
versions adapt the traditional ones to
current circumstances that shouldn't be
very surprising actually it's exactly
what you expect if you look at the
designers the designers are the few
richest and most powerful states the
international financial institutions
that are follow their directives on an
array of huge corporations mega
corporations which are tending towards
oligopoly anti market principles and
most sectors of the economy and are
heavily reliant on the state on the
state sector which is very dynamic in
the rich and powerful countries like the
United States reliant on the state
sector to socialize cost socialized risk
privatized profit and to maintain the
dynamism of the economy that's the real
world economy it's quite different from
what you study in a second
flex the designers of the system
modestly call themselves the
international community but maybe a more
appropriate term is one that's used in
the and the business press major world's
major business journal London Financial
Times described them as the Masters of
the Universe that was last January when
they were meeting in Davos Switzerland
to organise the world maybe that was
intended as ironic I don't know but it's
accurate the Masters of the Universe
professed to be admirers of Adam Smith
so you might expect them to abide by his
description of their behavior although
he only called them masters of mankind
but that was before the Space Age
Smith was referring to those who he
called the principal architects of
policy in England merchants and
manufacturers as he put it
attended to their own interests
carefully and made sure that they were
satisfied no matter how Grievous the
effect on others including the people of
England but incidentally primarily India
he wrote with particular anger about the
savagery of the English in India and
Bango particularly he went he stated
that the principal architects who are
ensuring that their own interests are
attended to
very well they follow what he called the
vile Maxim of the
masters of mankind namely all for
ourselves and nothing for anyone else
that's an accurate description of the
Masters of the Universe who follow their
model not noticing that he was
denouncing not providing a model for
them in subsequent developments over
time that would have a called Adam Smith
or any other classical liberal there has
been these huge concentrations of power
which are basically tyrannies have been
assigned by the courts the rights of
persons immortal persons the courts have
proceeded to attribute the rights of
persons to corporate management that's
true in the United States and I think
elsewhere in recent agreements
mislabeled trade agreements in these
recent agreements the rights of these
private tyrannies have gone way beyond
the rights of persons so for example
General Motors can demand under World
Trade Organization rules and received
what's called national treatment in
Mexico they have to be treated as a
national company on the other hand if a
Mexican of flesh and blood tried to
obtain national treatment in New York it
wouldn't last very long he could even
make it that far
so the corporate entities the immortal
persons have rights by now far beyond
human beings their exchange kind of
person apart from their massive scale
and immortality the the recent
agreements give them even further rights
so by now it's possible and these rights
are being explored and implemented for
corporate entities to
to undermine regulatory legislation in
States United States Canada others on
the grounds that these regulations are
what is called tantamount to
expropriation that is the state the
country regulates a will to take a
recent case that was one a u.s.
corporation wanted to deliver toxic
wastes to in Mexico to store somewhere
in Mexico the people of the state in
Mexico objected they didn't want toxic
waste stored there and they turned the
area into a national part of the
corporation metal-clad
charged Mexico with actions that are
tantamount to expropriation because that
infringes on future profits of the
corporation and they want they won in a
world after hearing a judicial hearing
and the judicial hearing was correct
because the NAFTA rules do permit that
this is under a imaginative doctrine
called regulatory takings any regulation
is a taking of people's rights meaning
corporate rights because it might reduce
their future profits well those are
rights that no person of flesh and blood
can think of but they're granted to
these totalitarian institutions that
dominate the international system the
Masters of the Universe
well these this is a simply one part of
what in fact is a very dedicated assault
against popular sovereignty which means
democracy which is expected to become
more severe in the Western Hemisphere
there are now
back to this for a free trade area of
the Americas there was a summit of the
countries of the Western Hemisphere last
April and Quebec plenty of disruption
and violence and protests it was kept
secret the plans are being kept secret
nobody knows in any detail what the
plans are for the free trade area of the
Americas and it's important to ensure
that it remains secret because if it
becomes public opposition will be
overwhelming don't come back to that
interesting exercise and truck control
in a free society
well the crucial point is that the
public has to be kept unaware that's
been true all along NAFTA is now seven
North American Free Trade Agreement
seven years old to this day the press
has refused to publish the official
position of the labor movement on the
form that NAFTA should have should take
that's now 1992 almost 10 years they've
also refused to publish the analysis of
NAFTA that was given by Congress's own
research Bureau the office of Technology
Assessment which is very much like that
of the labor movement the reason is that
it was critical of the form of
international integration that was being
imposed by the Masters of the Universe
and therefore the public better not know
about it because if the public does know
about it the already you know majority
opposition to NAFTA would grow
substantially as people came to
understand that their own critic
individual criticisms were in fact well
grounded in substantial institutions and
in a very important central part of the
neoliberal reforms is to reduce the
threat of democracy in this and in other
ways
well that's very much a lot I mentioned
that the one participant in the class
war
always exploits every opportunity to
institute harsh and aggressive measures
with unrelenting intensity that's
happening right now
they're telling them they're victims
that they have to be subdued and
acquiescent out of patriotism on the
other hand patriotism does not prevent
the Masters of the Universe from using
the opportunity to say give new tax
breaks to Enron to mention a something
you've heard of her around here to
increase the military budget
substantially while nobody's looking to
even to institute what's called
fast-track legislation it's interesting
the US Trade Representative Robert julik
immediately after the September 11th
bombings announced that the best way to
combat terrorism is to implement
fast-track legislation
what is fast-track legislation well it's
legislation that turns the United States
into the Kremlin under stall it's
literally the legislation grants the
executive branch the right to negotiate
international treaties in secret with no
congressional participation and a
personal public knowledge and then
Congress is allowed to say yes
that's the degree of public
participation
so that's fast-track legislation it's
often called free trade legislation and
that's not entirely untrue you couldn't
pass legislation that's mislabeled free
trade if the public had any
participation so it has to be done
kremlin style the but out of patriotism
years of undoubtedly osama bin
I'll just be shaking in his boots if
this legislation is passed that's an
obvious attack against international
terrorism well that's the kind of thing
that it makes sense to press through
when you have a window of opportunity
and the general public can be if they
can be induced to keep quiet out of
so-called patriotism or fear or whatever
this does all of this does raise a
question it's been very obvious over the
past years that opposition to corporate
LED globalization is overwhelming across
the world that's been particularly
dramatic in South where the main
opposition develop it later spread to
the north becomes harder to ignore so
reaches Seattle he can't pretend it's
not happening
and it does raise the question why there
is such massive public opposition in the
United States and England everywhere
else it seems paradoxical because
globalization so full is we're told
every day has led to enormous prosperity
in the United States particularly it's
led to a what's called a fairytale
economy give one quote from the extreme
left of the admissable spectrum Anthony
Lewis in the New York Times writing last
March said that has created the greatest
boom in American history economic boom
in American history in fact the greatest
economic boom in world history so why
are people opposed
well it's admitted that it has some
flaws not everyone is participating in
the glorious experience and since we're
good hearted people especially the left
we have to be concerned about this and
we have to worry about these people who
lack the skills to join us in
participating in the greatest economic
boom in world history and that also
poses a dilemma why is it that this
enormous
paraty that's developing and leading to
fairytale economies is also leading to
inequality where we do about that
well that picture is so conventional
that it takes a bit of a wrench to
recognize that is entirely false in
every respect except one the one respect
that is true is its leading to great
inequality everything else is totally
false and uncontroversially false the
economic boom in the United States and
the 90s was per capita economic growth
was about same as Europe it's much less
than it was in the pre globalization
period the period before the neoliberal
reforms of the 1970s its vastly less
than it was during World War two which
was the greatest economic boom in
American history under a semi command
economy so the question is how can the
conventional picture be so different
from absolutely uncontroversial fact
well the answer is very simple and you
know it very well in India a small
sector of the society has in fact
benefited enormous Lee and that sector
happens to include the people who tell
everybody else the wonderful news and
they're not being dishonest
they can't accuse them of dishonesty
they have every reason to believe what
they're saying they can read it every
day in the journals for which they write
furthermore that's exactly what they see
around you go to an elegant restaurant
or the Faculty Club the editorial office
or wherever you hang out that's what you
see people who are enjoying a fairy tale
economy so there's no reason to doubt it
the omens only the world that's somehow
different knows about that all right
take a look at the historical record on
this economic integration globalization
of neutral sense that increased very
rapidly in the
half century or so before World War one
it levels stagnated between the two wars
then it began to pick up again after
World War two by now it's reached the
level which is more or less comparable
to about a century ago in gross measures
but only gross measures if you look at
the fine structure it's quite different
in interesting respect prior to World
War one
there was much more international
integration at the level of people that
is movement of people was much freer and
if you care about free trade may recall
that free circulation of labor is the
foundation of free trade according to
old-fashioned radicals like Adam Smith
so movement of people was cut back a lot
by state regulation on the other hand
the free flow of short very short term
speculative capital that's move risen to
astronomical levels way beyond anything
in the past and that difference reflects
the central features of contemporary
globalization it expresses the relative
value of people and capital the capital
has priority and people are incidental
notice that that's exactly the opposite
of classical economics Adam Smith and
David Ricardo they insisted that people
should be mobile and capital for the mo
everyone's heard of Adam Smith's
invisible hand how wonderful it is but
not many people have apparently read the
one passage in Wealth of Nations in
which he mentions the phrase appears
once and it appears in the course of an
argument against capital mobility he
argues that the invisible hand will
prevent this disaster from happening
somehow suppress the there's other
interesting differences I'll come back
to some of them there is also a more
technical
of globalization globalization is
measured by convergence through a single
market to single price and wage around
the world well that's exactly the
opposite of what's happened it's gone
exactly in the opposite direction led to
enormous inequality so there's a theory
on one side and there's a real world on
the other side and that's expected to
continue the US intelligence services
with I recently put out a document of
projection for the next 15 years that
means there'll be less globalization in
the technical sense but more
globalization and the doctrinally
approved since rich wealth for the rich
a financial volatility of course means
slower growth so that best scenario best
possible scenario is even slower growth
and much less globalization in the
technical sense meaning more
globalization in the sensitive life
military planners adopt exactly the same
assumptions there's now a vast expansion
of armaments going on
in the United States since September
11th that's been escalated using the
window of opportunity and there's a
reason if you look at the planning
documents past years they predict make
the same prediction they predict that
globalization is going to lead to an
increasing divide between a small number
of haves and a large number of have not
notice opposite to the economic theory
but consistent with reality and that
raises a problem that's a problem that
has the technical name enforcing
stability the stability means you do
what I tell you or else and it's hard to
enforce stability when you have a
growing mass of have-nots who are
disruptive and unpleasant do bad things
accordingly it's necessary to have a
huge expansion of the military the
United States is already far on the lead
and conventional forces and weapons of
mass destruction actually it out spends
the next 15 countries but that's not
enough it has to move to a new frontier
space hasn't been militarized yet that
requires a violation of the Outer Space
Treaty of 1967 which has been observed
that's prevented militarization of space
that the United Nations is aware of this
in fact the world is aware so the
there's been a reactor mation of the
Outer Space Treaty every year for the
last couple of years and it's passed
almost unanimously with two abstentions
the United States and Israel probably
next year India
the is equally enthusiastic about
joining the race to destruction for the
reasons you can explain to me the UN
conference on Disarmament has been
stalled all year for the same reason
they're trying to put a restriction on
the width
space us blocks it all of this is
unreported
none of this appears in the American
press for the same reason it's not wise
to allow citizens to know of plans that
put the survival of the species at risk
at serious risk escalating the arms race
to space is in fact the core program and
has been for years it's not just the
push of the militarization expanding
what's called an arms race to space
although racism the very good term for
it since the United States is racing
along for the moment though there are
others eager to join like India for
example won a lot of respect from costs
and jingoist s-- in the United States
for its enthusiasm about this which is
unique the plans to cross the last
frontier to militarization of space are
disguised as a missile defense ballistic
missile defense know anybody should
understand that when you hear the word
defense you think offense any offensive
action is always both defense and it's
pretty straight in this case the goal of
ballistic missile defense is to place
offensive weapons destructive offensive
weapons in space and the goal is very
frankly expressed it takes real
discipline for the educated classes to
keep people from knowing this it's all
in public documents read them on the
internet very frank and clear for years
the goal is the US Space Command
documents explain that the goal is to
Maine obtain global dominance hegemony
they forward and the purpose is to
protect unquote a holy supposed to
protect us interests and investments and
they give a history they say that in the
past countries constructed armies and
Nate navies to protect and enhance
commercial interests but now there
new frontier we can cross we can have
new initiatives that'll free take the
next step in protecting and enhancing
commercial investment interests namely
militarization of space now this is
known to be extremely threatening
there's no question about this because
of the predicted reaction among
potential adversaries or for that matter
because of what are called normal
accidents in the technical literature a
normal accident is the kind of accident
you know is going to take place in any
complicated system you just can't tell
women
that's called a normal accident and
what's being planned our systems of
great complexity weapons a very high
destructive power are much more than
nuclear weapons laser weapons which are
extremely destructive powered by nuclear
power which itself is extremely
dangerous in space and on a hair-trigger
alert with automated strike on warning
systems because you can't take any
chances
if anybody starts shooting down your
satellites your system is wrong so you
have automated systems of massive
destructive power which are sure to
undergo normal accidents and therefore
wipe everyone out but it's and could be
stopped nobody doubts that he could be
stopped mainly by treaty but it's just
to stop it would be inconsistent with
the prevailing value system the
prevailing value system is that hegemony
is much more important than survival and
that's not new in facts the history of
hundreds of years the change now is that
the state search are far greater
well compact the globalization the
crucial point here is that this is
motivated by the expectations for
globalization it's expected to lead to a
widening divide meaning
in the technical sense but success in
the doctrinal sense and that requires
space-based weapons of mass destruction
and targeting the growing numbers of
have-nots
that globalization is expected to
produce and severely raising the threat
to survival and it's all very rational
and within the framework of a lunatic
set of institutions it's totally
irrational
well let's return to the greatest
economic boom in American and world
history remember that this was written
before the crash before the fiscal
bubble crashed early this year so at a
time when I really look fantastic since
World War two there have been two pretty
sharply different phases in the world
economy there was a phase called the
Bretton Woods period from shortly after
the Second World War into the early
1970s and then there's the neoliberal
phase that follow that when the Bretton
Woods regulations were broken down
Bretton Woods system in the first period
was based on regulation of capital so
regulation of capital flow states to
regulate outflow of capital inflow and
currencies were fixed pretty closely to
one another and that was terminated in
the 70s well that these two periods it's
second period that's called
globalization though in fact
international integration proceeded more
quickly during the first period but
remember this is a technical sense of
globalization neoliberal globalization
these two phases are quite different
economists commonly refer to the first
phase of Bretton Woods phase as a golden
age and to the second phase the
neoliberal phase as a leaden age and in
fact if you look at standard macro
economic statistics that's exactly what
you find they all declined considerably
during the globalization period that's
true a rate of growth of
cause of the economy rate of growth of
productivity capital investment in fact
even trade trade has declined during the
globalization period the interest rates
have gone way up because countries after
it especially countries itself protect
their currencies from attack that slows
down growth the financial volatility is
increased and many other harmful
consequences
well let's return to that profound
dilemma that everyone is worried about
how what are we going to do about the
fact that we have this enormous
prosperity resulting from globalization
but it's leading to inequality well but
there's no dilemma there's nothing to
answer there's no prosperity in fact
globalization has reduced prosperity
even bystander macroeconomic measures
which are highly ideological but even by
those and it's not controversial many
economists attribute the decline in the
economy severe decline during the
globalization period to liberalisation
of capital you can debate that so little
is understood about the International
economy that the causal relations are
hard to establish but the correlation is
very clearly and down down to fine
detail in fact however there's one thing
that is clear namely financial
liberalisation does lead to an attack on
democracy that's not controversial in
fact that was the reason primary reason
why the framers of the Bretton Woods
Agreement back in the 1940s insisted on
capital controls and regulation of
currencies they understood that that
would provide some space within which
countries could pursue social democratic
policies welfare state policies without
being overwhelmed by market forces that
would prevent it it's the only way to
protect that that was well understood
and that's quite true free capital
movement creates what's sometimes called
a virtual Parliament a parliament of
investors and Lin
who have veto power over government
decisions sharply restricting Democratic
options as I'm quoting from the
technical papers in the economics
literature free capital movement creates
what's called the dual constituency
namely voters as one constituency and
investors and lenders that's the other
constituency and the investors and
lenders conduct moment by moment
referendums on government policy they
don't like a policy because it's harming
then they vie to it by withdrawing
capital from the country you're
attacking a currency and of course the
second constituency the investors and
lenders they prevail personal
constituency can't compete with them and
that's true even in the rich countries
and furthermore that's well understood
and that's one of the most striking
differences between the current phase of
globalization and the phase before World
War one let me just quote from sorry a
stance a little technical but this is
the standard history of the
international financial system by a
highly regarded American economist Barry
Eichengreen he points out that before
World War one government policy had not
yet been politicized by Universal male
suffrage and the rise of trade unions
and parliamentary Labour Party's
therefore the very severe costs of
market discipline financial rectitude
they could be imposed the costs that are
imposed by the virtual Parliament they
could be transferred in the general
population because he didn't have this
politicization notice that logic is exam
a structural adjustment in the country
impose the costs on the poor and they
can't do anything about
now that's the way it was in the west
hundred years ago but that luxury was
unavailable under the more democratic
Bretton Woods period after the Second
World War there were there was universal
male suffrage in parliamentary labor
parties and unions and furthermore the
the world population was very radical at
that time then greatly radicalized by
the war and there was an enormous
popular support including the United
States for welfare state programs and
therefore it was necessary to do
something and what I from green points
out is that limits on capital mobility
substituted for limits on democracy as a
source of insulation for market
pressures which is quite true the limits
on capital mobility allowed democracy to
function and he doesn't follow the
argument to the next step but we easily
can dismantling of the Bretton Woods
Agreement should leave and has led to a
sharp attack on substantive democracy
just as he'd expect particularly
striking in the United States and
Britain which are in the lead on this
but in fact worldwide well this attack
on democracy is a very significant
feature of the second phase
globalization phase of the post-war
world and there are other components of
the Washington Consensus have the same
consequences the basic idea of
neoliberalism is to shift decisions
associate associate economics to
unaccountable concentrations of power
that's a essential feature of the
neoliberal reforms but remember the
powerful state remains to protect the
masters they require it this extension
of the attack on democracy is being
negotiated right now in secret as always
at the GATS negotiations general
agreement on trade and services in
Geneva what is a general agreement on
trade and services well what are
services services are anything that
could be
within the public arena so education
health welfare water resources
communication anything like that that
services there's no meaningful sense in
which they're privatizing these is
trades and services that's just it's
both trade so you can put it under the
trade agreement if you privatize these
government services you can have a
perfectly functioning democracy and it
will do nothing because nothing is less
than the public arena
so privatizing services which is what
these negotiations are about essentially
eliminates from the public arena
anything that might be virtually
anything that might be subject to
popular decision-making that's called
trade and services and naturally have to
negotiate that in secret to the extent
that anything leaks out about it there's
huge public uproar actually the
importance of protecting the public from
information was revealed very
dramatically at the April summit of the
Americas every editorial office in the
country in the United States had on its
desk two major publications which were
times for release at the summit one was
by Human Rights Watch main human rights
organization in the world a second was
by the economics Policy Institute which
is a major you know economics analysis
Institute in Washington both studies
investigated in depth the effects of
NAFTA on working people in three
countries the United States Canada and
Mexico
now NAFTA was presented at the summit as
a tremendous triumph that's what George
Bush said and headlines read and it
should be a model for the free trade
area and it's very easy to see why these
both studies were totally suppressed
didn't appear anywhere it's easy to see
why the the Human Rights Watch report
presented extensive detail about how
labor rights were harmed in all three
country's all three countries the
Economic Policy Institute report studied
in detail how the conditions wages
working conditions etc of working people
were harmed in all three countries
demonstrating that this is one of those
rare trade agreements which succeeded in
harming everybody in all three countries
at least apart from the people who count
they did fine somebody tell me
lost track
keep going alright tell me if I'm going
on too long because I lost ray if you
look at the effects on Mexico they're
particularly instructive for countries
like India or for any place in the south
and there the effects of NAFTA were
particularly severe in fact Mexico began
the neoliberal reforms about 20 years
ago and wages have declined steadily
since that time that continued after
NAFTA with a twenty five percent decline
for salaried workers and a 40 percent
decline for the self-employed and that's
an underestimate because it doesn't take
account of the fact that the number of
unsalaried workers increased greatly
so the actual effects are even worse
than that this includes the maquiladoras
the foreign manufacture simply plans
foreign investment grew after NAFTA big
headlines no headline for the fact that
total investment declined so far
investment went up but domestic
investment were way down and a total of
decline and the economy was transferred
into the hands of foreign multinationals
the minimum wage lost 50% of its
purchasing power Manufacturing declined
a development stagnated reversed
meanwhile trade between the u.s. and
Mexico did increase however the
component of trade that is inter
a firm that is centrally administered by
a totalitarian system that increased
from 1/2 to 2/3 now that's called trade
by economists that's not trade in any
meaningful sense no it's not trade if
you if General Motors move something to
Mexico to the assembles and sends it
back to the United States to sell if you
discount that trade actually reduced
between Mexico and the United States
these studies actually confirm what had
been reported in the business press and
academic studies I won't go into the
details because I guess I am running out
of time but it's essentially the same
story and very familiar around the world
agriculture suffered a particularly
severe blow for the usual reasons
Mexican farmers can't compete with
highly subsidized US agribusiness with
effects that are familiar throughout the
world actually most of this had been
predicted by critics of Mastiff that
they were wrong in one respect and me
two most enemy - anticipated that there
would be a sharp increase in the
urban-rural ratio after NAFTA as
hundreds of thousands of peasants were
driven off the land that didn't happen
the urban rural ratio remained the same
the reason is that conditions
deteriorated so badly in the cities that
there was a huge flight of people both
from countryside and city to the United
States and those who survived the
crossing and do not work for very low
wages no benefits under awful conditions
the effect is to destroy lives and
commute
is in Mexico but that's not counted when
you measure effects of things and it
improves the US economy one study the
Woodrow Wilson foundation points out
that consumption in the United States is
subsidized by impoverishment of farm
workers both in the United States and
Mexico so it's a benefit for the economy
for the health of the economy well these
are among the costs of NAFTA and new
liberal corporate globalization
generally but those are costs that
professional economics chooses not to
measure and it's a choice you couldn't
measure those if you wanted to they're
called externalities but even by the
highly ideological standard measures
which dismissed these these costs have
been very severe and from what I've read
I understand the same is true in Indian
well none of this was allowed to disturb
the celebration of NAFTA and the free
trade agreement that is summit of the
Americas and in fact unless people are
connected to activist organizations they
cannot know any of this everything they
know it in their own lives you know or
in the lives of the people near them but
they can't know that this is generally
in fact one effect is to make people
feel like failures here there's a
fairytale economy out there but my
income is declining and the people
around that you work writer and so on so
there must be something wrong with us
in fact US happens to be almost
everybody so for about 75 percent of the
workforce wages have stagnated or
declined over the last 25 years
globalization period and the richest
country in the world and the only way
incomes are kept up is by increasing
working hours ordinary you know median
American hip
the American working class what are
called middle-class Americans I worked
about a month extra a year family just
to keep wages stagnant that's the
highest workload in media in the world
well that picture generalizes around the
world there's some variation the the
main exception are countries which
quoting now which did not follow the
religion that the markets know best I'm
quoting from the latest Nobel Prize
laureate in economics Joseph Stiglitz in
an article he broke just before he was
appointed chief economist of the World
Bank a position which he did not keep
very long because he kept making such
annoying statements they just picked out
but what he said is correct the
countries that didn't follow the
religion that markets know best did
succeed in growth extensive growth
during the neoliberal period almost
everywhere else it was pretty much what
I've just described worse for countries
like Mexico and for the United States
furthermore this is expected to continue
you know the if you look at the
provisions of the World Trade
Organization they deprive countries of
exactly the mechanisms that were used
for development
all of them are market interference
without exception there isn't a single
rich developed country that didn't rely
personally on extensive market
interference and that holds from England
up to the East Asian Nick's of the
United States dramatically if the United
States had followed the principle of
comparative advantage the rules that the
poorer must accept under contemporary
neoliberalism the United States would
now be exporting fish it would certainly
not be exporting textiles the only way
it could develop textiles was
by extremely heavy protectionist
barriers that kept superior British
textile sell actually the reason Britain
was producing textiles is because it did
the same thing to nd it imposed heavy
duties keep Indian textiles out not just
textiles ships steel my entire
manufacturer all sorts of things because
they couldn't compete then when and
meanwhile India was compelled to follow
liberal rules it became what's called an
ocean of liberalism by economic
historians and the results are obvious
countries like the United States the
United States couldn't have developed a
steel industry for the same reason
British steel was superior just as
Indian iron had been superior to British
iron in the century earlier and it was
changed the same way and that goes right
up to the present often a military cover
is used for this the dynamic source of
the US economy is under the cover of the
military system it's a massive state
sector the economy that includes just
about everything the whole new economy
you know electronics computers Internet
in fact telecommunications you go
through the list it's developed under a
military cover and if you look at the
World Trade Organization rules you'll
notice that they have a way of dealing
with this you're allowed to what's
called a national security exemption so
you're allowed to violate the rules for
national security okay for Haiti doesn't
help a lot I vote for the United States
it helps quite a lot because it includes
the whole economy the whole economy can
be developed within a national security
exemption by placing it under
the cutting edge of it under the
military and that's exactly what's not
you can hear Alan Greenspan calling
about the wonders of the entrepreneurial
economy and rugged individualism and so
on and even gives lists examples of
these things you take a look at the
examples every single one of them
without exception was developed in the
state sector extensively over a long
period and it's inconceivable he doesn't
know this I mean this is common
knowledge but it's again not the kind of
thing that not the kind of information
that people have the right to well you
take a look at economic history all of
this is just dramatically clear just ask
yourself a simple question which
countries develop well the countries
that developed were Europe North America
Japan a couple of the countries in the
Japanese colonial system and that's
about it the rest of the world not only
didn't develop but it was pretty much
destroyed there's a characteristic in
common to the countries that developed
they maintained their sovereignty they
were not colonized and the correlation
is extremely close you don't find
correlations like that in history
countries that maintain their own
sovereignty and were able to violate the
rules and integrate themselves into the
economic system on their own terms
many of them did develop countries that
lacked sovereignty were subjected to
external control without exception did
not develop again it takes a lot of
discipline for economists and other
intellectuals not to notice this fact
right right under the contemporary
versions of
and I should say this understates it's
completely understates the reality also
takes 8 you know the beginning of
industrialization everywhere as textiles
britain succeeded in developing textile
industry by destroying the superior
Indian textile industry and by
protectionist devices and state
intervention but textiles were based on
cotton and cotton was cheap and why was
cotton cheap well cotton was cheap
because of an institution called slavery
slavery the rather severe market
interference but when you studying
market economies you don't count that
you don't count the fact that there was
a massive market interference namely by
state violence of the most extreme kind
that kept the basic commodity chief
technical cotton was like well today and
in fact oil is kept achieved the same
way a huge part of the pentagon budget
is directed to maintaining the price of
oil within a certain range the few
studies that are around count that is
about 30 percent of the 30 percent
subsidy of the oil price and there's
plenty of other energy subsidies well
those things just aren't counted but
even if you take the things that are
counted the facts are very very clear
under the current version of traditional
mechanisms about half the population of
the world
now is literally in receivership that
means that our economic policies are
managed by bureaucrats in Washington but
even in the rich countries
democracy is under attack and by virtue
of the shift of decision-making from
governments which may be partially
responsible to the population to private
tyrannies which don't have those details
are unaccountable so they're fine just
decisions to them everything that's
great
and that has very striking effects a
Latin America that Latin America has
undergone a wave of democratization in
the past 10 or 15 years military
dictatorships were replaced by
democracies but you know academic
specialists who follow this closely have
been observing for years that as
democracy is extended in Latin America
disillusionment with democracy is
increasing and that trend continues just
recently released study revealed that
about half the population of Latin
America would now support support
democracy in about half would be willing
to accept military dictatorships the
military dictatorships in Latin America
were extremely brutal affairs but after
the wave of democratization about half
the population wouldn't mind if they
came back and the reasons are very clear
they're reported in fact even in the
business press London Financial Times
recording this said that the reason is
an alarming trend which links declining
economic fortunes with a lack of faith
in the institutions of democracy and the
reason is that the this much-praised new
wave of democracy happened to coincide
with neoliberal economic programs which
undermine democracy so you get more
formal than
were in disillusionment with democracy
and indeed Latin America which has
followed the rules most religiously has
been one of the regions that had the
worst economic record correlation that
holds worldwide that also holds for the
United States I'm sure you read a lot
about the big clamor about the stolen
election of November 19 November two
thousand dollars Florida votes in the
Supreme Court and so on if you read
closely you'll notice that there was a
huge issue in the press and the moment
elite commentators they were very
surprised at the fact that the public
didn't care the public expressed no
concern over the fact that the election
was stolen they could never get a rise
out of the public with all the publicity
and the reasons are very clear from
extensive public opinion studies they
revealed that on the eve of the
elections or no Florida shenanigans on
the eve of the election about 75% of the
population regarded the whole process as
a farce
it was a game played by rich
corporations who do the funding party
leaders were all crooks and the public
relations industry which is just
crafting candidates to say things that
you can't believe even if you can
understand them so who cares what
happens stole them
what's a difference make any difference
anyway that's in fact these same studies
reveal this is a measure of what they
call helplessness inability to affect
anything that happens that's been going
up very fast at its highest level
last November with about half the
population saying that people like us
have little or no influence on
what government does that's a very sharp
rise right through the neoliberal period
where there are issues that separate the
public from the business world they
simply don't appear in the agenda so
international economic issues public has
very strong feelings a business has very
strong feelings but they're opposite
feelings accordingly the issue cannot
arise in the campaign the free trade
area the Americas for example could not
be mentioned in the campaign and that's
true in general these things called free
trade agreements actually the business
press more accurately close them free
free investment agreement that's what we
oughta call the free investment
agreements are opposed by the public
supported by the business world and it
leads generally therefore they cannot
appear as issues in campaigns no no the
original the constitutional system in
the United States was actually designed
to have this effect very consciously
James Madison was the main framer in the
Constitutional Convention he explained
that the goal of government is to
protect the minority of the ocula
against the majority and he said
therefore to achieve this political
power must be placed in the hands of the
wealth of the nation men who can be
trusted to secure the permanent
interests of the country which are the
rights of the property owners and to
defend these interests against what he
calls a leveling spirit of the general
population that continues to the present
takes various forms but that same
principle is a leading principle of
progressive political thought
progressive right up to the present and
no technical political scientists types
of right about these things I say that
it's wrong to describe the United States
as a democracy it should be described as
a polyarchy
that is a system in which elites
and the public ratifies the public is
supposed to show up every couple of
years and say you know you make the
decisions and then go home and buy shoes
or something like that that's the ideal
system and from that point of view the
November 2000 election didn't reveal a
flaw of American democracy but revealed
its triumph and that triumph has been
greatly enhanced by the neoliberal
programs well throughout all of this a
crucial element is restriction of
information that's why there's a huge
public relations industry they tell you
what they're doing you know it's like
it's not a secret the founding documents
of the PR industry back in the 1920s
this guy am quoting is one of the
founders of it as a roosevelt kennedy
liberal and yet a classic manual in
which he said the goal of the industry
is to regiment the public mind every bit
as much as an army regiments the bodies
of its soldiers and that's necessary you
can't have democracy otherwise unless
the population is totally regimented you
can't have allowed democracy because the
population will do what they want and
that won't be securing the permanent
interests of the country mainly the
rights of the rich who have to be
protected from the majority this is
quite conscious there's nothing secret
about it it's the standard political
science literature supported by major
figures it just assumed vader walter
Lippmann and others
well the struggle to impose that regime
takes many forms it never ends
it's going to continue as long as there
are high concentrations of power with
the decision-making controlling
decision-making and it's only reasonable
to expect the masters to exploit any
opportunity that they have at the moment
the fear and anguish in
face of the terrorist attacks but
there's absolutely no reason to accept
those rules and fortunately plenty of
people are not accepting there's been a
very impressive increase in opposition
taking totally new forms and recent
years it mostly developed in a cell it's
been joined by the north
recently the Masters of the Universe are
very scared they're there they recognize
what's happening the meeting in Qatar
I'm sure you know is an expression of
the fear that the public may become
involved if they could figure out how to
meet in a space shuttle they meet there
just keep the public away because it's
too dangerous
every time the public breaks through
there is panic in the business press
literal panic they know there's such
their control is extremely fragile it
can be destroyed at any time it's mainly
a matter of not accepting the injunction
to be passive and acquiescent and to
realize that power actually is in the
hands of populations particularly in the
you know more free and democratic
societies where it's impossible to use
really massive force - and violence to
suppress the general population these
popular movements are unprecedented in
scale there's been nothing like them in
history in the range of constituencies
and in international solidarity and I
think the future to a very large extent
lies in their hands and it's very hard
to overestimate what's at stake
thank you very much for this wonderfully
rich and thought-provoking lecture I did
tell you that norm jumps Kitty knows a
fair amount of economics and I hope that
you're convinced now and he has put us
me and my colleagues in the difficult
position now of having to either accept
when he said and forget a lot of what
we've been teaching for four years or
having to argue with him which may be
even harder don't go away
as Larry King says there's still a lot
of exciting things on the program for
the next hour and a half we will have a
long question answer with Noam Chomsky a
little later on if you wish to ask to
ask a question we'd like to ask you to
please give it in writing to facilitate
the proceedings so if you have any
question please put it in writing and
bring it here to the front the last
half-hour of the question answer session
will be for the press so we will ask the
press to ask questions at that time and
that will be directly not in writing but
the anyone else would like to ask a
question and please do it in writing
before that we are going to have now a
short summary translation by Bharat
Dogra 10-15 minutes for those in do not
follow the lecture in English then we'll
have another short song from Ram Dass
college students and then other speeches
from Illuminati Roy Siddhartha Rajan and
others and then the question answer
session we apologize for those who could
not hear very well from the back we are
unable to increase the volume because
there are exams
going on around here but we're going to
try to relocate the speakers to improve
the sound system and now I'd like to
invite Bharat Dogra to give us a short
translation in Hindi after that already
a question has come thank you
