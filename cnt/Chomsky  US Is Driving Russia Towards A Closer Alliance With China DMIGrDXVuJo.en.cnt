can you hear now well if you take a look
at what's happening now take a look at
this morning's newspaper The Washington
Post the main newspaper the deals with
Washington affairs there's a report of
the US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel
who finally concedes that the Putin is
withdrawing forces from the border of
Ukraine but he says and Washington
backed him up that this is not enough
they after we throw all the forces and
we cannot overlook the fact that they
already placed forces there that's
permanent notice that the issue is not
whether Putin is withdrawing forces from
Mexico and Canada
I mean if Russian forces were in Mexico
Canada we wouldn't be here to talk about
it there'd be a nuclear war tomorrow if
not yesterday but he's withdrawing
forces from within Russia from the
borders of Ukraine which the US and the
West have been trying hard to assimilate
into the Western economic and military
system on the borders of Russia and
that's considered perfectly legitimate
in its Putin's fault not ours but what's
happening is that this is driving the
Russians consciously towards the closer
alliance with China how can they
possibly react and there are natural
relations between China and Russia China
Russia Siberia Eastern Russia has huge
resources China needs them there's all
sorts of historical antagonisms they've
been practically a war
many years but yeah it's driving them
towards a closer alliance and it's
tending to reshape world affairs in that
manner actually this is happening on
China's eastern border maritime border
as well China is being pretty much
barred from its own the waters off
China's shore China wants to exert
influence over them and there's a
conflict about that notice the conflict
is not about the waters off California
or the Caribbean that's not an issue the
u.s. controls of everything the question
is the waters off the coast of China and
because of recognizing those
difficulties China is moving towards
Central Asia it's establishing close
relations with many of the Central Asian
states interesting relations for now by
now you can actually take a high-speed
train from China to Kazakhstan you can't
take one from Boston to New York but and
but it's true that these pressures are
driving China toward Central Asia or
driving Russia towards China China has
established some years ago the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization which is
includes China India Pakistan Kazakhstan
other Central Asian countries the u.s.
requested permission to be an observer
that was refused the Iran requested and
is accepted and it
is an observer and this system is
gradually developing and will become a
significant system in world affairs but
we're quite consciously pressing them in
that direction it comes from a premise
the premise is we own the world
and if anybody else is doing anything
it's there there's something wrong with
them
