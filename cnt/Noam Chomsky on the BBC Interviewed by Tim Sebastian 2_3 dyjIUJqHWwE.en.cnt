but you know if you think you know it
suppose that one that the British
discovered as they have in fact that
some of the people involved in IRA
bombing Hitler in the United States and
they've called for extradition of those
people the US has refused do they then
have the right to bomb the United States
you think that well fine then you don't
think that the United States said the
right to bomb Afghanistan it's the same
thing professor Chomsky above 9/11 which
went to press article 15 so I doesn't
take account of later developments you
talk about bin Laden's motives for what
he did and you say I think there's every
reason to take him at his word
why did you take any of these well you
never take anybody that was two points
first of all I often take people with
their words including governments I
usually think of a US government you the
US government in particular I usually
take it at its word so for example when
Bill Clinton says we will act at the
United Nations we will act
multilaterally when we can and util at
early when we feel it is necessary I
think him in his word when the United
States government gave its official
reasons for bombing Serbia mainly to
maintain stability and to establish
credibility and I take them to the world
I've been luck in the case of bin Laden
you take them at their word when their
word is first of all consistent over
time and also consistent with their
actions then you take them at their word
same with bin Laden his statements are
consistent over time and very consistent
with his actions over a long period did
you say that would not be possible he
was telling the truth when he says he
didn't know about the operation I heard
like possible in fact still was entirely
lost she didn't live the December video
where he said we calculated in advance
the number of casualties from the
enemies a big killer facebook
notifications the previous birthday
today
I treat him this anyway I Do's big
regime ski when Brzezinski says we we
lured the Russians into an Afghan trap
by supporting the Mujahideen and that
was a great achievement please Mountain
destroyed Afghanistan and them set up a
terrorist network with a wonderful
achievement in the same book I said we
have to be cautious about this because
he made me boasting unless you give us
some evidence the fact that he says
later yes we drew them into an Afghan
trap doesn't prove that when he takes
credit for it we have to treat that
statement the same way we treated the
statement of the National Security
Adviser of the United States is the most
thing about something or is he really is
that really evidence in that case I
don't really think it's good evidence
you take a vitamin parent and compare it
to the u.s. I'm saying
we're prepared to vicious because per
simple reason see I believe in
elementary moral principles mainly if we
apply some standard to someone else we
apply it to ourselves but you have to
cut one out like with light haven't you
this is like with wide it yes bin Laden
is comparable to pigeons no no that's
that's just a total non sequitur in the
case in point each of these people is
taking credit for an action that was
carried out in the past and we have no
evidence that the action was carried out
in the past and in both cases they are
posting of it and very proud of it and
therefore we use the same criteria I
could say the same thing about two
children our playground doesn't mean
that they're equivalent but then one
motive don't you love declarative yes I
agree with the CIA and
networker intent on supporting Muslims
defending themselves against computer
him at the dentist excuse me whatever it
may be you're missing reader miss
reading crucially I say that he like
every other gangster in history cause
whatever action they carry out defensive
so he describes himself as defending
Muslim lands just the way Hitler
described himself as defending the Aryan
people against the Jews that doesn't
mean it was defense it means that every
just about every use of violence even
think of in history is justified on the
basis of defense you say nothing can
just define current such as those of
September 11th but we can think of the
u.s. innocent victim only if we adopt
the conventional path of ignoring in the
record of its actions and those of its
life so it's not you it's not an
innocent victim according to you there
are no like every that happening - no no
that's your inference people get reading
if they're totally irrational if we were
a lot of irrational people on that I
can't help it if we're rational we will
recognize that the United States Britain
France and I can go down a long list had
a terrible record of atrocities and that
does not justify why I want to act
against that you seem to see the moral
equivalence and Bush Marley Marl
equivalence is a term of propaganda that
was invented to try to prevent us from
looking at what the acts for which we
are responsible you say that I think
you've been loved there
it's not moral equivalence there is no
such notion there are many different
dimensions and criteria for example is
no moral equivalence between the bombing
of the World Trade Center and the
destruction of Nicaragua forest El
Salvador Guatemala the latter were far
worse like any criterion so there's no
moral equivalence furthermore they were
done for different reasons and there
were done in different ways there's all
sorts of dimensions but when the US
again what to do about that these always
go back to past not present present to
see what made you mention again I
mention that because I'm controversial
since there's a World Court straining
Council resolution but I can take take
cases since is uncontroversial there's a
good example you're kicking the u.s.
know I'm asking that we that we accept
the definition of hypocrite given in the
Gospels I think that's correct the
hypocrite is the person who refuses to
apply to himself the standards he
applies to others I don't think we
should be it to what aim do you do this
what a image you wish to plaintiff now
because I think we should rot tried to
rise to the level of minimal moral
integrity once we can rise to the level
of a minimum our moral integrity then we
can discuss these issues seriously we
can't even rise to that level there's
any point is talking minimum moral
integrity requires that if we think
something is wrong when they do it is
wrong when we do it correct holidays was
professor of international relations at
the LSE he said that you overestimate
you a behaviorist to make the public
shift in attitudes into faith when you
were writing a lot 10 years to accept
I think I read the article he didn't
give any evidence so I can't comment but
I've emphasized repeatedly the the a
growth of the human rights climate in
the last 30 years and I think it's one
of the most development for developments
in the last 30 years but he overrracted
made us responsibility for everything
that goes wrong though regimes that are
oppressive in the river i'm not consult
but there are regions that passive and
not control my mind is whether i tell
you that you are overestimating and
british responsibility you can't answer
that what's the evidence
where am I ever found maybe but where am
i overestimating it that's the kind of
claim that the most serious person makes
about anyone but how is a status but if
I were to say Fred Halladay
underestimates us responsibility for
actions in the world that would be a
totally irresponsible statement unless I
give my reasons
what serious person doesn't make
accusations like that if you want to
make an accusation against someone give
your reasons then we kind of it then we
can evaluate professor chance do you
think you overestimated the humanitarian
crisis and Afghanistan yes Pakistan is
dual use as you saying on a November
trip to Pakistan only ten days before
the bombing the UN s lead magnet
cultural organization but more than the
world that seven million people would
face starvation in Afghanistan if the
military action was initiated
I wasn't overestimating it I was quoting
the food and agriculture work did you
give the impression that the bombing
alone
didn't give that impression at all what
I said is that before the bombing there
were very comfortable estimates UN
estimates about 5 million people facing
starvation great New York Times The
effect of the threat of bombing will on
the bombing would be to place an
additional two and a half million people
at risk they were quoting UN sources and
I quoted them that if it's an over
estimate it's not mine it's the over
estimate of the New York Times that he
freaking agriculture organization of the
world food organization and others
