he doesn't need
any introduction because he is very
known internationally
but for the sake of the new generation
and young people who did not know him i
would be happy to give

a major figure in analytic philosophy
and
one of the founders of the field of
cognitive science
he holds a joint appointment at institut

you can ask
questions directly during the interview
and
i'm i'm sure professor nam chomsky will
be pleased to answer all of your
questions at the end of course of this
interview if the questions have not been
covered
professor norm chomsky as you know
humanity
has many challenges including global
warming
the threats of a nuclear catastrophe the
immigration crisis
among others but today we are
facing an unprecedented phenomenon for
the majority of the planet's inhabitants
that is
of kovid 19 pandemic and as you know
president like the president bush and
barack obama already talks about this
pandemic
the arrival of this pandemic even
nowadays
bill gates has been talking about this
pandemic
do you think professor this crisis
could have been avoided and what are
its origins the floor is just professor
it's a very important question not
academic
the answer to that question will
determine
how we can deal with the next pandemic
that's coming
which is very likely to be worse than
this one
uh if you go back to 2003
after the sars epidemic was contained
scientists were telling us loud and
clear
that another one is coming and here's
what we have to do to prepare for it
not much was done the drug companies
huge resources wonderful labs
but they're not interested because they
follow
capitalist logic you do what you can
make profit on tomorrow
that's something that you can sell a lot
tomorrow not something that you may be
able to
use it 10 years from now when there's a
catastrophe
so they didn't do anything what about
government
government has again wonderful
laboratories
huge resources but they're blocked
they're blocked by the neoliberal plague
which says that as ronald reagan put it
when he came into office
government is the problem not the
solution we have to turn everything over
to the private sector
with consequences we've seen around the
world in the last 40 years
but one consequence is government
couldn't act well in fact
governments did act to some extent
so george w bush as you mentioned
did take initial efforts to
prepare for some likely
pandemic anticipated pandemic
when president obama took office
january 2009 his first act within the
first few days was to call the
presidential scientific advisory council
request a pandemic response system
to be descriptive and they a few weeks
later
they came back with a detailed program
he implemented it
there were also programs of american
scientists going to china
working with colleagues to study
coronaviruses that
anticipated another coronavirus would
come like czars and be the next major
pandemic
this continued until january 2017
president trump came into office first
days in
office disbanded the whole thing
no pandemic response system
then he began to defund
the center for disease control and other
health-related parts of the
government he has been doing that every
year he continued to do it in
february 2020
while the pandemic was raging that he
was denying it
without going through the rest of the
details which are pretty sorted
the end result is that the united states
is now
an outlier of the world in
late march uh the united states and the
european union were
approximately equal in number of
cases number of deaths now since then
curve has very sharply declined for the
europe for europe
uh they have they're opening up the
societies
totally under control but progressing
the united states gotten worse maybe
160 170 000 people killed
and the situation's getting worse where
i live in arizona
it's one of the worst hot spots in the
world
all of this is avoided we've seen it in
fact when
china produced the
genome sequencing provided the genome to
the world
on january 10th very quickly
countries that where the governments
cared about their
citizens acted and very effectively
uh south korea taiwan
uh hong kong new zealand
australia a little bit later some of the
european countries
and have the situation pretty much under
control
so it's a terrible situation but it's
avoidable
we're now facing the same thing
we will somehow emerge from this
pandemic
at a terrible and unnecessary cost
but there'll be another one and if you
think about it
so far we've been lucky there have been
coronaviruses which are highly
contagious
but not too lethal like this one
there have been others that are not very
contagious
but highly lethal like ebola next time
around
we might not be lucky could be one
that's
highly contagious and very lethal
we know how to prepare for it we know
what the barriers are
basically three one capitalist logic
which bars the pharmaceutical
corporations
two the plague of neoliberalism
which transfers everything away from
government
uh three incompetent and malevolent
leadership
put those three together spells
catastrophe
yes uh professor chomsky
as you know that's kobe 19 people many
people are dying because of kovid 19.
what mistake do you think do you believe
have been
made in the u.s italy and europe when
dealing with the pandemic
well actually italy was where the
pandemic struck
hardest in europe northern italy was
very badly hit partly because it has a
elderly population which is more
susceptible
to other reasons but italy is opening up
they have it pretty much under control
not perfect by any means
but not as not as good as east asia
south southeast asia and uh oceania new
zealand
but pretty effectively uh the biggest
mistake was
lack of preparation then comes the
question of
doing what has to be done the europe
aside from the uk europe followed the
advice of american and other scientists
and this work reasonably well
could be better but reasonably well the
u.s
ignored that advice we have
in the white house an administration
which despises science
it's not just on this issue science is
bad you don't want science
the guru of the uh
white house uh rush limbaugh
reaches tens of millions of people on
his program
president just gave him the medal of
freedom and
respectful work he tells his
tens of millions of audience of people
that
there are four corners of the seat in
the country
uh government media academia
and science they thrive on deceit
so don't pay any attention to them well
tens of millions of people listen to
that
they hear the same thing on fox news the
murdoch
channel they hear it from the white
house
it's all they hear tend to believe it
they uh run through the polls but what
people
republicans believe is just astonishing
so yes you have to have an educated
population
you have to understand and you have to
have a leadership
that's responsible for the population
not just to the rich and powerful who it
serves
actually uh we're talking about covet 19
which is bad enough we will
emerge from kovid 19 even
the united states will emerge we're not
going to emerge from
the melting of the polar ice caps we're
not going to emerge from the fact
recently reported that
greenland enormous quantity of ice
has reached a point where the melting of
the
ice cap is irreversible it's going to go
on
that's a legacy for future generations
we have to recognize
that what we're doing now to the
environment
is not reversible except by some
miraculous new technology that nobody
knows about
it's not it's going to be there
permanent essentially permanently
and it's getting worse time
the large parts of the world that are
inhabited now will be literally
uninhabitable within another
couple of decades if this continues
probably including morocco
that's uh this there are ways to stop it
we know how to stop it but it's kind of
like the virus
it's not enough to have knowledge you
have to act
and in fact countries are active
not enough but so the country that's
doing
most is the united states it's trying to
make the crisis worse so
nicely timed with the announcement that
greenland isis passed the tipping point
president trump opened up for drilling
the lat the only large wildlife
reserve in the united states in alaska
opened it up for drilling i mean even on
economic pure economic ground
this is lunacy is an oil glut
even the oil companies don't want more
drilling you can't sell what they have
but he opened it up because that's a way
to drive
more quickly towards disaster than to
satisfy the fossil fuel industries
other industries that fund this campaign
we've never seen anything like this it's
a
level of malevolence and evil
that the world has never seen literally
and it's gonna it's not changed it's
gonna destroy us
now there are alternatives europe for
example
could become a force in world affairs
as the largest economy in the world the
most educated population
with many advantages sits in the
background
can't handle its own problems can't act
as a player in the world
europeans say they don't like what's
happening but they're not doing much to
reverse it
that can change same is true of north
africa
plenty of awful problems i don't have to
tell you about them
but these things are under human control
we can
change it don't have a lot of time but
we can
yes uh is professor chomsky before we
talk about
the effects of kovite 19 after the
effect of coronavirus
uh i would like you uh to ask you
another question
in addition to the the trump
administration and the republicans
you know that some media try to blame
china for this
crisis does this play a geopolitical
role or is it just part of
the media element to divert attention
the media are following
the lead of government policy now
president trump
is flailing around desperately
to find somebody to blame
for the crimes he's committed against
the american people
he's responsible for killing well over a
hundred thousand people
in the last few months americans that
doesn't want that to be on his record so
let's blame
somebody else we'll blame the world
health organization
let's destroy the world health
organization
and condemn unknown numbers of
africans yemenis others to death
because they won't get the services of
the world health organization
let's do that because maybe we can blame
them
for my crimes then comes china
let's blame china actually that's not
hard
in the west now the so-called yellow
peril
that goes way back a century terrible
racist condemnation of chinese
chinese were kept out of the united
states
throughout the 19th century early 20th
century
pure racism it's brought up over and
over
now china did make mistakes they did
things that were wrong in january
at the peak of the crisis lots of
confusion of local officials
did not provide the central authorities
with full information that they needed
so the record is by no means perfect
much better and comparably better than
the u.s
reaction or even the european reaction
but defective so let's blame china
let's say china it's a trump typical
typical racist remark
likes to call it the chinese flu now if
we follow that policy the
huge pandemic in 1918
which is much worse than this at least
so far
should be called the kansas flu because
it originated
in a military base in the state of
kansas in the united states
if we want to be anti-american racists
call it the kansas flu
so trump calls it the chinese food and
the media
follow along it's not the
the charges are not worthless there are
correct charges but nothing like what's
being claimed which is
mainly as i say an effort to shift blame
from the crimes of the white house now
in fact
whatever the faults of the way the
chinese reacted
very quickly a couple of weeks after the
first
symptoms were detected they had provided
the world with the
sequence genome meaning virologists all
over the world
knew exactly what was going on and how
to deal with it
okay can't blame anyone else for what
happened anyone can do it happen after
that
uh but uh it's a
sordid business the
undermining of the world health
organization
in the midst of a pandemic is even more
grotesque
as i say consigns
lots of people to death and suffering
it's not a small matter
and that's the world we live in
has to be changed and quickly
yes professor in the same vein since uh
we know that
china uh reacted quickly uh
do you think uh it is possible that
there is a conspiracy behind the
lines in pandemic
it's not that's nothing is totally
impossible
but the possibility is so remote
that there's no need to think about it
and just to tell you uh i'm sure you've
heard this
this story going around
that that the pandemic was initiated by
bill gates george soros others to try to
put chips in people's heads to control
the world
now that story has reached 70 percent
of americans of those
about two-thirds of republicans believe
it
i mean this tells you something
that's pretty sick and it's not just the
united states
it should be another personal attitude
and one of the
plagues of the internet which we'll see
more and more of over the years
is that it's possible to post
an article on the internet under
somebody else's name
make it look as if they wrote it and
there's just nothing you can do about
that
it's happened to me several times
one of the beginning of the pandemic
uh somebody who put up a story
saying that the pandemic was originated
in a
u.s military laboratory
as part of a u.s government effort to
control the world
under my name circulated over
i started getting letters from people
all over
including europe and sometimes sensible
people even colleagues
saying thank you for finally telling the
truth about what's happening
i mean people are willing to believe
almost anything
it's a very dangerous situation
i mean so dangerous that in the united
states i don't know the figures
elsewhere
in the united states probably about half
the population
say they will refuse to take a vaccine
if the vaccine is developed because the
government may be trying to poison
or bill gates may be trying to poison
them
this is pretty serious it means for
example that it may
that the pandemic may be permanent
if half the population says i'm not
going to do it
you'll never reach general immunity
i mean every person who is infected
is like a time bomb waiting to explode
they kill others not just themselves
so if they refuse to take prevent
preventive treatment they'll go on
forever
that's the effect of the attack on
science
and on the rationality clear thinking
these are very serious developments it's
a
it's a deep problem of the reigning
culture and i think it traces back
to the attacks on the population
that have taken place in the last 40
years
the neoliberal programs
whatever it was the intention of the
planners we could debate that
but the design was very clear
the consequences are very clear it's
brutal class war
that's neoliberalism it's designed
to concentrate wealth and power
in a tiny segment of the country of the
population
mostly financial institutions which are
generally harmful to the economy their
predator
and to take it away from
institutions that are somewhat under
public control
when reagan says government is the
problem
the words mean let's take decisions away
from
government which is at least partially
responsive to the public and under its
influence
and let's put them in the hands of
private
institutions which are totally
uncountable to the public
and which are driven solely by the goal
of maximizing profit and market share
let's let them make all the decisions
it doesn't take a genius to figure out
what's going to happen
and we've seen what happened so for
example in the united states
0.1 not 1
0.1 of the
population now hold 20
of the wealth that's twice what they had
when reagan came into office now a
majority of the population
you can't get can barely get by from one
paycheck to the next if anything goes
wrong
in trouble well has many effects on the
pandemic
so one of the effects of neoliberalism
is that you have to run everything on a
business model
including hospitals when you run
hospitals on a business model
means no waste everything is what's
called
just on time so just enough hospital
beds for what you need
now don't waste resources on excellence
what happens when something is out of
the ordinary
catastrophe if it happens on the
assembly line of the ford motor company
okay you can hold up the assembly line
for
the wall while you fix it up you can't
do that with
an outburst of disease this is lethal
simply aren't enough even hospital beds
other countries like say germany had
which is a neoliberal country but not
this extreme
they did have extra beds extra
diagnostic capacities they were able to
put them to use
it's not an anti-science government it's
a pro-science government
merkel scientist yourself they
uh immediately put into the
action as soon as they figured out what
was happening the
proper procedures they had facilities
they were able to deal with
under strict neoliberal rules it's
catastrophe
uh that's the united states an extreme
example of britain
is pretty close but uh
certainly doesn't have to happen and the
result of all of this
is that people all over the world
there's anger and resentment
fear and contempt for major institutions
this is exacerbated in europe
by the radically undemocratic character
of the european union
a decision under european union rules
decisions important decisions are
removed
from the nation-states where again the
population has some
influence and transfer to unelected
bureaucrats in brussels
the european commission which is
unelected
imf obviously on elected central bank of
course
they make the major decisions so people
feel rightly that they're
disenfranchised
no we can't do anything we try to do
something
uh the bureaucracy which is
heavily influenced by the big banks
german banks
they'll say you can't do it actually
europe is finally breaking out of this
one of the effects of the pandemic good
effect is that europe has
finally decided to break out of these
ridiculous constraints economically
observed even the imf says then it was
the highest era
which just makes crises worse it's
uh they've been doing that throughout
the whole neoliberal period
since maastricht especially since the
1990s
it's very seriously good europe and it's
created a population as i said
that is angry rightly
uh same in the united states trump
supporters are people who are bitter
resentful they don't like what's
happening to them
it's fertile terrain for demagogues
you say just listen to me i can save you
we've seen this before i'm old enough
to remember it in my childhood
mussolini hitler franco
no not pretty that's
where they flourish this kind of system
and so the problems are not just trump
not just bolsonaro not just orban
but goes deeper they're
exploiting the crisis for their own
benefit and power
but it's deeper all of these things
can be under control but they're not
going to cure themselves
yeah yeah yes professor lawson since you
met you mentioned your liberal
new liberalism uh so let's move on to
talk about
the effects of uh kovite 19 what will be
the economic and the political impact of
this
health crisis in both the united states
and the world do you think that the word
relationships i mean
uh the relationships between super power
countries
will be reconsidered in other words
will alliances endure or collapse
sorry it could go in any direction
let me go back to my childhood again
okay
was born right before the great
depression
it hit the whole world there were
various ways to react to the great
depression
two different ways mainly one was the
way that was taken in germany
nazism the other is the way that was
taken in the united states
much of europe social democracy
okay came from the same crisis
reacted differently there was no way to
predict it
in text say germany again in the 1920s
germany was the country which was the
peak
of western civilization
educated population
outstanding work in the sciences in the
arts music
was regarded as the model democracy
american political scientists regarded
the weimar
republic as the best democracy in the
world
that's germany in the 1920s okay
depression hit the
there were several political political
organizations not
parties uh one was the nazis
they were small in the 1928 elections
they had i think three percent of the
vote
now there were two huge left
organizations
communist party social
socialist party between the two of them
with the two of them together they
greatly outnumbered the nazis
if they had gotten together for the
1932 elections the last elections in
germany
they would have taken power but they
were too busy fighting each other
the communist party was under the orders
of
joseph stalin the line of the stalinist
at that time was that
everyone is a social fascist so
the the social democrats are the same as
the nazis we can't cooperate with
uh socialists not that bad but they also
were
not working towards cooperation
result was we know
the worst
government in human history
after 10 years 10 years after being the
most civilized country in the world
did not have to go that way take the
united states
depression hit in 29 1929
took about five years before there was
any serious reaction
i'm old enough to begin to remember uh
the
finally around 1933-1934 he started to
get
organized possible popular protests
the labor movement had been virtually
crushed in the 1920s
pretty much like today but it
revitalized
it organizes it as cio began to organize
a lot of solidarity black and white
workers
they began to take militant actions they
moved as far as
occupying factories which is very
serious because the next step after that
is to say
we don't need the bosses we can run it
ourselves
at that point you started getting
reactions to actions
now the government happened to be fairly
sympathetic
which is important the roosevelt
administration
so lots of actions were taken which
didn't end the depression but they had a
very positive effect on the country
right up until today today's
social security the
medical error it's not
it's not advanced in the united states
social welfare system is
very backward but there's something that
came from the new deal
the same in true huge government
projects like the
tennessee valley authority which took
one some of the poorest regions in the
country
rural arkansas created
the energy industry the agricultural
development
now the dust bowl which had been created
by
the united states should have a very
very productive agriculture there's
more enormous advantages but
agricultural practices
had begun to destroy the main
centers for american agricultural
production
this was stopped by new deal programs
who
introduced scientific management
changed the practices of the big
corporations and
small farmers managed to control it and
put it back into operation
so there were many achievements that put
people back to work
you know important things like
government people paid by the government
who were building the
workman conservation development
infrastructure and so on that all these
things can be done
well didn't quite end the depression
because
business was so strongly against it that
they couldn't do it sufficiently
well the war came along at that point
all the bars were down dylan could spend
anything it wanted
controlled everything it wanted instead
of raging price controls
control production huge boost to the
economy
the man manufacturing quadruple
the united states came out of the war
richer and more powerful than it
had ever been comparable policies today
to deal easily with the crisis
that we now have so dealing with the
very serious global warming crisis
it's estimated to take a small fraction
of the expenditures that were used
during the second world war
it's all feasible just as europe can get
out of its crazed austerity mania
by carrying out the policies they're now
beginning to
implement the several trillion dollar
reconstruction program
all of this is possible
with regard to the pandemic and the next
one that's coming
we know what has to be done can be done
right now
serious research and development into
coronaviruses preparation of
vaccines working on trying to get a
universal flu vaccine
difficult difficult scientific problem
but not out of bounds harder problems
have been solved
if the resources were put into it these
things can be done
but it has to be done it's not going to
be done by itself
it's going to take a lot of organized
public pressure
to get governments to do it to overcome
the resistance
of the major centers of private power
we're plainly going to resist it they
don't want their power taken away
so it's kind of class war on a
global scale
yeah yes professor since you we are
talking about the alliances the new
alliances may appear in
after kobe 19. so uh what do you think
about
the the the power of uh or what is
called
uh china the new power the superpower as
a super power
country do you think that china will
rule the world
after kovite 19.
there's a lot of speculation about that
it's been going on for decades
incidentally you can read articles in
the
major u.s journals of international
affairs and
20 years ago saying that china and india
are gonna
be the dominant powers in the world
i don't believe that for a minute and if
it ever happens it'll be
way off um even
i mean president trump has severely
harmed the united states
there's no question about that but even
trump's wrecking ball can't change the
fact
that the united states is the
overwhelmingly dominant power in the
world
for many fundamental reasons for one
thing the united states has
advantages that no one else comes close
to
huge territory pretty homogeneous
you can fly 3 000 miles and it looks
like the place you came from
people speak the same language they go
to the same stores and so on
huge agricultural resources not
duplicated anywhere
mineral resources
enormous security beyond anything anyone
can dream like
controls the whole hemisphere controls
the oceans
controls the air and dominates most of
the rest of the world
the military expenditures are greater
than the next
correctly dozen powers combined much
more sophisticated
the us is the only country in the world
that can issue sanctions
against others and when the united
states issue
sanctions everyone has to follow them
otherwise they get thrown out of the
international financial system
we're seeing that dramatically right at
this moment
right now the united states is trying to
get the united nations
to renew the sanctions against iran
everyone is opposed they're afraid to
vote against the united states that's
too dangerous
there's a maniac on the loose you know
an anger
so they abstain the united states went
to the security council
to try to get support from this got one
vote
columbia dominican republic the island
off the united states they voted with
the united states
nobody else it's now coming with an
effort to renew it again it'll turn out
the same
nobody will support it but they can't
they won't do anything about it
so europe won't support hates u.s
sanctions against iran
but are they going to do anything about
it yes made some gestures
but they can't anger the united states
it's too
powerful and too violent that's
dominance there's no other it takes a
uh israel palestine it's very striking
what happened there
the trump administration came out with
what they call
the greatest deal of the century they're
written by
binyamin netanyahu and jared kushner
released by the white house
if any other country would come out with
that proposal you know what it is
people would have left if they'd even
paid attention they would have left
when the u.s does it everyone observes
it
so the commentary immediately afterwards
well this is the new situation and how
can we
accommodate to it that's the kind of
power that
you just don't see anywhere there's
nothing closely to what
approaching anywhere now china does
have a growing economy that's
developing in it's not just
at the beginning it was just kind of
assembling things with western
corporations
now it's moving into high-tech areas
but it's nothing like the united states
if you take a look at the human
development index of the united nations
and china ranks around 90s india
maybe 130. they have
severe internal problems that the more
developed countries don't have that
incidentally is
not much time to go into history but
this is not
because of it was quite this is because
of
very specific developments european
imperialism
they go back a couple of centuries china
and india were the industrial
commercial centers of the world
what happened european imperialism
which smashed them stole their higher
technology
uh de-industrialized and uh undermined
their
societies and civilizations now they're
trying to catch up but it's going to be
a long process
enormous internal problems that the risk
doesn't have
uh even more serious ones take us to
india
under if current uh
energy programs persist
most of india will be uninhabitable
in a couple of decades the temperatures
are already reaching
the 50 degrees centigrade in some places
it's basically unlivable uh and uh
it's gonna continue take pick bangladesh
the last figures i heard about a third
of bangladesh was underwater
with a severe weather events and rising
seas
uh remember that uh
the capital of bangladesh was the
richest place in the world
when robert clive british explorer
landed there couldn't believe the wealth
and opulence of
what's now bangladesh east
east bengal well what happened
yeah okay thank you uh
and another question is uh we are facing
this
uh unprecedented phenomenon so what
lessons
should we learn from this crisis covet
19
what positive lessons can we learn from
the pandemic
well we can take a look at some of the
things that have happened
and learned lessons from them one thing
that's happened is
around large parts of the world there
has been
an upsurge of local
programs of mutual aid and support
people are helping each other instead of
just
trying to gain everything i can for
myself and forgetting everybody else
let's work on this together if in some
neighborhood there and there's an
elderly
person in a apartment or doesn't have
food let's get food to them
if people can't uh separate
act properly by social distancing let's
arrange it for them
it's happening in the most amazing ways
so it takes a brazil
awful president a clone of president
trump
terrible reaction awful catastrophe
they go to rio de janeiro the favelas
the slums
horrible slums government's doing
nothing for the people
but they're being organized to deal with
the pandemic somehow
who's doing it the criminal gangs
that have been terrorizing the region
they've gotten together to try to
help bring water to people who don't
have water
to get people to try to separate as much
as it's possible under those horrible
conditions
and you're seeing this everywhere that's
one lesson
we can work together to help each other
now we can do it on an
international scale so take
italy again mentioned before that the
peak of the crisis in europe the first
place was northern italy
there happened to be two rich countries
right north of
italy italy austria and germany
they were able to get the crisis pretty
much under control for themselves
did they help northern italy no
they were taking care of themselves this
is supposed to be a
european union but italy could turn
to for help to cuba
cuba sent the doctors and medical aid
to help northern italy at the peak of
the pandemic
that's traditional they've been doing it
for years
cuba is a very poor country subjected to
60 years of u.s terror
vicious economic strangulation but
somehow cuba was able to be the one
genuine internationalist country in the
world
that's not only a lesson but it should
shame
the rich countries especially the united
states which is
still torturing cuba and increasing the
torture under trump
so yes there are lessons mutually
at the local level you know
internationalism
at the general level all that can extend
if we don't have genuine
internationalism we'll never get out of
this
every one of the crises today is an
international
crisis the pandemic is obviously
international
so new zealand can
terminate the virus as it did for
several months
no more cases the vietnam had no cases
at all
but they can't stay that way they can't
wall themselves off from the world
there's going to be
travel interaction they'll come back
it's an
international crisis the vaccine
when it's available should be a public
good it should be for everyone in fact
all vaccines should be
the idea that there's any profit to be
made out of vaccines is obscene
other governments meanwhile are trying
to monopolize it to themselves
okay you could have genuine
internationalism
when pasada utopian idea
the polio when i was a young person was
a
frightening disease i remember very well
the salk vaccine which was produced
with government support and initiative
was made freely available to the world
no patent no profit it's a public good
like the area breeds that's the way it
should be
in fact that's the way medicine should
be that can be done
but and listen to the same is true of
global warming i mean
you don't have to talk about it it's a
global problem
if the united states under the
malevolent administration
decides to erase the disaster the whole
world was in deep trouble
it's got to be done globally and in fact
this is true of just about everything
you think about
take say the exportation of jobs
which is harmful see when american
workers
have a plant closed because they want to
send the jobs to
mexico or china it's a problem for the
american workers
how do you deal with it first of all
by taking the decisions away
from bankers in new york and putting
them in the hands of the workforce in
the community
first step second step internationalism
american workers have shared interests
with chinese and mexican workers
china's has a huge number of labor
actions
protesting against inhuman conditions
they can be supported by american
workers the unions
to this day are still called
internationals
remembering an earlier ideal
that they would be international that
can be reconstructed
then these problems can be worked out by
the people who
bear the costs the working class and
communities
not by gang of rich bankers who are
trying to maximize profit for themselves
okay then you get a very different world
and you can deal with the crisis
but i think it's fair to say that we're
facing a choice between
internationalism and literally
extinction
not that everybody in the world will die
but life will be
unrecognizable you have to remember the
situation we're in
you take a look at co2 particles in the
atmosphere
so it's almost doubled since the
industrial revolution
it's now at a level that was last
reached
close to a level which is now reached
about three million years ago
it's getting close to that at that point
the sea levels were about
30 meters higher 25 meters higher
can you imagine what human life is like
uh i haven't seen specific
studies from morocco but i have seen
studies by israeli
geo the geophysicists and climate
specialists on the event
what's going to happen in the levant
region you know
eastern mediterranean now their
prediction is that within a couple of
decades
of the mediterranean will have heated up
so much that over the summer
it'll be about at the level of a jacuzzi
something to go into for a hot bath
meanwhile the sea level will have
expanded over
most of israel and lebanon
the uh the plate the originally
destroyed
the gulf region is just going to
disappear
nobody will be able to live there i mean
today you can do it with
high technology but it's going to get to
the point where that's impossible
uh where i live arizona it happens to be
uh we're in a position where a drought
there's a
river the colorado river which provides
water for the
west and southwest it's fed by glaciers
they're melting this means the
colorado river is declining that means
that temperatures here are already about
you know 40 degrees centigrade something
like that
you know they're going to go up uh water
will be drawn
that it'll be the desert that's the
southwest united states
this is where we're heading towards
nobody's going to escape
i mean there are some rich people who
think they can build a
gated community up in the alps somewhere
that's not going to work it's
essentially over
if we don't if we don't address this
crisis
seriously i mean leading climate
scientists are saying
panic now don't wait
those are their words we have to act
decisively
no again we know how to do it
there are careful studies that show that
talking about the united states that the
problems
here could be settled with a fraction of
the expenses
used to fight the second world war again
it's
not a utopian dream and furthermore
would make a better world
it's a much better world if you don't
have to sit in a traffic jam for three
hours
to get to work but you have efficient
mass transportation
it's a better world if you're not dying
of pollution from
fossil fuels a lot of improvements in
the world possible
and they're feasible but not unless
something is done
to predict if we go on our current
course
we can predict with very high confidence
that organized human society will not
survive
um yes professor thank you very much for
the explanation
uh professor um chomsky you mentioned i
think
a long time ago maybe uh on twitter
there's a post on twitter that's uh
about the vaccine that they will develop
the vaccine for kovid or something like
that
and they should give it to the to people
for free as a uh dish
to forgive their sins so what do you
think so why
do you say that did you think the that
the
the vaccine was created and that they
should develop
that the virus was created and that they
should develop
the vaccine for that to forgive their
sins
well i should say that the twitter
account
is not mine it's under my name but i
know nothing about it
it's one of these things that happened
in the early
so the first part i agree with yes it
should be free
we have plenty of sins but we should
overcome them
we're not asking anyone to forgive them
we should
pay attention to them overcome them and
in fact one of the
sins is that my computer is
dying in another
two or three minutes so i'm
we are running more than one hour thank
you very much for being patient with us
maybe i will ask you another question
before
so since we are talking about vaccine
you know that russia now developed
vaccine for covet 19. so what is your
comments on that
we don't know that's right
putin when he announced it was very
cautious if you listen carefully
he said there's a vaccine under
preparation
hasn't been adequately tested so we
basically don't know
there are lots of vaccines being
developed
some of them are moving to a testing
phase
and it takes time can't rush it you're
not going to know the results of a test
maybe for years serious results
so
we shouldn't expect a miracle cure
and in fact it's just possible so far
the
virus has not mutated very much it has a
little but not much
could start mutating then you have a
situation like flu
where you have a lot of different
strains maybe you have a vaccine for
some but not for others
so there's not going to be any miracle
there should there will
sooner or later be vaccines maybe
several
and they should be free they should be
for everyone
like the stalk vaccine for polio and
everyone should agree to take them i
mentioned that in the united states
about half the population is so
alienated
and frightened and angry about
government that they're refusing to take
they say they'll refuse to take it
which is a disaster means the pandemic
never goes away
each one who doesn't take it infects
others and it escalates exponentially
so this planet yes maybe
another question because you said that's
your laptop
uh so uh you know that's the the effect
of chronovirus shaped
or the word into new directions and we
know
that uh terrorist attacks
stopped during kovid 19.
who's behind such terrorist
acts terrorist acts
yes so we know that we don't
see more let's say a tourist attack uh
act during covet 19. we don't know the
details but we do know the details for
the last
couple of years so the fbi
comes out with a review of terrorist
acts in the united states
there aren't many but there's a fair
number
now if you go back to 2016
about 20 of the terrorist acts
were attributed to white supremacists
you go back to last year it was close to
100
through the trump years white
supremacist terrorist acts have pretty
much taken over
now that doesn't say that every act say
you know burning a police station is a
white supremacist
but that's the curve that's the tendency
uh trump has strongly encouraged and
cited white supremacist actions
commitments including the terrorist
fringe
okay so i really do have thank you
because the computer
yeah okay so maybe uh we can say that's
it's time maybe we come to the end of
this presentation
for this interview interesting webinar
with professor nam chomsky we
uh thank you very much professor for
being with us today
we are running more than one hour thank
you so much for your patience for bien
here it was a great honor for us and we
wish you a long life
full of happiness and appreciate uh
your uh explanation and answer to
all of our questions thank you very much
very good to be with you thank you
