the next three hours Noam Chomsky will
be taking your phone calls and emails as
our guest on book TVs in depth
well some of it i do because i find it
intellectually challenging and exciting
and demanding and some of that i do
because i just feel it has to be done so
you know people are suffering bitterly
throughout the world there are a lot of
things we can do about it and that seems
to be a responsibility that comes with
privilege and freedom which we have to
an unusual degree may be unique degree
to involve ourselves in these issues
what do you think of United States I
think it's a complicated country it has
wonderful achievements it's in some
domains it's gone beyond any other
country in the world protection for
freedom of speech for example many other
liberties it's got tremendous advantages
incomparable at the biggest economy in
the world over a century ago I don't
think it's used them properly the
there's plenty of many of the actions
that the US government has taken in the
world I think are deplorable then should
be stopped and reversed and it's you
can't really comment on a country
there's just too many facets to it
there's a society there's a culture
there's just too many things I mean when
I take my grandson to a baseball game as
I did last Sunday I enjoy being part of
mainstream America when I look at US
government foreign policy or the
domestic highly regressive domestic
policies I'm extremely critical noam
chomsky will be ways for just a little
under three hours and we will go to the
phones in the next several minutes but
for the first part is program we want to
chat a bit about his life Philadelphia
played a big role in your life what year
were you born
i was born in 1928 in in Philadelphia a
immigrant first-generation immigrant
family Jewish my parents were very much
involved in fact immersed in the Jewish
community Hebrew culture my father was a
Hebrew scholar ran the Hebrew school
systems my mother taught in it deeply
committed through Zionist Zionism we
have to remember that that was something
different than from what it is today and
actually I grew up in a community which
in which we were for most of the time
the only Jewish family in a mostly
german and irish catholic community and
a lot of problems which incidentally my
parents never knew about but the streets
were complicated places problems for you
they never give us an example well as i
say there was a lot of anti-semitism and
those this is the 1930s deeply
anti-semitic period the don't like to
say it but I grew up with a kind of a
visceral fear of Catholics knew it was
irrational got over it but it was just
the street experience and there were
periods during these were periods of
complex ethnic conflicts in the cities
I'm there were times when I was a young
teenager we're in Philadelphia that was
a curfew I think a seven or eight
o'clock curfew on teenagers if we wanted
to go out in the evening we had to have
parental authority there were times when
the walk from the subway station to the
Hebrew school was under police guard and
it wasn't just
Jews were not you know there was a lot
of anti-semitism but it went at all
directions actually get a pretty good
picture of it from some of the novels
written about the period describing
urban ethnic conflicts which are
complicated and real grew up in the
middle of them we're had your parents
come from and what were they like my
father had come from Ukraine right
before the First World War escaping
bizarre as an army my mother had come
from what's now belarus her family she
came when she was a baby actually but
and the two families were were
first-generation immigrant families what
were they lying over your parent / well
had a very warm loving childhood I look
back at it with a lot of warmth and
affection we they were both working they
taught Hebrew school so I was in school
actually from all day from the time I
was about a year and a half old and did
I was actually in an early years up to
high school in a experimental school
that was run by a temple university a
dewy school a wonderful place I don't
know if there's anything like it today
fostered creative activity there was no
competition that I didn't know I was a
good student until I got to high school
because the question ever Rose you know
you weren't graded by your achievements
I mean I knew I skipped a class but I
didn't think anything in particular of
it and nor did anyone else it was a very
healthy exciting intellectual and social
environment why did you decide to go to
the University of Pennsylvania where you
got I believe your undergraduate your
masters and your PhD question never
arose you didn't go into the idea of
going public leaving home
was inconceivable yet we were working
students both my wife and I you lived at
home you went to the local school I
worked in the afternoon the concept of
going away to college just wasn't it
wasn't in the you know didn't exist you
didn't the question never came on when
did you first get interested in
linguistics that was sort of accident
well it's complicated actually my father
was Hebrew scholar he did work on
medieval in grammar and growing up as a
child I read his manuscripts and the
drafts of the book and so on I was kind
of intrigued but but it then I happened
through actually through political
contacts to meet Zoellick Harris who I
later discovered was the most important
and influential linguist in the country
happen to be teaching at the University
of Pennsylvania I was actually on the
verge of dropping out of college at that
time I was pretty bored with the dice I
got in at 16 and a lot of anticipation
and excitement and was mostly killed in
the first year and I was not really
committed to staying I met him and he
drew me back into college I suspect in
retrospect that he was doing it on
purpose but I don't know anyhow I
started taking his graduate courses and
through his influence other also mostly
graduate courses in other fields and he
was an extremely brilliant and exciting
a person in many respects and my
interests developed through those
contacts and then on from there and when
did you meet your wife Carol
she was about two years old and I was
about four years old I guess these were
closely knit communities she was also
from a Jewish community or father that
and mother were from European immigrants
and the families knew each other and we
had sort of mad as children and they
went through a kind of similar history
you know Hebrew school zebra camps by
time we were teenagers we interacted in
a different fashion we married pretty
young she was 19 I had just turned 21
there are people that say there are two
noam chomsky's is you know the language
and the political activist which one of
those do you prefer well I can't really
say if the world would go away I would
much I would be very happy to keep to
what's called my professional work
linguistics philosophy cognitive science
and so on which I do find that exciting
exhilarating challenging and demanding
and easily good could could easily put
my full time activities into it on the
other hand the other activities in their
own way are difficult rewarding
complicated also challenging unnecessary
again if you've just joined us our guest
for the next two hours and 45 minutes
Noam Chomsky who is now located at MIT
how long have you been there almost 50
years what year did you go there and why
I went there in 1955 and actually at
that I had just had been at Harvard for
four years in a graduate fellowship and
had just gotten a PhD from University of
Pennsylvania where actually hadn't been
for four years I had no recognized
academic field the work that i had was
doing was
didn't fit anywhere didn't have any
academic home and I had no particular
expectations of going on into an
academic career because they didn't for
one thing they didn't seem to be any
possibilities but I did receive an
invitation from MIT to be in the
electronics lab I don't know a tape
recorder from telephone practically and
anoint nothing about electronics but I
was the electronics lab at the time was
directed by Jerry Wiesner later became a
Kennedy science advisor who was a pretty
very imaginative personally was the
laboratory itself was a mixture of all
kinds of exciting activities a good deal
of MIT at that time was in a transition
from being primarily an engineering
school to be coming primarily in fact
totally a science-based University it's
a ten year transition which had a lot to
do with things happening in American
science and technology and so on and the
electronics lab where I was was the
center of a lot of these activities
biology neurophysiology mathematics
linguistics acoustics just on and on
many of these were experimental efforts
it wasn't at all clear that they were
going to go anywhere some of them
succeeded very well others failed but it
was a great ferment of intellectual
excitement than interaction and
challenge there were other places like
it at the same time for example
laboratories and as I was primarily in
the electronics lab in a research
position but I also was asked to do some
teaching
I did I was able to teach introductory
linguistics and philosophy courses the
first ones in these areas that had been
taught there but mainly I was my service
to the University was teaching cram
courses in French and German to graduate
students who in those days had to pass a
reading exam in French and German which
they considered a total waste of time
because they knew they were never going
to look at anything and there was a
technique for sort of getting them
through the exam essentially teaching
them to fake their way through the exam
and that's of course as I was teaching
first couple years on the screen is some
shots of Massachusetts to technology
which is on the Charles River right
across from Boston in Cambridge
Massachusetts how many students there
you know I think there's roughly last
time I looked it was about 4,000
undergraduates and I think about maybe
twice that many graduate students
something roughly on that order my
background on you says that you have
published 65 political books and 33
linguistic books from a total of sixty
different publishers would we have been
doing book shows here for many many
years I've never heard of anybody
publishing 98 books well a lot of those
books are collections of talks
interviews if you looked at the ones I
actually sat down and wrote you know it
wouldn't come to anything like that what
was your first first book first book was
called syntactic
