hello my name is Jack Chen I'm a
historian at New York University and I'm
delighted to be interviewing Noam
Chomsky today we will be discussing
Asian American and Pacific Islander
issues both in terms of the growing
numbers of Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders in the United States and many
of them are at our college campuses but
also especially focusing on issues of
race its relationship to foreign policy
intercultural kinds of questions and
also questions of philosophy and
education so so no I was you know I
thought it'd be useful it may be
contextualized a little bit you know I'm
sure at MIT but certainly at NYU and
places like Stony Brook here there are a
lot of asian-american students and many
of them are coming as you know the
children of recent immigrants Korean
Americans have a term for 1.5 hours 1.5
generation and it's my understanding
that also your you you could be I don't
know if you would consider yourself that
way but in many ways you're the child of
immigrants and you spoke did you speak
Yiddish and parents refused to let us
speak Yiddish ah ok as for different
reasons however that's because there was
a in the Jewish immigrant community that
was kind of a cool torque of going on at
the time between yiddish diaspora
oriented and hebrew up in palestine
oriented around my parents were on that
side of course the other whole groups
that just wanted to drop it all right
right so you spoke Hebrew that my I was
I didn't actually speak it but it was in
a Hebrew culture okay yeah learned it
right right well one of the interesting
questions about being a 1.5 or is that
people have some insight about more than
one culture they're immersed in a family
culture and also community oftentimes a
community culture which has its food
ways languages still immersed in
of very different oftentimes immigrant
you know experience and then they're
also engaged with various aspects of
kind of the dominant us culture and so
so part of what I think is very
interesting now about asian americans
were in this country is that they're
kind of negotiating that Korean
Americans in particular I've talked
about being caught between cultures but
it seems to me that that's also a
resource of special insight really in
critical insight about the cultural
difference and and how cultures operates
and what the norms of different cultures
are I'm wondering if that's something
that that depends very much how its
treated I mean it can be a way of
enriching a society in a culture or or
it can be abandoned many immigrant
communities have tried to suppress an
abandoned their traditional roots and
Americanized themselves and I remember
that very well and childhood in fact
went in both directions my parents were
really transplanted immigrant community
happened to be here but my generation
was trying to Americanize itself in
every way could you was there something
of an idea of an American Dream and
within that honor of learning baseball
statistics and making sure you were as
like the other kids you know and even
more more so than they were at same time
keeping to you know Hebrew school in the
afternoon and so on and so forth so it's
kind of two parallel universes which was
pretty common of Jewish kids back in the
30s and 40s right I'm wondering if
that's part of the reason for that was
there was plenty of anti-semitism it was
rife so you just wanted to sort of
wanted to keep your identity not too
visible so the one hand you wanted to
kind of become American in terms of
identifying identifying with baseball
like the cool part of the kids on the
street
right there I kind of wanted to share
with you maybe a few people that I've
been working with and because I think
their experiences in some ways embody
the tension of being caught between
different cultures and also clearly what
happens in Asia has affected them deeply
here it's also a process of discovering
what those meetings are last night at
the event I met a man who is in his 50s
he's filipino America his father was in
the Philippines a supportive Marcos he
himself was drafted during the Vietnam
War and fought in the war and started
dealing with the fact that he wasn't
kind of a mainstream American in the
sense that soldiers were American
soldiers are starting to threaten him in
quantum races names so he he was telling
me that he not only had to kind of watch
out who was in front of him but also
watch behind his back that's one story
the other story is a PhD student of mine
who's Vietnamese and she was just
finishing up a PhD a couple years ago
when it was discovered that she had
ovarian cancer and it turns out that a
lot of Vietnamese children who came over
in she's so fit and she South Vietnamese
now would be who were there where it
affected by a dachshund SIA and that
it's affected the children even though
they may have been quite young when they
left in a profound know there's still
new cases coming along yeah from New
children born well after the chemical
warfare was terminated actually the
extensive studies of it but they can't
be recorded here or they won't be they
aren't reported at least many of them
done by the American public health
specialists and she was just a
conference in Hanoi a couple of months
ago in which a leading us
researcher who's concerned with dioxin
did a report an extensive study that
they had done comparing dioxin it's only
in South Vietnam but they didn't use it
in North Vietnam so kind of ugly but
they have control population the he just
compared the levels of dioxin with
levels of spring and of course it
coincided closely we also found that
dioxin levels were hundreds of times as
high as what's permitted here in heavy
spraying areas Ashley Columbia
University just published a unit in the
epidemiological Center I just published
a study in nature the British science
journal a couple weeks ago in which they
discovered that the actual use of these
chemicals was about fifty percent higher
than what was reported so and there's
extensive studies of the effects there's
new cases coming along it's kind of
ended here there's virtually no mention
of it there's a which is you know you
don't pay attention to your own crimes
right right you know it's what's
interesting about these two examples but
also there are many more that we could
go on and on is that these are people
who have been deeply affected by war
violence u.s. foreign policy when they
come here they're also racialized in
very particular ways they oftentimes are
pro Marco store South Vietnamese and
came you know with the support of the US
but then in this country there they're
kind of treated in whether to both and
especially the Philippines because goes
back a century but the Philippines were
very deeply colonized I'm to the extent
that sense of identity was lost in many
respects and they have to kind of
recover what they have to learn what
happened
Vietnam more complex because more recent
and many different currents and so on
but imma take Edith's portrait Marcos
I'm in the US it was a brutal corrupt
dictator the reagan-bush administration
not only supported him but expressed
what they call their love for him and
there is they admired his love for
democracy george bush senior and so on
and that went on up to the practically
that day when the military turned
against him there was a what they called
people's power movement p which kind of
spread over much of the country and what
the military was really powerful was
present at one point because about it
was around march 1984 if i remember the
military turned against him and the
reagan administration instantly turned
against do and the cydia we support the
democratizing forces but so it is and
then they became a tee markers so people
like that are caught in a very
complicated situation in which they grew
up with the support of the United States
bring a dictator in part of the
dictatorial system but then became
quickly on the other side with policy
shift at almost overnight and of course
the racial element is just constant
what's right the Vietnamese case is
complex if this is a South Vietnamese
woman she was probably in South Vietnam
a split there was a u.s. client regime
with the don't supporters and there was
a popular
it was opposing it in the south so it's
kind of like France during the German
occupation I mean Vichy France at
playing a supporter I was running the
country pretty much by itself with the
Germans in the background the resistance
had plenty of supporters that in fact
after the war there were pretty serious
reprisals thousands of people killed so
that's that's pretty common in countries
that are colonized part of them I think
the challenge of Asian American Studies
and that perspective that brings to
let's say American Studies in American
history is that you have people who have
migrated here who come out of these
experiences and obviously people don't
necessarily critically reflect on their
experiences some of them are escaping
and just kind of trying to assimilate in
a culture it as quickly as possible but
in their backgrounds and it was
interesting about this Filipino American
man is that he didn't really think about
his identity even after having been in
Vietnam and having had the experiences
he had until he had grandchildren and
then he began thinking about what was he
going to tell his grandchildren what
what identities what do we know about
filipinas well such as not much right
right as it was wiped out colonial
experience virtually like them I mean it
was kept some circles of course but for
much of the population it was just
expressed many of the filipinos that I
work with talk about the absence of
presents the absence of presence and
part of the challenge of doing the kind
of education on historical work they do
is to try to try to make something
tangible and real because it's all been
wiped out the archives are gone the
stories are kind of suppressed people
don't talk about the true everywhere men
take say Korea as South Korea is
becoming democratized it's also bringing
up memories of things that happened
earlier which had been suppressed like
the Jeju Island massacre which was never
discussed for years but now it's a big
issue on the
and the conference that every year that
are trying to admit spreading through
the population what happened none of
these issues because it gets suppressed
for a long time actually I noticed this
number of places happened in Europe I
happen to have gone why did go to both
Spain and Greece shortly after the
dictatorships were overthrown and young
people just had no idea what the
background was I mean if he years later
it's beginning to come out but if you
talked about what happened in Barcelona
and 1939 I remembered vividly but only
people my age knew Sam agrees talk about
the Greek Civil War people my age
remembered but hadn't talked about it
for years because she just couldn't talk
about those things and their children so
you have to kind of recover a history
which is not that far back in these
cases saimin yeah one of my students is
taking one of our courses and was
reading a history book and and there was
a reference to it I think as a Bruce
Cummings history and chido was mentioned
and she suddenly realized that because
her family was from Chad Reed oh and her
grandfather had disappeared and died at
a certain point that was what had
happened is that you know it's a very
powerful insight but the family itself
didn't talk about it no unico
connections to go but I remembered from
my own child my parents never talked
about Eastern Europe actually my mother
was too young but my father was there
till he was 17 but it was just one of
those things you didn't talk about so
part of the kind of irony or difficulty
of being a migrant in this country is
that on the one hand you have that
family experience often times but then
it's also too often times erased or in
order that the become of these are all
different circumstances in the Korean
filipina a Spanish Greek case I mean it
was suppressed in the home country
under dictatorships and military rule
and the fascist governments and so on
which may adds an extra layer of
difficulty to recovering it has to be
recovered in the home country which is
not so easy thanks you you write about
the necessity to develop a critical
comprehensive or comprehension of
reality I guess part of what what's
interesting about the Asian American
experience is that the experiences are
not self-evident but as people begin to
look into their own family histories and
their own backgrounds this is where is
that kind of what you mean by the kind
of work well it's yeah and it's pity
it's there are a lot of specific
problems in the asian-american case and
that in in complicated ways in Asia has
been different parts of Asia depending
on what year it is are demonized in the
in the united states to an extreme
extent this goes way back it course
varies depends who the Allies are movie
enemies or but it's kind of a
generalized demonization of asians which
isn't differentiated much in the popular
culture even though it may be in policy
which just affects everyone on the one
hand will be a demonization of the bad
Asians but then there's always some kind
of group whether it's Chinese or Chapman
Japanese Americans are Chinese Americans
from one moment to the next or let's say
in South Vietnam those were
collaborators and therefore the good
days but you know I think in the popular
in the general popular culture these
differentiation joint clear to people in
fact it's important to understand that
the United States itself is an extremely
insular country I mean most people don't
know anything about the outside world
and they can't distinguish who you're
for and who you're against I remember
take a recent case one of the major wars
in the 1980s was nicaragua's that
they issue all over the newspapers
couldn't miss it everyone though it's a
huge issue well my wife and I were went
down number of times I and Erica we had
friends who people who have college
degrees you know educated people who
assumed that we were visiting the
Contras the reason is that the u.s.
ports governments and they know we're
these kind of crazy types of funny ideas
so we must be visiting the guerrillas
you know this is the lead issue in the
newspapers and they know which side the
US government was on just imagine if
people who don't even barely know where
Asia is they're trying to sort out who
are the friends and who are the enemies
more recently there are a lot of
asian-american students on campuses the
stirring school business at NYU for
example is fifty sixty percent
asian-americans in among their students
and the representation is that from Asia
or from no Asian American Asian
Americans many of them 1.5 hours yes
yeah and there's a popular
representation especially among
neoconservatives of Asian Americans as
kind of the motto minority used as a way
to point to poor African Americans and
Latinos as well these are examples of a
minority and they've helped themselves
etc etc and you know how would I mean
how would you understand that in the
global context that
I'm Emma there are striking differences
that they didn't come from the same
experience as Latinos and blacks the and
they tend of reminiscent of the Jewish
minorities tend to be educational
oriented hard-working quiet obedient and
you don't pay attention to the splits
within the community so you know who
goes down to the poor neighborhoods
where asian americans live but the ones
who make it to NY you do come from a
education oriented upward oriented
community so they can be you know held
as you say as a kind of weapon against
others why don't you do it if they do it
that's which puts them in an especially
difficult position for one thing it's
not represented of the Asian American
community well many of them also come
from backgrounds that's in Korea where
the the parents actually enjoyed kind of
american-style education as it was
instituted after the war in in South
Korea same with Japan same with Taiwan
other places and so many ways they're
already very comfortable with kind of
western-style education and oftentimes
in the came to this country they they
sacrificed quite a bit for the children
because they were at a higher
professional level and then they end up
operating a greengrocer in the case of
many Korean Americans or your child goes
to NYU right now but the crowd goes down
why you and it puts a lot of pressure as
you can imagine on the children too
because the parents are expressing it
well through sacrificing themselves for
their children the children then feel
that they need to honor their parents in
that love at the same time they feel the
need to become a part of American
culture stricken just strike out to get
some freedom from that kind of authority
many of these parents are fairly
authoritarian coming from authoritarian
governments and cultures and cultures
yeah yeah so what would you say I mean
what would you say to some
because it can't tell people that live
their lives I don't give advice to my
own children not if I did they'd be
smart enough not to listen to well how I
mean maybe I should ask at a different
way which is if they're if they're
struggling to try to understand some of
that themselves many of them will kind
of work it out in terms of this personal
you know animosity or rebellion against
their parents but it seems to me that
they really did really come out of a
larger historical moment post-war put
post-world war two aja wars in Asia and
they've got a difficult relationship
with this country in this culture in
many ways yeah that could turn out to be
more difficult because they the
conflicts are simmering and could blow
up again I mean the potential us-china
conflict is right beneath the surface us
planners regard China as a serious
potential enemy there's concern that the
whole northeast asia region might strike
out in its own it's a rich developing
region and those are likely to be
they're going to live with those
problems very likely they may take a
more serious for so I better figure out
ways of resolving them some economists
are projecting that in 2020 Chinese
economy will be the same size as the US
economy if it continues to grow
obviously with the Czar's incessantly
that's sorry I actually I think one
should see is reflecting another sort of
hidden problem in China and that is that
the since the reforms are sort of market
reforms have been taking place the a lot
of the socials of the support system has
collapsed so the health system is pretty
well gone actually was recently a study
done by a Harvard University group and
Harvard Medical School and the Beijing
University want some University they are
medical school trying to see if they
could give a realistic analysis of
growth rates
China if they took into account the loss
of support systems so if you lose your
health support system and you have to
deal with it yourself that's a cost and
it growth declines if you take that in
so they try it's a tricky study but they
tried to do an estimate and you know
their figures were not impressive I mean
it by their analysis Chinese growth
rates were very low if you took into
account the collapse of pension system
sports and health systems and so on and
I I strongly you know China so secretive
Gary figure out what's going on very
well and the statistics are probably
very dubious but it's very likely i
suspect that the Czar's concerns have to
do with the collapse of a preventive
health system I mean whatever one thinks
about Maoist China it had pretty
successful health outcomes actually it's
interesting the way this is dealt with
here the the main person who studied the
economist who studied the famines and
social policy and their effects as a
march ascent won the Nobel Prize for
this work the very important work half
of his work is known the other half
which is in the same papers is not known
what his main studies he and his
colleagues andrez compared China and
India which is good comparison I mean
they both colonized became independent
same time late 40s and they were sent
you know different countries large
caucuses yeah similar in many ways
levels of development so on well he he
one of his main contributions was
studying the main that terrible Chinese
famine in the nineteen fifty eight sixty
when maybe 20 million people died big
terrible famine and he treats that as a
political crime basically an ideological
crime it's not that the center wanted to
kill people it's that
they didn't get any information to tell
tarian society you don't get a flow of
information up and back and simply
didn't know what was happening and the
critical commentary and they couldn't do
anything about in India he points out
which is a capitalist democratic society
the did get information so there were
flows of information up and back and
criticism and so on in India never
suffered to any such famines after the
British were kicked out there are plenty
of them before but since independence
hadn't had a major famine and this is
the well-known part of artisans work
shows how awful the communist or take a
look at the same papers and the other
half of the paper doesn't different
analysis it compares mortality rates in
india and china since independence bone
china they went way down because they
instituted rural health programs and
barefoot doctors and preventive medicine
for the huge overwhelmingly rural
population in India they did they
followed capitalist principles you know
doing it for people to do it on their
own well turns out that the death rates
in India declined much more slowly and
if you look at the gap well I'll just
quote their own conclusion what they say
is every eight years India put as many
skeletons in its closet as China did
during its years of shame meaning during
the period that they studied 1947 the
1979 that's a hundred million extra
deaths in India well that's pretty
serious and that's also they treat that
as an ideological crime to comes from
government policies now you could have
carried out preventive medicine and
rural health care and so on but they did
without half of the study is unknown
unreported when Sen got his Nobel Prize
I had see a single mention of it and
it's hard to miss it's in the same
papers you know the same books but it
doesn't fit the requirement that's our
ideological crime I can fit our
ideological requirement
anyway going back to China that system
has been lost and in fact their study
san andreas goes a little beyond 79 and
they say that at the very beginning of
the reform period 79 the death rate
started the decline slowed you know
whether that continued I don't know but
if these facts are taken into account
get a rather different picture and I
strongly suspect that the Tsar's have it
epidemic has to be looked at in that
context and there's concern that if it
spreads to the countryside where the
health support systems of freshly
collapse that could be a catastrophe now
part of which are pointing out is that
usual indicators of economic development
don't take into account people's
well-being health care and there is an
effort with done bae hawk and sin and
others too and it's now part of the UN
program to construct an annual Human
Development Index which is different
from the growth index and that it's
takes into account a few things like I
think literacy infant mortality maybe
one or two other things and if countries
are ranked in human development it looks
quite different from economic growth the
growth is a very funny notion you know
there's much to do with most of the
population and effect take Chinese
growth the China China's growth
statistics are very high but to be
serious about it have to ask how much of
it is foreign own growth right and it
turns out if you look at the real growth
areas of China plenty of its for
investment overseas Chinese Japanese us
others it's also very urban as opposed
to more it's very room it leaves that
most of the population there's like 900
million people out there who may be
devastated if the big question now in
the world trade system is whether China
is going to agree to open its to open
its economy to agricultural
imports from the United States in Europe
well these are highly subsidized
technologically advanced agribusiness
exports which no peasant society can
possibly compete with there are the
subsidies then on support and so on so
I'll be wiped out right but that means
hundreds of millions of people will be
you know testitude what happens to that
they'll become dependent on these other
good the economy does what about the
producers and a peasant agriculture
happens to be highly productive and very
effective but it cannot compete with
subsidized high-tech agribusiness that's
very possible the same things happening
in Mexico right the and in fact all over
the world peasant communities are being
devastated by the fact that they can't
although they may be highly productive
and they are and think very often when
scientific agriculture is at school
comes into some third world area a
production actually declines because
peasant agriculture which is the product
of centuries or millennia of development
the study selection I'm picking their
developing seeds and so on and so forth
turns out to be really productive I mean
people though you know this seeds you
plant under this rock because the Sun
hits in the afternoon and so on and so
forth that's all gone when you have
scientific usually monocrop agriculture
furthermore peasant the peasant
agriculture tradition though it's very
rich is unknown the reason it's unknown
as it's a woman's culture it goes from
mother to daughter so you know in the
right in the society people don't know
what it is the daughter knows what it is
because their mother taught her and it
develops over long periods extremely
rich and extremely fragile if you
eliminated it's gone well there's also
the move of let's say US corporations to
take let's say certain varieties of
basmati rice from local indications
happen and forth the modify them
slightly force them back under
subsidized exports which destroys the
peasant society actually sometimes more
brutal than that i was in southern
Colombia not long ago where in fact
chemical warfare is going on they call
it fumigation but it's just another form
of chemical warfare now what it's just
doing is destroying peasant communities
I mean it's driving peasants off the
land these again are rich at traditional
peasant communities with highly
complicated and rich agriculture but
it's an extremely fragile system one
generation is enough to kill it it's
closely connected to the in Colombia
turns out very rich biodiversity so it's
all integrated with that but the via
diversity is also being destroyed but I
chemical warfare and other operations
and you know you drive the peasants off
the land by what's called fumigation
they join them several million people
rotting in urban slums mining companies
come in and strip mine the mountains
once the these are indigenous people
come see knows afro-american viens ones
there a way that mining companies can
come in freely the drilling companies
come in you can put a dance you know
flooding big areas for hydroelectric
power for you know political free export
zones foreign industries and the peasant
society has gone the lot of the
biodiversity is destroyed I end up with
you know violent a tremendous violence
as you'd expect that you've got 20
political assassinations a day by now
and then as far as the agricultural
areas are concerned what either the
alternative ranches for you know cattle
raising or anything or else monocrop
agro export using the monsanto
genetically modified seeds which will go
somewhere and the creation of
shantytowns and he's extended or right
go after the urban areas and so in fact
the people it's it's it's like many
countries some of the people most of a
lot of the wealthier part of the
population is completely unaware I mean
I've had Colombian students who learned
about Columbia when they came here and
they hurt people you know like me and
others giving talks about and they went
back its oh yeah that's the other corner
of town I mean you know it's plenty of
people in downtown Manhattan like you
know what's going on a mile away right
what do we know about the homeless it's
not just a home was the way people live
I mean I've you know walk through parts
of Manhattan which looked at some of the
worst parts of the wood third world you
just don't see him it said the same in
Boston same everywhere on my own
children no didn't see it really a poor
person in a serious sense so we happen
to take him to Tijuana once and they
were kind of shocked that you know
people lived like this well in fact they
live like this just a couple of miles
away from where we live but who sees
that we recently were doing some
teachings around in Indonesia and
looking at the obviously Indonesia is
where the largest is the largest Islamic
you know nation in the world but also
it's clearly a kind of a non going hot
spot in terms of us conglomerate and
global conglomerate interest so there's
gas and oil there's also the natural
resources of the forestry and they're
indigenous which is a devastate and it's
being destroyed actually but most by
Asian exporters tie others are just
wiping out the forest illegally no
further woods for the wood a teakwood
something like that it's illegal but now
Indonesia has laws about it but nobody's
enforcing them and that can have out
that's kind of like the destruction of
the Amazon you know it's very dangerous
they're being sold at pier one and other
places like that in the name of kind of
being able to have middle class access
to liquor that there's a kind of a
background there which is also
it's amazing that its wealth striking
that it's not known here I mean the the
United States relations to Indonesia are
pretty complex Indonesia was a central
focus of u.s. tension back in the late
1940s in fact the Planning Commission's
called of the major issue in Asia in
1958 this is kind of an it's public
information but nobody knows it the US
carried out the the Eisenhower
administration carried out the largest
clandestine subversive operation in
post-war history to try to destroy
Indonesia to break it up to separate the
outer islands they supported a military
revolt to strip the outer islands away
from Indonesia the outer islands were
most of the wealthy resources and the
reason was that the Indonesian
government was becoming too independent
as pillar of the non-aligned movement
which was dated and also to democratic
the Indonesian government the sort of an
autocracy was allowing a political party
of the poor to function and it was
picking up support if you look at that
now be classic declassified US records
they're very concerned about that they
thought they were going to get dominant
support within a quasi democratic
political system so therefore that
system had to be destroyed and the were
there was attempt in 1958 to split it up
by force that didn't work us then turned
the supporting the generals by 1965
there was a military coup support the
coup which killed and nobody knows but
maybe a million people in a couple of
months you know hundreds of thousands
certainly a huge Massacre a CIA called
it the one of the worst mass murders of
the 20th century comparable to Stalin
and Hitler it was greeted with complete
it was reported accurately pretty
accurately I was greeted with total
euphoria
I mean the Time magazine had a an issue
which had on the front cover something
like boiling blood bath and then it just
reveled in this wonderful massacre of
hundreds of thousands of people I mean
it mostly landless peasants destroyed
the one political party mass based
political party and opened the country
to foreign robbery for an investment
after that general suharto ranit
compiled one of the most grotesque human
rights records in the world he was held
here as a wonderful person the Clinton
administration described them as our
kind of guy they invaded East Timor with
enormous us port Carter Administration
that since wiped out maybe a third of
the population there pretty much
depressed you know I mean figure it out
if he looked but almost nobody knows and
that goes right on until nineteen ninety
nine finally the u.s. Suharto lost his
usefulness he began dragging his feet on
IMF worders and he was sort of losing
control the population that was popular
revolt brewing a lot of it by students
actually a lot of it using the internet
it's one of the first internet
revolutions because they could
communicate around the you know the
official system x 1998 the US was giving
up on support though he got a phone call
from madeleine albright secretary of
state saying the u.s. believes it's time
for a democratic transition four hours
later he resigned no it's not cause and
effect but it does reflect the power
relations try to find some comment here
asking why they hadn't had a Democrat
Rick democratic tradition since nineteen
fifty-eight well no that's part of
history wipe out why did why the
euphoria about one of the biggest
massacres and it is in the 20th century
which is instantly entirely open you
know it's a well but you know all of
that and what it means is gone so when
you talk about Indonesia yes a lot of
complicated things
and it's a little like the Philippines a
lot of Indonesia's don't know that this
incorrectly because there were 100 100
thousand political prisoners you know
the major writers in the country were in
prison they couldn't know we could talk
about it you know it's and it's you know
you have to recover your own history and
historical understanding and put it in
the context the world affairs which is
not so simple yeah part of the pattern
of asians in the US has been when US is
involved in a foreign policy
intervention of one kind or another at
them and in some cases it's people who
were suppressed and actually are
important intellectuals you know coming
here but in any case arriving here and
their children settling here and
arriving here and then their children
are really cut off from any kind of
understanding well they were cut off in
their own countries because of the
repressive regimes sometimes really
brutal ones when they come here they
find that history's going they have to
recover it but just like young students
here if they want to understand anything
about u.s. history they're going to have
to discover it it's not going to be
taught to them in schools right we
really have about five minutes left but
I thought it'd be useful to talk about
one holy a little bit in this context
because in many ways he's an example of
that he's a very successful kind of
model minority in a certain sense who
who who came as a foreign student
married here had children here became a
naturalized citizen became quite
successful loving mathematics really
worked on nuclear arms you know in Los
Alamos but then what happened to him in
some ways I think it's been quite a rude
awakening for a lot of professionals
Asian Americans in this country so yeah
you know these racist and other factors
and often intermingled with political
internet international political
conflict or right or the service doesn't
take much for them to emerge I mean oh
look there I wouldn't be if you let's
take a hypothetical situation closer to
me personally if the United States
turned against Israel which it could
there can be a major wave of NT Senate
the United States hasn't existed for
maybe 30 years but 40 years but it could
come back it's joel these things are
barely below the surface well when the
US by plane got shot over China yeah all
of a sudden in this country there are
causing boycotts of Walmart because
they're selling goods made from China
and boycotts of Chinese restaurants and
on suppose that China does begin to take
what looks like an independent course
there's a lot of concern I mean US
military planning is oriented towards a
potential Chinese thread so what's
called missile defense which is nothing
to do with defense but it's understood
by both the Chinese and by the u.s. to
be a first strike weapon aimed the China
not anybody else yeah and of course part
of concern I mean even if let's say
Chinese Americans were pro us and and
didn't ever care about so what does pro
us meet and interact I'm crew us but
against the US government you know it
depends what you mean think us is right
the population is it the culture of the
society state policy and it's a very
interesting concept so it's really as
totalitarian roots this whole concept of
anti-american or pro us and so on it is
presupposes that the society the culture
and its people should be identified with
state policy and that's something that
should be dismantled yeah so we're us is
to I don't like the use okay yeah yeah
yeah you know there are a lot of Asian
Americans who really come out of more
conservative backgrounds they're
supporting us point policy and but they
find the contradiction when they're here
in terms of their being entirely
vulnerable to to racism but also feeling
quite vulnerable I mean many chinese
americans believe that if there was a
war with china or china was declared an
axis of evil be they would have interned
just like the Japanese Americans yeah
yeah I'm you know it's not going to
duplicate it but the other the hysteria
over China has been extreme the Red
Chinese were the Super demons in the
1950s what kind of fantasies concocted
about what they're planning to do to
Americans you know tournament the drug
addict so that particular thing was
particularly ironic because it's the
West that churned China into drug
addicts by force but that's been
forgotten now there were fantasies about
them going to turn us into drug addicts
and that could easily come back just
like these stories about the Hispanic
narco-traffickers were stimulated and
built up in the late 80s mostly for
domestic and international political
reasons and doesn't take long and these
population very susceptible to that kind
of growth began to it's worth bearing in
mind that for whatever reason I don't
know what the reason is we speculate but
the United States happens to be a very
frightened society and has been for a
long time I'm an actually goes back to
colonial history but in the modern
period it's dramatic i mean i remember
my own children in school and background
night early sixties being taught to hide
under desks Chuck uncovering how protect
themselves from Adam violence which are
going to come from China probably russia
or someplace there's no other i don't
think there's any other country in the
world would any kind of such lunacy took
place but it's a strain that runs right
through the culture and as always
apparently below the surface it's a
large part of the gun culture is based
on that I mean playing people really
think they need guns to protect
themselves from and you see who they're
protecting themselves from other parts
of the country where people are
protecting themselves from the United
Nations which is sending black
helicopters over to carry out their
plans of
Native Americans or aliens the sphere of
aliens and of course communists whoever
the current enemy happens to be but
these are strains that are just beneath
the surface and they can show up in very
ugly ways right okay we're going to need
to wrap up this segment but let it open
up for questions and comments so um name
is Charles Ehlinger I wanted to ask if
you could expand on two things in China
one being I understand that while as a
rapid growth it's going to investors and
D communist party operatives but not so
much to the peasants to the extent that
I've been told that there have been some
physical uprisings in the country and
that it might actually be a forbearer of
a revolution this is according to a
group called China Study in New York
City and then the other question would
be I'll move into Afghanistan and seems
to be people say we're trying to control
oil and perhaps other resources in that
area where does China fit in as far as
its needs for oil does it have its own
support or will it be possibly a problem
with AmeriCorps over control of that
area well what's going on in the
interior of China people really don't
know much about but there have been
reports there is other have been some
speculation that China might go back to
a period of mass peasant revolts mass
peasant revolts against the central
authority that's a large part of Chinese
history not quite big ones it's
conceivable because the peasant
population is in a serious situation a
lot of people being driven off the land
already they're becoming highly
exploited labor in very ugly
circumstances in the growth areas the
industrial areas which are split the
Chinese growth has benefited a large
part of the population but it is also
devastated art to and how this is going
to play out nobody knows the big effect
is likely
if they open themselves up to agora ex
work from the west the United States and
Europe that could lead to a very serious
problem and this decline of support
services could be pretty severe too so I
don't think these speculations are wild
we don't know that they could be
happening actually China has been
carrying out quite repressive policies
in many areas in this gets to
Afghanistan including the Muslim areas
in the in western China where there were
connections to things happening in
Central Asia even people moving up and
back and that repression which is pretty
severe has been supported by the United
States since number 11th I'm September
11th gave a kind of a give a free reign
to repressive governments all around the
world to become more repressive so
Russia and Chechnya China and western
China with authorization from Washington
no they call it counterterrorism but
that actually is a link I mean China was
involved in Afghanistan China and Iran
were involved in the 70s against the
domestic more or less by the late
seventies russian-backed government as
part of their whole you know
international games even before the US
got in serious on this sort of like late
seventies and the connections have
continued China has great interests in
Central Asia and naturally borders on
them and the the the energy sources are
a crucial issue the US has always since
the Second World War committed itself to
controlling Middle East oil because it's
the main resource in the world and it's
kind of a leader of world control on the
other hand the eastern Siberia has a
substantial mainly gas but also oil
resources which China needs and so to
South Korea that's a large part of the
North Korean problem is that it's right
in the middle of all of this these areas
Russia
because of its eastern Siberia and
resources China big developing society
with resources of its own Japan and
South Korea huge industrial countries
they're all integrated and they could
the resources of the area could you
independent a degree of Independence
maybe hi independence then comes the
question of who picks up but you know
the Central Asian resources which are
not on the scale of the Persian Gulf but
are substantial so yes this is these are
major concerns for planners and could be
large parts of future evolving policy
it's only as far as Afghanistan is
concerned the US didn't go in there
because it wants oil there's nothing
much in Afghanistan you know they could
use a pipeline but it's a secondary
issue I think too much was made of that
the u.s. does want military bases there
and also in Central Asia but that's
because of Central Asia and the Persian
Gulf it seems a common theme in an
oppressive situation whether it's in a
family or whether in a society is the
the power of silence certainly in a
family unit if there's some type of
abuse going on or whatever there's that
strong network of keeping people quiet
and then it spills out could you talk
about the power of silence a little bit
is that from humaneness is that from a
societal thing where does that come from
well it certainly is pervasive I mean
the domestic abuse issue is a remarkable
example of it i I didn't myself in
knowing much about it until very
recently what happened to have learned
about it and I've just been shocked I
would have discovered I mean in my own
town which is a professional educated
relatively wealthy town everybody's it
turns out I often wondered what the
police do in that down there's nothing
to accept chase lost cats or prevent the
black kids from coming in in a
dilapidated car they're kind of I got
word or police but it turns out that
they have two or three cases a week
where they're actually called to you
know by a 911 gets into a home for a
domestic abuse cases I mean never guess
that this could have happened here and
yes it's silent I had silenced within
families the inside silence among
friends I mean I have a close friend who
happens to be a radical woman lawyer who
works in a radical law office a lot of
it on feminist issues one of her
colleagues was coming in bruges and they
suspected that some problems taking
place which did nothing she was killed
right in the middle of the most you know
sophisticated to conscious area and I
tell you I can remember that from
childhood to we said I was an immigrant
community we happened to be the only
Jewish family in a mostly Irish and
German Catholic neighborhood was the
1930s very anti-semitic the street life
for myself and my younger brother to
Jewish boys was a tricky issue you know
because because the anti-semitism was
extreme we never told her parents about
it I don't think our parents ever knew
till there till they died and they never
knew what life was like in our own
neighborhood you just didn't talk to
your parents about those things and they
didn't talk to you about things and and
this is inside families you know closely
knit families when you go beyond well
you know the things we've been talking
about silence about the crimes stories
that aren't ideologically acceptable and
so on it's overwhelming in fact one of
the well as you know when the women's
movement began in serious a serious way
in the late sixties early seventies a
lot it was just
telling the truth better so you know
let's face the truth better own lives
because we've been silent about it we
talked about it's just accepted as the
norm if you bring out what actually what
your life is actually like to yourself
it can be revolutionary we we only have
just a minute left unfortunately but one
of the quotes that you refer to is John
Dewey in your miss education book and
I'll just read it the ultimate aim of
production is not production of goals or
goods i'm sorry but the production of
free human beings associated with one
another on terms of equality could you
just maybe end with a few comments about
that well john dewey was the leading
american social philosopher was also by
our standards pretty radical I mean he I
think his positions correct Bertrand
Russell took very similar positions and
yes a decent education ought to be
creating free independent creative human
beings it doesn't have to be developing
them has to be allowing them to follow
those natural instincts there's a
natural among children the educational
system has to beat it out of them and
make them obedient and subordinate and
so on but a decent educational system
would be would allow these natural
aspects of human nature to flourish and
encourage them and it would be part of
developing a free and democratic society
of real participation but of course that
runs counter to elite interests the
worth remembering that the United States
was not founded to be a Democratic
Society and elites do not want it to be
a Democratic Society it's supposed to be
what political scientists sometimes
called a polyarchy system basically of a
leap decision and public ratification
and if you had the kind of
educational system that do we spend his
life committed to you wouldn't be able
to sustain that people would become
active involved engaged and would try to
create a truly functioning democratic
society which would as do we also
pointed out require industrial democracy
that means democratizing production
Commerce and so on which means
eliminating the whole structure of
capitalist hierarchy his positions were
moved he's very mainstream Main Street
America but radical from the point of
view of prevailing doctrine and I think
he's quite right about that in fact just
to go to politics do he also pointed out
that until that's done unless that's
done politics will remain what he called
the shadow cast by business over society
and the educational system will be a
system of indoctrination control I was
lucky as a kid to be sent to a do at
school and I was quite quite an exciting
experience on that note we have to wrap
up but thank you very much
you
