i've been asked to
make some comments about democracy and
human rights with reference to the
asia south asia context
the revival of asia in recent years is a
remarkable
phenomenon has enormous significance for
the future
and the word revival of course is
appropriate because as we all know as
late as the 18th century
china and india not only had an
unusually
rich and vibrant political
cultural history but they were also the
most advanced
economies in the world at the time
europe was still a developing fringe
in fact it was borrowing more advanced
technology from asia
in ways which are now barred as piracy
as
the west adopts what economic historians
call kicking away the latter that is
first you
climb up and then prevent others from
following the same course there are some
who
project that in the not too distant
future
asia may resume its dominant position in
world affairs
however realistic these projections may
be
the impact of colonization
and the torment of torment of
efforts to escape its legacy
have left asia with deep and even
awesome problems which are likely to be
exacerbated in coming years
as global warming proceeds in its
calamitous course
i would not presume to offer solutions
to these problems
a task that's beyond my competence
and would be out of place even if i had
the
depth of understanding that's required
instead in the hope that
this may be enlightening i would like to
reflect about the state of democracy
human rights in the world dominant
societies of the present and
recent past in western civilization
with its record of great achievements
and horrendous crimes as asia
knows all too well so let's begin with
the state of democracy in the west
it's very now and right now very
seriously contested
in election after election the centrist
political parties that have governed in
the
post world war ii period have been
weakened
or have been virtually eliminated along
with a rise in
what's been called illiberal democracy
democracy in form but very limited
function as autocracy deepens
the collapse of centrist institutions
has been accompanied by a rise of the
far
right as a political force it's a matter
of
no slight concern particularly in
central europe in the light of the
terrifying recent history well
while these tendencies have been
particularly striking in europe
they do extend to the united states as
well
the two traditional political parties
still
monopolize the political system but they
were
severely shaken in the last
2016 elections among republicans
in recent primaries the candidates who
emerged from the base
were utterly unacceptable to be
elites and were beaten back by the
republican establishment
uh 2016 was different for the first time
the establishment candidates were
crushed by
an outsider who they regarded with
fear and contempt although he
showed that despite offensive
antics he knew well how to serve the
primary constituency of the party
private wealth
and corporate corporate power
that task was assigned to the republican
congressional leadership which has
performed it
admirably profits are skyrocketing
while real wages continue to stagnate
and restraints on avarice or
eroding under rapid deregulation
less reported but more striking
was what happened to the democrats
the electoral victory of a billionaire
with
huge financial and media support
is not all that surprising but the
success of the bernie sanders campaign
actually broke with over a century of
u.s
political history he had virtually no
support from
private wealth or business power
he was either ignored or vilified in the
media
but nevertheless came very close to
winning the
democratic party nomination he was
blocked at the end by machinations of
party leader
leaders that's an astonishing departure
from a record of over a century of
elections that are mostly bought
political science research has
demonstrated very persuasively
that electability both for president and
congress
is predictable with remarkable precision
just from the single variable of
campaign
spending and a corollary result
is that the majority of the population
are literally disenfranchised in that
their own
representatives that disregard
their opinions and preferences they
listen to the voices of the donor class
looking forward
to the next election both
political parties were affected by the
same
powerful tendencies that are undermining
the
centrist institutions of european
democracy
these developments have given rise to
much commentary
about the dangers of what is called
populism
taken to be a serious threat to
functioning democracy good order
generally
and there have been many efforts by
analysts
to attribute the rise of such populism
throughout the
state capitalist world to various
psychic disorders one
popular version attributes them to
impulses i'm quoting
deep in our psyches and bodies beyond
matters of fact
fear of the future a sense of our own
mortality
however it's unnecessary to appeal to
an epidemic of irrationality that
uh and emotional appeals that has
mysteriously uh spread over the
domains that have been subjected to the
neoliberal policies of the past
generation
these policies have been designed to
sharply concentrate wealth enhance
corporate power undermine democratic
systems
which are reduced increasingly to
formalities
while the majority of the population
stagnate
so in the united states for example real
wages
for male workers today are actually
lower
than they were in 1979 when the
neoliberal onslaught was just in its
very early stages in europe
the attack on democracy is even stronger
major socioeconomic decisions are made
by the
unelected troika northern banks
looking over their shoulders throughout
the western world
the working people and the poor have
been essentially
cast aside that quite naturally breeds
anger bitterness and resentment
there are no mysteries here no need to
search deep into the psyche the
renowned economist thomas piketty and
his colleagues
have observed i'll quote them an economy
that fails to deliver growth for half of
its people
for an entire generation is bound to
generate
discontent with the status quo and a
rejection
of establishment politics so what's
happening is
no mystery it's also useful to remember
that democracy has always been a highly
contested
concept it's been feared and disdained
among
elites throughout the period of
democratic revival in the world now
that's been true
strikingly in the great democratic
revolutions
the first of these was in england mid
17th century
leading finally to what's called the
glorious revolution of
1688 in which the
rising bourgeoisie it gained power
through parliament at the expense of
royal prerogatives now it had a wide
variety of gains one of the major one
was
breaking the royal monopoly over the
lucrative
highly lucrative slave trade the slave
trade actually
provided the provider of course the
cheap cotton
which is what fueled the growing growth
of
manufacturing finance commerce
led to wealth and power particularly in
england and the liberated american
colonies the
major slave state there were those
who did not want to be ruled by either
king or parliament
probably the great mass of the
population
there are pamphlets and spokespersons
favored universal education
guaranteed health care democratization
of the law
as one of their critics ominously
observed i'll quote him
they preached seditious doctrine to the
people
and aimed to raise the rascal multitude
against all men of best quality in the
kingdom
to draw themselves into associations and
combinations with one another
against all lords gentry ministers
lawyer rich and peaceable men
particularly frightening were the
itinerant
workers and preachers calling for
freedom
and democracy the printers putting out
pamphlets questioning authority and its
mysteries
the worst was when the rebel
their pamphlets proclaimed that they did
not want to be ruled by
either king or parliament but rather by
countrymen like ourselves that nowhere
wants
their pamphlets explained that it will
never be a good world
while knights and gentlemen make us laws
and are chosen for fear and do but
oppress us
and do not know the people's source
these ideas naturally uphold
the men of best quality the rising
bourgeoisie of merchants and
manufacturers
they were willing to grant the people
some rights but
within limits after the democrats had
been
defeated john locke commented that
day laborers and tradesmen the spinsters
and demp dairy maids
must be told what to believe the
greatest part
cannot know and therefore they must
believe
something similar took place in the
second democratic revolution
a century later in the liberated
american colonies
although it's important to remember that
the american revolution
with all its flaws did advance
popular democracy quite considerably
the concept we the people
which is it was a revolutionary idea at
the time
however flawed it might have been in
implementation
during the 1780s during the
preparation of the u.s constitution
there was a
very impressive level of popular
activism and debate
pamphlets press meetings groups
even rebellions farmers protesting
economic injustice the delegates at the
constitutional convention were of course
from the elite
and they were concerned to suppress the
popular pressures for liberty and
democracy
the major figures in framing the
american constitution
were alexander hamilton and james
madison
and the basic concern of the framers of
the constitution was
captured lucidly by hamilton
he explained that the constitution is
designed
to be defense against depredations
which the democratic spirit is apt to
make
on property property is the
proper concern of government and madison
agreed
he argued at the constitutional
convention
that government must protect the
minority of the opulent
against the majority he warned that
if elections were open to all classes of
people
the property of the landed proprietors
would be insecure was mainly an
agricultural economy at the time
land reform would be passed
govern that should not be acceptable
government should
secure the permanent interests of the
country
which are property rights against
innovation
meaning a threat to them the land
holders ought to have a share in the
government
to support these invaluable interests
the system should be constituted so as
to protect
the minority of the opulent against the
majority
the senate ought to be the body that
ought to have
permanence permanency and stability
and the senate madison explained would
be drawn from
the wealth of the nation the more
capable
set of men people who have sympathy
for property and its rights and the
senate was to be the most powerful
branch of the government also insulated
from the people
and from democratic aspirations
the senate was not to be popularly
elected
in fact it was not popularly elected
until
1913 but was assumed to be under
elite control the whole story is a
complex one but it's in general fair to
say
that the framers did manage to carry out
what amounts to an elite coup
against the wishes of the general
population
in fact the major scholarly study
of the formation of the constitution is
appropriately called the framers coup
it details how the elite framers
called what the author carried out what
the author called
a conservative counter-revolution
against
too much democracy there have been
constant popular struggles ever since
to expand democracy many victories
but also a regular elite backlash
no time to run through the interesting
record
but the struggle is very much alive
today
popular struggles against the severe
neoliberal assault against democracy
and basic rights the outcomes are
sometimes unpleasant
economic distress throughout history
has opened the door to pathological
symptoms
that can be exploited by demagogues
racism white supremacy
xenophobia we see that today
strikingly in the savage reaction
in the western democracies to the waves
of
miserable people fleeing violence
and repression and grinding poverty
thousands of people are dying in the
mediterranean
fleeing africa for a refuge in europe
and europe has a certain record in
devastating the continent which i need
not review
the same is happening in the united
states
where the government has even descended
to separating
children from their parents and families
and dispatching them to virtual
concentration camps in the desert
in an effort to deter people who are
still fleeing
from the catastrophic effect of ronald
reagan's terrorist wars in central
america
and new waves are being engendered by
the
obama clinton support for the military
dictatorship
that refu that overthrew the reformist
government of honduras in 2009
leading to a sharp escalation and brutal
violence
that's the main source of refugees today
the u.s run drug war which has had
no effect whatsoever on use or
flow of drugs has subjected much of
latin america
to terrifying violence
those who flee are brutally rejected
in gross violation of international law
pope francis has described the refugee
crisis
as being in fact a moral crisis
among the rich and privileged and he's
quite right and one can scarcely
imagine the refugee crisis that the
world will be facing
in a few years when rising sea levels
drive huge numbers of people from the
low-lying
plains of bangladesh or when water
supplies in
south asia which are already under
severe stress
are further depleted by rising
temperatures
melting the glaciers also making much of
the region
virtually unlivable and perhaps may
even set two nuclear powers
at each other's throats with
consequences that are unthinkable
it's all too easy to project disasters
but it should never be forgotten that
there are solutions within reach
solutions that would at least mitigate
severe threats
might even pave the way to a world of
much
greater freedom and justice
solutions are within reach but to make
uni
to make use of the opportunities that
exist
will be no small task and
failure to do so is a predicted
prescription for severe catastrophe
