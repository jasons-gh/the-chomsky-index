inside the system have you changes by
hiding people that elected well you know
there's nothing wrong with it I mean if
you can get a senator who's a nice guy
that's better than having senators or
rotten guy but there are very sharp
limits on what you can do I mean these
are institutional things like say take a
corporation
I suppose the chairman of Ford decided
to cut back profits and to use them to
improve working conditions and to make
safer cars and you know put resources
into you know ten cars ten years from
now that won't break the environment so
on what if what'll happen to him well
for one thing you're probably ought to
be put in jail because it's illegal he
is he has a legal responsibility to
maximize profit and market share for his
shareholders well he wouldn't be put in
jail but he'd surely be kicked out and
somebody else would replace him who
would do the right thing and in fact if
by some miracle he did do what he set
out to do he'd be out of business in a
year because his competitors wouldn't be
doing it so they'd be under selling him
next year I mean these are institutional
facts some of the individuals in charge
may be you know very nice to their
children and friends and give a lot of
money to charity but it doesn't change
anything because they have to act within
an institutional framework which
requires vicious activity the head of a
corporation you've got to be any moral
monster otherwise you can't survive as a
head of a corporation if you're a part
of a state system you're part of the
Maffei the international affairs runs
like the Mafia you know it's the power
systems they get away with it already
can the United States is more violent
because it more powerful on if Andorra
had US military force they'd be doing
that happens to be the fact about the
way the world is well the world can
change and it has changed it's because
of the popular movements you know a lot
of ferment in the sixties developed much
more in the seventies in the 80s and
just changed the culture and that's the
way to change things
