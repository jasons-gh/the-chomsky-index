one of the features of contemporary
economic systems is what's called the
imposing flexibility and labor markets
that's considered a wonderful thing
labor markets are supposed to be
flexible it's a fancy way of seeing
saying you don't know when you go to
sleep at night whether they have a job
tomorrow morning and that can that
contributes to efficiency anybody who
has taken an economics course
understands that you get more efficiency
if people will have no security then all
what's going to happen to them tomorrow
then you can move around it's just like
a like a tool so if you get labor market
flexibility then you get a kind of
efficiency but of course as a cost for
example one of the costs is mental
illness the International Labour
Organization just did a study in which
they found that the incidence of mental
illness among workers has increased very
sharply which they attribute plausibly
to working insecure workers in security
on the other hand you can look at this
is a game so like when Alan Greenspan
had a Federal Reserve tells congress
about what a wonderful economy is
running theatre if it's a good part of
it the what he calls growing worker
insecurity because then people can't act
for they're afraid to ask for better
wages or more benefits and profits go up
and inflation stays down and you get a
fairytale economy except for the
population but you know their tools the
tools of production and the units of
consumption so they're doing their job
if that's what they do
