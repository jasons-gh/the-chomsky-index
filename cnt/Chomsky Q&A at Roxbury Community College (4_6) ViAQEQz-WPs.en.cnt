you
of interest here this really major media
outlets Israel well firstly I should say
that the individual reporters on the new
the student who were very courageous and
honorable work very hard to do it read
the reasons the heart through in Iraq is
it such a photo attachment that
reporters can't go into the field they
are stuck mostly in princeton from us a
doubt is surrounded by animators text
first work ever regis buso test use of
haze or words just couldn't get it out
from from profession when them to the
and our words of them really work
question is what happens when it gets
shape and design and selected to turn
into it you read okay then it ends up
being like what's right i made a lot of
reporters
internalize the Fed they come from the
educated classes food so they had
internalized pharmacy right but not mine
is my honor we've had one newspaper in
the world I was loud breathe at the new
york times in the world is the traitor
who should get the most
decoding ever remember is hard
I said yesterday that sort of thing but
if a attention you can run a lot of the
world I know that the end result is the
real problem I think is not false
reporting but it's rather than imperial
and talent try that is right which just
doesn't see things it doesn't see for
example that when you say you ran is
defying the whole world by taking the
position is supported by the majority of
the world but there's something wrong
somewhere they get to see that but we
can't do much the journals on Sam
separate of the case far as the insert a
lobbyist concerned over for the case of
Iraq that Israel was not particularly in
favor of the invasion of Iraq in fact
that thought it was a diversion from but
it really want they want to us attacking
us grant your wrath no fear I mean a
quake was made there I've been feared
the ice is going up in the world would
the people on the hated celebs into
afraid
and some Israel do that it's not a
military threat in fact in a way it's
kind of defense for Israel against Iran
which is a big powerful country that
they can control the only country in the
region that they can so they didn't like
the invasion of Iraq particularly
the record you'll find that the Israel
of again speaking up for the invasion
regret after they knew that the Russians
are doing months washington pronounced
early two thousand super come on after
the rack yet then first stage join in
and said better draft the best no that's
not that's not the tail wagging the dog
it's the tail following the book in
general the visitor lobby is important
Bobby but you have to be careful
me but to fail with this book by Waltons
near china so standard book on the
Israel lobby they begin by lying Bobby
that proper way they find the lobby the
people who commit themselves to
supporting policies the State of Israel
essentially no matter what ok that's a
good definition Pilate but there's an
effort a lot I mean like the New York
Times of course the globe Heart
University Polling lecture classes as a
member the lobby by Activision and not a
nun forever you can time it it's after
1967 after before nineteen sixty seven
of them was very much interested in
bidding even the house blew up reading
blew up a huge issue tested these are a
bit
7 but that is really a career in 1967
performed an enormous service of the
United States it eliminated secular Arab
nationalism and placed the u.s. client
Saudi Arabia the leader of radical
Islamic fundamentalism it secured their
dominance the region there was war going
on between secular our nationalism
represent the Nasr and radical Islamic
fundamentalist most extreme cases I
rated and he listens on these suicides
on the other side of the paper casting
and thus internationals Weston sir
threat to the US control of the energy
resources but this really put paid they
also not one of the props up from the
non-aligned movement wish to escape I
say they perform amazing service of the
United States Essman the relationship
between the US and Israel got really
tight strong durations and the only
electric less than alone they said
loving you
early but not before so is that part of
the Israel of her know we mean by me or
any other bodies that's very nobody TSA
they have to find their feet up your
enemies and kids are gonna decide
take it away marathon where it's a very
good example is your love okay let's
just take a look
north aurora CO contrary Alfred
right-wingers supers pro-zionist
phonetic up until nineteen sixty-seven
he didn't care medicine you want to find
out more about that reads book hit a
book called me Grady woods early
nineteen sixty-seven before the 67 war
is barely mentioned is good the contrary
magazine gnd editor it was actually
non-zionist 56 it was nothing not for
electricity so now if by the Israel
lobby you mean the electric class which
went along with state power station oh
yeah all right get back anytime if you
need a peck you know Zoltan register
blog
farber endurance listen to like they
they bribed a congressman people comes
and it looks closely the effect that
they have on progress which has been in
Saudi a life very closely by Stephen
zooms very good Billy scullery implanted
stuff on the internet it's a funny sort
of influence I mean on an issue where
nothing is going to happen but you know
there's no outcome people in Congress
will vote the way that wants them to
because the girls on my hands prestige
anyway so should be the capitalism men
does get implement it has something on
all kinda lobbies have fixed like they
say Armenian love they practically drove
the United States into a major
confrontation when its chief at last
couple months ago right here in Boston
and lobbies have influences and they
could be vigilant
as more of the most it doesn't begin to
compare with the Chamber of Commerce or
the Business Roundtable that cometh not
that all the same league but as a lobby
it has significant in fact one question
right of people who believe in the power
of you might ask themselves is supposed
to believe this is true especially which
is relevant really runs attorney against
anything against it well what you need
what are the tactical consequences of
that belief I think there are technical
consequences leprechauns millipedes
people like need you or stop wasting
their time that giving talks and its
repeal sign read books about it
information out focus the time because
of us everybody about what we want to be
doing is putting on our ties and jackets
going to the corporate headquarters of
Lockheed Martin Pinto ExxonMobil you
know more about it takes manhattan and
so on and explain to them patiently that
their interests are being harmed by a
lobby that they have put out a business
in 30 seconds with their political and
economic club that's the tactical
consequence is anybody to do percentages
to study crazy they don't think they're
interested in curt part they think this
is funny that's why you dealt with
invest in israel's are warren buffett
investigator lockheed martin things is
terrific well you know the man centers
of america capitalism
marine this affected a lot how many
learn what's all the national maybe I
mean you know there is something to
distort and the book is a valuable book
