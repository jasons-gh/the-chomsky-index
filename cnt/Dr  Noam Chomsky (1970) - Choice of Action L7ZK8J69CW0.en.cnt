have the the honor and function of
introducing new and Chomsky's evening
and the first of the responsibilities in
introducing anyone is to make
announcements I have an announcement
would you please announce that there
will be a meeting of those working on
the teaching against the war and the
Bloomington Peace Action Coalition on
Wednesday October 14th 7:30 p.m. in
Valentine all room 310 all interested
persons are urged to attend and the war
now jock Kendall and Rick Gerrity okay
the meeting is for announcing the plans
for a market on the football stadium to
Dunn meadow on October 31st anti-vietnam
Indochina war demonstration sponsored by
Bloomington Peace Action Coalition okay
I have two more functions in this
introduction the first would seem to me
to be to introduce to the audience the
speaker in regard to that function the
works of Noam Chomsky is so
fantastically extensive covering the
fields of linguistics mathematics
psychology sociology pedagogy philosophy
you name it and that is inconceivable
that anyone here needs to be introduced
to you already should know him certainly
through his works
the second function would be as a song
of praise for the speaker and noam
chomsky doesn't need it
I consider myself totally extraneous and
therefore hasten to introduce you
I think I have to begin by apologizing
for the state of my voice and asking you
to keep your fingers crossed that it
lasts through the through the talk it
will be touch-and-go I'm afraid that I
hope you'll be able to hear me I'm just
getting over kind of flu or something
it was suggested to me that I talk about
some aspect of the relationship between
intellectuals and their society and I
thought at first of speaking about this
in a rather general and abstract perhaps
if you like almost philosophic
way but decided against it decided that
I would rather concentrate on some more
concrete and immediate aspects of this
type of question the reason I think is
fairly obvious this particular question
the relation of intellectuals to their
society under a slight transformation we
might say as has become a very central
and significant one in current American
political debate it's obvious that as no
time in the past the university is now
the home of the American intellectual
community there are very few separate
independent centers of electrical life
outside of the university as there as
there were in the past
to a greater and greater extent this
ceases to be true therefore the problem
of the relation of the intellectuals to
their society become the large extent
the problem of the relation of the
universities to their society and this
is a trouble than topical
issue one which i think is of very great
significance in itself and the
resolution of this issue I think will
have enormous impact on American society
and because of the power and the threat
and the promise of America for the world
at large the title of this talk I don't
know if ever got announced or not is
choice of action the title was taken
stolen perhaps is a better word from a
recent book about a quite remarkable
group of French intellectuals who
emerged from the Second World War
resistance with the conviction in the
words of Sartre that we exist only if we
act a group that was determined not to
revert to the pre-war apathy and
resignation to what the author of the
book refers to as the permissiveness
towards history and those who were
leading it towards to task a--they and
the title of the book in turn is drawn
from an early manifesto of this group a
manifesto which announces a struggle not
quoting and a struggle against that
pathetic and prophetic spirit which is
becoming more widespread every day and
which demands of our contemporaries
blind decisions and painful commitments
it's not true that the world is divided
into two empires of good and evil it is
not true that we cannot think without
weakening nor be strong without talking
nonsense it is not true that good
intentions justify everything nor that
we have the right to the opposite of
what we want the comedy of history the
switching of roles and the frivolity of
the actors do not prevent us from
discerning a clear enough course of
action provided only that we take pains
to know what is going on rather
and there is phantasms and provided that
we distinguish anguish from anxiety and
commitment from fanaticism these remarks
which were enunciated 25 years ago have
a strikingly contemporary ring to them
transplanted across the Atlantic they
pose questions and I think give some
good advice that might be taken to heart
by by American intellectuals today there
is very definitely a pathetic and
prophetic spirit which is becoming more
widespread every day and is driving at
least some of our contemporaries to
blind decisions and painful commitments
then as now I'm afraid it's far too
optimistic to speak of a clear enough
course of action in fact even the
ambiguity of the title choice of action
even that ambiguity remains a prior
problem is it in fact at all proper for
an American intellectual today to choose
action rather than merely thought or
analysis or persuasion all of which are
certainly in short enough supply and if
he should decide to choose action then
what course of action is legitimate and
well designed to respond to the warnings
of that pathetic and prophetic spirit
that demands painful commitments and
decisions which if not strictly speaking
blind are nevertheless surely enshrouded
and missed as well as very often in
gloom the pathetic and prophetic spirit
that I have in mind is well expressed
for example by Kant's Morgenthau who can
hardly be written off as a radical or as
inexperienced or thoughtless he's
recently formulated an analysis of the
present situation of American society
which is virtually a call for revolution
although he didn't present it or perhaps
even intended precisely in that men
he writes that it should by now have
become obvious that the great issues of
our day the militarization of American
life the Vietnam War race conflicts
poverty the decay of the cities the
destruction of the natural environment
are not susceptible to rational
solutions within the existing system of
power relations these problems he writes
are a result not of accidental
misfortunes but of social and economic
policies in whose continuation powerful
social groups have a vested interest the
overriding single issue is the
distribution of power in American
society which has survived essentially
undisturbed all movements for reform
movements which appear in retrospect as
essentially futile attempts at
accomplishing through rational and
moderate reform what can be accomplished
only by a radical shift of power and
priorities either through the
disintegration of the existing power
structure or through revolution what is
interesting about such remarks is
particularly their source let me remind
you this is not Tom Hayden but hunt's
Morgan fellow employees American Society
he writes further has definitely chosen
to reject its rhetorical commitments as
equality and freedom and to use all the
means at its disposal to preserve the
existing system of injustice at home and
abroad as its ultimate purpose it is he
says the conformist subservience to
those in power that guarantees this
result the universities which is to say
the intellectual community are occasion
point and Morgenthau's strictures
regarding the universities can be read
as a critique as an indictment of the
American intellectual community as a
whole
given the fact that it is so centrally
located within the universities and in
fact identically to be identified almost
with the university
he says that the universities claim to
be dedicated to the disinterested search
for truth about man's Society in the
universe but they have transformed
themselves through the very dynamics of
their undertakings into gigantic and
indispensable service stations for the
for the powers that be both private and
public they serve society but do not sit
in judgment on it I think would be more
accurate to say that they serve not
society but the private and public power
that dominates society and that are
tightly interlocked he continues saying
much of what the University presents his
truth is either not proof at all or
truth only by accident
arrived at because it furnishes the
power is to be with ideological
rationalizations and justifications for
the status quo indictments of American
intellectuals in such terms are no
longer sound extreme and are no longer
confined to the fringes of the new left
in fact one doesn't have to look to the
huge laboratories defense laboratories
on-campus laboratories say that produce
counterinsurgency technology or advanced
guidance systems for new generations of
missiles one doesn't have to look to
such obvious examples as an index of the
politicization of American Universities
during the Cold War years it's enough in
fact it's far more revealing to consider
simply such matters as the choice of
research topics let me illustrate with
two rather dramatic I think rather
dramatic examples a couple of months ago
jacked the corn wad of Lomond wrote an
analysis of American research on
Thailand which was entitled Thailand
laboratory for counter-revolution give
you just a few words of background
Thailand
as you know of course has been the
Central American base for its Southeast
Asian operations for many years ever
since the brief attempt at parliamentary
democracy in 1946 was cut short shortly
after by a military coup with immediate
American support the Liberal Party
mentary reformer who had won that
election the only election in Thai
history he soon found his way to China
whereas the dictator the military
dictator who took over got quick and
extensive support from the United States
some historians regard this as ironic
because the liberal reformer who ended
up in China had actually worked with the
American OSS ahead of the freetype
guerrilla movement during the war while
the fascist dictator who took over with
American support was the person who
ruled Thailand under the Japanese
dictatorship and had declared war
against the United States but I think
people who regard that as ironic are two
formalistic you might say failing to
recognize I see no further comments of
necessary
since that time substantial American Aid
has maintained the dictatorship which is
brutal and venal in 1961-62 when the
path that loud gorillas were about to
take over Laos after the failure of were
really extremely clumsy American efforts
to subvert the the parliamentary
solution which was working quite
successfully in Laos but had the
unfortunate quality that it gave
significant power to the people who won
the elections namely the Communists
after after the failure of these efforts
at subversion when they pathid Lao are
about to take over the country the
United States did in substantial
military forces to Thailand as a threat
to try to prevent this in may 1964
Thailand was used as the base for the
bombing of Laos which began in that
month secretly and of course it was used
as a major base again secretly for the
bombing of North Vietnam and South
Vietnam which began in February
sixty-five nine months later since 1968
Thailand has been the major base for the
very intensive no longer secret but
still largely unknown a bombardment of
the civil society of Laos and South
Vietnam of course now Cambodia Thailand
has received a billion and a half
dollars in what is euphemistically
called aid in the past seven years it
has about forty thousand American troops
according to the recent congressional
hearings they're combating a threat of
aggression from China which at the
moment consists of 100 tiger illis who
were trained in China according to the
administration testimony that much is
background what the corn was discussing
in the articles that I'm referring to is
the academic contribution to this effort
the details are a little bit hard to
come by since this kind of academic
research is not entirely public
good deal of it's classified and a great
deal is inaccessible though unclassified
for example in the Arco library in
Bangkok what is known reveals that the
United States has undone putting now the
corn wah has undertaken extensive
studies aimed at acquiring a thorough
knowledge of the workings of Thai
society with the unstressed aim of more
easily controlling them continuing to
quote examination of the scottie
published information on these
activities together with certain
confidential or classified documents on
earth by American students last spring
in a useful choice of action this
examination throws some light on this
new type colonial policy and its use of
scholarly research for its own ends
research covered a broad range of
subjects among them village sociological
structure the functioning of miniature
listening devices in a tropical forest
the motivations of Thai policeman leach
eradication and the manoeuvrability of
light armored and flooded rice paddies
testing of heat changes in the forests
with the object of tracking down
guerrillas detailed studies of various
rubber plantations penetration
possibilities ground movements
visibility from the air through the
different types of foliage influence of
forests of various kinds on radio
transmission defoliation possibilities
detection of tunnels and concealed metal
objects uses of hovercraft clear load
dykes village studies techniques for
population and border control gadgets to
smell out the enemy as well as the
functioning of telecommunication systems
under tropical conditions study of
communication problems and under various
conditions of insurgency aerial
reconnaissance and infrared spotting
techniques computer analysis of
theoretical guerrilla attacks and
counterinsurgency tactics all pure
research as you see these programs are
under either arco which is the research
branch of the pet
or the aid program the aid program
defines its mission officially as a
quote from the a definition supporting
the Royal Thai government that its
efforts to contain control and eliminate
the communist insurgency in rural areas
aid in accordance with his program sets
up mobile police units with helicopters
and it sponsored studies of village
sociological structures to analyze the
human environment in which the
guerrillas operate in their terminology
it's concerned with such questions as
these I pick out a few is the prevailing
pattern of village organization in the
northeast adequate to cope with
insurgency what can be done the strength
in this pattern is there anything in the
village pattern a family organization
that's relevant to the promotion of
village security and so on these aid
programs are implemented by academic
scholars and university programs through
the medium of seed AG Southeast Asia
develop an advisory group and the
academic advisory committee for Thailand
these represent themselves as purely a
political research sponsorship
organizations and they take great
umbrage if anyone accuses them of having
a political purpose in fact if you look
at what they do one contract at the
University of California stipulates that
the University will compile all
available information concerning
research on Thailand and will organise
coordinate and conduct meeting seminars
or conferences under the sponsorship of
this academic Advisory Council with the
overall objective to support and
strengthen the operations of the u.s.
aid program and Thailand we call that
that goal is as the official objective
of supporting the Royal Thai government
in its efforts to contain control and
eliminate the communist insurgency in
rural areas this being of course an
essential component of American policy
in Southeast Asia so of the brief
syllogism you can
deduce how apolitical these research
efforts are that's one example of
value-free pure research in contrast let
me quote a paragraph from a forthcoming
article by David Horowitz who's been
interested for a number of years in
studying the role of American
corporations in domestic and foreign
policy he says that he writes the
following consider the following
organization it has a budget exceeding
fifteen billion dollars or four times
the gross national product of Cuba more
powerful than many sovereign states it
has a hundred and fifty thousand agents
organizers and hired hands operating 250
sub organizations in more than 50
countries it's part of an international
syndicate which controls the economic
lifeblood of half a dozen strategic
countries in the underdeveloped world in
itself that is a major political force
in the key electoral states of New York
Pennsylvania New Jersey and Texas and it
has close links with other syndicate
members which are major political forces
in California Ohio Louisiana Indiana and
elsewhere members also which are major
its agents and their associates occupied
the cabinet post of Secretary of State
in the administrations of Eisenhower
Kennedy and Johnson and at the same time
had influence in the CIA and other
foreign policymaking organizations of
government at the highest levels it has
its own intelligence and paramilitary
networks and a fleet of ships larger
than the greek navy it's not a secret
organization but it is run by a
self-perpetuating oligarchy whose
decisions and operations are secret and
these affect directly and significantly
the level of activity in the whole US
economy the organization as you probably
guessed is the Standard Oil Company of
New Jersey there can be no question as
to the front rank significance of this
corporation in the American economy or
in American politics yet there does not
exist a single independent academic
study of the operations of the Standard
Oil Company its relation to other
interest groups in the American economy
or polity or its impact on American
social political or I can
life generally nor is this lacunae and
the academic perception of corporate
power unique I mentioned these two
examples for an obvious reason a
comparison of academic research on
Thailand and on the Standard Oil Company
New Jersey comparison of the academic
research on both is quite illuminating
the conclusions to be drawn from this
comparison are sufficiently obvious so
that I will waste no time in drawing
them or discussing them but the
comparison does illustrate in a very
significant way I think many other
examples could be used to illustrate it
as well
the intense and overwhelming
politicization of the universities in
the past generation as they have
undergone what Morgan's out quite
correctly and accurately describes as a
process of conformist subservience to
those in power now a consideration of
this process of conformist subservience
which is quite undeniable and is quite
considerable in its proportions raises
some very pertinent questions for
intellectuals who are concerned with the
choice of action even in the narrow
sense of choice of action in the
professional domain and areas of
professional concern Peter Berger
several years ago remarked that as the
physicists are busy engineering the
world's annihilation the social
scientists can be entrusted with the
smaller mission of engineering the
world's consent their remark
the remark is quite untargeted and
characteristically it has been students
who have been in the forefront of the
recent challenge to the conformist
subservience the intense politicization
of the universities and who have been
asking quite properly and quite
belatedly in fact whether they should
willingly fit themselves into their
assigned place and engineering the
world's consent to the International
order designed by the ruling circles of
the great powers is it for example at
all proper to carry out research on
Thailand if it will be used as
undeniably it will to prop up a
particular ruling elite which quite
apart from its corruption and its
inequity quite apart from the fact that
it's now engaged in a massive effort to
pacify the Maiar tribesmen by driving
them from their mountain homes with
bombs and napalm quite apart from all
such things also happens to provide the
base for the long term American effort
to subjugate into China and dominate
Southeast Asia
an effort which I might add
parenthetically shows no signs in my
opinion of diminishing the corn wah and
the article that I referred to earlier
writes the object of the various
research projects carried out there in
Thailand is to lay the groundwork for
bringing the ties into the Japanese US
sphere of influence I have no doubt that
effectors seems clear that the evidence
is in fact overwhelming that this
judgment is accurate but even if let's
say I'm wrong about thinking that the
judgment is accurate is it not in fact
the legitimate question whether let's
say whether the weight of research about
a certain Society say Thailand or Harlem
or you take your choice whether the
weight of research about that society
should be outside of the control of that
society available not to members of that
society and there are democratic
structures if they exist but rather
available to those who in the larger
society domestic or international have
the power to make use of this research
for their own purposes these are very
important quest
and it's a scandal that the
consideration of them has been so long
delayed that is even now so marginal to
the concerns of most academic
intellectuals at least outside of the
student movement where questions of this
sort are very current in fact it's the
great merit of the student movement to
have insistently brought such questions
to general awareness and it's not too
surprising that the movement that has in
fact been in the forefront almost alone
one might say in trying to bring to an
end the intense politicization of the
universities is now accused of
introducing politicization into the
universities those who make that
accusation we're not concerned and still
are not concerned about the overwhelming
politicization of the past generation
which I've just mentioned a tiny facet
it's important to bear all of this in
mind I think now that the student
movement is under such intensive attack
for many quarters it's important to bear
in mind how profound that impact has
been during the decade of its renewed
existence as Kenneth Kenaston recently
pointed out research on student activism
has shown that it is overwhelmingly
related to the issues of war and racism
no one questions the significant
contribution enormous contribution one
might say of his student movements since
its earliest beginnings to the efforts
which still are only marginally
successful to overcome traditional
racist practices and structures and in
connection with the war the student
movement has in fact been virtually
alone certainly been the only organized
force in white American society and
taking a principled stand in opposition
to the war was plenty of opposition to
the war but I said a principled stand
and by that I mean opposition to the war
that's based not on its cost or not on
the fact that the United States probably
can't get away with what it's been
trying to do in Indochina but rather
opposition that's based on the principle
that the United States has neither the
authority nor the competence to use its
power to intervene in the internal
affair
of other societies as let's say in this
in its assault against the peasant
societies of Indochina or an it's more
successful counterinsurgency efforts in
Thailand and elsewhere
what's more this principled stand has
been reasonably successful not
unfortunately in fostering principled
opposition of the war among other
segments of the population there it has
been virtually without success but
rather in raising the domestic costs of
the war to the point where policymakers
have been forced to readjust their
tactics and to restrict somewhat at
least the means of destruction that they
would otherwise be free to employ this I
think is an achievement of historic
importance and I think one can say this
without exaggeration the survival in
fact of Indochina is problem to this day
may not continue to survive it has the
large extent been determined by this
principled opposition which has
difficult as it is to say given what has
happened there has to some extent
restrained the exercise of unlimited
American destructive power there this is
a striking example of the importance of
choosing action on the part of a segment
of the intellectual community mostly
students in this case choosing action in
place of the permissiveness towards
history and those who are leading it to
catastrophe a clear example of the
effectiveness of this choice of action
was the student strike last spring we do
not know and probably never will know
just what the Nixon administration had
in mind when it launched the invasion of
Cambodia
and we can't know for certain that there
were also plans for an invasion of
southern Laos but there's reason to
believe that both in Cambodia and Laos
much more destructive and massive
intervention might have been undertaken
and was probably planned had it not been
for the spontaneous student reaction
which incidentally had to
of effect while on the one hand the
effect of hampering the war makers also
on the other hand aiding those who wish
to drive the country back to the
conformist subservience of earlier years
by facilitating their efforts to
frighten the population and this one
might add as a his dual effect is not an
infrequent consequences of effective
political action consequence that has to
be balanced and considered by those who
undertake action I think in this case at
least there's little doubt in my
judgment at least that this particular
example of the choice of action was
fully justified when the range of
consequences is weighed however we don't
have to speculate about what might have
been in trying to determine the effect
of student activism we have direct
testimony and I think it's important to
pay very careful attention to it direct
testimony from people who are close to
the implementation of policy consider
for example Townsend hoops whose recent
writings are very important than should
be read and thought about he was the
former Undersecretary of the air force
in the Johnson administration and he
switched from pop to dub as we may
recall in the spring of 1968 in writing
about this switch hoops writes the
following he says that the rebels of
Indochina are inviting the West which
possesses unanswerable military power to
carry its strategic logic to the final
conclusion which is genocide he says
however that we stopped short of
genocide the reason is because of our
Christian values and because of our
recognition the genocide is through
terrible a burden to bear however when
he goes on to discuss the matter he
offers a somewhat more persuasive
explanation of why we have stopped short
so far of true genocide contending
ourselves with a violent attack on the
peasant society of South Vietnam and
Laos that has turned the land into
moonscape of traders into foliated
forests and barren rice fields and that
has moved something like 70% of the
population in south vietnam alone from
their original habitat he explains that
the u.s. political objective defines
free choice for the people of South
Vietnam as a process necessarily
excluding the NLF Viet Cong from
participation in either elections or
government for this aim he writes
military victory is a prerequisite and
hoops came finally to disagree with the
commitment to a military victory which
has this political goal in mind because
he says it would be possible only at the
price of literally destroying South
Vietnam tearing apart the social and
political fabric of our own country and
harming our international relations
more specifically he writes it would
cause anti-war demonstrations and draft
resistance to increase reinforced by
civil rights groups concerned with
domestic problems elsewhere he explains
further that Vietnam I'm quoting now
Vietnam is not of course the only source
of division in American society but it
is the most pervasive issue of our dis
court the catalytic agent that
stimulates and magnifies all other
divisive issues in particular there can
be no truce between the generations no
end of the bitterness and alienation of
even the large majority of our youth
that is neither revolutionary nor
irresponsible until Vietnam is
terminated I might note incidentally
that there could hardly be a stronger
argument for continued demonstrations
draft resistance disruption and evidence
of bitterness and alienation than these
remarks that is there could hardly be a
stronger argument for people who do not
choose to see the United States carry
its strategic logic for the final
conclusion which is genocide because as
he is saying fairly clearly it is
precisely these factors that led at
least one decision-maker
in fact we know from testimony many
others to decide to stop short of
carrying that strategic logic to the
final conclusion in short I think that
there's little doubt that the choice of
action by one segment of American
intellectuals American students in this
case has been significant and effective
in my opinion by and large are not
totally justified and beneficial in
connection that is with the specific
issues of worid racism to which more
student activism in fact is key
however the consequences of all this
have been still greater and I think it's
worth thinking about you as I have
noticed or noted already there there has
been a challenge raised to the
conformist of subservience of the
universities to their intense
politicization during the Cold War years
in fact the whole system of beliefs and
expectations that might be referred to
let's say as the Cold War ideology and
as a consequence for the first time in
many years it has become possible to
raise serious questions about American
society about industrial society about
its values in general recall again the
prophetic and pathetic voice that I
quoted earlier recall its apocalyptic
conclusions or near conclusions
Morgan thousand remarks such analyses
and evaluations are far cry from the
rhetoric of the turn of the preceding
decade in 1959 you may recall it was
possible for a very distinguished
American sociologist to write that the
fundamental political problems of the
Industrial Revolution have been solved
this very triumph of the Democratic
social revolution in the West End's
domestic politics for those
intellectuals who must have ideologies
or utopias to motivate them to political
action compare these remarks with
Morgenthau's
with his statement that the problems of
industrial society are not susceptible
to rational solutions within the
existing system of district
use power as a matter of fact they were
very here many there are very few people
today who would celebrate the end of
ideology and the solution of the
political problems of industrial society
in anything like the terms I've just
quoted from Seymour Martin Lipset
in contrast some at least believe with
Morgenthau that the great social and
political issues are not susceptible to
rational solutions given the present
distribution of power in American
society and in fact other industrial
societies all other industrial societies
without exception in consequence many
are seeking correctly and properly for a
rational social theory an ideology if
you like though will suggest effective
political action of a very different
sort than would be appropriate if indeed
we had witnessed the triumph of the
Democratic social revolution in the
domain of international politics the
justification for other forms of
political action civil disobedience for
example it seems to me much more obvious
one hears occasionally the argument that
such actions are inappropriate in a
democracy quite apart from the
inevitable restrictions on democracy
that necessarily exist under
contemporary state capitalism in its
militarized and highly concentrated form
quite apart from the overriding and in
effect uncontrolled role of the
executive in creating and implementing
policy for example in fighting secret
Wars as it's been doing in Laos for the
past six years quite apart from all of
this the question certainly arises what
price the peasants of Indochina are
expected to pay so that American life
can continue tranquil and undisturbed in
fact even if we granted that the United
States was an absolutely perfectly
functioning democracy in which as
Lipsett says the Democratic social
totally triumphs when could accept that
for the sake of argument and still
conclude that there is no principle
whatsoever that requires that the
peasants of Indochina be let's say wiped
out or their society destroyed because
this perfectly functioning democratic
society has slow wilded I'd like to try
to project these considerations slightly
into the future I mentioned earlier
bouncing hoops judgment that student
activism and the costs that it produces
are primarily a consequence of the
Vietnam War the heard report to
President Nixon expressed itself in
similar terms as infected the Scranton
Commission it's very interesting to look
at the executive reaction to all of this
as expressed by people like Agnew or
Mitchell or Sidney hook and others the
reaction has endeavored to dissociate
campus protest from the war to deny in
other words the connection between the
war and what is tearing apart American
society in direct contradiction to the
results of all independent studies
whether by social scientists or by
presidential commissions or whatever and
it's quite clear why this is the tact
that has to be taken the logic of taking
it is quite clear the administration is
hoping to be able to conduct what it
calls borrowing a term from the British
counterinsurgency expert Sir Robert
Thompson what it calls a long haul low
cost effort in Vietnam which can go on
indefinitely but now if you're going to
carry out a long haul low cost effort
you have to reduce the cost and the main
cost is the bitterness and alienation of
our youth and all of these other
descriptions that I read now
unfortunately here we run into a
difficulty because this cost is in fact
directly tied to Vietnam and cannot be
eliminated
as long as Viet Nam's little Vietnam war
continues so the conclusion is quite
obvious deny that this is across to the
war rather attributed to drugs or dr.
Spock or radical professors or weak
administrators or whatever that is
precisely the conclusion that is given
in the official executive reaction and
that is spreading over the country today
and the logic of it is clear it is
directly related in fact almost
necessary consequence from two facts
first the decision to continue to
prolong the war indefinitely as a long
haul low cost effort and secondly the
fact that the cost of the war which is
great the cost in alienation and
disruption student unrest and so on is
in fact key today must follow if one
accepts these this framework that it is
necessary to try to somehow pin this
cost on something else there's another
element to this same strategy instead of
my describing it let me quote again from
one of America's outstanding political
commentators are at book Wald in a
comment that he in a column that he had
a couple of days ago he's referring to a
imaginary conversation that he had with
a communist friend of his who he says
was practically in tears as he told me
how the party was falling apart we're
not a menace to anyone anymore he said
and everyone is ignoring us red-baiting
has gone out of style it's disgusting
how do you explain it I asked no one can
get any mileage out of attacking
communists in the United States anymore
student baiting is the big thing now the
red hunters are spending all their time
attacking students and professors and
administrators nobody gives a damn what
we do we haven't been able to get in the
newspapers and months as far as Agnew is
concerned the biggest enemy of the
United States is no longer Karl Marx but
dr. Spock
says this really has a terrible effect
on the party half of our membership was
made up of FBI undercover agents
we depended on them for all of our
financial aid as they were young because
they were the only ones who paid their
dues now they're leaving in droves to
enroll at colleges and universities
ourselves are down to nothing well the
only good effect of all of this is that
maybe it's a new resource for the peace
movement but other than that which we
certainly use some people who pay their
dues even if they're FBI agents aside
from that though I think he's pointing
to something quite real and very
important it's worth remembering that to
understand what the importance of what
he's referring to I think it's necessary
think about what the social function was
of red-baiting in American society in
the post-war years after all it wasn't
just a massive paranoia
although it was also that its social
function was expressed very succinctly
and in my opinion entirely accurately by
William Williams when he wrote that
after World War 2 American power was
adroitly deployed behind the banner of
anti-communism a psychological and
political strategy that was as
successful as it was commonplace the
Imperial majority of American leaders
recognized that the populace would have
to be realist Ain the kind of activity
in the related costs that they had
supported during the war senator Arthur
Vandenberg was merely being more candid
than most of his colleagues when he
remarked that it would be necessary to
scare hell out of the American people
quote from vandenberg the specter of
communism met that need it's a very
accurate description I think it had
nothing to it and let's not forget how
successful this campaign was not only
for the population but for the
leadership as well
a good example of how successful it was
for a very good example take a look at
I'd suggest if you haven't done so
already that you take a look at a recent
interview long quite fascinating
interview with Eugene Rostow in The New
Yorker on July 4th in it he he's asked
what the consequences would be of the
loss of South Vietnam and his view and
he explains that the apparently the
straight face that the loss of South
Vietnam would first of all lead to the
loss of Japan interesting that this is
probably one of the major motivations
during the 1950's and entering into
Indochina at that time not a totally
irrational idea and after the loss of
Japan the next thing that would happen
by some mechanism that he doesn't
specify is that we would lose Latin
America and then after that Russia would
take over the Middle East and threaten
Europe as hostage so we lose Europe and
he says after that the United States
would be reduced to the status of
Finland that is the Russians would be
able to tell us who to run in our
election as imperial life
he says we would not be reduced to the
level of Poland but we would approach
that this if we withdraw from South
Vietnam I mentioned Walt Rostow because
he is precisely a Eugene Rostow sorry
the brother because not only because he
was a high advisor during the Kennedy
and Johnson administration's of Dean of
the Yale Law School before and sterling
professor of law on such things but
because he isn't rather typical member
of the Kennedy elite of intellectuals
the group which does represent I think
probably one might say the most balanced
and perhaps sane I don't know what group
that was anywhere near the formation and
implementation policy in recent history
for interesting see how they
characterize their own views in earlier
years again Townsend hoops writing of
the writing of the policy makers of the
Kennedy administration he was one of
them he says they operated on the
implicit assumption that henceforth
Washington would be predisposed to view
an effort to overthrow the existing
order anywhere as a National Liberation
war fomented by and for the benefit of
Russia or China
Johnson's advisors Kennedy men all
carried in their veins the implicit
implicitly unlimited commitment to
global struggle against revolutionary
communism the prevailing assumption was
still quoting hoops that the communist
bloc remained an essentially cohesive
international conspiracy manifesting
itself primarily in military and
paramilitary assaults against that other
comprehensible entity the free world and
so in fact we do find people like the
brothers Roscoe Dean Acheson and many
others pretending that for example the
Vietnamese revolution the Vietnamese war
against French in 1946 pretending that
this was fomented by Stalin as in fact
they claimed at a time when Stalin
probably didn't even know where Vietnam
was in fact
and to this day it's an item of faith
that Stalin was responsible for the
Greek Civil War
Townsend Hoops in this effort that I've
just been quoting from to eliminate from
the illusions of the Cold War years
nevertheless reiterates this myth and it
is a total myth the facts are entirely
different and a known to be different
and I couldn't continue now you know
Russian imperialism is certainly real
enough there's no question about it
Russian totalitarianism is real enough
the Czechs and Hungarians many others
can testify to that
what was entirely unreal was the system
of beliefs that was erected on these
facts in an effort precisely to scare
hell out of the American people and it
did succeed succeeded so well in fact
that the leaders of American society are
now paying a very serious cost for it
because of course one of the problems of
building up a national psychosis is that
you can't turn it on and off at will
there are many people who would like to
turn it off right now so that they could
cut their losses and what obviously is
not a paying proposition namely the
effort to subjugate indochina people
like Clark Clifford and many other
enlightened members of the corporate
elite have urged that we end this war
but we're not doing it and we won't do
it and there are a lot of reasons for
this but I think that the main one is
that any politician knows that he will
be committing political suicide if he
leaves Indochina even if 99% of the
American population are in favor of it
on the day that he does it the natural
advantage that any demagogue always has
witnessed the success of Agnew in the
last few months the national advantage
of any demagogue will very quickly
convert this abandonment of Indochina
which of course will turn ultimately
into a communist victory since they are
the people with the programs in the mass
of the population or the only organized
part of the population will convert this
into a kind of treachery into another
loss of China and in this connection
it's worth mentioning that
recently there have been finally some
detailed studies of American
decision-making in Indochina over the
past 20 years it's a very beautiful and
careful analysis by Daniel Ellsberg
still unpublished was just given at the
American Political Science Association
which he points out that the operative
principle I think is quite convincing
the operative principle at every moment
has been not you know great geopolitical
considerations though those were in the
background but rather the assumption
that this year would be a bad year to
lose into China
maybe next year and of course as he
points out that's a recursive procedure
for continuing the war indefinitely and
the reason why it would be a bad year to
lose Indochina is in part because of the
paranoid anti-communist psychosis which
was so successfully whipped up by these
very same leaders in their effort to
scare hell out of the American people
and mobilize them behind domestic and
international policies so there's a
complicated situation
however this paranoid system of beliefs
is no longer entirely tenable though
there are still people like Eugene
Rostow around very few literate people
are willing today to believe that either
the domestic communists are a threat to
the United States or that communism is a
monolithic conspiracy directed from
Moscow and Peking and this erosion of
the Cold War ideology is a very serious
matter because the Cold War ideology has
served very well as a technique for
mobilizing the American population in
support of national policy by scaring
hell out of them although it also has
such unwanted effects as those that I
mentioned there are two aspects of
national policy that are particularly
critical in this respect first domestic
have in mind the government induced
largely military production and the
related research which involves about
two-thirds of the scientists and
engineers in the country and a very
large part of the labor force and which
undoubtedly has been a major force in
preserving what's called economic health
since World War two of course it's very
costly and it's tolerated by the
taxpayer because his leaders succeeded
in scaring hell out of them
fearsome social cost so the second
aspect of policy behind which is the
necessary to mobilize the American
people by scaring hell out of them is
the International aspect Woodrow Wilson
when he became president made it clear
that it was official American policy to
open the doors of all the weaker
countries to an invasion of American
capital and enterprise the words are
those of his Secretary of State Bryan in
1914 that has been and remains American
policy since World War two the specter
of communism has met the need to
mobilize the American people in support
of that objective with very interesting
weird effects such as the ones I noticed
many others for example one effect is
that in Indochina we've been led to
destroy physically to attempt at least
to destroy the only forces in the
country that have any capacity to
mobilize the population to overcome
ethnic rivalries to introduce social and
economic programs of some sort of that
happen might have some meaning for the
mass of the population now these
objectives have not changed there's no
serious move towards dismantling system
of militarized state capitalism at home
no serious moves towards fostering or
even permitting independent national
development on the part of societies
that choose to extricate themselves from
the American world system and this is a
serious matter
same objectives but the technique for
social for mobilizing the population the
technique of social control is beginning
to erode in other words the ideology of
anti-communism it seems is no longer
adequate to mobilize the population it's
not even entirely but it's losing its
power so quite naturally there's going
to be a search for some new technique of
ideological mobilization and I'm
reasonably sure that our book world has
put his finger right on it I've already
pointed out that student protest has
overwhelmingly been teed to the war and
to racial discriminate
and there is no intention of ending the
war and accepting the consequences of a
defeat for a 20 year effort to dominate
Southeast Asia as there is no real
possibility of implementing the kinds of
programs that might overcome Venessa
domestic inequities of the power in
control therefore it is necessary to
isolate if possible destroy those forces
that are raising the cost of present
policies to intolerable levels there are
factions in the student movement are
formerly in the student movement that
see themselves as the representative in
the affluent white community of third
world revolutionaries and radical
currents in the American ethnic
communities whatever when they think of
these ideas it's pretty clear that
through the FBI mentality they form a
pretty neat pattern quite well designed
to replace the communist threat as a
technique of social control and it's
therefore not too surprising that some
of the same people who helped 15 years
20 years ago same people who helped
convert a justified opposition to
communist totalitarianism into a
paranoid anti-communist crusade are now
to be found attacking the student
movement with all the subtlety of a
bludgeon specifically refusing to
consider the context of protest the
question of legitimacy of aims simply
trying to discredit any effort to raise
the cost of the destruction of Indochina
and with some success and I might say
with some participation by students who
themselves have taken a choice of action
that is very well designed to lead to
the realization of these ends but not
unfortunately to lead to the term saving
Indochina from destruction it seems to
me that the proper for the proper
attitude to take 15 years ago let's say
was to condemn communist totalitarianism
was a deserved condemnation richly and
yet at the same time to expose the
political and social goals of those who
used it very cynically for the most part
for their own
anti-communist crusade for expanding
American power and today I think it's
also necessary to condemn domestic
terrorism while exposing the political
and social goals of those who are trying
to whip up the new crusade the new
technique of social control based on
such actions this enters into a pretty
complicated matters and I don't
personally find the answer is very easy
for example there are some forms of
sabotage I have in mind in particular
let's say what was undertaken by the
berrigan's draft file destruction these
it seems to me seem quite justifiable
given social context in which they're
undertaken and the manner in which
they're undertaken there are others
which I think are entirely not
justifiable when one thinks of their
character
the character of the means and the goals
that they're likely to achieve so at
this point in one's thinking about these
matters I think one turns to rather hard
questions concerning the choice of
action there are conflicting values
there are no glib answers for example we
should very definitely have a commitment
to the democratic process even in the
flawed democracy of contemporary
militarized state capitalism at the same
time we should have a commitment which
unfortunately is a conflicting
commitment to the existence of Vietnam
as a cultural and historical entity
I'd like to recall to you the prophecy
or warning of Bernerd fall who was a
military man quite in sympathy with
American goals and certainly no alarmist
his judgment that Vietnam is a cultural
and historical entity is threatened with
extinction under the American assault
this was a judgment expressed three
years and three million tons of bombs
ago these commitments are in fact in
conflict it's highly likely I think that
nothing short of massive civil
disobedience could terminate the
American attack on the peasant society
of Indochina and to help create the
basis for that mass civil disobedience
by creating an appreciation of its
necessity and a willingness to
participate in it on
part of the massive population that task
is I think a fundamental one I don't
know if it's a realizable one we should
have a commitment to the rule of law but
this commitment also is hardly clear in
the choice of action to which it leads I
think a very strong case can be made to
me it seems on purely intellectual
grounds an overwhelming case that the
United States executive is openly
flouting domestic and international law
and Vietnam might say incidentally that
it's often argued that this is a
technical issue that must be left to the
experts like most such injunctions this
one conceals a political purpose the
purpose of fostering conformist
subservience in fact the issues are not
all that complex and when you read the
detail briefs presented by both sides
you discover that the argument is really
turning on certain factual questions
certain factual issues of historical
interpretation where the responsible
citizen 10 and most definitely should
make a judgement some people argue that
the matter should be left to the courts
but surely that's rather unpersuasive
argument as well for example a recent
Department of Justice brief urged that
the courts not hear cases concerning the
legality of the war because of the
domestic consequences that might ensue
if the judgment were that the executive
is engaged in criminal acts now this
point is actually well taken and it
indicates quite clearly one reason why
it's irresponsible to rely on the
determination of the judiciary in this
kind of situation one reason there are
other reasons the most obvious being
obvious questions prejudice when a
branch of the government is asked to
rule on that government's possible
crimes there is quite apart from this
the question whether the law must be
obeyed no matter what the consequences
as an absolute value I think there are
very few people who would agree that it
must be obeyed no matter what the
consequences as an absolute value but
the question in any event is academic if
it is true as it seems to me that a
citizen is not required to join
the criminal acts of his government but
should rather seek to restrain these
acts
perhaps violating statutes in the course
of so acting we should furthermore be
committed to non-violence but even here
the questions are not trivial the pure
pacifist whose views personally I
respect but cannot share pure pacifist
has certain answers but even he does not
have all the answers even to him the
question arises and at the moment is
being seriously debated as to whether or
not destruction of property is a form of
violence for example the kind of
activity that the berrigan's we do
regard themselves as pacifists carried
out for the non pacifist there are not
only these questions but many others
much harder because the non pacifist
which does include virtually everybody
the non pacifist believes if he's
willing to say whether he's willing to
say so or not but he in effect believes
by virtue of being a non pacifist that
violence may be justified if it will
prevent still greater violence at that
point the tangled web of questions with
no very easy answers arises and one has
to ask questions about the intrinsic
legitimacy of the means employed and the
intended ends about the likelihood that
these means will lead to these ends or
will they fail or will they by the very
character distort these ends and one has
to also inquire into unintended
consequences these are not easy
questions to me it seems that a
consideration of all of these factors
leads to the conclusion that nonviolent
resistance nonviolent civil disobedience
ranging from say draft and tax
resistance and general strikes if
possible and so on ranging from there
over to actions such as those of the
berrigan's
are seems to me a legitimate and
potentially efficacious course of action
under present circumstances but I don't
see how anyone can believe that the
choice of that course of action is clear
and I think one must reject out of hand
the contention that such actions are
illegitimate apart from the
consideration of the social and
political context in which they are
undertake
as I think one must reject out of hand
the kind of domestic terrorism which
rather than which apart from the issue
of the intrinsic legitimacy of the means
employed is not designed to make the
society uncover noble and thereby
contribute to ending the war but rather
is designed precisely to make the
society very easily governor bull and
Governor Belen the worst possible way in
a way which will mobilize American
opinion for a final perhaps genocide or
assault on the Vietnamese and who knows
how many other people in this discussion
of the choice of action I've tried to
stay fairly close to questions that have
a certain immediacy rather than focusing
in a more general and abstract way on
the problem of the relations of
intellectuals to society the reason is
the one I mentioned namely that these
questions to which I don't want to
pretend that I have any answers will
have my own answers but I don't think
they're terribly convincing these
questions have a desperate urgency to
them the erosion of the Cold War
ideology threatens a stable system of
social control from within as the
resistance of the peasants of Indochina
threatens it from without and we can
therefore expect with some degree of
confidence but strong efforts will be
made to reinstitute the conservative
consensus of the post-war years and to
continue towards what senator to former
senator joseph clark borrowing a phrase
from Toynbee recently called the
Germanization of the united states there
will be continuing efforts which may or
may not succeed to scare hell out of the
american people so that they will
support domestic and international
policies that may indeed be in
eradicable as Morgenthau asserts given
the present distribution of power
centralization of decision-making in
american society and this process of
Germanization may indeed be furthered by
a kind of moral degeneracy the only term
I can think of I'm sorry if it has a
pompous sound
I'm kind of moral degeneracy that has
been induced by the war I have in mind
the process of habituation to atrocity
there are a natural tendency to project
our failings our crimes even onto the
victims as though in some sense they are
responsible for them I think a touch of
this attitude is revealed in the
quotation from Townsend hoops that are
read earlier when he wrote the rebels of
Indochina are inviting the West which
possesses unanswerable military power to
follow its strategic logic to the final
conclusion which is genocide if you
check the context of this assertion it
strengthens the suspicion that hoops is
blaming the rebels of Indochina for
calling down this terror upon their
heads this kind of projection takes a
particularly brutal form for example
when we give one example and the
observations of quite excellent
correspondent of The Washington Post the
man who incidentally is quite opposed to
the war who recently wrote an account of
his own personal reaction to a year and
a half and in Vietnam this war he writes
as a horrible mistake the United States
he says has never accepted the
fundamental different 'no son aam those
aspects of this society that compel
beggars to buy and steal babies who
might help them look more pathetic in
saigon filthy gutters it's all too easy
to forget or ignore the stupefying
venality of South Vietnamese society the
selfishness of ordinary Vietnamese the
almost total lack of civic spirit in the
society the fundamental American
optimism about human nature can be put
to a severe test in this society where
cause and effect don't work the way they
do in America and so on this comment
which was printed in many newspapers
without any reaction at all in your
editorial or in letters and I've just
sampled a tiny bit of it has a very
simple point to it
first we destroy and demolish the rural
society of Vietnam first we drive
millions of peasants into the miserable
slums of Saigon which now has twice the
population density of Tokyo
then after having done this we blame
them because the beggars by and steal
babies who may help them look more
pathetic and slogans filthy slow means
it's their selfishness that puts our
fundamental optimism about human nature
to such a severe test its they are
stupefying venality that we deplore the
lack of civic spirit on the part of the
people who've been fighting for 25 years
against every horror that West Western
ingenuity can devise I don't really know
how one can respond effectively to such
profound moral degeneracy whether by
words or by actions but I do think that
the future for America is rather grim
unless some slow process of cultural and
ideological change takes place in the
United States that makes it possible for
the American people to face up honestly
to what they've done either by direct
decision or submissiveness and
conformist subservience since many young
people seem quite capable of reacting in
a decent and human fashion to this
reality I think it's quite certain that
the device of this bitterness that our
rending American society will continue
so long as their elders remain capable
of immunizing themselves of denying
obvious facts of constructing pathetic
rationalizations for example projecting
onto the victims the atrocities that we
have done to them and refusing to take a
principled stand against aggression an
imperial conquest and against the quite
inevitable terror of a war that's
conducted by the world's greatest
technological power against a virtually
defenseless peasant population
unfortunately there's very little
indication of any such cultural and
ideological change on the contrary as I
indicated earlier there's a marked
tendency to turn against the youthful
tormenters who continue to call for
honesty and decency for a realistic and
humane response to facts that can no
longer be concealed if many young people
are being driven from commitment to
fanaticism as in fact they are
and that is extremely unfortunate for
themselves and for American and world
society if they are being done so then I
think that is happening and it is then
the responsibility falls very largely I
think on those who have failed to find
the more effective course of action to
believe otherwise is to react in a way
quite similar to those who blame the
Vietnamese beggar for his selfishness
and janela T so always very tempting to
focus attention on the irrationality the
intolerable abuse the unjustifiable
terror occasionally of those who are
fundamentally raising deeply disturbing
questions questions that would have
taken seriously lead to a choice of
action that might be very painful and
difficult how much easier to deflect the
questions and deplore the perhaps quite
deplorable excesses of those who raised
the questions the fact of the matter is
that the sum total of all youthful
fanaticism in my opinion is barely
detectable when weighed in the balance
against the criminal refusal to act in a
principled way to save Indochina from
destruction the intolerable
