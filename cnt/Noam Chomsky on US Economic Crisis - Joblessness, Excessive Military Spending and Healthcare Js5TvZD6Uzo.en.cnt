it's just that we're now in on Monday
President Obama sent his new jobs
proposal to Congress in a new challenge
to Republicans Obama said he would
propose paying the 447 billion dollar
package by raising taxes on the wealthy
around 400 billion dollars would be
raised by eliminating a number of
deductions claimed by wealthy taxpayers
Obama discussed the bill in a White
House speech Thursday
I told Congress that I'll be sending
them a bill called the American Jobs Act
well here it is this is this is a bill
that will put people back to work all
across the country this is the bill that
will help our economy in a moment of
national crisis this is a bill that is
based on ideas from both Democrats and
Republicans and this is the bill that
Congress needs to pass no games no
politics no delays I'm sending this bill
to Congress today and they ought to pass
it immediately
you know I'm chomsky what is your
assessment of President Obama whether
we're talking about his new jobs plan or
whether we're talking about his foreign
policy well I can't say that I find it
disappointing because quite frankly I
never expected anything actually wrote
about it before the primaries just based
on his record and his website I think my
I should say first of all that this
latest jobs plan is one of the better
things he's done anything I don't think
goes anywhere far enough but at least it
has elements that are going in the right
direction there was when the during the
lame-duck session that serious question
was whether what to do with the Bush tax
cuts the bush tax cuts were carefully
designed so that at the beginning every
got a little you had a feeling taxes are
being reduced but they were designed so
that as the 10-year period ended it was
overwhelmingly going to the very rich
now the population is strongly opposed
to that you take a look at polls during
the lame-duck session when this was
coming up a very strong support for
increasing taxes for those with incomes
over say quarter million dollars a year
well a Obama didn't push that if he had
appealed to the public they I think
could have overcome the opposition of
the financial institutions you know the
Republican new Republican congressional
delegation and so on but he didn't try
and that should be done now the current
proposal goes partially in that
direction by indirectly increasing taxes
through elimination of deductions but
the tax code simply has to be revised
the it's become a highly regressive in
fact the share of GDP you know national
income by of taxes is probably lower
than it's ever been far lower than
twenty or thirty years ago
particularly for the rich all of that
should be adjusted there is a stimulus
in the program which is good idea but
it's much too small and the the
concentration on deficit reduction when
the problem is the serious problem is
massive unemployment I think that's a
very serious error you can understand
why the banks insurance companies and so
on like it but it's completely wrong for
the for trying to extricate ourselves
from quite a serious economic crisis the
other things are unfortunately the the
deficit itself if you want to take it
seriously I don't think it's the major
issue by me in fact I don't even think
it's a serious
at least in the short-term but if you do
want to take it seriously it's pretty
easy to trace it to the roots Dean Baker
very good economist has done has pointed
out the calculations would show that if
the United States had a healthcare
program similar to other industrial
countries which is not a utopian dream
not only would there be no deficit but
there'd be a surplus that plus the huge
military budget military budgets
probably in half the deficit it's way
out of line with anything needed
certainly for any defensive purpose but
for any justifiable purpose Ron Paul who
you heard before was quite right about
that if the military of the u.s. is
spending about as much as the rest of
the world combined almost on the
military spending technologically very
advanced and new destructive techniques
developed developing far beyond what any
other country has this is all first of
all shouldn't be done on principle but
it also ends up being harmful to us
essentially for the reasons that Paul
mentioned the very expensive of course
that plus the hopelessly dysfunctional a
health care system as those are
fundamental problems that have to be
addressed now that could have been
addressed the at the time of the health
care reform a large part of depending on
how the question was asked either a
large plurality often a majority of the
population it was in favor of some form
of national health care which we
incomparably more efficient and more
humane but Obama just dropped that the
public option remained as a possibility
that was supported by I think maybe
almost 2/3 of the population Obama just
dropped it so everything is in the hands
of the insurance companies we continue
to have
roughly twice the per-capita healthcare
costs of comparable countries some of
the poorest outcomes and it's the only
large almost unregulated privatized
system yes it's highly inefficient it's
also very inhumane not to speak of tens
of thousands of people without insurance
or many more with not enough insurance
well that can be changed it should be
changed if it could the deficit issues
such as they are I think they're
secondary would largely disappear
there's a long-term debt problem that's
a different matter
and that can be dealt with the best way
to deal we can trace that to its roots
to Ronald Reagan who was fiscally
totally responsible tripled the u.s.
debt shifted the u.s. very quickly from
the world's leading creditor to the
world's leading debtor George W Bush
enhanced it with his fiscal policies
including the huge tax cut for the rich
the wars and the end of the long term
that's a problem but the way to deal
with that problem in the long term is
with economic growth appropriate
economic growth sensible economic growth
well that can be done but it's not going
to be done through deficit reduction
programs or tampering with entitlements
as is on the table unfortunately so
there were elements and infrastructure
development is significant and Obama
mentioned that there's small programs I
think that those are he talked about
work sharing which is quite an important
proposal one on a fancy will be done
that was done in Germany and it cut down
unemployment very sharply led to
substantial economic growth even through
the recession those are options that
could be pursued the they're mentioned
they should be pushed harder they should
be expanded but at least there are
elements there that could turn into a
a constructive program however not until
the core issues are handled one is
enormous unemployment that's the worst
problem that it's becoming almost
permanent unemployment another is the
deterioration of manufacturing that
meaning offshoring of manufacturing the
only way that can be dealt with this by
cutting back on the overvalued the
dollar that would improve possibilities
for exports the healthcare system which
is grotesque
it's an international scandal the huge
military spending the very low taxes for
the rich by comparative standards those
corporations and so on those are
problems that there's our fundamental
problems that have to be dealt with if
there's going to be anything like
successful economic and social
development in the United States no um
you mentioned entitlements and obviously
that's an this is an issue that's come
up a lot in the deficit debate Governor
Rick Perry the Republican presidential
hopeful is called a Ponzi scheme but
even Democrats seem to buy into this
narrative that it's in crisis can you
adjust that Social Security's not in any
crisis I mean the the trust fund alone
will fully pay benefits for I think
another thirty years or so and after
that taxes will give almost the same
benefits to worry about a possible
problem thirty years from now which kind
of sidin Talebi fixed with little a
little bit of tampering here and there
as it was done in nineteen eighty three
to worry about that just makes
absolutely no sense unless you're trying
to destroy the program it's a very
successful program a large number of
people rely on it it's if it doesn't pay
munificent lee but it at least keeps
people alive not just retired people of
people with disabilities and others
very low administrative costs extremely
efficient and no burden on the on the
deficit doesn't add to the deficit the
the effort to try to present socially
social security a program as if it's a
bit major problem that's just a hidden
way of trying to undermine and destroy
it now the there has been a lot of
opposition to it since you know since
the 1930s on the part of sectors of
extreme wealth and privilege especially
financial capital they don't like it for
several reasons one is the rich don't
barely for them it's meaningless anyone
with you know who's had a who's had a
fairly decent income it's a tiny
addition to your to your retirement but
doesn't mean much another is if the
financial institutions the insurance
companies can get their hands on this
this huge financial resource for example
if it's privatized in some way or
vouchers that's a huge bonanza they'll
have trillions of dollars to play with
the banks the investment firms and so on
now but I think myself that there's a
more subtle reason why they're opposed
to it and I think it's rather similar to
the reason for the effort that pretty
much dismantled the public education
system the Social Security's based on a
principle it's based on the principle
that you care about other people you
care whether the widow Crosstown
disabled widow is going to be loved food
to eat and that's a notion you have to
drive out of people's heads the idea of
solidarity sympathy mutual support
that's doctrinally dangerous the
preferred doctrines are just care care
about self don't care about anyone else
that's a very good way to trap
control people and the the very idea
that you that we're in it together that
we care about each other that we have
responsibility for one another that says
sort of frightening to those who want a
society and which is dominated by power
or authority wealth and which people are
passive and obedient and I suspect I
don't know how to measure exactly but I
think that that's a considerable part of
the drive on the part of small
privileged sectors to undermine a very
efficient very effective system on which
a large part of the population relies
actually relies more than ever because
wealth personal wealth that was very
much tied up in the housing market
that's that was people's personal wealth
well ok that quite predictably totally
collapsed
people aren't destitute by the standards
of say the slums in India or Southern
Africa but very suffering severely and
they have nothing else to rely on
but what they really Pitons that they're
getting from Social Security to take
that away would be just disastrous we're
talking to Noam Chomsky he has a new
book out ten years after his book 9/11
this is called 9/11 was there an
alternative we'll come back to this
conversation in a minute and if you'd
