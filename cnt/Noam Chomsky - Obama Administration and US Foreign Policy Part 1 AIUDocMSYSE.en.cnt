I'm trying to see over the Eagles head
it is a great honor to be here with Nome
and to introduce Noam Chomsky now Haiti
from Haiti to East Timor from Vietnam
Cambodia and Laos to Latin America there
is one person who has connected these
dots for decades and he is the person
we've come to hear today Noam Chomsky
such an important word in the New York
Times call him the most important
perhaps the most important intellectual
alive today to which no one responded
what did I say wrong but and you then
must ask why isn't he quoted more often
occasionally perhaps once in the front
pages of the New York Times amazing to
think how much you get in one lecture
from Noam Chomsky compare it to the
network's day after day 24 hours a day
that small circle of pundits who know so
little about so much explaining the
world to us and getting it so wrong
a few years ago Tim Russert was
challenging well was talking to General
Peter pace than the head of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff it was I think it was in
2006 and he asked him if he was
concerned that the Iraqi Prime Minister
at the time Joffre said one of his
favorite authors was Noam Chomsky and
general pace responded by hat I hope he
has more than one book on his nightstand
I hope he did too the prime minister of
Iraq I hope he had hegemony or survival
America's quest for global dominance the
essential Chomsky a collection of Noam
Chomsky's works
oh we'll go back in time to
manufacturing consent so essential to
deconstructing the way the media
constructs our view of the world
Noam Chomsky and Ed Herman's but
manufacturing consent the political
economy of the news media interventions
would be a very good book for general
pace to have on his nightstand failed
States the earlier books like turning
the tide as Noam Chomsky looked at
Central America as you can see from the
cover of essential Chomsky there's more
than a hundred books this is a bookcase
filled with Noam Chomsky's works and
they've even start writing out these
kinds work so actually it did right when
he was like 14 years old not to
intimidate any really young folks who
were here today you don't have to do it
at 14 write essays about the Spanish
Civil War as no one was doing inspired
by his uncle among others I just came
from New York a few minutes ago passing
72nd Street the subway station there and
no more he's described how in the front
but I know he won't do it today in the
front there's a newspaper stand world
all of the folks going in and the subway
work buying newspapers quickly his uncle
had the stand in the back where you had
to sort of make your way to keep the
stragglers who were debating and
discussion discussing what was in the
paper
maybe that was the beginning of
manufacturing consent deconstructing the
news media how it tells us what it tells
us
Noam Chomsky inspired me and my
colleague Alan Aaron to go to East Timor
I think he kept that issue alive more
than any single person in this country
from 1975 when the Indonesian military
invaded East Timor and President Obama
is just about to go to Indonesia so it's
so important to know this history well
for a quarter of a century the u.s.
armed train financed the Indonesian
military and they committed one of the
great genocides of the 21st century I
hardly knew about it but from Noam
Chomsky's writings in the 90 and 91 we
went and witnessed a massacre more than
two hundred seventy-two memories killed
in one day my colleague Alan Aaron had a
skull fractured as the US military beat
us up and killed everyone around us and
that was one of the smaller massacres
they killed a third of the population of
Timor before they allowed the people of
East Timor they were forced to allow
them to vote for their own future and
they voted for independence and I'll
never forget the night on May 20th 2002
when Alan Aaron and I went back to East
Timor among many other people and the
people of Timor this the survivors
gathered in Tassie Tola right outside of
Dilli the capital to celebrate their
independence it was midnight there were
hundred thousand Tim erease shenanigan
al the rebel leader had been imprisoned
for years than the founding president of
timor unfurled the flag of the
Democratic Republic of East Timor and
there was as fireworks display and you
could see the tears reflected the lights
reflected in the tear stained faces of
the people of East Timor this nation of
survivors had prevailed they had
resisted and they had won and we were
the only national broadcast in the
United States that was broadcasting the
ceremony back to the United States it
was just after midnight
we were thinking how do we convey this
and bringing out all the voices of
people there and we called up known as
Timor was celebrating his in its
independence the people of teamwork
thank people especially from Western
nations for bringing out the issue of
arming human rights abusing regimes and
what the cost was on the ground and Noam
Chomsky was so seminal not only his
writings but how he inspired so many to
then go do the work and his voice
cracked as we were interviewing him and
the fireworks were going off and the
people were gaining that freedom and an
unacceptably high price but they finally
had won and he actually said he didn't
know if this day would ever come
you could have fooled all of us because
of his commitment over those decades if
he didn't think it would happen he sure
inspired so many people to believe it
could just by being empowered with
information that's what Noam Chomsky
gives us every single day so it is a
great honor to be here to introduce a
man who has stuck whether with it
through thick and thin who's whose
erudition academics I didn't even go
through obviously all the honours but
has honored all of us by continuing to
write to share his thoughts as he moves
now into his ninth decade I bring you
Noam Chomsky well maybe it's ungracious
but I have to add one qualification to
what Amy just said I do sometimes get
mentioned in the New York Times in fact
just a couple of days ago there was an
op-ed which it was one of those standard
Tantrums about how awful the 1960s were
and
and they were pretty awful they really
civilized the country and that's pretty
dangerous but I was mentioned as one of
the last stale holdovers still peddling
that 1960s line that governments and
corporations play some role in global
planning you know real heresy it's not
the exact words that were used but
that's what they meant so if you don't
mind some stale holdovers I'll go on
with that
heresy today there's there there's lots
of articles and the press and the
journals the foreign policy journals the
these last couple of weeks trying to
evaluate the first year of President
Obama's foreign policy what was achieved
what the problems are and so on
one of the longest and most detailed
ones was in the journal a national
interest by Richard Burt well-known
policy analyst and among other things he
compared Obama with George Bush number
one the first Bush first Bush was
criticized because he lacked what was
called the vision thing Obama on the
other hand but but Burt said you know he
in practice he were successful but
lacked vision Obama he suggested as sort
of the opposite grand vision real vision
of what should be done but he hasn't
succeeded much in practice and in fact
both Bush and Obama have accepted that
designation not the not doing well but
George Bush the first
agreed he said yeah he said I'm not into
vision he's into doing things and Obama
when he was came under some criticism
when he appointed his economic advisors
because they were all drawn from people
people who'd helped engineer the
financial crisis that was consuming the
economy he said he said yes it's true
I'm getting experts and the economy but
you don't have to worry because I'll
provide the vision okay well we can see
where that led on the foreign policy
let's then keep to the vision the
admirable part my favorite newspaper the
London Financial Times a couple of days
ago identified Obama's major foreign
policy problem today as Iran the
occasion for the article was Hillary
Clinton's failure to convince Brazil to
go along with the United States on
calling for harsher sanctions and
president Lula's insistence that there
should be engagement with Iran
commercial relations and so on and that
it has a right to enrich uranium for
producing nuclear energy as do all
signers of the non-proliferation treaty
well it was reported here too of course
and the Lula's position was considered
sort of paradoxical why is he not going
along with the international community
with the world it's an interesting usage
which is a very striking reflection of
the depth of the culture of imperialism
who was the international community well
it turns out if you look that the
international community is Washington
and whoever happens to
at the moment the rest are not part of
the world they're kind of an opposition
well in this case Lula's position
happens to be that of most of the world
you can think it's right or wrong or
whatever but just as a matter of fact
for example it's the position of the
former non-aligned countries the
majority of countries of the world the
large majority of their populations they
have repeatedly and vigorously supported
Iran's right to enrich uranium for
peaceful purposes reiterating that it's
a signer the non-proliferation treaty
which does grant that right so they're
not part of the world another group
that's not part of the world as the
population of the United States
the last polls that I've seen a couple
of years ago in those polls considerable
majority of Americans agreed that Iran
has a right to develop nuclear energy
but of course not nuclear weapons and in
fact as the poll demonstrated the
opinions of Americans on this issue were
almost identical with opinions of
Iranians and a whole range of issues and
in fact when the poll was presented in
Washington at a press conference
presenter pointed out that if people
were able to make policy could be that
this these tensions and conflicts would
be resolved well that was a few years
ago since then there's been a huge mass
of propaganda about the threat of Iran
and so on and it's very likely I would
guess that if the poll were taken today
those figures for the American
population would be different but that
was 2007 three years ago so at that
point Americans were not part of the
world most of the majority of people of
the world were not part of the world and
Lula by repeating their view is also not
part of the world could be added that
he's
almost surely the most popular political
figure in the world but that doesn't
mean anything either so what about the
conflict with Iran and the threat of
Iran nobody in their right mind wants
Iran to develop nuclear weapons or
anyone for that matter so on that
there's complete agreement and in fact
there are significant problems about a
proliferation of nuclear weapons it's
not a joke and Obama's vision forcibly
includes stresses the need to stop the
proliferation of nuclear weapons and to
reduce or maybe remove nuclear weapons
well that's the vision what's the
practice
well the practice became clear a couple
of months ago
once again the Security Council passed a
resolution 1887 I think it was October
calling on with the criticism of Iran
for not living up to commitments that it
that were demanded by the Security
Council and also calling on all states
to join the non-proliferation treaty and
to solve all their conflicts within the
framework of the non-proliferation
treaty without any threats of force well
that particular part of the resolution
was not exactly headlined here for a
simple reason it was directed at two
countries the two countries that are
regularly threatening the use of force
the United States and Israel the threat
of force is in violation of the UN
Charter if anybody cares about that
stale old stuff even older than the 60s
but that's never mentioned but every
just across the spectrum here almost
everyone insists that
usual phrases we must keep all options
open that that's a threat of force and
the threat of force is not just idle so
for example Israel is ascending its
nuclear submarines into the Gulf firing
distance their undetectable basically
into just into areas where they could
fire nuclear missiles of course Israel
has plenty of nuclear weapons fire them
at Iran the US and others or its allies
are carrying out field operations you
know the exercises plainly aimed at Iran
there's a little hitch because turkey is
refusing to go along but that's what
they've been trying to sow their regular
threats verbal and in policy that Israel
and actually ascending the nuclear
submarines on other warships through the
Suez Canal with the tacit agreement of
Egypt the Egyptian dictatorship another
US client in the region well those are
all threats constant verbal actual and
the threats do have the effect of
inducing Iran to develop a deterrent
whether they're doing it or not I don't
know maybe they are but if they are the
the reason as I think almost all serious
and analysts would agree is not because
they intend to use nuclear weapons and
missiles with nuclear weapons if they
even loaded a missile with nuclear
weapons assuming they had them the
country would be vaporized five minutes
and nobody believes that the ruling
clerics whatever one thinks about them
have
kind of a death wish and want to see the
entire country in society and everything
they owned destroyed fact that US
intelligence figures pretty high inuit
who've talked about it estimate the
possibility of Iran ever actually using
a nuclear weapon as maybe one percent
you know so low that you cannot estimate
it but it's possible that they might
develop them as a deterrent one of
Israel's leading military historians
Martin fund Cray filled a couple of
years ago after the invasion of Iraq
wrote in the international press that of
course he doesn't want to see Iran have
nuclear weapons and he said but if
they're not developing them they're
crazy the US had just invaded Iraq
knowing that it was totally defenseless
I was part of the reason why they felt
free to invade everybody can understand
that the Iranian leaders can certainly
understand
so therefore to quote funk ray field
again if they're not developing a
nuclear deterrent they're crazy well
whether they are or not is another
question but there's no doubt that the
hostile and aggressive stance taken by
the United States and its Israeli client
or a factor in whatever planning is
going on and top Iranian circles as to
whether to develop a nuclear deterrent
or not and Lulla I think has a point
when he says along with the actual world
what's technically called the world in
suggesting that interaction commercial
and other is the proper way to try to
constrain whatever the threat that may
be and I think the UN Security Council
was correct and concluding that back
last October that the threat of force
should be abandoned
and the issues involving the interstate
conflict should be resolved within the
framework of the UN Charter and the
non-proliferation treaty in this case
again aimed at the United States and
Israel
well the Security Council resolution
there were reactions to the Security
Council resolution in part there were
reactions on the part of the three
states there are three states which have
never signed the non-proliferation
treaty so they're the worst violators by
far the three states are India Pakistan
and Israel those are the three states
that have never signed the
non-proliferation treaty they've all
developed nuclear weapons with the
assistance of the United States in the
case of Pakistan it was primarily under
Reagan the Reagan administration which
very strongly supported the worst of the
Pakistani dictators and there been a lot
of bad ones the worst by far was Yale
Hawk who was developing nuclear weapons
and of course the Reagan administration
knew about it but pretended they didn't
know so they could still keep providing
aid to their favorite dictator who at
the same time was carrying out radical
Islam is a ssin of Pakistan with the
Saudi Arabian funding Saudi Arabia and
Pakistan are the two leading sources of
radical Islamic fundamentalism including
jadi terrorism Saudi Arabia primarily
both close allies in the United States
and Britain both the United States and
Britain open supporting them throughout
this whole period in the 1980s that's
when you had the spread of madrasahs you
know extreme extremist religious schools
all over Pakistan funded by Saudi Arabia
backed by the United States that was
supposed to have to do with Pakistan's
support for
opposing the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan and the u.s. in Saudi Arabia
and Pakistan did in fact try to organize
the most extreme radical Islamic
fundamentalist they could find anywhere
the sent him to Afghanistan to fight
there now the goal of that was not to
liberate Afghanistan that would have
been a legitimate goal to fight the
Russians but that wasn't the goal the
CIA chief in Islamabad made the goal
explicit he said we're doing this in
order to kill Russians it's not going to
liberate Afghanistan in fact this wasn't
a concern it probably dragged out the
war but they were able to kill Russians
and that's good so that's meanwhile
Pakistan develop nuclear weapons it was
a strong it's not a majority by any
means but there's a strong radical
Islamist jihadi tendency that developed
in Pakistan and it's part of what we're
facing did what the world is facing
today so that's Pakistan what about
indeed well India their nuclear weapons
program was got a big shot in the arm
from the second George Bush couple years
ago George Bush signed a treaty with
India which in effect which overcame US
law the India had been developing
nuclear weapons and violation of the
non-proliferation treaty and Congress
had passed sanctions conditions back in
the 1970s Bush essentially overrode
those and also overrode international
resolutions to permit India to have
access to nuclear technology
theoretically for civilian use but
everyone knows
if you provide technology for civilian
use it just means that it can be
diverted the weapons production and
effect it frees India to develop nuclear
weapons u.s. pressure succeeded in
ramming that through the Nuclear
Suppliers group they have no way of
stopping the United States so they went
along but that's a Tears a big hole in
the non-proliferation treaty and in fact
India reacted to the Security Council
resolutions last fall right away
by announcing that it now has the
capacity to produce nuclear weapons of
the same yield as the super powers in
the United States and Russia that was
their reaction and thanks to in part to
our support the Obama administration
immediately informed India that the
resolution didn't apply to them so they
didn't have to worry about the Security
Council resolution that calls on states
to join the non-proliferation treaty and
to accept its regime
well that's India at Pakistan wouldn't
even mention yes in fact the more India
increases its nuclear weapons capacity
the more Pakistan does with a very
serious threat of nuclear war it's
coming quite close a couple of times and
the threat is still there and growing so
that's Indian Pakistan well the obama
administra
as the Security Council resolution
roughly the same time the International
Atomic Energy Agency passed a resolution
that calling on Israel to join the
non-proliferation treaty and to open up
its nuclear facilities to inspection as
as far as I'm aware that was never
reported in the United States in fact
the only I mean I I learned about it
because I happened to be in Mexico and I
was reading the Mexican press which
published wire service reports I didn't
know whether to believe them or not so I
came back and checked and yeah
accurate isn't the military journalist
and so on the only reference that gets
find to it and the English press was in
the Irish Times they haven't reported
but but it happened I mean they there
was an interesting resolution the United
States and Europe had tried to block the
resolution but they weren't able to
block it and then it passed with a
majority of the International Atomic
Energy Agency
well Abama did react same way as to
India the administration informed Israel
that they didn't have pay attention to
this didn't apply to them
that's reiterating a informal but
well-known agreement between President
Nixon and Israeli prime minister Golda
Meir back in the Nixon years saying that
the u.s. agreed that Israeli development
of nuclear weapons is kind of off the
agenda we don't allow any discussion of
this so that's the reaction of the three
powers that never joined the
non-proliferation treaty in all cases
with us support well that has something
to do with non-proliferation actually
the General Assembly also passed a
resolution calling on Israel to join the
non-proliferation treaty and open up its
facilities there were the US and Israel
of course voted against it and they were
able to pick up two more votes so there
were four votes against the resolution
in the General Assembly which is a
little more than usual sometimes can't
even get them so for example a year
earlier the General Assembly passed an
important resolution trying to regulate
the arms trade
what's called small arms but small
doesn't mean very small that means
less than nuclear weapons those are the
ones that are carrying out massacres and
slaughters all over the world and that
the u.s. voted against it not alone that
time it was joined by Zimbabwe and that
was a little embarrassing so I don't
think it ever got reported but that's
the kind of thing that happens pretty
regularly if you look okay that's Obama
also reacted not directly but to the
Security Council resolution at the time
that he got his Nobel Prize the Pentagon
an effort you know bringing about peace
and so on and opposing nuclear weapons
at about within days the Pentagon
announced that it is has been
accelerating development of massive
ordnance penetrator x' they think is the
technical word these are huge bombs the
biggest ones in the u.s. Arsenal 13 tons
of bombs or something like that which
are designed so that they can penetrate
deep it not I deep into the ground but
right through many made layers of
reinforced concrete the proposal was
initiated under the Bush administration
but it kind of languished however as
soon as Obama came in he accelerated the
development of these weapons and
according to the Pentagon they're going
to be put into place maybe they're
already there a couple of months from
the time of the announcement that three
couple of years before the original plan
every guy knows that therefore there's
only one target for those that's another
threat against Iran okay that was
Obama's reaction to the resolution well
you know there's there's more to say
about this
I mean as I mentioned certainly nobody
wants you around to develop nuclear
weapons and we should undertake sensible
measures to try to prevent that there's
one measure which would that could be
quite significant then give a hundred
percent security but it could advance
these efforts and that is to establish a
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle
East again verification is never a
hundred percent reliable but it can be
carried out and there would be ways to
reduce the tensions may mitigate the
tensions maybe eliminate them if there
were a nuclear weapons free zone
well again the there's overwhelming
support for this in the American
population and a huge majority Iran huge
majority the countries are officially
committed to it you know official
doesn't mean anything unless the
population does something actually the
United States and Britain have a special
commitment to this very uniquely deep
commitment to this the reason is that
when they invaded Iraq they tried to
provide a kind of a thin legal cover for
the invasion and the legal cover
referred to a Security Council
resolution in 1991 resolution 687 in
1991 the Security Council called on Iraq
to eliminate its weapons of mass
destruction and as you recall the US and
Britain the claim that they were
developing weapons of mass destruction
so that was the legal argument for
invading Iraq nobody outside of the
White House and 10 Downing Street took
it very seriously but anyway that was
the legal argument well if you read that
resolution
down as far as article 14 you can find
it on the Internet you see that that
resolution calls on the on the signers
to move to establish a nuclear weapons
free zone in the Middle East well that
means that the US and Britain have a
very special commitment to this over and
above everyone else over and above the
fact that the world is in favor of it
the American population and so on and
that could be a step towards
strengthening the non-proliferation
treaty and reducing the threat of
nuclear weapons but the vision doesn't
go that far
the vision only goes as far as some
pleasant rhetoric and the steps that
could be taken to implement it or off
the agenda can be discussed I don't know
if anyone's ever discussed this anywhere
near the mainstream but the facts are
pretty straightforward you can check
them and it goes beyond that there are
other nuclear weapons free zones growing
throughout the world and you know
they're not they're not the answer to
everything but they're a step towards
reducing the threat of nuclear weapons
that's just a couple of months ago
Africa the African states agreed after
long debate and discussion to establish
an African nuclear weapons free zone
there's only one hitch the US won't go
along the US and Britain are blocking it
the reason is that the reason has to do
with an island Diego Garcia which the
African Union regards as part of Africa
but it's an island that was a British
colony and at the orders of the master
Britain expelled the population from
Diego Garcia so that the United States
could build a huge military base there
which it has and that's not that's just
for fun I mean that's the military base
from which the u.s. carries out its and
Britain carry out their
bombing operations in the Middle East
and Central Asia it's used it's one of
the main basis and that basis stores
nuclear weapons in fact just last
December the Navy announced that it's
sending a submarine tender to Diego
Garcia to take care of the nuclear
submarines that are there in the nuclear
weapons and none of this ever gets
reported but it's there oh okay I'm
supposed to stop rehashing all this 1960
stuff so I'll stop in a minute it's just
this let me just finish this part of it
there's a lot more to say about Obama's
foreign policy but you can bring it up a
nuclear weapons free zone in Africa
would make good sense it would mean
closing down Diego Garcia maybe even
allowing the population to return to
what's left of the island but that one's
not working because of us British
rejection there's another one in the
South Pacific the nuclear weapons free
zone there that one was held up for a
long time by France because France
wanted to use its islands to for nuclear
weapons tests but finally France
exploded its nuclear weapons and they're
not holding it up anymore so it's being
held up by the usual one vote the United
States won't permit it because the US
has Islands there which are very useful
sometimes they even vote with the u.s.
at the UN so it isn't a 100% against one
thing sometimes get Palau Micronesia but
the main purpose ignition so them is
that they the u.s. uses them to store
nuclear weapons and
or submarines and so on passed through
so therefore the u.s. refuses to allow
them to be included in the South Pacific
nuclear weapons-free zone but overcoming
that would be a considerable step
towards reducing nuclear proliferation
and also the threat constant threat and
often actual practice of using these
facilities because they're used all the
time
well that's that's here and the vision
extends much farther
mr. Palestine Latin America and other
things that's a great deal to say about
them but thanks to the instructions I'll
stop at this point and save you from
these stale nineteen sixties you know
when when Obama came into office or when
he was elected one highbush official I
think it was called Lisa rice predicted
that Obama's foreign policy would be a
continuation of Bush's second term the
first and second term of which were
quite different on the first term was
you know aggressive arrogant kicking the
world in the face even an allies and it
had such a negative effect as an action
as well as a manner that the US prestige
in the world sank to the lowest point
it's ever been
that was really harmful to the interests
of those who actually set foreign policy
business world for pretentious state
planners and so on there's a lot of
criticism of Bush right from the me
