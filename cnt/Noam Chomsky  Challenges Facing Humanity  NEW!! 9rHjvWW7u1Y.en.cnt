effective for them so tonight our guest
is known dr. Noam Chomsky really I
probably considered the greatest public
intellectual alive and very prolific
author over a hundred books almost as
prolific as another author that I used
to favor when I was younger I see gasps
mo who wrote over 500 books but Isaac
Asimov isn't quoted like Noam does and
Noam Chomsky is one of the 8th most
quoted authors in modern civilization
which is just astounding so if you write
so much and have all that work held in
very high regard is a quantity and
quality together is extremely
exceptional dr. Noam Chomsky are you
doing tonight good to be with you great
to handle hmm a great pleasure it's a
great pleasure one of your recent talks
and an article came out of it was a
title it can civilization survive
capitalism at least I was the title of
the article and it was referring
specifically to your discussion the
american legislative exchange council
alec writing up legislation that can be
applied state-by-state to distort our
educational system so students can't
even understand basic science might be
good perhaps talk a little bit about
that again that's so crucial for people
to be aware of well this alec is a
American Legislative Exchange Council is
a a very well-funded corporate based
lobbying lobbying group which primarily
it designs legislation for state for
states and it's got enough clout so that
many of them are accepted this is
pretty reactionary corporate funding the
Koch brothers and others this particular
program that you mentioned is a an
educational program they want to
introduce a program into the schools k
to 12 24 or what they call balanced
teaching of environmental science that a
balanced teaching means alongside of the
basic science that's backed by 99% of
scientists all National Academies of
science around the world what appears in
science magazines and technical
magazines alongside of that you should
teach climate change denial it's and
that'll give balanced teaching children
the critical thinking and so on it's
it's an obvious effort to try to induce
skepticism about the extremely serious
threat of environmental catastrophe
which could not be might be not too too
remote it's plenty of the ongoing
discoveries almost daily that indicate
that it's more dire than was expected
and that the very few grounds for
skepticism are being undermined
case-by-case the consensus on this is
quite unusual for a complex scientific
issue in heavily studied and this is a
part of a much broader effort corporate
effort which is it openly announced not
a great secret by the main lobbying
groups the American Chamber of Commerce
main business lobbies Chamber of
Commerce the Petroleum Institute than
others to try to prevent emeriti
american population from joining
virtually the entire world in
taking some serious steps towards
addressing this disaster now it's had a
bit of the campaign has had some effect
on the public the American public tends
to be somewhat more skeptical than other
comparable countries but it's still much
too close to the scientific the public
is much too close to the scientific
consensus for the wishes of the
corporate sector the ones who wanted
denied and that is the point of the Alec
program policy incidentally is far more
divorced from the international
consensus than attitudes are so out of
about 110 relevant countries of the
United States is the only one that
doesn't have a national federal program
national program to deal with the impact
of climate change and that doesn't have
national renewable energy targets we are
off the spectral in that the public
wants them but policy doesn't follow
them in fact that's one of many examples
in which policy is quite sharply
divorced from public attitudes and that
conforms very closely to the demands of
the corporate sector and the very
wealthy that's a rather very general
feature of what I call in that paper
that you quoted really existing
democracy which is really different from
democracy yes I think there is no
democracy really and it does seem like
though the democracy among the elites
you sort of have the right wing side of
the elite try to screw over the liberal
elites for example the voter suppression
that was sort of pushed through by
Republican governors of certain southern
states and so forth so it seems like
it's becoming less of a democracy
even for the elites they believe in
killing well there's actually very a
very good research and professional
political science about that's what I
mean one of the main topics they study
is public attitudes and in the United
States you can study that pretty well
it's a very heavily polled society a lot
of the polls are quite serious and well
done so you get good consistent results
about what people want and of course you
can see policy so therefore you can
compare policy with attitudes and the
results are quite striking turns out
roughly that roughly it the case that
for about seventy percent of the
population the lowest seventy percent on
the wealth income scale that seventy
percent has effectively no effect on
policy what they leave just the matter
at all the local figures don't pay any
attention to the Senators just don't
listen and so on as you move up the
scale income and wealth you get slowly a
little more influence and when you get
to the very top you get enormous
influence people essentially get what
they want well it's not a hundred
percent but it's a very striking
tendency so that what it means is that
there's a in effect as kind of flute ah
cracy with most of the population
essentially disenfranchised and as you
say there are now efforts to try to
extend that further just as in the case
of climate change denial these
skepticism a of the American public is
too close for comfort to the
international scientific consensus for
the comfort of those corporate elements
of the corporate structure which don't
want that it's exactly the same is true
in the case of electoral democracy it's
too close to Democratic even though very
froman and that's the point of these
efforts to try to restrict and reduce
voting by various techniques you know
voter ID who conditions making it harder
to vote so no votes on Sundays people
have to take off of work many other
devices are we used to try to cut back
the electorate and of course not the
whole electorate but a very special part
of it it's a primarily an attempt to
reduce the voting of poorer and less
privileged sectors when including
minorities firstly because they tend to
look democratic and republican governors
you mentioned want to cut that out so
all kinds of trekker being used to cut
back voting want to ask a question for
one of our young friend Justin because
all these online videos and very far
left and only 19 years old the
self-declared communist but he had a
question about the future since
neoliberalism is having such a
paralyzing effect on broad sectors of
the working class and by I assume he
means a wage pressure benefits getting
caught social safety net and so forth do
you see the revolutionary left growing
or rather do you see a fascist far-right
movement possibly growing in the future
you want to know your thoughts on that
well there's no serious sign of a
revolutionary left there are many
progressive forces of all kinds but not
revolutionary they're trying to help
work within the existing system to
overcome the kinds of very dangerous
developments that you just mentioned and
that in my opinion makes sense you can't
have a you can't expect people because
it wouldn't make sense for them to
apart to try to participate in a
revolutionary movement unless they were
convinced that the limits of change of
reform had been reached within existing
institutions so it makes perfect sense
to press existing institutions do the
limits to achieve which can and I think
every revolutionary ought to be in favor
of this and will encourage the
understanding that yes we can achieve a
good deal and we ought to it's for the
benefit of people to do it but there
will come points where you just can't go
any further at that point you have to
have institutional change now and in
fact you know it's not a matter of sort
of before and after you can actually
create elements of a future society
within the existing one and it's being
done in fact it's not pie in the sky so
for example there particularly in
northern Illinois working class and def
former industrial areas of working
Illinois Ohio sorry and also other
places there's an interesting growth of
worker owned enterprises they've extent
Lee and then just said you know these
are elements of a future you know free
society prove democratic society
communist society if you want to call it
that yeah but i guess the concern is on
the growing far right i mean for example
i think was it the southern law center
something like that put out an alert
that we now have over a thousand
right-wing militias yeah so I mean a
good possible fascist movement grow out
of that okay so that can always be there
till we've seen some politicians and
mortar them such behavior Alan let's
talk like the fascist as far as I'm
concerned really well so it's always
been it's always a danger
everywhere it's a danger in Europe it's
always been a danger here these are
forces that always exist in our kind of
society state capitalist societies like
these and there are potential danger not
very long ago they were a very serious
danger to the world in Europe and
they've existed in many other countries
since right now in Europe for example
the neo-fascist parties are coming close
to power sometimes in dominant positions
and both will Eastern Europe for example
knots not trivial and one of their
elements of that here in fact even some
very mainstream scholars have written
and even in journals like foreign
affairs the major establishment journal
there for example a couple years ago was
an article by one of the leading
specialists on Germany in the country
for its turn scribing what he called
descent into barbarism and he was
compared he was writing about the
collapse of civilization and the defense
descent into barbarism very rapidly in
Germany in the 30s but he was clearly
pointing to analogies in the United
States do you think we're heading the
setting of the barbarism note that says
well I hope not then we can certainly
prevent it but there's a danger I mean
take just the thing that we began with
the efforts to try to undermine actions
and to confront the potential crisis of
environmental catastrophe that'll be
worse than fascism no at the end to the
prospects for decent survival and we
might not be too far away take a look at
the mounting scientific evidence it
increasingly indicate
that there might be a tipping point you
know in the global lifetime of our
children and grandchildren well we had
study that just came out in the journal
journal science Maynard scientific turd
the study of of arctic Siberian ice
cores going back 500 years and it's a
study of how they the melting was
affected by temperature changes and the
conclusion is pretty alarming the
conclusion if it has to be further
verified that the conclusion of this
study is that even the kind of warming
that's anticipated could be sufficient
to melt the permafrost which will
release huge amounts of methane into the
atmosphere that's far more destructive
than carbon dioxide and that could set
off processes which we sharply escalate
the severe harm from global warming yeah
most people don't seem to realize that
it's like ice and water as the ice is
melting temperature is not going up you
have this phase transition then called
the thermal heat of fusion measures yeah
yeah basically gives you the temperature
it stays steady during a period of time
once the ice has gone that heat energy
goes into increasing temperature so it
will be an amazing temperature increase
once all that ice is gone that's not
talked about it's basic physics that's
in a high school physics book it's not
even talked about on the news now it was
pretty serious reporting and discoveries
at the end of the summer when the Arctic
ice melting period and
and studies were taken about how far
went turned out it was far beyond what
had been predicted and it has the kind
of consequences you described as the
Arctic ice melts there's less reflective
surface there's more black water less
white I send that absorbs more sunlight
less reflection that speeds up the
warming and you get a you get nonlinear
it's called nonlinear effect said
growing faster and faster rapidly also
because of the concentration of gas that
would be nonlinear the only time for
example that extreme weather was talked
about in relation to global warming even
though a number of scientists were
already recognizing and publishing about
this was a marine hurricane sandy you
know after wouldn't when a hurricane
threatens New York City the financial
network I guess then you know the
financial nerve center of the country
and then there's some grumbling that
maybe this bad weather is connected to
global warming they did it seemed
obvious be like this well the you know
the climate models and all of them
predict more extreme variation and
weather as you have global warming but I
mean you know science hasn't reached the
point where you can say that this
particular event was the result of
global warming it's a probability of it
we increased we've increased your dad
how to tell you whether that particular
can was it's just auto likely that you
all listed at Ward's netic energy yeah
but it's a sign of it's a danger sign
it's kind of like a canary in the coal
mines it's a little it occurs to ignore
it and most of the world isn't ignoring
and in fact even the American population
isn't ignoring it though policy is
ignoring in fact policies Millie in the
opposite direction it's a
just a little bit in that article is a
kind of a remarkable phenomenon taking
place on throughout the world right now
I mean this problem is a very severe one
and their various reactions to it in the
forefront of trying to do something
serious to mitigate or in the
catastrophe in the forefront are
indigenous populations tribal societies
traditional societies so for example in
Ecuador where there's a large indigenous
populations been able to influence
policy they are trying to gain support
for their an oil producer they're trying
to gain support for keeping the oil in
the ground that we're totally when you
get to the richest and most advanced
societies like ours and Canada's with
incomparable advantages we're doing the
opposite we're trying to accelerate the
race to disaster so while they're trying
to keep the oil in the ground or auto be
that we are trying hard to get every
last drop of even very dangerous
hydrocarbons like tar sands out of the
ground as fast as possible and both
political parties are hell-bent proud of
the co of it trying to achieve the goal
of what they call a century yeah there's
a dependence which means getting
everything out that weekend making
things as dangerous as possible it's a
mrs. Everest or in in the future there
may not be and looking back at this is
called yeah yeah it's it's very scary so
basically colonial set learn a shins are
the worst and behavior the ones not
primarily populated and run by their
indigenous population you say that's
primarily class driven issue then its
class structure issue although society
was a very large extent i mean the
United the United States and Canada's
rather like it or
is a highly stratified society to an
unusual extent in the world it's a
business run society with a very class
conscious business class that's one of
the reasons why inequality is so much
higher here than in other societies
that's why if the United States is
virtually alone in the world and not
having a functioning national health
system highly dysfunctional most private
I system I agree costly as law deaths
and so on many other respectfully are
very low benefits by comparative
standards all of these are huge attacks
on the labor movement very violent labor
history these are all reflections of the
fact that it's a formal kind of
historical reasons to a an unusual
extent to business run society and there
have been powerful popular Democratic
movements they've achieved quite a lot
connecting in some respects the United
States of the world leader so X a
freedom of speech which is very
significant right very important I mean
that's protected in the United States
probably more than any major country in
the world now that's it's not in the
bill right I mean that's you know those
words their ability protections really
came much more recently there a mid 20th
century phenomenon in fact the biggest
step forward was in the context of the
civil rights movement and quite commonly
rights or one and by popular struggle
they're not gifts from above the same
can be true of what we were talking
about before the potential environmental
catastrophe may be a real one not very
far away it's going to take substantial
popular activism at education to
overcome concentrated power that once
accelerate the danger I should say it's
not the individuals so the same people
who maybe you know funding efforts to
turn the country into sort of a stupid
nation which doesn't understand those
same people individually maybe you know
contributing to the Sierra Club that
they understand what's happening as well
as the rest of us do but they have an
institutional role in their capacities
as a CEO of a corporation the
institutional structure compels them to
act differently it's a it's a back to
your radical friends of you quoted
before this is a serious institutional
problem though which is driving the
society towards possible disaster whoo
that's kind of inherent in you know
market societies I'm we don't have
really a market society but to the
extent that there is a market of the
well-known deficiencies of markers and
they are well known enter like one
crucial market inefficiency you can read
about it in every economics test text is
the transactions do not take into
account what are called externalities
the effects on others so for example if
you sell me a car that we may make a
good deal for ourselves but we don't pay
attention to the costs that it imposes
on the guy next door and it does impose
a cost there's more pollution you know
more traffic accidents price goes up and
so on well these these externalities can
be huge and one of them the most vast of
all is environmental catastrophe so
where business is making decisions it is
not taking it it's not internalizing the
cost of
perhaps destruction of the environment
that just not considered and it won't be
considered in a market system that's
part of the fundamental and possibly
even lethal the defects of these systems
a very defective capitalism itself to
fundamental and the public's is not made
aware of it at all the issues that are
covered and take up a huge hunk of the
news to limo for example the gun control
debate valid public safety issue perhaps
but it doesn't put more food on one's
table and certainly doesn't prevent a
potential disaster to the human race but
it's an issue that's promoted at times
almost half the news cycle and it just
it's if it's extremely polarizing just
I've never seen people so split up over
it yelling at each other across the hall
in a sense I'm serious issue it ought to
be dealt with but you're perfectly right
it's not of anywhere near the scale of
say climate disaster the trafficker war
others I mean you think it's deliberate
the sense that it takes so much of a new
cycle and it's also deliberately
polarizing it's an amazingly distracting
issue it's only sick people moves off
key issues I think it's very direct I'm
in the you know the media have a concept
of objectivity which they are proud of
they explained it and they try to keep
to it objectivity means recounting
accurately what's happening inside the
beltway you know in Washington circles
within decision-making circles so if the
Democrats and Republicans are arguing
about something you're supposed to
review to discuss that if they're not if
they're basically agreeing on something
you don't discuss it one of the things
they're basically agreeing on is support
nation to corporate power and disregard
of massive externalities like
destruction of the environment
so therefore you're down to what they're
willing to debate which is not
insignificant like guns are an important
issue but I don't think it's deliberate
deception it's another kind of almost
institutional property series these
properties are very fundamental you know
they're not bad it's not a matter of bad
people it's a matter of institutional
structure just so as to maximize bad
choices that's the serious problem yeah
oh and also if you're a reporter for the
beltway you want to keep in line because
if you go out of it you lose access and
that's how you're punished you just lose
access we're more than that I mean ask
yourself take a look at your
congressional representative somewhere I
suppose suppose that he or she leaves
Congress and goes back to private life
what are they going to be is the person
going back to be a truck driver and you
know data process or secretary a nurse
no no the person is going to go back to
a cushy job in a lobbying firm probably
lobbying for the area that the person
was legislating in full management
position and so on and those are the
rewards for behaving properly while
you're in your legislative role quite
apart from the fact that you know
elections are by now we're so remote
from a functioning democracy that
elections are substantially bought which
means you're in debt to the club I'm for
you dr. Petrovsky I mean it is 1130 so
you know ahead of time based on what but
would you be willing to entertain some
guests questions I think audience
questions yeah but I really can't stay
long I've got another one got myself in
you know whatever you want to clear cups
couple more minutes yeah okay what they
on somebody is here on skype i believe
soon as I can get them in hello you're
on the air hello okay then didn't work
listen I'm afraid oh really have to take
off I've got another call coming in a
minute oh okay yeah laughter Chomsky you
know I thank you so much please come
again ok good to talk to you yep I ok
you goodnight
