even the so called constructive programs
were actually lethal like take the
Alliance for Progress now most of our
lot of what happened in Central America
is just because we imposed dictators and
gangsters and terrorists and so on if
they ever try to get independent as in
Guatemala but every once in a while
there's something called a constructive
program the Alliance for Progress is the
famous case well I know the Alliance for
Progress was like a plague probably
worst plague that hit central america
until the Reagan administration that's
killers in a category by themselves the
Alliance for Progress first of all was a
completely cynical operation I mean the
Alliance for Progress was not instituted
by the Kennedy administration because
they suddenly discovered that there are
poor people in Central America and they
knew that all along it was initiated
because they were afraid that the poor
people in central america were going to
follow the cuban model now that means it
began as a purely cynical operation okay
and that showed the Alliance for
Progress was designed to impose on Latin
America altogether in fact an agro
export model they're supposed to shift
production from subsistence crops to
export for the benefit of us
agribusiness in the American market well
as consequences for example it means
that farmers in Central America are
expected not to produce rice and beans
for them people locally to eat but
asparagus and broccoli and flowers for
yuppie markets in the United States well
for one thing that means not going to
eat so I got to import food which they
import from us at high costs which is
good for American agriculture subsidized
usually by the american taxpayer now
subsidized by them and it also means
that and that food is not going to be
equally distributed it's going to be
distributed to the rich furthermore the
production is going to be by the rich
because it takes capital inputs to
produce the fancy fruits for the
American market so there's going to be
landless peasants furthermore they're
going to produce beef in fact every
Latin American tral American country
beef production moved up rapid
under the alliance for progress while
beef consumption reduced and the reason
is that ranchers moved in often with
North American connections drove
peasants off their land turned it into
grazing lands so they could send beef to
North American markets for hamburgers
great for a grammarian agribusiness and
for pesticide and fertilizer
manufacturers and for the rich in
Central America but not very good for
the people now you take a look at you
look to your favorite economics book or
latin american studies book and they'll
tell you that the Alliance for Progress
created an economic miracle well you
know from a certain point of view it did
a gross national product went up all
through Central America so did
malnutrition no and the reason is
obvious you drive people off the land up
in the hills and you take over their
land then you produce beef for export
and fancy crops it's good for the gross
national product just means the people
starve in fact the crisis of the 1980s
is largely caused by that plague well
let's just take the 1980s during the
1980's the Reagan administration is
responsible for roughly 200,000 people
slaughtered and that doesn't mean just
killed you know that means tortured and
mutilated and raped I mean Paul Pott
style torture that's pretty serious
business hundreds of thousand five
millions of refugees large areas of the
country destroyed all of this in an
effort to block social reform in all
three major countries where we were
involved in Honduras and El Salvador and
Nicaragua now that's serious what should
we do well the first the first thing we
do is stop torturing them a second thing
we should do is pay reparations because
we own and after that maybe there's some
hope that they could reconstruct from
the damage we've done to them I think
that's where we ought to do try to find
anybody suggesting that in the
mainstream however you can't express
this view not because it's false but
because it's true if you look into it
you'll find that it's true I think now
what should we do
I mean let's go back well we should do
we are free to act plenty of things that
we can do one thing we can just provide
aid ourselves you'll have to wait for
the state to order you to provide aid
they need it badly I mean Nicaragua was
reeling the hurricane last October was
the final blow they're gonna have mass
starvation there now the government of
course is delighted the US government
they won't send of a penny because they
want them to suffer as much as possible
but American citizens are much more
independent and in fact they've raised a
lot of money for example there's one
small Jesuit center in North Carolina or
Virginia or some worthy quest for peace
scroll with the Quixote a center a
little I think they they have three
staff members or something they've
raised millions of dollars from people
in the United States who are able to
think for themselves who weren't just
slaves of power and those are things
that can be done you can help people
survive and you can have to all put
pressure on on Congress on the media to
do something about this a lot of ways of
doing that weighs all sorts of ways
ranging from civil disobedience to
writing letters to the editor to you
know mass popular organization you know
they're not going to put you in jail for
it and that's a very free country which
means if you don't do it you have a lot
more responsibility than if you don't do
it in a place where you are afraid that
you're going to be repressed so there's
no shortage of things to do it's just a
matter of willingness to do them and the
willingness to do them begins with a
willingness to recognize reality that's
the hardest part I think once you
recognize reality won't have any more
questions about what to do because too
obvious so the first thing to do is to
recognize the reality and it takes a
little work but once you recognize it I
think it's obvious what to do
