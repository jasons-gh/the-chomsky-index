what state does function according to
what you call the minimal levels of
honesty is there Stan
no it's our power centers the only thing
that imposes constraints on them is
either outside force or their own
populations so the United Services
critical dialogue that's exactly why the
intellectuals who were talking about are
so adamant at preventing people in the
United States and Britain from learning
the most elementary facts about is it
even possible that if you see no state
function it's not really happens the
United States for example is far more
civilized than it was 40 years ago
the immediate problem is to free
ourselves from the shackles imposed very
consciously by the kind of people you're
talking about who don't want the facts
to be known and for very good reasons
because if people know the facts they're
not going to tolerate it
so therefore have to prevent them from
knowing you have to indoctrinate them
you have to tell them stories about how
we're really good guys and if we use
violence must be for the general good
because we represent the course of
history yeah that's the job of
propagandists for power and violence
there are things you have to believe to
make it to top managerial positions you
have to believe that the United States
is unique in history and that it acts
from benevolent motives benevolent
motives are not properties of States
whether it's the United States or any
other one they don't have this is
meaningless to talk about the United get
any four I mean it acts because of the
interests of groups that have power
within it like any other society but
anyone who believes this truism is
already excluded you have to believe
that whatever the United States does is
defensive if we bomb South Vietnam we're
defending South Vietnam if the Russians
invade Afghanistan
that's not defense now of course if you
I suppose if you go to the pelipper
they'll tell you they're defending
Afghanistan they're defending it against
terrorists supported from the outside
and of course there's a you know we know
that there's a bill in fact you can tell
you they were invited in and there's a
kind of an element of truth to all of
that but if we naturally dismiss it as
nonsense on the other hand when we
create a government in South Vietnam to
invite us in and
we attack the population of South
Vietnam and we bomb people to drive them
into concentration camps to separate
them from the guerrillas who we concede
they're supporting and so on we're
defending South Vietnam and anyone who
doesn't agree with this is not part of
the system they the Russians don't keep
their promises because they are a nation
like other nations in fact the fact that
is anyone who believes the promises of
any nation-state is out of their minds
or just doesn't know anything about
history and that includes us and every
other one thinks I mean you know states
follow their promises if it's in their
interest to do so and the the point is
to try to create a system of shared
interests which will bring about a
certain degree of observance to
international agreements every Power
greater small tries to extend the
influence of its weather the extent of
its degree to coerce and control and
penetrate markets and so on and so forth
get resources we happen to be the
world's most powerful force in the early
post-war period we were overwhelmingly
the world's most powerful force and
therefore the United States did in fact
we can easily document this both in the
documentary record in the historical
record the United States did in fact set
forth on a policy of global domination
and it succeeded to a surprising extent
since that period be and the Russians
did so also in their much smaller sphere
now since that period this bipolar
system has in fact eroded I mean other
powers have developed Europe Japan
element to the third world and in fact
the degree of the two superpowers to
coerce and control us in our huge
domains and them and there are smaller
domains that has declined but point out
that every again it's quite general
every society perceives itself or tries
to make its public perceive itself as
benevolent I mean the British were
carrying the white man's burden and the
French had a civilizing mission and the
Russians are doing their
internationalist duty when they entered
when they invade Afghanistan and the
United States is preserving democracy
and all of this and we are as much
interested in democracy as the Russians
are interested in socialism in fact we
you know over and over again have
overthrown democratic regimes if they
didn't do the kind of thing we wanted
them to do I mean there has study after
study has revealed the obvious namely
that American support and aid correlates
with sense
with the improvement of the investment
claim if a country is willing to open
itself to our penetration and control
our access to resources allow our
corporations to repatriate profits and
so on we will support them doesn't
matter what kind of regime they have
it's perfectly true that the United
States or at least you know the American
leadership in the American ideological
system have been very strongly opposed
to what they call socialism but of
course they're opposed to many other
things too for example there they've
often been opposed to fascism you know
we went to war with fascist States they
were opposed to national capitalism in
Europe I mean they were about there that
the United States has been opposed to
democracy for example we were opposed to
democracy to a nudie overt style regime
in Guatemala and in fact there's a
general principle of which the
opposition to so-called socialism is
just one special case namely the United
States is opposed naturally to any
attempt on the part of any society to
use its resources for its own purposes
instead of to integrate itself into what
we call an open world system which means
a system that's open to American
economic penetration and political
control if any society deviates from
that whether it's capitalist fascist
communist you know democratic or
whatever the United States will be
opposed to it we're Kaplan who writes
about foreign policy I spoke to him
recently about his book warrior politics
and I put some of your points to him he
said about the distinction between the
terrorist States you call Israel you
know America and the terrorist States
that America calls the Taliban he said I
wish Noam Chomsky had been with me in
Romania in the 70s or the 80s just one
of the seven or eight Warsaw states with
just one of the seven or eight prison
systems with 700,000 political prisoners
adult choice a foreign policy is made on
distinctions the argument that Chomsky
makes has no distinctions because
there's a difference between the
quantity and the kind of dictators that
America supported and the quantity and
the kind of things we went in in
communist world for 44 years so let's
take his example I am
Ceausescu hideous regime yeah which he
forgot to tell you the United States
supported supported right till the end
as did Britain so the example that he
gave is a perfect example and it's a
smaller
because we support much more brutal
regimes I gave an example in
southeastern Turkey several million
refugees tens of thousands of people
killed a country devastated that's
rather serious
it's a nobody accused the militia which
of that in Kosovo East Timor we support
an affricate he's Indonesian he was one
of the Suharto who was one of the worst
killers and torturers of the late 20th
century the United States and Britain
supported him throughout he's our kind
of guy as the Clinton administration
said in 1995 a horrible atrocity is in
fact you know when he came into office
in 1965 with a coup the CIA compared it
to Hitler Stalin and now it led to total
euphoria in the United States and
Britain massive support when he carried
out even worse atrocity comparable
atrocities elsewhere the couple of you
know hundred thousand people killed then
hundreds of thousands later full support
continued right through the end of his
rule in fact continued past his rule in
late 1999 when they were rampaging and
destroying what was left of East Timor
the US and Britain continued to support
him and I can continue through the world
like this I mean what Catalans Kaplan
says that that there is a distinction
that everyone's got some blood other
hands but he says ah we have
significantly less blood because what we
are soft imperialist really state
terrorists so like when we supported his
example Ceausescu in Romania right to
the end that's good how about killing
several million people in Vietnam how
about killing hundreds of thousands of
people in Central America in the 80s
leaving four countries devastated beyond
you know beyond may be beyond recoveries
but Machiavellian virtue sometimes we do
a bad thing to protect our democratic
and our good institutions and a justice
system how are we protecting our
democratic institutions by supporting
mass slaughter in southeastern Turkey in
the last few years was that supporting
our democratic institutions was it
supporting our Democrat against
not ours but anybody would Kaplan argue
that the nation state has a right to use
any means necessary to protect its
sovereignty no then then he's justifying
the luster of it she's saying Milazzo
Fitch had any have the right to anything
he wanted to repress the Kosovars and
Albanians that reasoning do we needs a
Constabulary a force a central force in
this case it's America in America
because it's the superpower to sometimes
use unjust means in the service of just
causes what are the just cause it's what
was the Just Cause in for example
slaughtering Kurds in southeastern
Turkey what was it just cause I can what
was the Just Cause in supporting Suharto
when he wiped when he killed a couple
hundred thousand landless peasants in
Indonesia went on to become one of the
biggest torturers in the world and then
destroyed slaughtered a third of the
population of East Timor what was it
just cause what was it just cause when
we invaded South Vietnam forty years ago
this is the 40th anniversary of the
public announcement of the u.s. attack
on South Vietnam ending up killing
millions of people leaving the country
devastated is still dying from chemical
warfare what was it just cause what was
the just cause when we fought a war to a
large extent against the Catholic Church
in Central America in the 1980s killing
hundreds of thousands of people every
imaginable kind of torture and
devastation what was the Just Cause can
I continue yeah we were the Just Cause
for people like Kaplan is we did it
there are many evil forces in the world
if we want to stop atrocities I think
it's a great idea to reduce the level of
atrocities and violence around the world
the easiest way to do it simplest is to
stop participating in it if we stop
participating in it we will already
reduce the level of a try atrocities and
violence enormous Lee and if we can ever
reach the moral level minimal moral
level of terminating our own massive
participation and atrocities then we can
move to another question of what we do
about the atrocities of others and I
think there I think that it's right to
deal with them yes there is an enemy
there are people who carried out crimes
against humanity and there are ways to
deal with crimes not by a bombing
another country and putting millions of
people at the risk of starvation that's
not a way to deal with crimes when the
US was condemned for international
terrorism in Nicaragua and then vetoed a
security hadn't dismissed the
condemnation by the World Court of
course and escalated the crimes and
vetoed a Security Council resolution
calling out on it to observe
international law the right reaction for
Nicaragua was not to say we have seen
the enemy and we must destroy them so
therefore let's set off bombs in
Washington but if it's wrong for them
it's wrong for us again by elementary
moral standards so we should ask well
what was right for them and what's right
for which would be right for us and I
think they couldn't do what was right
for them because we blocked it we're too
powerful but we could do what was right
for them and we never even considered it
because we don't rise to that minimal
moral level
when we investigate the foreign policy
of any state we find first of all an
official doctrine that attributes to
state policy honorable intent though
occasional failure due primarily to the
national evil enemies the Soviet
propaganda proclaims the commitment of
the Soviet Union to peace democracy and
human rights describes the Soviet
posture as defensive and identifies u.s.
imperialism as the prime source of
disorder and suffering throughout the
world official US doctrine is the mirror
image and the pattern is far more
pervasive if not universal if we
investigate further we regularly
discover that official doctrine is quite
inconsistent with the historical and
documentary record in our case we are
fortunate to have access to a rich
documentary record for earlier years we
discover not surprisingly that it
conforms to the pattern of evolving
events and is entirely inconsistent with
widely proclaimed doctrine now I cannot
hope to establish these conclusions in a
few minutes rather I'll try to sketch
the main outlines of what I believe you
will discover if you explore the record
on your own as I very much hope you will
I'll focus on Central America in the
Middle East and the post-world War two
period but the record for earlier years
and other regions is much the same the
United States emerged from World War two
in a position of global power with few
with any historical precedents and USA
leaks were well aware of the fact
through the 1940s they carried out
sophisticated geopolitical planning
which is on record to fashion a global
order that be responsive to their
interests during the war top state
department planners carried out
extensive studies with the Council on
Foreign Relations to develop the general
outlines of global policy later applied
to particular regions they developed the
concept of what they called the grand
area the grand
area was to be a region subordinated to
the needs of the American economy in a
framework of liberal internationalism in
which it was plausibly assumed US
interests would nominate the grand area
was outlined in detail that was to
include at a minimum the Far East the
Western Hemisphere and the former
British Empire including the energy
reserves of the Middle East which the
State Department described as I'm
quoting a stupendous source of strategic
power and one of the greatest material
prizes in world history the richest
economic prize in the world in the field
of foreign investment referring Saudi
Arabia at a maximum the grand area
should become a world system under US
control now the grand area had a
structure the industrial powers were to
be reconstituted but under US control
and in a manner acceptable to the United
States a commitment with many
significant consequences it was
understood that Europe and Japan
required a hinterland State Department
studies now Declassified explain that
the third world was to fulfill its
function as a source of raw materials
and markets for the industrial
capitalist powers and was to be
exploited as they put it for their
reconstruction with regard to Latin
America George Kennan who was one of the
most influential of post war planners
explained an internal discussion that a
prime concern is the protection of our
raw materials more generally he observed
that we have 50% of the world's wealth
but only 6% of its population and we
must maintain this disparity to the
extent possible by force if necessary
putting aside vague and idealistic
slogans such as human rights the raising
of the living standards and
democratization preferring police states
if needed over democracies that might be
too liberal and too indulgent to what
were called communists the latter term
has lost any substantive meaning and US
political rhetoric referring simply to
anyone who stands in our way
these are all quotes these are all
quotes incidentally the declassified
documents on u.s. foreign policy in
Latin America applied these these ideas
in detail they explained that the
primary threat we face in Latin America
I'm continuing to quote is the trend
toward nationalistic regimes that
respond to popular demand for
improvement in low living standards and
production for domestic needs now that's
unacceptable because the United States
is committed to quote encouraging a
climate conducive to private investment
in particular guarantees for opportunity
to earn and in the case of foreign
capital to repatriate a reasonable
return we must therefore oppose what is
regularly called ultra-nationalism
in secret documents that means efforts
to pursue domestic needs
we must foster export oriented
production in the interest of US
investors now is recognized that such
programs have very little appeal to the
Latin American public so the conclusion
is natural natural one we must therefore
gain control over the military which can
in turn control domestic opposition and
overthrows civilian governments if
necessary we must also act to overcome
the excessive liberalism of the
latin-american countries these ideas are
outlined in the high-level documents and
were applied in practice in Latin
America as elsewhere if some group or
country succumbs to ultra-nationalism it
must be disciplined by the local
security forces under US control if
possible or by direct US subversion or
aggression and the modern history of
Latin America is to a significant extent
an application of these doctrines so a
brief experiment in capitalist democracy
in Guatemala was terminated in 1954 by a
CIA coup installing a murderous terror
state that has been maintained by
regular US intervention to block
elections and to conduct regular
repression and massacre these operations
reach the peak in the past decade with
perhaps 100,000 people killed and
innumerable others tortured maimed and
starved all of this and
jessica lee supported by the Reagan
administration meanwhile Honduras was
turned into a US military base with
increasing human rights violations
reaching several assassinations a week
last year and hundreds of thousands of
peasants starving to death while the
country exports snow peas and beef for
US markets that being a typical
consequence of the u.s. imposed aid and
development model in El Salvador in the
late 1970s there was a proliferation of
popular organizations largely
church-based
that threatened to lay the basis for
popular for meaningful democracy and
social reforms the archbishop pleaded
with the United States government not to
send aid to the kunta because it would
be used he said destroy the people's
organizations fighting to defend their
fundamental human rights these security
forces backed by the United States
overcame the threat of democracy and
social reform by terror and slaughter
murdering the political opposition
assassinating the archbishop physically
destroying the independent media
invading and largely destroying the
university slaughtering tens of
thousands of peasants union leaders and
others killing priests and nuns and
intellectuals are driving them out of
the country to which they still cannot
return for fear of torture and
assassination when the population was
considered to be sufficiently
traumatized a so-called election was
held in an atmosphere of terror and
despair macabre rumor and grisly reality
in the words of the British human Rakata
mentary human rights group that observed
it I should add that it's a staple of
independent scholarship that I quote
known while paying lip service to the
encouragement of representative
representative democracy of Latin
America the United States has a strong
interest in just the reverse apart from
formal elections that are often farcical
and that the alleged us concern for
democracy when proper conditions have
been established by repression violence
or simply control of resources that that
is only a tactical device to inch
the dominance of private capitalistic
enterprise linked to the United States
son quoting from Gordon Connell Smith in
the major study of the inter-american
system published by the Royal Institute
of International Affairs in London as
the leading academic u.s. academic
scholar on human rights in Latin America
has put it the goal of the military
authoritarian regimes back sponsored by
the United States has been to destroy
permanently a perceived threat to the
existing structure of socio-economic
privilege by eliminating the political
participation of the numerical majority
principally the working or popular
classes that's what we call democracy in
the case of Nicaragua as George Shultz
frankly explained the concern was that
sandanista success might emboldened
others to seek radical solutions to
their problems unacceptable to the
United States therefore the United
States followed what in fact is quite a
traditional pattern attempting to force
Nicaragua into the Soviet orbit by
military attack pressures on allies and
international lending institutions to
refuse military and other aid economic
warfare that have had a lethal effect in
a desperately poor country ideological
warfare he ran abroad including
Nicaragua where the u.s. in fact
dominates the media in much of the
country the purpose was to abort the
early successes of the Sandinista
revolution in health welfare and
development and to ensure that the virus
of independent development does not
infect the reason region to use these
standard terms of this miss case Henry
Kissinger and others there have been
numerous other examples over the years
now policy does vary so at the hawkish
extreme we have the Reaganites
who favor force over diplomacy and
thunder that negotiations are a
euphemism for capitulation if the shadow
of power is not cast across the
bargaining table and that the purpose of
our aid is to permit people who are
fighting on our side to use more
violence as George Shultz and Elliott
Abrams respectively at the dovish
extreme we find Robert pastor
who was director of latin-american
affairs for the National Security
Council under Carter he explains that
quoting the United States did not want
to control Nicaragua or other nations of
the region but it also did not want to
allow developments to get out of control
it wanted Nicaraguans to act
independently except when doing so would
affect US interests adversely the Latin
Americans should be freed choose as we
wish them to choose again what we call
democracy in practice when they choose
otherwise we resort to what our friends
in the Salvadoran military called the
pedagogy of Terror sometimes in extreme
forms as under the Reagan administration
which is responsible for atrocities that
merit comparison to call pot turning
briefly to the Middle East the primary
concern was the same the fear that
indigenous nationalism might threaten
our effective control over one of the
greatest material prizes in world
history that was understood since the
1940s to provide us with leverage over
Europe and Japan the National Security
Council recognized in 1958 that quoting
a logical corollary of our opposition to
radical nationalism would be support for
Israel as a loyal ally now this
conception of Israel as a strategic
asset became established in ways I can't
review here particularly under the Nixon
doctrine with Israel and Iran under the
Shah assigned the role of cops on the
beat as the defense secretary melvin
laird put it at the time israel also
increasingly came to provide services
for us power in Africa and Asia but
particularly in Latin America as in
Central America over the past decade
where Israel has served in effect as a
mercenary state within the impressive
international terror network that was
partially partially exposed during the
iran-contra hearings these are the
essential factors that have led the
United States to block a political
settlement for the arab-israeli conflict
since 1971 a settlement that's backed by
a broad international consensus that
favors a two-state settlement and the
internationally recognized borders based
on the principle that the indigenous
halation of the former Palestine and the
Jewish settlers who largely displaced
them both have the right of national
self-determination such a settlement
which has long been feasible is opposed
by Khomeini by Qaddafi by the United
States and Israel u.s. Israeli power has
been decisive in blocking this policy
not too well understood here but easily
documented from the record and traceable
back to Henry Kissinger that guarantees
further escalation of the cycle of harsh
repression resistance more repression
and more resistance in the occupied
territories with a likelihood of
regional wars and possible superpower
confrontation as has repeatedly
threatened since 1967 now these are I
think the main outlines of what you will
discover if you review the ample
documentary and historical record a
record that is very remote from official
coyote's as we regularly discover in
investigating international affairs and
their ideological cover let me just
comment a little bit on some of those
remarks first mr. pearl pointed out that
the Soviet Union and the United States
are internally very different societies
I absolutely agree and anybody who can
think their way out of a paper bag will
notice that that has no relation
whatsoever to my comment that the that
in every state you look at whether it's
the Soviet Union or the United States or
anyone else you'll find official piety
and you'll find the historical and
documentary record and they want
anything to do with each other with
regard to the reconstruction of Europe
well that was my main topic I'd be very
much interested in talking about it if
someone would like to raise questions
let me just stress again what I said the
United the United States planned in the
highest level planning documents in
during the war and later to reconstruct
Europe in the context of liberal
internationalism in which it was assumed
that US interests would prevail given
the relations of power it's exactly what
happened for example US investment in
Europe skyrocketed the United States was
deeply concerned that if the United
States did not reconstruct Japan and you
they would associate themselves with our
enemies Japan it was assumed would
associate itself with China with the
Soviet Union we had to block this
therefore we had to reconstruct them
under our own control in particular the
control over Middle East oil was always
regarded explicitly as a lever to ensure
as George Kennan put it a veto power
over them and recalled notice that these
policies of liberal internationalism in
fact worked let me stress that the
documents that I was citing of course
they're a small selection were not
random comments by this or that person I
was quoting the highest the most
comprehensive statements of the policy
planning staff of the State Department
and the National Security Council the
statements I quoted are reiterated over
and over again often verbatim
consistently in the documentary record
and they in fact as you will discover if
you look represent the core of thinking
in the 1940s in the early 1950s when the
framework of the current world order was
established as far as Europe was mr. Pro
is correct when he says that the United
States fosters stability and prosperity
of a very special kind the kind in which
we can prosper so it's us the kind of
stability in which for example Honduras
exports so peas and beef but doesn't
feed its own population and we also
foster democracy namely the kind that we
like so for example in the early 9th at
late 1940s the United States intervened
in Japan and in Europe to conduct the
reverse course which blocked which
destroyed the anti-fascist resistance
which repressed labor which broke up
unions which broke up the independent
media which reconstructed business
control and in fact historic pretty much
the old order but now within the
framework of u.s. power and in fact that
explains the kind of democracy we want
democracy under business control link
the aid to Nicaragua that mr. Perot
mentioned is a perfect example the aid
did not go to Nicaragua it went to the
business sector in Nicaragua to the
private sector in an effort to block the
San Minister revolution mr. Perot
regards it as astonishing that we
attempted to drive Nicaragua into the
Soviet orbit here comes a question I
would like to ask what you think are the
consequences of organizing a military
force based on the National Guard with
the aid of Argentinian Nazis to attack a
country then preventing them from
getting any military aid from abroad
turning down their request to us for
arms blocking aid from international
institutions launching economic warfare
including finally a blockade when you
can when you attack the country and you
prevent them from getting arms from
anywhere else except the Soviet Union
exactly what does one think is going to
happen
does it take a genius to conclude that
they're going to rely on the Soviet
Union when we instituted that blockade
in 1985 so Nicaraguan trade with the
Soviet Union was in fact 20% they wit
with a whole East Soviet bloc including
Cuba about the same as ours
much less than Europe and much less than
the third world purpose of the blockade
as the purpose of the attack was obvious
it would have the intended consequence
of forcing the reliance that we require
as a retrospective justification for
attacking them for quite different
reasons now as to the atrocities that
are comparable to Pol Pot again I urge
that you look at US government records
so for example the CIA has a demographic
study of the Pol Pot regime in which
they conclude they much underestimate in
my view but they conclude that fifty two
hundred thousand people were killed more
serious estimates put it at several
hundred thousand and many hundred
thousands more died from starvation
disease etc that's roughly comparable to
what happened in Central America in the
last decade in scale and in character
read the reports of the human rights
organizations of the church and so on
and you will find that the torture
atrocities mutilation and so on in sense
America is exactly on the style of pop
check it and see as to my calling for
the United States to get out of Vietnam
in in Indochina let me recall the facts
for the 1960s I did call on the United
States to terminate its aggression
against South Vietnam and its invasion
of all of Indochina exactly as I call on
the Soviet Union to terminate its
aggression in Afghanistan by 1970 I
pointed out that the effect of u.s.
policy was going to be to guarantee that
North Vietnam would control all of
Indochina for the simple reason that by
that time we had destroyed the
indigenous forces and the other
countries pretty much what happened the
United States physically destroyed three
countries they've undergone a disaster
that there's nothing in our history to
compare with back to the Black Plague
and in fact you do see the effect of
that the Russians continue in
Afghanistan you'll see similar effects
that several questions came up let me
deal with them one at a time why is it
in the interest of the United States to
drive Nicaragua into the hands of the
Soviet Union it's transparent actually
first let's establish again that that is
that was the policy of the United States
simply to review the record the Carter
Administration tried very hard to first
of all supported Somoza until virtually
the end long after the Nicaraguan
business community our natural allies
turned against him and after our other
Central American allies turned against
him when it became impossible to support
Somoza because he was obviously gone the
carter administration the carter
administration tried to maintain the
national guard in power in fact it
called upon the Organization of American
States to intervene to maintain the
national guard and power and a policy
that latin americans called some some of
some of someone's his mode without
Somoza that failed the Latin American
countries refused to go along
after that the the Carter Administration
tried in every way to first to rescue
the National Guard so for example they
sent American planes under red cross
marking to violation of the laws of war
incidentally in to Managua to take
National Guard officers out they
the Contras were reconstituted on border
they were quickly picked up by the
Reagan administration and turned into a
terrorist force to a technically
meanwhile the Contra the Carter
Administration offered aid but not to
the sound Ennis to government let me
repeat that that aid went to the private
sector it was again a last-ditch effort
to try to prevent the Sandinistas from
coming into power now maybe the Carter
Administration would have made some
arrangement we can't tell but when the
Reagan administration came in that was
finished they launched an attack against
Nicaragua almost immediately both the
military tacit attack and an economic
attack they prevented our allies from
sending aid to Nicaragua so for example
there was pressure put on France to stop
them from providing arms the story about
arms and El Salvador I won't go into it
if you like but there's nothing to it
the the the both economic warfare and
military worker increased international
lending institutions were pressured to
stop giving aid an embargo was called at
a time when so when Nicaraguan trade
with the entire Soviet bloc was roughly
comparable to ours again I say it does
not take a genius to figure out that the
result of these policies will be to
force them to rely on the only group we
allow them to rely on to defend
themselves against their attack
so assuming something short of total
stupidity that was the purpose since it
was obviously the perfectly predictable
consequence and the consequence that to
a limited extent took place but that's
not why did I didn't quite answer yet
why we wanted to do it well the answer
that's obvious in facts a consistent
pattern we did it when we wanted to
overthrow Guatemalan democracy we did it
when we wanted to overthrow Dominican
democracy in 1965 if you want to over to
attack to attack and destroy a political
system there's a way to do it within
hours within our political culture try
to show that it's an agency of the
Soviet Union
once you've succeeded in establishing
that then you're gonna
this this is a this is a record that has
been replayed so many times since 1947
when Dean Acheson
pioneered it with a totally fabricated
account as being more or less conceded
of the Soviet intervention which didn't
exist in Greece and at the time the
Truman Doctrine as he knew and as we now
know the Soviet intervention was an
attempt to try to get the Greek
guerrillas to stop interfering with a an
imperial settlement that they had made
with Britain which granted Britain
control over Greece that's not even
debatable anymore
the that records been replayed over and
over the Soviet Union incidentally does
exactly the same thing when they want to
invade Hungary or Czechoslovakia or
whatever they try to they argue that
they're defending it from CIA mashaa
nations and they try to show that
they're working for the CIA
etc other powers through the same things
obvious way we should do it now was US
policy as inept as mr. pearl suggests on
a contrary it was extremely successful
the policy of liberal internationalism
reconstituted Europe and Japan on the
old order on the old conservative order
remember what that meant that meant that
meant eliminating often destroying by
violence the anti-fascist resistance in
much of the world it meant destroying
labor unity it meant blocking efforts at
radical democracy that had substantial
support in both Europe and Japan
particularly striking in Japan with the
reverse of course in 1947 it meant
reconstituting something like the old
order under US control with enormous
profits just enormous profits for US
corporations huge expansion of
investment of exploitation of a of the
third world and so on all of this and
enormous and maybe unprecedented success
now the third world remember had a very
definite role in that system the its
role was to fulfill its function as a
source of raw materials and markets for
this conservative quasi democratic order
that we had reconstructed by pressure
and force in fact in Europe and Japan
and it did that when I mentioned
Honduras that's just a symbol that's a
symbol of us development policies
everywhere I mentioned Honduras because
there was only one minute well but the
point is not that Honduras is exporting
snow peas the point is that Honduras is
not producing food the effect of US
policies take the alliance for progress
the effect of the alliance for progress
policies in Honduras and Costa Rica in
Nicaragua everywhere was to lead to what
American economists called an economic
miracle gross national product went up
and so did child nutrition child
malnutrition
the death toll misery and suffering and
the reason is when you change when you
impose by force of course a development
model in which production for domestic
use
is replaced by agro-export for foreign
use people starve and you make profits
so you take land that was used for
subsistence agriculture you turn it over
to ranchers linked to American
agribusiness or the hanover company and
so on to produce specialized vegetables
and flowers and beef for pet foods and
for the American markets GNP goes up
profits go up a small sector of the
local economy profits and the population
plummets into disaster that's why there
have been hundreds of thousands of
people starving to death in Honduras in
the last years and in fact the same
story pretty much the same story was
true and throughout most of Central
America take Nicaragua Nicaragua did
have an economic miracle in the 1960s
and 70s
similarly child malnutrition doubled and
the general misery vastly increased that
laid the basis of the crisis of Central
America and similar things are true in
much of the third-world that's the
effect of this development model that
American policy consists of a group of
people sitting in the State Department
and figuring out how we can exploit the
rest of the world which is in essence
what what Professor Chomsky is is
asserting it ignores the fact I don't
know what development model he has in
mind I imagine it's a Marxist
development
the American I'm speaking of develops
you want to know what I have in mind
it's very simple independence
I would like no no wait a minute I would
like this
I let me just let me just say again out
of the bell game development motto
because I don't is there any country
that I follow the development model
would recommend it I think you're
missing my point
the neither the United States nor the
Soviet Union or Britain or anyone else
has a right to ram some development
model down somebody's really not I mean
I can tell you what I think and you know
academic seminar we could talk about how
development should take place but that's
not to the point here the question is
whether the countries of the world and
the peoples of the world are allowed to
pick their own development of course
that's the quest of course they are and
in fact if you look at the countries
that have been most prosperous and most
successful that have picked their own
path and his people that prospered and
these institutions are democratic and
flourishing they are for the most part
countries that have maintained close and
friendly relations with the United
States and if you look at the look at
the Pacific Basin for example the
success stories in the Pacific Basin are
countries like Taiwan and Japan and
Korea you can look at Singapore you can
look at Hong Kong the development model
that has worked there has worked with
very substantial results in to the
benefit of the people involved they are
independent in every sense I notice how
you slipped in quasi Democratic is a
description of of Europe which I don't
know exactly what you have in mind I
explained what explains the the quasi
but it is a relevant question which
you've dodged as to what development
model you have in mind because I think
what I detect underneath all of this is
a simple equation of independence with a
development model that that you happen
to prefer that is something other than a
capitalist model of development and I
think you ought to tell us what it is
well you say you're assuming that I have
your values and I don't have your values
I'm quite sure you not I feed my
let me continue my I mean I have my own
ideas about how development take place
but my point is that neither I nor you
or the US government or the Soviet
government or anyone else has the right
to ram those ideas down someone else's
throat no one neither lean about if you
want if we were to have a discussion on
development models I'd be perfectly
happy to discuss it it's just not
relevant here I mean in fact the there
let's take a look at the development
models you say have worked but if you
look at them you'll notice something
very interesting ones you mentioned are
the right ones they worked in a
particular way the Pacific Basin but in
order to understand those development
models you have to look at the history
of those regions say history and
documents and so on really are important
you can't just spin this stuff out your
head now the the countries that have
developed in in the Pacific Basin are in
fact the countries that are former
Japanese colonies and there's a reason
for that Japanese colonialism was very
brutal but it was quite different from
European colonialism they look back at
the record you'll find it operated in a
different way
Japanese colonialism while extremely
brutal actually carried out development
and in fact if you look at the history
of these countries since the period of
Japanese colonization you'll see that
development took place industrial
development in fact under conditions of
extraordinary brutality it then of
course stopped during the Second World
War in post-world War a period and then
took off again where it was under pretty
much the same model namely a state
controlled directed economy which is
what they have we call it capitalism it
has very little to do with capitalism
well that's particular kind of
development model it didn't just come by
free choice I mean in Korea say it came
after uh after ten years of war the
Korean War started in 1945 remember in
1945 when the United States intervened
in South Korea it and the Soviet Union
came into North Korea
what happened was that a civil war began
and in South Korea about a hundred
thousand people were killed before what
we call the Korean War broke out with
plenty of border conflict across the
borders the Russians pulled out
incidentally that's the basis for the
Korean War then
came the fighting the destruction of
Korea the control over it by the
conquerors well that wasn't what you may
say it's good or bad or whatever it
certainly wasn't free in Taiwan the
development was carried out under in
fact a conquering army the comb in town
army and similarly in Indonesia let's
say the development again wasn't just
free
I mean Indonesia there was a military
coup in 1965 strongly supported by the
United States seven hundred thousand
people approximately were slaughtered
within four months mostly landless
peasants that destroyed the only mass
based political party in the country and
then came a certain with us enthusiastic
support I should say then came a certain
kind of development model one which
opened the country up to exploitation by
Canada by Japan by the United States and
a certain kind of development if you
like all of these are forms of
development but they didn't come by free
choice they came by forceful imposition
just as the development in Hungary
didn't come by free choice it came by
forceful imposition of a different kind
undoubtedly the kind of you know the
forms of US intervention are different
from the forms of intervention of other
countries for all sorts of reasons but
it's rammed down people's throats it's
not their choice when development began
that when moves began to take place in a
way inconsistent with our officially
stated goals namely when the threat of
ultra-nationalism began to develop
independent regimes responsive to the
demands of the population for
improvement in their living standards
and diversification of production we
have repeatedly intervened by force to
block it we did so in Guatemala since
1954 over and over again we did it in
the Dominican Republic we have done it
in in the Southern Cone we've done it
throughout
I mean extensively in Central America
and the in the current period we're
doing it now in the Philippines I'm in
this case after case after case now let
me separate again two issues what's the
right kind of development model the
proper topic for an academic seminar
what's the right kind of policy the
right kind of policy is one that allows
people to be as free as they can to
determine the course of their own
affairs without foreign intervention
without violence 40,000 dead Nicaraguans
qualify as terrorism if not please
explain is that a that applause I think
it is for the question and not not for
my answer let me say this whatever
terrorism is I would not define it in
such a manner as to confuse acts by the
PLO against non-combatants frequently
children with action taken by George
Washington in the American War of
Independence now it does seem to me that
the essence of the concept of terrorism
is an attack against non-combatants that
is an attack against people who are not
involved not directly parties to a
conflict and one of the things that I
object to in the analogy suggested by
Professor Chomsky is the failure to
recognize that when the PLO attacks a
bus full of civilians including children
and murders them that is not in any way
to be compared with a struggle for
independence okay may I come in on that
one well I sure like given our edition
of terrorism you can apply it to those
situations right may i sir terror I
think that here again Oh
unfortunately refer us document which I
think are quite good the u.s. code has
an official definition of terrorism
ethics pretty good one State Department
and army documents for example the army
manual countering terrorism good
definitions of terrorism I think we
ought to keep to it basically without
putting all the words it comes down to
just said they threat or use of force to
coerce and intimidate civilian
populations that's terrorism now that
would include it would include in fact
George Washington's actions for example
the
prep went beyond terrorism like the
destruction of the earth way
civilization in 1779 the rampaging of
green armies and so on I don't say that
particularly critically I really don't
know that a national movement that
didn't involve terrorism but let's keep
up until today I agree with you that
when the PLO attacks civilians that's
terrorism similarly when the United
States directs its proxy army as it's
called in internal documents again when
it directs its impact as proxy army to
it to attack soft targets the words of
General John Galvin testify in Congress
a year or two ago to attack soft targets
and not to going on to duke it out with
the Sandinistas directly that is to
avoid defended targets and attacked soft
targets as terrorism when Charles Redman
of the State State Department spokesman
endorses endorses publicly the attack of
our proxy forces against agricultural
collectives on the grounds that there
are some people with arms defending them
that's advocacy of terrorism just as it
would be if Qadhafi endorsed the attack
of the attacks by the PLO against
Israeli collectives which are far better
armed than the cooperative's that we're
attacking all that's terrorism when the
in fact when former CIA director
Stansfield Turner testified before
Congress in 1985 on this he simply
referred to our attack against Nicaragua
as terrorism state-sponsored terrorism
that's giving us the benefit of the
doubt I should say if you take the World
Court decision seriously it may pass
beyond terrorism to the much more
serious crime of aggression unlawful use
of force but giving the us the benefit
of the doubt it's large-scale terrorism
when the PLO attacks a bus and kills
civilians that's terrorism when Israel
bombs civilian targets in the Bekaa
Valley killing with hundreds of cash
maybe 400 casualties including
children the children killed in a
bombed-out schoolhouse mosques destroyed
markets destroyed and so on that's
terrorism in fact there's plenty of
terrorism in the world by and large the
Terrorism Brian large is a roughly fair
generalization that the more powerful
the entity involved the more terrorism
it carries out there are exceptions but
there's no doubt that we're doing quite
well in that conflict I might point out
that we're one of the few countries in
the world that's officially committed to
terrorism there are other terrorist
States but I want to stress that the
United States has an official commitment
to terrorism the attack against the
commitment to attack soft targets such
as agricultural cooperatives that's an
official commitment to terrorism in fact
if you take a look at the army publish
US Army published manuals on low
intensity conflict the policy were
officially committed to you will notice
that the definition of low intensity
conflict happens to be almost
word-for-word the definition of
terrorism the use of measures short of
aggression to to control coerce and
intimidate the population that's low
intensity conflict take a look at the
definitions this isn't it's not that
we're the only terrorist state but we're
ranked rather high in the competition
for major terrorists our discussions so
far has been relatively at least cool
and abstract and antiseptic we have not
looked into the eyes of the victims as
is often the case the terrorized tetanus
the slum dwellers of El Salvador they've
been remote from our consciousness the
main victims of the forces we send out
to attack
soft targets is Nicaragua the children
with broken limbs and Gaza Hospital a
peasant woman trying to cook in the rain
ruins of home demolished collective
punishment in what Israel with our aid
is turning into a vast concentration
camp having just a turn in the West Bank
and shortly before from Central America
these images do happen to be vivid in my
mind talks about them
I'd like to use these last few moments
just to outline the radical shift in
policy that I think American citizens
should induce our government to
undertake and we have ways to do it with
regard to Nicaragua I think we should
follow the advice of the leading
Democratic figure in Central America
Jose de garis who is the founder of
Costa Rican democracy he returned
recently from a trip to Nicaragua which
he described as an invaded country and
he called upon the United States to
allow the ten ministers to finish what
they started in peace they deserve it
for the first time he said Nicaragua has
a government that cares for its people
one that was elected as freely as anyone
else in Central America except for Costa
Rica
he found a surprising amount of support
for the government he said despite the
destruction of the economy caused by us
terror and economic work there as is
understood throughout the world this is
the reason why the United States
government has been unable to convert
its proxy army into a guerrilla force
despite the unprecedented support
lavished on
vastly being on anything available to
authentic popular guerrilla movements we
should put aside our reliance on
violence and our defiance of
international law we should terminate
our dedicated efforts to block a
peaceful settlement in Central America
we should offer large-scale reparations
the recovery from the destruction for
which we are responsible with regard to
El Salvador we should listen to the
archbishop who calls upon the government
we established to accept the offer for
negotiations on the part of the
indigenous guerrilla forces and to halt
what he calls the escalating terror of
the death squads
now those we should heed the church
based human rights organization that
denounces the continuing state terror
and describes Salvadorans
society is on pudding affected by terror
and panic a result of the persistent
violation of basic human rights a
society living under collective
intimidation and generalized fear that
accepts the frequent appearance
approaches bodies because basic rights
the right to life has absolutely no
overriding value for society we should
attend to the recent poll taken by the
jesuit university of san salvador will
show that 95 percent of the population
prefer economic and humanitarian aid
over military aid of any kind and the
75% opposed both the public political
parties that are permitted to function
under us-backed state terror collier
democracy the same is true with regard
to Guatemala and Honduras which like El
Salvador remain under effective military
rule behind the thin civilian facade
which is erected primarily with stored
money from Congress to the benefit of
the wealthy and the privileged in the
Middle East we should reverse our policy
of onions worming of rejection ISM we
should join the very broad international
consensus favouring a political
settlement with a Palestinian state on
the West Bank and Gaza with in a
regional settlement with the
Palestinians permitted to select their
own representatives for negotiations
that means the PLO which has every bit
as much legitimacy as the Zionist
Organization did in 1947 more generally
we should have the courage and the
honesty to face some truths about
ourselves and what we do in the world
even if those are unpleasant fruits we
should ask why the United States rejects
the World Court decision calling on it
to refrain from the unlawful use of
force against Nicaragua why we dito
resolutions at the United Nations
Security Council calling on all states
to observe international law and why we
repeatedly stand alone or almost alone
in the General Assembly on issues of
peace disarmament and observance of law
we should ask why we have consistently
sought to remove conflicts from the
arena politics and diplomacy to the
arena of violence
hope to prevail we should ponder the
meaning of the fact that have studies
have repeatedly shown us foreign aid
correlates closely with torture and
egregious human rights violations and
not with need that it has been used for
a form of development that leads the
majority of the population in greater
misery and destitution we might even
consider the advice offered over twenty
years ago by marine almond on David's
troop who said with regard to Vietnam
that the best contribution we can make
to its people is to get our bloody
dollar crooked hands out of their
affairs and if we can achieve this much
we should consider how we might begin to
play a constructive role in the lives of
miserable and suffering people
throughout the world instead of treating
them as instruments to serve our
purposes or more accurately the purposes
of those eight groups that shake us
policies in their interests not yours or
mine we should consider how the fear of
the Soviet Union has been exploited to
gain support for intervention and terror
just as fear of the United States has
been exploited to similar ends by our
global adversary and we should ask what
we can do to reverse this system of
passive cooperation and global
oppression we should begin to raise some
fundamental questions about ourselves
and our institutions and ask how that
how they can change so they can become
responsive to our true interests which
are not different from those who suffer
those who separate our hands by world
standards we happen to be very free
state and other coercion and that means
that we have means available to learn
about ourselves and to act to reverse a
course that has brought us chaining and
among many others into misery we cannot
appeal fear of repression if we fail
undertake such efforts but only the
selfishness and cowardice more than any
other power we have the resources to
contribute to freedom human rights and
social and economic development just as
we have the power to destroy and oppress
which is just what the United States
government will continue to do if its
citizens choose the easy path of
obedience and apathy ample opportunities
are open to us
our willingness to make use of them will
determine the fate of many millions of
suffering people in the world ultimately
our own as well
