it's particularly harmful to democracy
when media systems are in the hands of
private Tierney's I mean it's bad enough
if the guys who you know she's making
shoes is or cars that's bad enough but
when its control over the doctrinal
system and information that's much worse
that's why I think the stuff that's
going on in telecommunications now is so
should really have a lot more attention
than it does I mean here's this huge
system you know built that public
expense I mean you guys paid for it you
know I and as usual being handed over to
private power now that its profitable
and it's very likely i think most media
analysts with their head screwed on see
and indeed even report that it's going
to end up in the hands of a half a dozen
mega-corporations internationally well
that's worse than the oligopolies that
run steel and computers because here
we're talking about a new mode of
information and communication and so on
as always built at public expense and
right now or in the middle of it being
handed over to private power and
certainly not being reported i mean like
it's not that there's no reporting i
like you've heard about the
Telecommunications Act but it wasn't
discussed as a public interest issue it
was discussed as a business issue and in
fact most of the reporting was in the
business pages this is the big
legislative achievement of last Congress
you know talk Communications Act of 1996
I reported in the business pages and not
as a public interest issue like it's not
supposed to be a question of public
interest whether major systems of
information and interchange are handed
over as gifts to Rupert Murdoch that's
not supposed to be an issue of public
interest the only thing that was
discussed was like to give it the six
corporations or 12 or do you do it this
way or that way well you know that's
effective indoctrination when these
ideas when these things don't even occur
to people takes real indoctrination but
yeah I think you're right these are this
is worse than the handing over of
decision-making power to private Erinyes
because in this case it's also
handing over you know access to the
things that they're going to use for
control of the public mind these systems
could also be as deliberate people mad
fun educational systems k 12 and the
president's just dropped it a bunch of
good stuff but there's still lot of
problems yeah I'm not sure how good the
good stuff is I'd ret I'd like to I mean
I haven't the details haven't come out
yet but from the reporting that I've
heard you know I've read maybe you know
more the actual proposals that are going
to come along are going to be granting
benefits of one kind or another to
people of income levels kind of like
mine you know people up to the level of
like you know eighty a hundred thousand
dollars a year well you know what that I
forget the last figures but i think the
median income in the united states is
something like around 30 some now the
idea of giving rich people special
benefits so their kids can go to school
well okay who's paying you know well
where people are paying so i'm not so
sure it's such great stuff when you look
at it the same with other things you
know the big investment firms lehman
brothers in this case are now
circulating brochure those of you who
are wealthy enough must be receiving
these things you know they're
distributing brochures to their you know
rich customers telling them look we've
taken over the health system we've taken
over the crimp the criminal system you
know we're right now taken over the
welfare system we're in Richie there's a
new way to enrich ourselves at public
expense they don't not their words you
know this is my translation the way we
will do it is by setting up a MOS ok
educational management organizations
which will do wonders for the
educational system like HMOs do for
health care about the same in fact
namely they will be able to take more
and more money away from the system
and put it in private you know private
power meanwhile reduce a shaping care so
that it mostly benefits the rich in
harm's everybody else and now we can do
it for the educational system the last
big government monopoly I'm it's not put
this way it's all put in terms of
efficiency and what nice people we are
and we're going to make everything so
better much better for everyone like
because we're just benefactors and so on
but go through it and that's what it is
yeah I think those are probably the new
plans that they'll be coming along and I
would be very cautious about the
Clintons proposals look at him really
carefully see to what extent their
lending themselves after all remember he
is he is not he has made no secrets
about what he is I mean he is and always
has been a moderate Republican candidate
of the business community his never
pretended to be anything else you know
never pretended to be anything else he
is a business candidate he his main
influence on the Democratic Party was to
move it over to the Republican side with
the Democratic Leadership Council he
never it's not like a secret or anything
he said it you know made it very clear
his record in Arkansas was like that his
influence in the national government was
like that so whatever the democratic
party may have been which you can sort
of debate it's now like if you can find
a difference between cloak Dole and
Clinton I'd like to know what it was you
know I mean a policy difference they're
both moderate Republicans instantly the
business press is very well aware of
this I mean it's take take a look at the
Wall Street Journal editorials the first
couple of years you know or reporting
first you know throughout the whole
Clinton years I'm at first they were a
little nervous because he had some of
this populist rhetoric but pretty soon
within a few months you start getting
you know editorials in the Wall Street
Journal and articles in fact not just
editorials about how Clinton is the best
president the business has ever had
they quote the Ford company executive is
saying we're getting along with it much
better than we did with Bush and Reagan
and on and on now of course you know
they'd prefer the Gingrich guys actually
with some ambiguity I should say because
they don't like the small business
aspect of the Gingrich people there's a
delicate balance there between holding
off the crazies and making sure that the
really rich people get everything so
there's been a problem but the as far as
Clinton was concerned they were
perfectly happy with him yeah he's a
moderate Republican so and I don't think
I don't think you can say that he's
deceived anyone you know if you look at
his positions all the way along they've
been very clear people didn't want to
see it that's their choice but it's been
clear it's been clear to the business
press it's been clear in his policies
exactly what kind of education program
would be crafted out of that I'd be very
suspicious about and I think it's worth
a very careful look I mean there's
plenty of problems with the educational
system but the main problem is that way
too few resources go into it now it's
not that we don't have money you know
like there's no budget crisis or
anything like that the country's just
flooded with money again read the
business press you know it cannot find
adjectives exuberant enough to describe
you know the dazzling stupendous profit
growth and you know what are we going to
do with all those funds and so on the
country's just flooded with money
capital but all getting very narrowly
concentrated okay there's plenty of
money around to improve the educational
system and we know exactly where has to
come from but I i think that's its main
problem I am teachers are way under paid
you know and they're under educated
they're not given enough respect too
many kids in school in a classroom you
know not enough educational materials
and so on and so forth not there's no
special you know nobody has any
brilliant ideas about at least I've
never heard anything about how people
should be educated except you know kids
natural and enthusiasm and creativity
ought to be allowed to you know aren't
work in constructive way done all this
kind of stuff you know what what's
missing is the resources fine so let's
provide the resources so maybe they
won't have such dazzling stupendous
profits next year and instead kids will
get a better education I think that's
what I have but what I'm worried about
is it's going that the system is moving
towards the kind of privatization which
just imposes question on the public
