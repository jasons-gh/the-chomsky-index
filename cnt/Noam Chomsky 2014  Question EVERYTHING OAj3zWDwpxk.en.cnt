where were you born eraser i was born in
philadelphia pennsylvania in 1928 i
lived there until about nineteen fifty
when i went to Boston been here ever
since oh wow wow that's that's amazing
so in boston now what brought you to
boston early on well i managed to get a
very good graduate fellowship at Harvard
which I was very tempting this axis
first time my life didn't have to work
and I had all the resources of Harvard
available in several years it was
irresistible temptation I'll just stayed
ever since wow that's amazing and sir
and know what year was that what decades
what was her period was night I came to
Boston in 1951 and I was at Harvard for
four years and then switched over to MIT
in 1955 and I've been at MIT ever since
that's where I'm speaking now oh wow
that's absolutely fascinating up again
and I we are so grateful for your time
um but you know getting you know 1951 oh
no the time period in America you know
that you got the height of the Cold War
you have so much going on question is
this ah you know what do you see sir
from your perspective is is is the
difference similarities between you know
the the decade of 1950 1951 till now
2014 what's what's the comparison here
from your perspective sir quite a lot
has changed the activism of the 1960s
had a significant civilizing effect on
the country so many things that are
fortunately more or less
taken for granted today not settled but
at least recognized to be significant
and important we're not even on the
agenda at the time for example women's
rights it which is quite probably the
major achievement is the past generation
we might remember that women were not
that we go back in American history to
these revolution-- the colonies took
over British common law under which
women were really not people they were
property owned by their father
transmitted to their husband there were
it was activist opposition for years but
it really took off in the 60s and it was
literally not until 1975 that the
Supreme Court finally recognized that
women can be recognized as peers they
have a right deserves and federal juries
so sign of the equality and many things
have changed in that respect there were
the civil rights movement was just
beginning to take off and in nineteen
sixty one that had significant that
limited effect 1961 is when I became
personally directly involved in
protesting the invasion of Indochina was
virtually no support for that at the
time it was unheard of issue of infected
people even today there was nope almost
nobody knows that in 1961 1962 Kennedy
President Kennedy launched a major
attack on South Vietnam with American
Air Force bombing villages chemical
warfare to destroy crops driving people
into what amount of the concentration
camp a major attack well by now within a
couple of years there developed a
significant opposition to
American aggression in Vietnam and
that's that's changed the character of
the country to thee it remains a
significant opposition to the kinds of
actions that at the time were taken
without concern at all of this is
progress there was no concern at the
time for the environmental crisis which
at least now is recognized by many
people to be extremely severe not by
enough so all of that is progress on the
other hand there was a backlash as you'd
expect of the civilizing effect of the
60s led to a mediate backlash and they
following years of the institution of
the essentially neoliberal assault on
the population which takes many forms
and has led to a very significant
regression so just to give some things
that we would all be familiar with real
wages for male workers today are about
at the level of 1968 the last there has
been economic growth in the last 30
years not the same level as before but
significant however almost all of it is
going into the pockets of a very small
number of people but for most of the
populations in stagnation relative
stagnation or decline there's major
attack on unions technology educational
system lots of things happening that are
very harmful it partly an effort to beat
back the progress that began in the
early 60s and that's a conflict that
goes on through through American history
we're in a regressive stage of it now
but come out of it before and could
again sir I tell you you know
you speak so eloquently and so honestly
from the heart it feels and I have a
question that you know I that I just
dawned on me you know speaking for so
many decades sir you know speaking
change in the face of speaking from a
perspective that is a more broad more
more educated you know what what was the
spark in you sir in your life that said
you know what I want to be this this
person who is honest and I want to be
this person who speaks to the world
about the truth when did that happen in
your life sir I can't really say it
simply goes back to early childhood
never questioned it and I grew up during
the Depression and objectively it was
much worse than today although
subjectively it was better in the sense
that there was a sense of hope and
optimism and we can get at we can work
together and get out of this and so on
the feelings that are kind of absent
today but in the depression period that
was simply at least my point of view
though question from early childhood
that one had to commit oneself to combat
the deep in justices repression violence
the threat of fascism was that expanding
over the world that would an
extraordinary problems at home somehow
the question you raised just never never
rode well I guess I feel honest be that
person that is that question that that's
never rose yet sorry um you mentioned
the education system and I'm somebody
that's immersed within that and very
near and dear to my heart
what do you what do you see as some of
the major obstacles of American
education in 2014 well the educational
system unfortunately is under a severe
attack it's not called attack it's
called reform but you should always be
very cautious when you hear the word
reform and ask what it actually means
the educational system is badly
underfunded schools are in disrepair
there aren't enough teachers teachers
are poorly paid there are efforts to get
around the edge public educate to
undermine the public education system by
setting up alternatives mass public
education was one of the great
achievements of American society back in
the late 19th century and it has had
enormous positive consequences and it's
now under attack from the kindergarten
level right through the universities the
at the k-12 level the school level
education is being shifted under
government policy to what amounts to
training for obedience teaching to test
which is a perfect way to undermine and
dull creativity interest searching for
your seeking your own understanding of
yourself in the world absolutely the
worst form of educational policy
deadening and destructive and that's
being imposed all over at the university
level we did we still the United States
still has the greatest universities in
the world but the system is severely
under attack so again the scientific
research which is not only enormous
significance in itself but is also the
basis for future economic development
that's under attack from Congress fact
the just take a look at the figures the
research and development funding by the
federal government has declined about
twenty five percent relative to the
economy in the past decade at the same
time when everywhere else europe japan
china it's going up the students now
leave college typically with a extremely
heavy debt burden there's no economic
basis for that but it does have it has a
sharp disciplinary effect it limits the
opportunities for what you can do for
obvious reasons you have to pay off your
debt and again it's worth stressing that
that is not an economic necessity that
we can see that very easily just take a
look across the border at mexico the
poor country with a pretty good at a
higher education system that education
is free there was an attempt about 20
years ago to add a raised tuition to add
a little tuition low tuition there was a
student strike national student strike
cut enormous popular sport and the going
back down that's Mexico and take a look
at the country's rich countries that
squirt that regularly score the highest
and educational achievement like Finland
Germany other education free higher
education free in fact even in the
United States when it was a much more
country than it is today back in the
1950s the education for a very large
part of the population was essentially
free that's the GI Bill brought a huge
number of people into the colleges and
universities who never would have been
able to make it on their own that was a
enormous benefit to them of course but
also to the society and it's a large
part of the reason for the
rapid growth rate economic growth rate
scientific discovery is the basis of the
high-tech economy that we have today was
mostly established then through federal
spending incidentally even in the
private colleges like I went to an Ivy
League college university of
pennsylvania in 1945 but a payment was
the tuition was extremely low i think
there's a hundred dollars at the time
you could easily get a scholarship these
are not economic necessities whatever
one wants to how everyone wants to
debate cause the effect is to impose
discipline and passivity on people young
people who should be aware time of their
lives when they should be free to
explore to figure out who they are to
find their own way in life to understand
the world become engaged in public
issues to pursue their their own
interests and so on but that's Dean
sharply constrained well none of this is
necessary these are all social policies
and they're closely integrated in my
opinion with the policies that are in
fact imposing something like stagnation
often decline on the large majority of
the population which is not an economic
necessity either I mean take our current
socio-economic situation just look at
the country today there are tens of
millions of people who want to work and
are capable of working have the skills
to work and cannot get jobs the
unemployment figures are misleading
because many have just dropped out of
the workforce and despair so a huge
number of willing and idle hands there's
an enormous amount of work that has to
be done I just drive I drove into work
this morning like every day when i drive
to work i have to try to guess where the
detour is known to be
because they're patching up some Street
that's falling apart and day literally
and that goes everywhere I mean we our
health system is an absolute scandal
twice per capita cost of other countries
and some of the worst outcomes the the
American Society of Engineers gives an
evaluation of infrastructure every year
they've given failing grades to the
United States for years country's
falling apart plenty of work to be done
there's a need for construction for
teachers for scientific research for
just let everything you can think of so
plenty of work to be done plenty of idle
hands huge resources available on the
corporate sector and the banks are
richer than they've ever been so much
money they don't know what to do with it
so idle hands work to be done plenty of
resources the society can't put them
together you can hardly have a sharper
indictment of a socio-economic system
and there are there there are very
serious dangers ahead you want to have a
look at it and the way we're dealing at
them I'd simply suggest taking a look at
this morning's New York Times it has a
separate section on energy and that's
very much worth reading the section is
pretty much euphoric we can become the
Saudi Arabia of the 21st century we can
have a hundred years of energy
independence there's endless amounts of
fossil fuel that we can produce and use
an export there are maybe some problems
like maybe the price won't be right that
generally it looks just wonderful
there's one thing missing in that
intersection what's the world going to
look like in a hundred years if we
exploit all of our fossil fuel resources
now we're heading towards a cliff like
lemmings and they were going to it
create a world in which people that
won't be possibilities for decent
survival so what happens our
grandchildren that question simply
doesn't arise the moral calculus of
today's the form of capitalism is that
profits tomorrow far outweigh the
failure grandchildren that's it this is
the first time in human history that we
have been on the verge of destroying the
possibility for decent existence and
we're marching as fast as we can towards
that cliff the section i just mentioned
is a good illustration of it all of the
effort for this there's an enormous
amount of work to be done in this regard
from the weatherization of homes to wind
farms and solar panels more advanced
scientific research john it's not being
done because we have to maximize the
profit tomorrow for a very small number
of people very small fraction of one
percent oh gosh then you know is there
are you a spiritual individual you know
is there something beyond all of this
politics and all of this you know this
earthbound heaviness it feels you know
what's your perspectives are on on
spirituality and the stack go hand in
hand with religion or anything of that
nature well our future is in our hands
as always what I've just described is
not inevitable it's not a law of nature
it's a characteristic of a particular
form of social organization social and
political organization and it relates to
the mentality and mood of the population
there are many pressures that lead
people to be passive
a quiescent hope lacking hope isolated
to one another and if those pressures
are not resisted that we're heading for
disaster but they can be resisted as
they have been in the past that you
began by mentioning 1961 that's a good
place to look that was a moment when
these pressures for passivity began to
be resisted the 1950s was a very
quiescent period wasn't much going on
some but a lot sigh 1961 it was
beginning to change dramatically and I
can't again that's that's optimistic
that that is good to hear that it can
again I guess how will it soar like how
will it the people will be the people
would and and the love and the intellect
and the education that will change it
people have to simply decide you have to
wreck first you have to recognize
reality what is the nature of the world
that we're living in I mean I've made a
couple of comments but you have to go
far beyond that so try to understand the
nature of the reality that we live in
recognize these severe threats that are
right on the horizon and that will
materialize unless we do something about
them and then make the decision do I
want to do something about this do I
care enough about say my grandchildren
to want to avert coming disasters to
even apart from the major problem huge
problem of the environmental disaster
just the social and economic disaster
but I described before of tens of
millions of idle has plenty of work to
be done plenty of resources can't put
them together stagnation for most of the
population
you know this is not the torture and
massacre but it's pretty bad news can we
do sometime what do I want to do
something about that we can it's been
done before we can do it today and
ultimately that's a decision that people
have to make they've made it before they
can again that's beautiful sir thank you
uh no mr. noam chomsky sir we're coming
on the last two and a half minutes and i
know you are a busy man and we can't
thank you enough at the networking show

audience can you know get a feel to say
oh I have that same interest um sir I
want to ask you mr. Noam Chomsky what is
your favorite color and why if you have
one favorite color hold I guess blue I
love to look at why know why but I love
to look at the ocean that a lake obey
one of the I can't do it anymore arm too
old but one of the real joys in life was
sailing a small sailboat out at late
afternoon and then that peaceful day
waters of Massachusetts and it's the
blue of the water in the sky is just
some how overwhelming that was beautiful
thank you sir last and final question um
and you can switch this off for music
but what are what is one of your
favorite what are your favorite authors

you've written and and you know people
you know well there are too many to
mention when there are you know there
are books that I go back to and reread
dusty-ass keys Brothers Karamazov his
one when I think of favorite authors
it's usually would have just reading
interesting stuff that i've read
recently just recently i happened to
have read a couple of novels by a great
19th century brazilian novelist machado
de assis that's on my mind but at the
