it's no exaggeration to say that the
effort to take control of our lives is a
dominant theme of world history with a
crescendo in the last several centuries
of dramatic changes in human relations
and World Order the topic is far too
large to try to discuss here I'll have
to cut it down sharply first I'll keep
only two current manifestations and some
of the roots with an eye towards what
might lie ahead also I'll keep to the
global arena which is by no means the
only domain in which these issues arise
in the past year the global issues have
been framed largely in terms of the
notion of sovereignty that is the right
of political entities to follow their
own course which may be benign or maybe
ugly and to do so free from external
interference in the real world that
means interference by highly
concentrated power with its major
centres in the United States this
concentrated global power is called by
various terms to spend depending on
which aspect of sovereignty and freedom
one has in mind so sometimes it's called
the Washington and consensus or the wall
street Treasury complex or NATO or the
International Economic bureaucracy World
Trade Organization World Bank and IMF or
a g7 the rich Western industrial
countries or d 3 or more accurately
usually d1 from a more fundamental
perspective though it takes longer to
say we could describe it as an array of
mega corporations often linked to one
another by strategic alliances
administering a global economy which is
in fact the kind of
mercantilism tending toward oligopoly in
most sectors heavily reliant on state
power to socialize risk and cost and to
subdue recalcitrant elements well in the
past year the issues of sovereignty of
have risen in two domains one has to do
with the sovereign rights to be secure
from military intervention here are the
questions arise in a world order based
on sovereign states secondly in the
matter of sovereign rights in the face
of socio-economic intervention hear the
questions arise in a world that's
dominated by multinational corporations
especially financial institutions in
recent years and the whole framework
that's been constructed to serve their
interests of those are for example the
issues that arose dramatically in
Seattle last November the first category
military intervention was a very lively
topic last year two cases gained
particular significance attention
prominence East Timor and Kosovo in the
opposite order which is an interesting
fact because that reverses both the
timing and the significance there's a
lot to say about these matters and a a
lot of new information about them but
would like to discuss but reluctantly
I'm going to drop that topic if you'd
like to bring it up later in questions
fine I'll be happy to talk about it it's
a big important and instructive topic
but you know I'm short so let me turn to
the second topic and that's the one I'll
keep to still cutting things down the
question of sovereignty freedom human
rights the kind of questions that arise
in a socio-economic in the South
socio-economic arena that's the sub part
of this whole topic I want to keep to
first a general comment sovereign
sovereignty is no value in itself it's
only a value insofar as it relates to
freedom and rights either enhancing them
or diminishing them and I want to take
for granted something that may seem
obvious but it's actually controversial
namely that in speaking of freedom and
rights we have in mind human beings that
is persons of flesh and blood not
abstract political and legal
constructions like corporations or
states or capital if these entities have
any rights at all which is questionable
they should be derivative from the
rights of people and that's the core of
classical liberal doctrine it's also the
principle the guiding principle for
popular struggles for centuries but it's
very strongly opposed it supposed by
official doctrine it's supposed by
sectors of wealth and privilege and
that's true both in the political and
the socio-economic realms I'll ask you
to keep that question on the shelf for a
minute and a few minutes and say a
couple of words of background in the
political realm the familiar slogan is
popular sovereignty in a government of
By and For the People but the operative
framework is quite different the
operative framework is that the people
are considered a dangerous enemy they
have to be controlled for their own good
these issues go back centuries back to
the earliest modern Democratic
revolutions in seventeenth-century
england and in the North American colony
is a century later in both cases the
Democrats were defeated not completely
and certainly not permanently by any
means
in seventeenth-century england much of
the population did not want to be ruled
by either king or Parliament recall that
those were the two contestants in the
standard version of the Civil War but
like most civil wars good part of the
population one in either of as their
pamphlets put it they wanted to be
governed by countrymen like ourselves
who know our want not by knights and
gentlemen who do not know the people
sores and who but apress us these same
ideas animated the rebellious farmers of
the colonies century later but the
constitutional system was designed quite
differently it was because it's designed
to block that heresy the goal was to
protect the minority of the opulent from
the majority and to ensure that the
country is governed by those who own it
those are the words of the leading
framer James Madison and the president
of the Continental Congress and first
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John
Jay well these their conception
prevailed but the conflict continued
they continually take new forms they're
alive right now however a leap doctrine
remains essentially unchanged
fast-forwarding to the 20th century the
population I'll keep here to the sort of
liberal progressive side of the spectrum
it's harsher on the other side the
population are regarded as ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders whose role is to be
spectators not participants apart from
periodic opportunities to choose among
the representatives of private power
these are what are called elections in
elections public opinion is considered
essentially irrelevant if it conflicts
with the demands of the minority of the
you went to own the country we're seeing
that right now in fact so one striking
example there are many has to do with
the international economic order what
are called trade agreements the general
population as poles make very clear is
strongly opposed to most of what's going
on but the issues don't arise it's not
an issue in the elections because the
centers of power the minority opulent
are unified in support of instituting a
particular kind of socio-economic order
so therefore the issue doesn't arise the
things that are discussed are things
that they don't much care about like
questions of character or questions of
reform which they know aren't going to
be implemented so that's what's
discussed not what people care about and
that's pretty typical and it makes sense
on the assumption that the role of the
public is the ignorant and meddlesome
Outsiders is just to be spectators if
the general public as it often does
seeks to organize and enter the
political arena to participate to press
its own concerns that's a problem it's
not democracy it's what's called a
crisis of democracy that has to be
overcome again I'm quoting these are all
quotes from the liberal progressive side
of the spectrum the modern spectrum but
the principles are quite widely held and
the past 25 years have been one of those
regular periods when a major campaign
has been conducted to try to overcome
the perceived crisis of democracy and to
reduce the public to their proper role
of apathetic and passive and obedient
spectators well that's the political
realm in the socio-economic realm
there's something similar there's been
parallel closely related conflicts for a
long long time in the early days of the
industrial revolution in the United
States in New England 150 years ago
there was a very lively
independent labor press run by young
women from the farms or artisans and the
town's they condemned the degraded
degradation and subordination I'm
quoting of the newly emerging industrial
system which compelled people to rent
themselves to survive it's worth
remembering hard to remember perhaps
that wage labor was considered not very
different from chattel slavery at that
time not only by the workers in the
mills but right through much of the
mainstream so for example Abraham
Lincoln or republican party even
editorials in the New York Times that
they might like to forget working people
opposed what they called the return to
what they called monarca chol principles
in the industrial system and they
demanded that those who work in the
mills should own them the spirit of
republicanism they denounced what they
called the new spirit of the age gain
wealth for getting all but self a
demeaning and degrading vision of human
life that has to be driven into people's
minds by immense effort which in fact
has been going on over centuries in the
20th century the literature of the
public relations industry provides a
very rich and instructive store of
instruction on how to instill the new
spirit of the age by creating artificial
want or by quoting regimented the public
mind just as an army regiment the bodies
of its soldiers and inducing a
philosophy of futility and lack of
purpose in life by concentrating human
attention on the more superficial things
that compromise that comprise much of
fashionable consumption if that can be
done then people will accept the
meaningless and subordinate lives that
are appropriate for them and they'll
forget the subversive ideas about taking
control of their own lives
this is a major social social
engineering projects and going on for
centuries but became intense and
enormous in the last century there are a
lot of ways of doing it one tomm are the
ones the kind that I just indicated
which are too familiar to illustrate
others are to undermine security and
hear through their number of ways one
way of undermining security is the
threat of job transfer one of the major
consequences and consuming rationality
one has to assume one of the major
purposes of the mislabeled trade
agreements stress mislabeled because
they're not about free trade they have
strong anti market elements of a variety
of kinds and they're certainly not
agreements at least if people matter
since people are mostly opposed but one
consequence of these arrangements is to
facilitate the threat doesn't have to be
reality sometimes it is but just the
threat of job transfer which is a good
way of inducing discipline by
undermining security another device
pardon the technical jargon is to
promote what's called labor market
flexibility I quote the World Bank who
put the matter pretty plainly they said
labor labor market flexibility has
acquired a bad name as a euphemism for
pushing wages down and workers out which
is exactly what it is but nevertheless
despite the bad name increasing labor
market flexibility is essential in all
regions of the world the most important
reforms involve lifting constraints on
labor mobility wage flexibility as well
as breaking the ties between social
services and labor contracts that means
cutting the benefits and the rights that
have
and one in generations of bitter
struggle when they talk about lifting
constraints on wage flexibility they
mean flexibility down flexibility up and
the talk about labor mobility doesn't
mean the right of people to move
anywhere they want as has been required
by free market theory ever since Adam
Smith but rather the right to fire
employees of will and under the current
investor base version of globalization
capital and corporations must be free to
move but not people because their rights
are secondary incidental these essential
reforms as the World Bank calls them are
imposed on much of the world as
conditionalities for ratification by the
World Bank in the IMF they're introduced
into the rich industrial countries by
other means and they've been effective
Alan Greenspan testified before Congress
that we call greater worker in security
was an important factor in the what's
called the fairy tale economy it keeps
inflation down because workers are
afraid to ask for wages and benefits
they're insecure and that shows up
pretty clearly in the statistical record
in the past 25 years this period of
rollback of the crisis of democracy
wages have stagnated or declined for the
majority of the work force for
non-supervisory workers and working
hours have increased very sharply
they've become the highest in the
industrial world and this is a noticed
of course by the business press which
describes it as a welcome development of
transcendent importance with working
people compelled to abandon their
luxurious lifestyles while corporate
profits are dazzling
stupendous The Wall Street Journal
Business Week and fortune lot like in
the dependencies less delicate measures
are available one of them is so-called
debt crisis which is largely traceable
to World Bank IMF policy programs of the
1970s and to the fact that the third
world rich are for the most part exempt
from social obligations that's
dramatically true in Latin America and
one of its major problems the debt
crisis is something but we should be
careful to notice what it is it's not a
simple economic fact by any means it's
to a large extent an ideological
construct the what's called the debt
that could be overcome in the number of
very elementary ways largely overcome
one way to overcome it would be by
resorting to the capitalist principle
that borrowers have to pay and lenders
take the risk so for example if you lend
me money and I send it to my bank in
Zurich and buy a Mercedes and you come
back and ask me for the money I'm not
supposed to be allowed to say I'm sorry
I don't have it to take it from my
neighbor and if you don't want to take
the risk of the loan you're not supposed
to be able to say well my neighbor will
have to pay for it that's the way it
works in the international arena however
that's what the debt crisis is the the
money is not the debt is not to be paid
by the people who borrowed it now
military dictators their cronies the
rich and privileged in highly
authoritarian societies that we've
supported they don't have to pay so it
takes a Indonesia where the current debt
is about a hundred forty percent of
gross domestic product the debt was the
money was taken by the military
dictatorship and their friends and
probably held by maybe a couple hundred
people at the outside but it has to be
paid by the population
harsh austerity measures and the lenders
are mostly protected from risk they get
what amounts to free risk insurance by
various devices of socializing costs
transferring them to the northern
taxpayers it's one of the functions of
the IMF well st. similarly in Latin
America I mean the huge Latin American
debt is is not all that much different
from capital flight from Latin America
which suggests a simple way to deal with
the debt or a large part of it if anyone
were to believe in the capitalist
principle which is of course
unacceptable puts burden on the wrong
people the mine are rated the opulent
there are other ways also of eliminating
the dead and they're recognized and they
also reveal the extent to which it is an
ideological construct one other method
apart from the capitalist principle is a
principle of international law that was
introduced by the United States when it
what's called in history books liberated
Cuba meaning conquered cubed or
prevented from itself from liberating
itself from Spain in 1898 having done
that the United States cancelled Cuba's
debt to Spain on the perfectly
reasonable ground that the debt was
imposed without the consent of the
population it was imposed on but under
coercive conditions that principle then
entered international law largely at us
initiative called the principle of
odious debt an odious debt is invalid
doesn't have to be paid it's been
recognized for example by the u.s.
executive director of the IMF that if
that principle were available to the
victims not just to the rich the third
world debt would mostly dissolve because
invalid its odious debt but that's not
to be the odious debt is a very powerful
weapon of control and it's can't be
abandoned for half of about half of the
world's population right
thanks to this method national economic
policy is effectively run by bureaucrats
in Washington that's another half also
half of the population of the world not
the same half but overlapping is subject
to unilateral sanctions by the United
States which is a form of economic
coercion that again undermine
sovereignty severely and has been
condemned repeatedly just recently again
but the United Nations is unacceptable
but makes a difference in the within the
rich countries there are other means of
achieving similar results I'll come back
to that but before doing so it's just a
word to about what we should never allow
ourselves to forget and that is that the
devices that are used in the
dependencies are can be very brutal
there was a Jesuit organised conference
you know son Sullivan & Son Salvador
couple years ago which considered the
state terrorist project of the 1980s and
its continuation since by the socio
economic policies imposed by the victors
the conference took special note of what
it called the culture of terror the
residual culture of terror which lasts
after the actual terror declines and has
the effect of domesticating the
expectations of the majority who abandon
any thought of alternatives to the
demands of the powerful they've learned
the lesson that there is no alternative
Tina as it's called Maggie Thatcher's
cruel phrase and the idea is that there
is no alternative to the that's now the
familiar slogan of the corporate version
of globalization in the dependencies the
great achievement of the terrorist
operations has been to destroy the hopes
that it
raised in Latin America and Central
America in the 1970s inspired by popular
organizing throughout the region and the
preferential option for the poor of the
church which was severely punished but
for that deviation from good behavior in
awful lot to say about that and I hate
to drop it but time is short sometimes
the lessons about what happened are
drawn rather rather accurately measured
tones so right now there's a torrent of
self-education about our success and
inspiring a wave of democracy in our
Latin American dependencies the matters
put a little differently and more
accurately in a important scholarly
review the major scholarly review by the
leading specialists on the topic Thomas
for others who was he says writes with
an insider's perspective since he served
in the State Department democracy
enhancement programs of the Reagan
administration as they were called he
believes that Washington had good
intentions but he recognizes that in
practice I'm quoting now it sought to
maintain the basic order of quite and
democratic societies and to avoid
populist based change inevitably seeking
only limited top-down forms of democracy
that did not risk upsetting the
traditional structures of power with
which the United States had long been
allied almost accurate it would be more
more accurate to say the traditional
structures of power with which the
traditional structures of power in the
United States had long been alive and
that's accurate he himself Carruthers is
dissatisfied with the outcome but he
describes what he calls the liberal
critique as fundamentally flawed leaves
the old debates unresolved because of
its perennial weak spot the perennial
weak spot is that it offers no
alternative to the policy of restoring
the traditional structures of power
this case by murderous terror that left
a hundred thousand Corpses in the 1980s
and millions of refugees and maimed and
orphaned and the devastated societies so
again Tina there's no alternative the
same dilemma was recognized at the other
end the opposite end of the political
spectrum by President Carter's main
Latin American specialist Robert pastor
who's quite far to the dovish
progressive end of the admissible
spectrum he explains in an interesting
book why the Carter Administration had
to support the murderous and corrupt
Somoza regime right to the bitter end
and then when even the traditional
structures of power turned against the
dictator the u.s. carter administration
had to try to maintain the national
guard that it had established and
trained and that was then attacking the
population with the brutality a nation
usually reserved for its enemy as he
puts it this was all done with benign
intent under the Tina principle no
alternative here's the reason the United
States did not want to control nicaragua
or the other nations of the region but
it also did not want developments to get
out of control it wanted Nicaraguans to
act independently except his emphasis
except when doing so would affect us
interests adversely so in other words
Latin Americans should be free free to
act in accord with our wishes we want
them to be able to choose their own
course freely unless they make choices
that we want in which case we have to
restore the traditional structures of
power by violence if necessary now there
are that's the spectrum if you can tell
the difference there are voices that are
outside the spectrum I want to deny
that for example is the idea that people
should have the right to share the
decisions which often profoundly modify
their way of life not have their hopes
cruelly cruelly dashed by violence by
foreign power in a global order in which
political and financial power is
concentrated financial markets fluctuate
erratically with devastating
consequences for the poor elections can
be manipulated and negative aspects on
others are considered completely
irrelevant by the powerful those are
quotes from the radical extremists in
the Vatican whose annual New Year's
message could scarcely be mentioned in
the national press and it's certainly an
alternative that's not on the agenda
well why is there such broad agreement
that Latin Americans in fact the world
cannot be allowed to exercise
sovereignty that is to take control of
their lives it's the global analog to
the fear of democracy within after that
question has been frequently addressed
in very instructive ways in the
primarily in the internal record which
we have quite a free country we have a
rich record of declassified documents
and they're very interesting is this
theme that runs through all of them it's
strikingly illustrated in one of the
most influential cases hemisphere
hemispheric conference that the United
States called in February 1945 and in
order to impose what was called the
economic charter for the Americas that
was one of the cornerstones of the
post-war world still firmly in place the
Charter called for an end to economic
nationalism meaning sovereignty in all
its forms Latin Americans would have to
avoid what was called excessive
industrial development that would
compete with US interests so they could
have complementary development
so Brazil could produce low-cost steel
that the US corporations weren't
interested in crucially it was necessary
to protect their resources as George
Kennan put it even if that required
police states he continued the problem
but watching faced a problem and
imposing the Charter and that was
clearly explained internally in the
State Department at the time in this way
Latin Americans were making the wrong
choices they were calling them quoting
now they were calling for policies
designed to bring about a broader
distribution of wealth and to raise the
standard of living of the masses and
they were convinced that the first
beneficiaries of a country's resources
should be the people of that country not
us investors that's unacceptable so
sovereignty cannot be allowed they can
have freedom but freedom to make the
right choices that message has been
regularly and forcefully reaffirmed in
case after case up to the present
mention a couple of examples Guatemala
had a brief interlude of democracy was
ended as you know by a US military coup
for the public this was presented as
defense against the Russians a little
bit exotic but that was a story
internally the thrust thrust was
different and the threat was seen more
realistically here's the way it was seen
the social and economic programs of the
elected government met the aspirations
of Labor and the peasantry inspired the
loyalty and conformed to the
self-interest of most politically
conscious Guatemalans and worse still
the broad social programs of aiding the
workers in the peasant in a victorious
struggle against the upper classes and
large foreign enterprises has a strong
appeal to the populations of Central
American neighbors where similar
conditions prevailed so therefore a
military solution was necessary it's
been going on for 40 years and it's left
the same culture of terror as in
Central American neighbors same was true
in Cuba another currently live case when
the United States made the decision to
overthrow the secretly to overthrow the
government of Cuba in 1960 the reasoning
was very similar it was explained by
historian Arthur Schlesinger summarized
to President Kennedy the study of a
Latin American mission and a secret
report to the incoming president the
Cuban threat according to the mission
was the spread of the castro idea of
taking matters into one's own hands
that's a disease that might infect the
rest of Latin America where the poor and
underprivileged which means almost
everyone stimulated by the example of
the Cuban Revolution are now demanding
opportunities for a decent living so
something has to be done and you know it
was done what about the Soviet
connection I was actually mentioned in
the report the Soviet here in this way
the Soviet Union hovers in the wings
flourishing large development loans and
presenting itself as the model for
achieving modernization in the single
generation well that's the threat the
threat of taking their lives into their
own hands and it had to be destroyed by
terrorism and economic strangulation
which is still continuing all of that is
totally independent of the Cold War as
surely as obvious by now even without
the secret breaker the same concerns in
the post-cold war period led to the
quick undermining of Hades brief
experiment in democracy by presidents
bush and Clinton continuing an earlier
record the same concerns are lie in the
background of the trade agreements so
nasta for example at the time of nasta
you'll recall the propaganda was that it
was going to be a wonderful boon to
working people in all three countries
Canada the United States Mexico well
that was quiet
abandoned shortly after when the facts
were in and what was obvious all along
was in fact finally publicly conceded
publicly the goal was to quoting to lock
Mexico into the reforms of the 1980s
reforms which had sharply reduced wages
enrich the small sector and foreign
investors the background concerns were
articulated at a Latin American strategy
development conference in Washington a
workshop which in 1990 it warned that a
democracy opening in Mexico could bring
into office a government more interested
in challenging the United States on
economic and nationalist Browns notice
that's the same fret as in 1945 and
since overcome in this case by locking
Mexico into treaty obligations these
same reasons consistently lie behind a
half a century of torture and terror not
only in the Western Hemisphere and
they're also at the core of the investor
rights agreements that are being imposed
under the specific form of globalization
that's designed by state corporate power
Nexus okay let's go back to what I asked
you to put on the shelf the point of
departure the contested issue of freedom
and rights and sovereignty insofar as
it's to be valued do they in here in
persons of flesh and blood or only in
small sectors of wealth and privilege or
even in abstract constructions like
corporations or capital in the or states
in the past century the idea that such
entities have special rights over above
persons has been very strongly advocated
the most prominent examples are
Bolshevism fascism and private
corporatism which is a form of
privatized tyranny
two of these systems of collapsed the
third is alive and flourishing under the
banner Tina there's no alternative to
the emerging system of state corporate
mercantilism disguised with various
mantras like globalization and free
trade now a century ago during the early
stages of the corporatization of america
discussion about these matters was quite
frank conservatives a century ago
denounced the procedure the
corporatization as returned to feudalism
in a form of communism it is not an
entirely inappropriate analogy there
were similar intellectual origins and
neo Hegelian ideas about the rights of
organic entities and the belief in the
need to have a centralized
administration of chaotic systems like
the markets which were totally out of
control it's worth bearing in mind that
in today's so-called free trade economy
a very large component of cross-border
transactions which are called trade
misleadingly probably about seventy
percent of them are actually within
centrally managed institutions within
corporations and corporate alliances
it's quite apart from all kinds of other
radical market distortions the
conservative critique notice that
conservatives in the sense that I'm
visit traditional notion conservative
they don't exist anymore the but in the
century ago there were conservatives the
conservative critique was echoed at the
liberal progressive end of the spectrum
early in the 20th century most notably
perhaps by John Dewey America's leading
social philosophers work focused largely
on democracy and he argued that the
Democratic forms have little substance
when the life of the country production
commerce media are
ruled by private tyranny in a system of
inquiry called Industrial feudalism in
which working people are subordinated
the managerial control and politics
becomes the shadow cast by big business
over society notice that he was
articulating ideas that were common coin
among working people many years earlier
as I mentioned and the same was true of
his call for the elimination of the
replacement of Industrial feudalism by
self-managed industrial democracy
interestingly progressive intellectuals
who favored the process of
corporatization agreed more or less with
this description so Woodrow Wilson for
example he wrote that corporatization is
creating a new America in which small
groups of men in control of great
corporations wield power and control
over the wealth and business opportunity
of the country in which most men are
servants of corporations not free men as
in the old America that's gone and
corporations are becoming rivals of
government itself undermining popular
sovereignty exercised through the
democratic political system and notice
this was written in support of the
process he described the processes may
be unfortunate but necessary agreeing
with the business world particularly
after the destructive market failures of
the preceding years had convinced the
business world and progressive
intellectuals that markets simply had to
be administered and that financial
transactions had to be regulated similar
questions very similar ones are very
much alive in the international arena
today that talk about you know reforming
financial architecture and that sort of
thing
a century ago right about that time the
corporations were granted the rights of
persons by radical judicial activism
it's an extreme violation of classical
liberal principles they were also freed
from earlier obligations to keep the
specific activities for which they were
chartered furthermore an important move
the courts shifted power upwards from
the stockholders in a partnership to the
central management which was identified
with the immortal corporate person those
of you who are familiar with the history
of communism will recognize this is very
similar to the process that was taking
place at the time very quickly predicted
in fact by left critics left Marxist and
anarchist critics of Bolshevism people
like Rosa Luxemburg who warned early on
that the centralizing ideology would
shift power from working people to the
party to the Central Committee and then
the maximo leader has happened very
quickly after the conquest of state
power in 1917 which at once destroyed
every residue of socialist forms and
principles the propagandist son both
sides prefer a different story for
self-serving reasons but I think that's
the accurate one in recent years
corporations have been granted rights
that go far beyond those of persons so
under the World Trade Organization rules
the corporation's can demand what's
called the right of national treatment
that means that the General Motors if
its operating in Mexico can demand the
right of the demand to be treated like a
Mexican firm now that's only a right of
the immortal persons it's not a right of
flesh-and-blood persons like a Mexican
can't come to New York and demand
national treatment
very well other rules but corporations
can other rules require that the rights
of investors lenders speculators they
must prevail over the rights of mere
flesh and blood people generally
undermining popular sovereignty and
diminishing democratic rights
corporations as I'm sure you know even
have the right to bring suit spring
actions against sovereign states and
they're interesting cases for example
Guatemala a couple years ago sought to
reduce infant mortality by regulating
the marketing of infant formulas by
multinationals the measures that
Guatemala proposed were in conformity
with World Health Organization
guidelines and they kept two
international codes but the Gerber
corporation claimed expropriation and
the threat of a World Trade Organization
complaint sufficed for Guatemala to
withdraw fearing retaliatory sanctions
by the United States into the first such
complaint under the World Trade
Organization rules the New World Trade
Organization was brought against the
United States by Venezuela and Brazil
who complained that the EPA regulations
on petroleum violated their rights as
petroleum exporters watching back down
that time also allegedly in fear of
sanctions but I'm skeptical about that
interpretation I don't think the u.s.
fears trade sanctions from Venezuela and
Brazil more likely the Clinton
administration simply saw no compelling
reason to defend environmental the
environment and protect health these
issues are arising very dramatically and
in fact obscenely right now tens of
millions of people around the world are
dying from treatable diseases because of
the protectionist elements written into
the World Trade Organization rules a
grant private corporation mega
corporations monopoly pricing rights so
Thailand and South Africa for example
which have
misu t'kul industries can produce
life-saving drugs at a fraction of the
cost of the monopolistic pricing but
they're afraid to do so under threat of
trade sanctions the in fact 1998 the
United States even threatened the world
health organization that it would
withdraw funding if the World Health
Organization even monitor the effects of
trade conditions on health these are
very real threats i'm talking about
today like you know this week's
international press all of this is
called trade rights it has 92 a trade
that has to do with monopolistic pricing
practices enforced by protectionist
measures that are introduced into free
trade agreements what are called free
trade agreements the measures are
designed to ensure corporate rights they
also have the effect of reducing growth
and innovation naturally and they're
only part of the array of regulations
which introduced into these agreements
which are an attempt to prevent
development and growth not economically
motivated what is at stake is investor
rights and not trade and trade of course
itself is no has no value in itself it's
a value if it increases human welfare
otherwise not well in general the
principle of the World Trade
Organization primary principle and
related treaties is that sovereignty and
democratic rights have to be
subordinated to the rights of investors
in practice that means the rights of the
huge immortal persons the privateer
anees to which people must be
subordinated these are among the issues
that led to the remarkable events in
Seattle but in some ways a lot of ways
the conflict between popular sovereignty
and the private power was illuminated
more sharply short a couple of months
after Seattle
weeks ago in Montreal where an ambiguous
settlement was reached on the so called
bio safety protocols there the issue was
very clearly drawn quote the New York
Times a compromise was reached after
intense negotiations that often pitted
the United States against almost
everyone else over what's called the
precautionary principle what's that well
the chief negotiator for the European
Union quoting him countries must have
the freedom the sovereign right to take
precautionary measures with regard to
genetically altered seed microbes
animals crops that they fear might be
harmful the United States however
insisted on World Trade Organization
rules those rules are that an import can
be banned only on the basis of
scientific evidence notice what's at
stake here the question is at stake is
whether people have the right to refuse
to be experimental subjects so to
personalize it suppose the biology
department at the University were to
walk in and tell you you folks have to
be experimental subjects in an
experiment we're carrying out where
we're going to know what stick
electrodes in your brain and see what
happened and you can refuse but only if
you provide scientific evidence that
it's going to harm you well usually you
can't provide scientific evidence the
question is you have a right to refuse
under World Trade Organization rules you
don't you have to be experimental
subject it's a form of what it Herman
co-author of mine as an economist has
called producer sovereignty the producer
reigns consumers have to somehow defend
themselves that works domestically to as
you pointed out it's not the
responsibility of say chemical pesticide
industries to demonstrate to prove that
what they're putting into the
environment is safe it's the
responsibility the public to prove
scientifically that it's unsafe and they
have to do this
underfunded public agencies that are
susceptible to industry influence
through lobbying and other pressures
that was the issue at Montreal and a
kind of ambiguous settlement was reached
notice to be clear there was no issue of
principle you can see that by just
looking at the lineup the United States
was on one side and it was joined in
fact by some other countries with a
stake in biotechnology and agro export
high-tech agro export and on the other
side yet everybody else none of those
who didn't expect the profit by the
experiment that was the lineup and that
tells you exactly how much principal was
involved for similar reasons of the
European Union favors high tariffs on
agricultural products just as the United
States did 40 years ago but no longer
and not because the principles have
changed just because power has changed
there is an overriding principle the
principle is that the powerful and the
privileged have to be able to do what
they want of course pleading hi motifs
the corollary is that sovereignty and
democratic rights of people must go in
this case and that's what makes it so
dramatic they're right the reluctance to
be experimental subject when us-based
corporations can profit by the
experiment the appeal us appeal to the
World Trade Organization rules is very
natural since they codify that principle
that's the point these issues although
they're very real and affecting a huge
number of people in the world are
actually secondary to other modalities
to reduce sovereignty in favor of
private power most important I think
shirley was the dismantling of the
Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s
the
States and Britain and others that
system was designed by the US and
Britain in the 1940s it was a time of
overwhelming popular support for social
welfare programs and radical democratic
measures and primarily for those reasons
as is very explicit incidentally not
inference primarily for those reasons
the Bretton Woods system of the mid-40s
regulated exchange rates the idea was to
cut down wasteful and harmful
speculation and it permitted countries
to restrict capital flow and the reasons
were well understood and clearly
articulated free capital flow creates
what's sometimes called a virtual
Parliament of global capital which can
exercise veto power over government
policies that it considers irrational
that means things like labor rights or
educational programs or health or
efforts to stimulate the economy or in
fact anything that might help people and
not profits and therefore is irrational
in the technical sense the Bretton Woods
system more or less function for about
25 years that's what many economists
call the golden age of modern capitalism
modern state capitalism more accurately
that was a period roughly up until about
nineteen seventy a period of quite
historically unprecedented rapid growth
of the economy of trade of productivity
a capital investment extension of
welfare state measures golden age that
was reversed in the early 70s the
Bretton Woods system was dismantled with
liberalisation of financial markets and
floating exchange raise rates the period
since has often been described as a
legend age accurately there was a huge
explosion a very short-term speculative
capital completely over
whelming the productive economy there
was market there was quite marked
deterioration in just about every
respect considerably slower economic
growth slower growth of productivity of
capital investment higher interest much
higher interest rates which slowed down
growth greater market volatility and
financial crises all of these things
have very severe human effects of the
lenders tend to be bailed out stagnating
and declining wages much longer working
hours particularly striking in the
United States just give one example and
today's great economy that everyone's
talking about the median wage you know
half above half below median income half
above half below for families has gotten
back now to what it was in 1989 which is
well below what it was in the 1970s the
also has been a period of the
dismantling of social democratic
measures that had considerably improved
human welfare and in general provided
much greater veto power for the virtual
Parliament of private capital of
investors leading to significant decline
of democracy and sovereign rights as
intended in a significant deterioration
in social health well those effects are
felt in the rich societies and their
catastrophe in the poorer societies and
these issues they really you know they
cut across societies so you know it
doesn't sound a matter of this society
got richer and that one got poor the
more significant measures are segment
sectors of the global population so for
example if you take say the top 5% uses
recent World Bank analyses if you take
the type top 5 percent of the world's
population compared their income wealth
with to the bottom five percent that
ratio was 78 to one in 1988 and 114 to
one in 1993
it's last period which figures are
available and undoubtedly higher now the
same figures for the top one percent of
the world's population has the same
income as the bottom 57% two and a half
billion people for the rich countries
the point was made very clearly quoted
good economist by an economist barry
eichengreen is a highly regarded history
of the international monetary system and
listen to it carefully has the point
correct like others he pointed out many
people pointed this out but the current
phase of globalization is rather similar
to the pre-world War one period by rough
measures however their differences here
they are main one at that time global
policy government policy had not yet
been politicized by universal male
suffrage and the rise of trade unionism
and parliamentary Labour Party's
therefore the severe human costs of
financial rectitude that are imposed by
the virtual Parliament they could be
transferred to the general population
but that luxury was no longer available
in the more democratic Bretton Woods
Europe 1945 so that limits on capital
mobility substituted for limits on
democracy as a source of insulation from
market pressures as a corollary to that
it's quite natural that dismantling of
the post-war economic support er should
be accompanied by a significant attack
on substantive democracy freedom and
popular sovereignty in human rights
under the slogan Tina there is no
alternative it's kind of a farcical
mimicry of vulgar Marxism the slogan
needless to say is self-serving fraud
the particular socio-economic order
that's being imposed is the result of
human decisions and human institutions
the decisions can be modified
the institutions can be changed if
necessary they can be dismantled and
replaced just as honest and courageous
people have been doing throughout the
course of history
