question about the future of capitalism
general future yeah first of all that we
should bear in mind that capitalism is a
bit of a myth and we don't really have
capitalist societies now we have state
capitalist societies and the state has
always played an essential central role
in in development and extension of the
capitalist system so that goes back to
England in the 17th century and all the
way through the history of development
but let's just take the recent period so
take today's high-tech economy it takes
a your iPhone if you take your iPhone
and you take the technology and it and
take it apart turns out that almost
everything comes from the state sector
the GPS was developed by the Navy of the
electronics was developed in military
labs you know everything
the computer that's in front of you the
computers began to be developed in the
1950s actually a large part in the lab
where I happened to be working
it wasn't until 1977 but Apple was able
to produce a computer that could be
marketed and for profit that's after
about 30 years of research and
development in the state sector now
suppose we had capitalist societies but
one of the principles of capitalism
supposed to be that if you invest in
something especially if you invest to
make a risky costly investment over say
30 years and there's some profit that
comes out it's supposed to go back to
you but our system doesn't work like
that it goes to Bill Gates and Jeff
Bezos now the public pays the costs
through various devices now the
university labs and so on and then after
many years something has handed over the
private corporations and they make the
profit same with the internet the
beginnings of the internet were in the
late 1950s actually in same lab where I
was working at MIT that began thinking
about the internet and it developed over
decades under the within the government
system meaning taxpayer support finally
around 1995 the public made a gift
simply a gift to private corporations to
say ok you guys can have the internet
that we developed now we have the half a
dozen huge mega corporations which run
the Internet
it's a public public gift you know and
in fact across the board that's the way
it is the same if you go back to the
19th century when the what was called
the American system of production
developed kind of amazed the world you
know mass production quality control
interchangeable parts and most of who's
developing government armors that's
where you can do experimentation you can
you can make investments for the long
term for private corporations don't do
that
they want to make profit tomorrow you
know not invest for what might happen in
30 years you know and that's in fact the
entire history of development of what we
call capitalism and its current function
if you look at the present that takes
the people who are saying we have to
have a small government and devote
ourselves to the market and just look at
how they live there are huge public
subsidies government subsidies to every
major sector of the economy the
agribusiness energy finance they're all
heavily publicly subsidized but that's
ok that's a proper function of the
government just not pensions and
security and health and irrelevant
things like that so that's what's called
capitalism but it's a very specific
specifically shaped and designed form of
capitalism so can that survive well it
should certainly shouldn't survive and I
think that can be changed in fact the
public wants it to be changed so again
if you take a look at the United States
is a very heavily polled society mainly
because business wants to know what
people think but it's important so we
know it long about people's attitudes
the one thing we know is that across the
spectrum people want much higher taxes
on the rich the taxes keep going down in
fact those results usually aren't even
reported that of the even people who you
know are considered very right-wing tea
party let's say if you take a look at
their actual attitudes they're more or
less social democratic people say yeah
we want a very small government but we
want more expenditures in health and
education and support for people who
can't feed their children and so on but
just a small government but all the
things that a big government does in
fact even attitudes on things like
foreign foreign aid or very interesting
that can they polls about foreign aid
everyone says it's way too high and
we're giving everything away to the
undeserving foreigners when you ask them
what foreign aid should be this is about
ten times as high as it actually is you
know because it's these are the results
of extensive propaganda systems which
indoctrinate people into having certain
conceptions you know everybody's
stealing from us the poor are taken away
you know the government's of putting the
poor in front of us immigrants are
flooding the country that takes a
immigration
huge concern about immigration in the
United States you know Mexican rapists
and criminals almost half the
immigration is from Asia educated
trained to people who are being brought
in to help develop the high-tech economy
it's about 40% of the immigrants it's
not what people start here you know what
they hear is something that doesn't
exist
you know Mexican criminals but it's it's
pretty much the same in Europe so for
example in fact is very striking I
mentioned the other day the latest
elections in Europe were in Sweden a
couple of weeks ago which which again
the right-wing did get a much higher
percentage in everyone wanted which is a
frightening development but there was a
careful study of the rise of the right
in Sweden and what it showed was very
interesting and generalizes turns out
that the rise of the right in Sweden was
before the wave of immigrants it was a
reaction of people who were basically
cast aside by the abandonment of the
social democratic policies as the
government including the Social
Democratic so-called left began to move
towards the so-called austerity programs
you know people know the mass of the
population has left out some people do
fine you know they get rich the elites
as they're called so what most of the
people see is well those guys up there
are doing fine and on left out Oslo I
object and I'm gonna respond by voting
for the Nationalists xenophobic party
that was before the wave of immigrants
once the immigrants come in they serve
as a convenient scapegoat and so it's
their fault it's not the fault of the
corporation's up there we don't see them
in Finland with the same study showed
does the same rise in the right-wing
parties have put almost no immigration
if you take a look at the United States
it's quite interesting the 2016 election
have been extensive studies of why
people voted for Trump and almost all
the studies say it's racism and sexism
which is not false but the question is
why did these attitudes emerge and if
you look back they emerge from people
who were left out who have been
stagnating for forty years
even worse wages declining benefits
declining organization decline
those are communities that are ripe for
the demagogue who can blame everything
on a scapegoat the racism is there
undoubtedly misogyny is there xenophobia
is there and it comes out of the bottle
when people are angry and resentful and
don't know where to turn to for
explanation for their plight I think the
source of a lot of this is simply the
neoliberal policies of the last
generation which were designed they're
not a law of nature
you know they're designed to have
certain consequences which they have and
one of them is leaving the mass of the
population as what's sometimes called a
precariat people living precarious
existences no security pensions aren't
coming no organization we have nowhere
Osaka potatoes
we're going to look for somebody
responsible and the easiest place to
look as people are even more vulnerable
than you are and so it shows up in these
dangerous antisocial attitudes the
decline of democracy is a consequence
and in fact a desired consequence of the
policies that were instituted they
overcome what was called the crisis of
democracy too much democracy so now yes
we've succeeded in reducing the crisis
of democracy with the consequences that
follow from the
resistance you said this system will not
survive like this can't
yes impossible for a reason we haven't
discussed there are two huge crises
growing one of them we know about the
nuclear threat if you look at the
history of the nuclear age it's an
absolute miracle that we have survived
there was time we could go through it
but case after case
dozens of times sometimes by accident
mostly by accident sometimes by reckless
acts of leaders became literally within
minutes of terminal destruction
literally some of the cases are shocking
when you look at them and miracles don't
continue so sooner or later we'll manage
and destroy ourselves the other is
global warming which is very serious I
mean if the foot use of fossil fuels
continues that anything remotely like
the present level by the end of this
century let's say we might see sea level
rising 6 to 10 meters you can just
imagine what that would mean plus what
we already see severe weather droughts
hurricanes typhoons all escalating and
it already has big effects like the the
Syrian war for example at one of its
roots is a unprecedented drought nothing
and hundreds of thousands of years of
history huge drought surely the result
of global warming which drove peasants
off the land into the cities no way for
them to survive it creates a kind of
kindling which any Sparkle said all it's
part of the background for the conflicts
that arose the same happened in Darfur
the huge drought
of nomads into the agricultural areas
and there's also ethnic conflict there
immediately led to conflict and
confrontation ended up with big
massacres these things are not are not
just future we're living with the
beginnings of them you take a look at
Bangladesh which is mostly a coastal
plain the sea level starts rising that
what's going to happen to hundreds of
millions of people
if the glaciers keep melting and the
Himalayas the already meagre water
supply in South Asia is going to be
severely threatened and there right now
there are several hundred million people
in India who do not have potable water
we're taught in Pakistan it's going to
be even worse I mean we're talking about
the fate of hundreds of millions of
people in the near future the rich may
think they can escape by going to a
mountain somewhere but that's not going
to happen so and the policies that are
being pursued are to escalate the
problem that's not just nothing and it's
not just Trump I'm take the big banks
you take a look at the JPMorgan Chase
huge banks they know exactly what the
consequences are and they're increasing
their investments in fossil fuels that's
the nature of capitalism capital and the
as I said its we have a mixed form of
capitalism but there is a market system
underlying it somewhere and an
imperative of the market system is that
you try to make maximal profit tomorrow
and you disregard what are called
externalities the things that are not
charted and if you don't do that you're
out of the game it's part of the
structure of the system so Jamie Dimon
who's smart guy
head of JP Morgan Chase understands
perfectly well the consequences but
nevertheless is compelled by the logic
of the institutions to maximize the
threat his own grandchildren he may not
like it maybe on the side he gives money
to the Sierra Club environmental groups
but as functioning within the system
they're destroying the possibility for
organized life that is nothing that you
can put band-aids on this is much deeper
then of course the Trump administration
that's that's just though by far we
ought to have big headlines and the
newspapers every day saying these guys
are trying to destroy the possibility of
organized human life and if you think
about it honestly there's been nothing
in all of human history to compare with
this not a Atilla the Hun not Angus Kahn
not Hitler horrible as they were they
never tried to destroy organized human
life this is something new if that
there's a word to describe it an evil
doesn't capture it it's insanity doesn't
capture it because it's not insane its
plan unconscious and part of the very
logic of the system in which they work
now of course with Trump and his
associates they're trying to extend it
make it worse that's not part of the
logic of the system you could the system
could function with you know palliative
efforts to Obama in fact was doing and
most of the world is doing not enough
but at least something but it's a very
deep problem
it's like class hatred in Brazil this is
deep you can't put a bandaid on it it's
fundamental things that have to be dealt
with
how about resistance resistance the the
movement against capitalism against this
dole things believe that's it's going to
be encouraging for the store
all over the world there is a resistance
and it's you having so the most popular
political figure in the United States by
a considerable margin is Bernie Sanders
which is kind of unthinkable in the
framework of American political history
it's never happened in American
political history that somebody like
Sanders could become even notice let
alone become the most popular political
figure in the country now just think of
what happened here's a guy you have to
recognize that American elections are
literally bought you can you can predict
the outcome of elections with remarkable
precision simply by looking at campaign
funding executive and Congress goes back
well over a hundred years now here's
somebody who entered the campaign
virtually unknown no media support
barely mentioned if the media mentions
of they just made fun of him you know no
support zero from any of the funders no
corporate support no support from
private wealth he even used what's in
the United States the kind of
four-letter word that the United States
that I suppose the only country in the
world outside of maybe some dictatorship
where you can't say the word socialism
no let alone communism but it's just
unspeakable you know it's the it's it's
literally a four-letter word yeah then
he called him he said he was a socialist
socialist really means New Deal
Democrats mean anything very profound
but but with all of that he came very
close to win the nomination for the
Democrats are for Hillary at that time
no no not not
after the nomination yes but that's not
for Hillary that's against Trump that's
something quite different she was awful
but if Sanders had been able to win the
nomination frankly I don't know what
would have happened because the
Republican propaganda machine which had
not been directed against Sanders and
which is huge corporate back fantastic
it would be directed against Sanders and
what you'd start hearing is things about
this atheist Jew communist wants to
destroy everything a ton of stuff like
that
he probably probably couldn't have
withstood it but so it's kind of
unpredictable but that's what certainly
would have happened that and how people
would react to that you really don't
know it's hard that you can see it in
England right now the attack on Corbin I
mean there's an enormous fear including
the Labour point you know the old Labour
Party the Guardian you know the idea
that you might have a political party
that actually represents the general
public and its interests and suffering
people abroad and is led by a decent
human being
that's totally intolerable so you have
this enormous attack of the kind you
can't defend yourself against like
anti-semitism since you say and
somebody's a Holocaust denier and
anti-semite you know there's no defense
basically and it's just across the board
a huge attack on Corbin and the Labour
Party and that's the kind of thing you
would have seen if Sanders and commenter
you know they pick a little differently
but anti-israel you know all this huge
propaganda which he is so familiar you
can just make it a
- since there's a lot to overcome but
what the Sanders campaign showed and
what the Corbin success shows is that
you do quite a lot of these Sanders and
Yanis varoufakis just came out with a
joint declaration Baro focus that's very
important I think of our focus is very
smart interesting guy they have he is
the center of this new political
organization diem25
which is in fact running candidates
transnational candidates for the
European Parliament and ultimately for
in the Greek elections and later other
ones which is a kind of a counterpart to
Corbin and Sanders and they've are FACA
Sanders declaration a couple of days ago
is you know it's not radical it's
calling for sensible multipolar and then
Liberal Democratic instant stew in the
Europe to preserve what's good about the
European Union and to overcome the
serious flaws same in the Western
Hemisphere and things like the Obrador
election in Mexico or another example so
I think if you look around the world
there's a little just plain level of
activism mainly among young people it's
quite surprising striking I think it's
much higher than almost it's ever been
except for a few few brief moments but
1968 there's a brief spike but this is
lasting so I think the basis is sort of
there or if it can be brought together
and organized
