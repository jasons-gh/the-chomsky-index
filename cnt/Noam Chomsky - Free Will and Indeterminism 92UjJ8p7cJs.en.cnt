I wanted to ask whether you envisage for
have some kind of very accommodating in
determinism for free well for sense of
free will of being secreted in this
secrete delusion or perhaps being
analogous to the moon illusion or re
well-being beyond our comprehension no
theory about my only theory about it is
probably a mystery
I mean Connolly it's like a mystery he
is a phenomenon at confronting free will
looks to me like the way a rat would
probably field it was facing the right
right left left maze something's going
on out there but he can't figure out
what it is you know the phenomena look
so obvious requires to deny them
I don't got anything to do with
indeterminate I mean well like they say
Roger Penrose leading he argued that
quantum physics is wrong is you know
hasn't really tentative temporary theory
hasn't quite reached the truth and when
it reaches the truth no you know I'm not
enough of a scientist to be saying I
don't any reason to believe that doesn't
seem to be getting us anywhere near the
question quantum indeterminacy seems
that's totally different property no
more relevant in classical determinacy
Priestley he was just making a common
sense I think he was making common sense
observation he was paying look there's
no matter around anymore
got rid of it things like power of
attraction repulsion which we donors and
and electricity magnetism we don't
understand
and human thought which is done
understand are the properties of
whatever organized matter we've got to
try to understand the parallel way at
the house understand them
you never kind of thing but you never
know until you've done it doesn't make
much sense speculating about how it will
work out the only thing that's worth
speculating about I think is whether
some of these questions are in the
mysteries of age for humans which they
might be and about that we could
conceivably learn something they do have
that feel and in fact I think calling
again is basically correct in saying
that most philosophical problems have
that field problem country is one can't
deny there are people would deny that
people are country or who claim the
thermostats or country you know that
seems ridiculous and it just seems not
true but nobody has the progress idea
about how organize matters have this
property there are lots of pad book
steps of claims office but if you look
at them and angry state of the problem
