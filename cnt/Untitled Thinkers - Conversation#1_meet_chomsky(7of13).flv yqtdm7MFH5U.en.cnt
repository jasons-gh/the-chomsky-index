in any social structure that exists
you're going to find people who give the
orders and people who take them that's a
power system takes many different forms
in a patriarchal family traditional
patriarchal family will be the father
gives the orders the wife follow us on
the children do with the goal of course
nothing works that simply so what kind
of interactions but that's the basic
power system in a society like the
United States you take a look at the
pretty well studied it's kind of obvious
on the face and who makes the decisions
about what is produced what is
distributed what appears in the media
who's in the political system and so on
that's not you know you'll get a simple
answer but in a general way it traces
back to the concentration of economic
power that's where the decisions are
made in a corporation let's say that's
tyranny it's easy to determine how it
works at the top you get the board of
directors and the CEO they make
decisions they hand them down to the
next level where they implement the
decisions and pass it on down below very
bottom you have the people who have
rented themselves to it their co-workers
they just follow the decisions now again
there's interaction but you know this
interaction even in the Communist Party
run in the Kremlin run society but and
where we look you find the differences
between the guys who give the orders and
the ones who take them power systems
don't contribute to survival in fact
they always they often are responsible
for huge destruction whenever you have a
war somebody started and it's some power
system can lead to enormous suffering
and the same is true on a smaller scale
what you need survival requires
cooperation organization but
argument to say that it requires a
hierarchy and domination that's just a
residue of human history one that should
be overcome and to a large extent a
speed like one of the most extreme forms
of power systems was slavery well
theoretically we don't have it anymore
actually we do but not in the form in
which once existed okay that's our tix a
woman's room pretty recent development
for women have automatic rights fact
even our own societies free much less
half-century of 3040 years so Phil
matters proceed history is has it it's
not uniform is regression but over time
the cycle is towards eroding the more
brutal elements of the power hierarchy
and domination and I think that has a
long way to go but I don't think it's I
don't think the methods are obscure and
I don't think that the goals would be
terribly obscured
