members and friends of the West Point
community in particular Colonel Karen
Colonel Zupan colleagues in the trenches
who teach philosophy 201 and the nearly
500 cadets now taking this course good
evening to all and welcome I'm Robert
Tully professor of philosophy at the
academy our guest speaker tonight a man
of extraordinary accomplishment is known
Chomsky Institute professor of
linguistics and philosophy at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
his reputation precedes him here by
leaps and bounds just six months ago the
British Journal of current affairs
prospect conducted a poll among its more
than 20,000 readers to identify today's
leading global public intellectual in
the list of a hundred such figures
professor Chomsky came first drawing
more than twice the votes received by
the runner-up Umberto Eco in the eyes of
this journal professor Chomsky belongs
to the as they said the age of the great
oppositional thinker opposition has
indeed been a consistent feature of
professor Chomsky's public life since
the 1960s he has been a determined and
acerbic critic of American foreign
policy he has denounced politicians of
both parties for hubris and blindness
and condemned American Society for
tolerating the grip of big business on
politics and the pervasive influence of
mass media if he has been given more to
condemnation than to praise that may
well be the world's fault not his
professor Chomsky has launched his
attacks and newspapers journals and
magazines on radio and television and in
public forums pronouncing on the major
issues of the day from Vietnam to
Central America the Middle East the war
on terror and of course Iraq his
articles and essays on political topics
alone number more than 200 that at least
is where I gave up counting in addition
there are hers more than 50 books on
political matters beginning in 1969 with
a
American power and the new mandarins and
continuing to the present with the
recently published failed States however
this amazing productivity constitutes
only half the picture seem seemingly to
people fill the shoes of one Noam
Chomsky his protest and denunciations
will eventually recede from public view
but posterity will certainly always
remember Noam Chomsky as the single
thinker the non global non public
intellectual who once revolutionized the
science of linguistics chomsky's work in
linguistic burst upon the scene in the
late 1950s and was steadily consolidated
in a vast number of articles and more
than 30 books he gave linguistics a new
starting point Chomsky set out to answer
a fundamental question what makes
possible the endowment of human language
itself what lies beneath the enormous
variety of spoken languages he theorized
that our familiar languages derived from
an underlying universal grammar a set of
operational rules in which native
children already possess sufficient
skill to enable them unthinkingly to
become speakers of their parents
language in just a few years whether
this underlying grammar is a function of
the mind or of the brain was of
secondary concern to Chomsky as a
linguist to gain to codify and give
formal shape to the rules by which the
language learner naturally operates this
is science in an abstract but profound
sense the new direction that Chomsky
gave to linguistics made his project
comparable to the work done by Whitehead
and Russell a half-century earlier who
aspired to base both formal logic and
number theory on a set of first
principles his achievement on behalf of
linguistics was also in the spirit of
two great European rationalists the
Philosopher's Descartes and Conte who
had sought in their own ways and for
different purposes to find Anchorage for
our experience of the world in the
workings of an objective human reason to
selves then the public controversy list
and the academic scientist two voices
but
one noam chomsky do such divergent
interests have a foundation is there an
underlying unity to the voices I think
the answer can be found in the same
European tradition from which also comes
the view that the moral will is the
essential component of human reason
according to the rationalist we
recognize the rightness or wrongness of
human actions just as we into it the
necessary truth of some propositions our
ethical judgments express the workings
of the moral law and a sharpened insight
compels us to take an ethical stand if
we have the courage the rationalist with
courage reject self-deception and the
dominance of feeling the chief concern
is with what it is right to do not with
whether consequences make the action
right above all the rationalist upholds
a universal perspective that treats
people as ends rather than as means
actions contrary to this perspective
deserve to be exposed and criticized all
the more so if they are the actions of
governments that abuse their nearly
absolute power for the sake of
self-interest Noam Chomsky is a
passionate rationalist yet his endeavour
has not been to advance a novel theory
of ethics the moral certainties that
compel him to speak are not theoretical
they are the stuff of everyday moral
intuitions simple and easily recognized
but in need of a voice how these
certainties are applied is the stuff of
controversy but the dust of political
and social debate all too easily
obscures the strong moral convictions
that underlie them I do not apologize
for these lengthy remarks about
professor Chomsky it cannot be said that
a person of such remarkable complexity
needs no introduction to use a Warren
phrase he has come to speak to us
tonight about some aspects of Just War
theory after which he will want to
engage the students the cadets of
philosophy 201 in discussion and
priority in the question-and-answer
period will be given to the cadets let
this discussion be what all
philosophical debate aims to be
objective open respectful fair
l argued in one word rational please
join me now in welcoming our guest
professor Noam Chomsky
Thanks I think a useful place to start
might be with a recent academic study by
an Oxford professor of traditions of war
which contrasts to leading paradigms in
the study of Just War what the author
calls the Rodian and Republican
interpretations first part of paradigm
traces back to hugo grotius famed 17th
century humanist who founded the
dominant framework of thinking on laws
of war within this paradigm law of war
is an act of states and just war
proposals are means to humanize to
introduce humanity in warfare it's one
tradition the contrasting Republican
paradigm traces back to verse oh and the
uprising against monarchy in feudalism
and the late 18th century including the
American Revolution this paradigm blends
war with justice with liberty equality
individual and community rights whatever
else may fall within our concept of
justice well these positions are of
course idealization zeeeee the real
world is more complex the formal
implementation of efforts to introduce
humanity into warfare do not simply
disregard questions of justice but they
do put them to the margins they're not
central to the codification of the
principles of World Order and practice
with single exception of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights which has a
pretty tattered history well despite
real-world complexities the differences
between these two approaches
to just war I think deserve attention in
considering both the issues that are
dressed and those that are ignored we
might ask whether that itself is just
there are at least three major sources
of insight into the concepts of Just War
the first is the scholarly literature
the second is the underlying notions of
human nature that underlie our moral
judgment and the third is the
international codifications so I'd like
to say a few words about each of these
topics I think it may help to indicate
in advance where I'm heading in brief my
own conclusions are that the literature
merits careful attention but is
ultimately not very instructive about
just war secondly that the notions of
human nature should be at the heart of
the discussion although serious inquiry
into this is still in its early stages
and third that the codifications are
seem to be sensible but actions in the
real world all too often reinforce a
famous maxim of tacitus that the strong
do as they can well the week do as they
must so let's start with some remarks on
some of the current literature on Just
War one of the most recent studies is
Michael Walters book arguing about war
which merits particular attention not
only because of the high praise it's
received but also because Walter is
responsible for the largely responsible
for the recent revival of Just War
theory the strengths I think the book
reveals both the strengths and the
weaknesses of Just War theory the
strengths are that many of the
conclusion seem plausible enough at
least to me but
particularly those conclusions that
pretty much reiterate standard
codifications the weakness is that
despite the book's title arguing about
war it's very hard to find an argument
you might try that as an experiment and
more accurately while arguments are
sometimes detectable they rely crucially
on such premises as seems to be entirely
justified or I believe or no doubt and
there's almost no effort to bring in
relevant background information and
evidence Walter gives to paradigm
examples which in which case he simply
asserts that the wars are just in fact
so obviously just that argument is
unnecessary the two examples are
Afghanistan and Kosovo he describes the
invasion of Afghanistan as a triumph of
Just War theory which stands alongside
the bombing of Serbia in 1999 as an
uncontroversial case of just war no
argument is felt to be necessary
although in either case it doesn't take
much effort to think of possible
evidence that might bear on the
pronouncement that these are triumphs of
Just War theory and these are
considerations that would certainly be
brought by brought up by just were
theorists if the responsibility for the
military action lay elsewhere well for
lack of time i'll skip illustrations but
can come back to know if you'd like to
be clear I'm not asking whether the
bombings of Afghanistan and Serbia were
right or wrong maybe they were maybe
they weren't I'm asking a different
question namely what does Just War
theory have to say about it and I think
if you look closely you'll find that the
answer is that it has nothing to say
about it we're left with assertions of
the author's that state violence was
justified on
virtually so and any consequences
whether anticipated or not are entirely
no doubt the fault of the official enemy
well another recent and also highly
regarded inquiry into Just War theory is
by moral political philosopher Jean Elka
Elstein the paradigm of Just War she
writes is the bombing of Afghanistan and
she adds that nearly everyone with the
exception of absolute pacifists and a
few lunatics agree that the bombing of
Afghanistan was clearly a just war
argument ended in reality nearly
everyone excludes substantial categories
of people of the majority of the world's
population for example even in Europe
far more so in Latin America and also
leading Afghans who had been fighting
the Taliban and including us favorites
and virtually all aid agencies working
there but what's relevant is that this
constitutes the sole argument to
establish that the war was just in fact
uncontroversial e so facts are
irrelevant and though further argument
is needed well L Stein does provide
criteria for just war so we at least
have the rudiments of a theory for
criteria read them first criterion the
war must be openly declared or otherwise
what otherwise authorized by a
legitimate authority second it must
begin with the right intentions third
forces justified if it protects the
innocent from certain harm as when a
country has certain knowledge that
genocide will commence on a certain date
fourth it must be a last resort after
other possibilities for the redress and
defense of the values at stake have been
explored well
the first two conditions are vacuous
declaration of war by an aggressor
confers no support whatsoever for a
claim of just war and even the worst
criminals claim right intentions the
third and fourth conditions and
unreasonable but they have no relevance
at all clearly to the case of
Afghanistan so therefore elstein's Paris
paradigm example collapses entirely
under her own criteria he had just one
word on the classic modern work Michael
Walters Justin unjust wars which I
believe you've been reading my personal
judgment is that his conclusions are
generally very reasonable also pretty
much in accord with the conventional
reading of the United Nations Charter
but what's relevant here is that the
conclusions just about invariably rely
crucially on the ubiquitous phrase it
seems to me and so on and you might test
so just as an illustration tech witty
regards as the hardest question in his
words that is the British bombing of
urban centres in Germany up to the end
of the war Walter concludes that such
bombing quoting him after the immediate
threat posed by Hitler's early victories
had passed was entirely indefensible
maybe so but if you check you'll find
there's no argument apart from the
statement that the policy seems cruel
well I think it does it seems cruel to
me at least about what does Just War
theory have to say where does it enter
into the argument and why our relevant
facts disregarded there are after all
relevant
fact well the character the theory is
revealed further when we look at the
examples that Walter is just about a
half a dozen examples which are just
listed no argument or discussion to show
the to show that just war theory applies
leaving in his words no doubts the
examples are mostly uncontained might
we'll ask why some of these examples are
chosen but not others for example the
Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia is
given as a case where there is no doubt
but not given is the israeli invasion of
lebanon which I suppose had about a
hundred times as many casualties and
many more during the 22 years of
occupation of level of southern Lebanon
in defiance of security council orders
so maybe there's a reason maybe there
isn't but whatever it is it's not given
that's all examples except one the last
example of a case where just war theory
applies leaving no doubt is the Egyptian
challenged Israel in 1967 that's the
sole example in the long period covered
we're just were theory allegedly
demonstrates that a preemptive strike
was just beyond all doubt well maybe the
selection of cases and the conclusions
are correct maybe they're not but what's
relevant here is the Just War theory
plays little if any role in the argument
which reduces pretty much two
declarations of personal preference well
I won't go on that these are to my
knowledge fairly representative
selections from the most highly regarded
literature and I think it's fair to
conclude more generally that we learned
very little about just war from Just War
theory although we do learn something
about the
prevailing intellectual moral climate in
which the theory is presented and
honored well its allure turn to the
second source of potential insight
second source of potential insight into
just war theory that is our intuitive
moral judgments well here we are turning
to what was traditionally called moral
philosophy I think it's more aptly
described as moral psychology in modern
terms it's after the divorce of science
and philosophy in the mid 19th century a
century before that David Hume had done
his classic work on what he called the
springs and origins of human nature Hume
recognized that knowledge and belief are
grounded in what he called a species of
natural instincts part of our inherent
mental nature he recognized also that
something similar must be true in the
domain of moral judgment his reason was
that our moral judgments are unbounded
in scope we are constantly applying them
in systematic ways to new circumstances
in a manner that's intelligible to
others hence they too must be founded on
general principles that are part of our
nature although beyond what he called
our original instincts meaning the
narrow or instincts that we share with
animals well that insight which i think
is accurate should lead directly to
efforts to develop something like a
grammar of moral judgment it's an
enterprise very much like the inquiry
into the principles that are encoded
somehow in our brains that permit us to
do what you and you and I are now doing
and more broadly to produce and
understand linguistic expressions over
an unbounded range and used
them in a way which is appropriate to
circumstances and intelligible to others
even though they may be quite new in our
own history or unexperienced in fact all
of history well as was recognized a
century before Hume these principles
must be universal hence grounded in our
nature and the basis for acquisition of
any particular language today we would
say that the principles of language and
moral judgment are part of our genetic
endowment part of human biology in both
cases they're culturally specific and
universal aspect in both the case of
internal faculties of language and moral
judgment these things can be studied
their part of science in fact studied in
rather similar ways inquiry into the
moral faculty in these terms was
undertaken by the leading American moral
and political philosopher of late 20th
century John Rawls who relied explicitly
on the analogy of two linguistic
theories that were being developed in
the 1960s at the time that he was
writing his classic work theory of
justice roles in fact put this aspect of
his work aside under severe criticism by
moral philosophers turned to core issues
for him the criticisms were reexamined
and I think adequately refuted in a
doctoral dissertation a few years ago by
John MacPhail who is now a law professor
at Georgetown forthcoming book of his
based on the dissertation develops this
and also presents empirical
investigation of moral judgments in
puzzling thought experiments that have
been designed by moral philosophers this
experimental work reveals that
intuitions in these quite puzzling cases
are typically instantaneous and
reflexive in adults and children
with systemic changes through early
childhood development much as in other
aspects of development he then goes on
to develop a theoretical explanation in
terms of fixed principles that can be
regarded as a development of roles
theory of justice and the much earlier
work of Hume and other classical writers
on our natural instinct there's another
book soon to come out by Harvard
primatologist and cognitive scientist
mark Hauser carrying such inquiries
further includes comparative studies and
more general ideas about what he calls
the moral organ analogous to the
language organ other sub components of
the cognitive systems that are a core
part of our biological nature well in
recent years these topics have become a
lively field of theoretical and
empirical inquiry the for many points of
view incidentally is a study of
principles that underlie intuitive
conceptions of justice and rights and
their cultural variety their limited
cultural variety and their universal
properties that could someday provide
foundations for a more substantive
theory of just war but it remains
largely a task for the future though
it's underway and interesting and
interesting ways well finally a couple
of words on the codification of these
intuitive judgments in the past century
I'll keep through the period after world
war two although the earlier conventions
have very clear and significant
contemporary relevance a conventions of
1907 for example can come back to that
if you like the post-second World War
codification of the laws of war that
consists primarily of the UN Charter the
Geneva Conventions and the Nuremberg
principles
later adopted by the General Assembly
well as you know i'm sure the Charter
bars the threat or use of force except
in two instances if authorized by the
Security Council of the United Nations
or under Article 51 of the Charter in
self-defense against armed attack until
the Security Council acts the phrase
armed attack is conventionally
interpreted in terms of Daniel Webster's
principle which extends armed attack to
cases where in his words the necessity
for action is urgent is instant
overwhelming and leaving no choice of
means and no moment of deliberation any
other resort the force is a war crime in
fact the supreme international crime
encompassing all the evil that follows
and the words of the Nuremberg Tribunal
I was high-level UN panel meeting in
issued its report in december two
thousand four included among others
former National Security Advisor Brent
Scowcroft it concluded that article 51
needs neither extension or restriction
of its long understood scope it should
be neither rewritten nor reinterpreted
last September the UN World Summit
reaffirmed quoting that the relevant
provisions of the Charter are sufficient
to address the full range of threats to
international peace and security the
summit further endorsed the
responsibility to commit ourselves to
helping States build capacity to protect
their populations from genocide war
crimes ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity and to assisting those
which are under stress before crises and
conflicts break out the summit granted
no new right of intervention to
individual states or regional alliances
whether under humanitarian or other
professed grounds and it established no
responsibility to protect the contrary
to it was widely alleged in news reports
and commentary the high-level panel of
december two thousand four had reached
the same conclusion in words that were
specifically directed at international
at intellectual opinion and state
practice in the west in recent years its
words were these for those impatient
with declaring article 51 to be
appropriate as formulated the answer
must be that in a world full of
perceived potential threats the risk to
the global order and the norm of
non-intervention on which it continues
to be based is simply too great for the
legality of unilateral preventive action
as distinct from collectively endorsed
action to be accepted allowing one to so
act is to allow all allowing one to so
act as to allow all now here the panel
is proposing the principle of
universality namely that we applied to
ourselves the same standards we do to
others if not more stringent ones that's
perhaps the most elementary of moral
truisms and it's the foundation of Just
War theory if that theory is to be taken
at all seriously the principle however
is flatly rejected in the elite
intellectual moral and political culture
of the most powerful states and six plis
utley rejected by official doctrine that
includes the expositors and advocates of
Just War theory also includes a
substantial legal literature it's pretty
easy to delta illustrate there's plenty
of material and print about it well in
this and we can draw some conclusions
from that in this connection and by
saying that it's worth remembering some
eloquent were
on the principle of universality
foundation of Just War theory in any
serious moral theory the comments by
Justice Robert Jackson he was the chief
of counsel for the prosecution at
Nuremberg he informed the tribunal that
if certain acts of violation of treaties
are crimes they are crimes whether the
United States does them or whether
Germany does them and we are not
prepared to lay down a rule of criminal
conduct conduct against others which we
would not be willing to have invoked
against us we must never forget that the
record on which we judge these
defendants is the record on which
history will judge us tomorrow to pass
these defendants a poisoned chalice is
to put it to around own lips as well the
supreme international crime for which
the defendants were hanged at Nuremberg
was defined clearly enough by Justice
Jackson at Nuremberg he proposed to the
tribunal that an aggressor is a state
that is the first to carry out invasion
of its Armed Forces with or without a
declaration of war of the territory of
another state illustrations of that too
are easy enough to find and others are
on the horizon it's again noteworthy
that these considerations are virtually
excluded from the dominant intellectual
and moral culture in the West rather
generally although we have no difficulty
at all and applying them to official
enemies well once again there's nothing
special about our own country in this
respect except that it's more powerful
than others such elaysians with regard
to the acts of one's own state are close
to universal they disfigure intellectual
history as far back as you go to the
maxim of Tacitus that I quoted we may
add an observation by president john
adams
power always thinks it has a great soul
and vast views beyond the comprehension
of the week I think that's another
near-universal again all too easy to
illustrate from the traditional practice
of governments and the educated classes
within them well to return to the
beginning what can one learn from Just
War theory my feeling is that from the
literature on Just War we learn mostly
about the prevailing moral and
intellectual climate in which we live
scientific inquiry into moral psychology
and its roots in our nature may someday
provide important insights but practice
cannot wait for that day any more than
engineering has waited for physics or
medicine for biology for centuries in
these cases which are much simpler ones
and much more accessible to inquiry than
human nature thirdly the codification of
laws of war has over time had a notable
civilizing effect but the gap between
professed ideals and actual practice is
much too large to be tolerated in my
opinion thanks
your chance to talk repeat that question
errs won't be filmed so you can feel
free to talk
sir I was just wondering I if you
believe that the United States of
America has a responsibility to
intervene in cases where just war says
that it is justified to intervene do I
think that there's a responsibility to
intervene in cases where just war theory
concludes that it is correct intervene
set the question personally I agree with
the UN Charter the high-level UN panel
of december two thousand four and the UN
World Summit which i quoted but I can't
really answer the question because as
far as I can determine you can tell me
if I'm wrong Just War theory never tells
you anything it doesn't tell you in its
proper to intervene what it tells you is
I think its proper to intervene well you
know I I may also think so but there's a
big gap between assertion and argument
between surmise and evidence so if you
can tell me we're just war theory
entails that we ought to intervene we
can consider the question but until ads
don't done we can't really consider the
question
sir I was wondering sorry I don't right
here sir oh I was wondering do you
believe that it would have been right to
reassess article 51 of the UN Charter
and you believe that by not reassessing
and not rewriting it it loses relevancy
I'm sorry I didn't get it bye bye say it
again by not reassessing it not recess
you're writing it do you believe it
loses its it has been reassessed
repeatedly for example by the high-level
UN panel of December to that issue is
report on 2004 with many distinguished
participants I mentioned Brent Scowcroft
but there are others yes that's exactly
what they did they reassessed the UN
Charter and their conclusion is what i
read the UN world summit last September
again reassess the UN Charter and that's
what it concluded maybe there should be
a further reassessment fine then let's
undertake it and let's consider their
arguments or other arguments but we
can't say that it hasn't been reassessed
and we can say that we haven't paid any
attention to it well that's possible in
fact true but it certainly has been
reassessed by very respectable and
leading figures and their conclusions in
my opinion at least are pretty justified
however I get back to the main topic I
don't think just war tell Theory tells
us anything about that when we judge
these things we're judging them on
another basis on the basis of actual
evidence about what happens in
particular cases in terms of our
fundamental moral principles which we
should try to explicate and apply like
the principle of universality that's the
way we should reassess it also we should
I think think seriously about the
statement that I quoted of the december
two thousand four panel that was
directed to people like us it was
directed to intellectual opinion in the
west and can read it again
what they said is the foundations of
World Order based on the principle of
non-intervention and the affairs of
others not forceful intervention is too
important and too fragile to be
destroyed or the consequences will be
terrible because for one to act is to
grant the authority to all at least if
we believe in elementary moral
principles that's a heavy burden to bear
maybe we could come up with a different
conclusion in some cases actually
personally I think we can but has to be
argued circuit a Greco he said that it's
possible that article 51 needs to be
reassessed but you mentioned earlier
when you were referencing Walters book
that he said that the Israeli preemptive
strike was just or that he said the
Israeli preemptive strike was justified
you also stated that his arguments did
not really have justification by his
theory however in the case of the
preemptive strike he does say that there
are several criterion that are necessary
for the Israeli attack to be justified
specifically the fact that these
Egyptian army was standing at a state of
readiness that the Israeli army was
incapable of holding so under Article 51
even though Egypt had not yet invaded
Israel that they they were not at war
however what Egypt was doing tactically
put Israel at a severe disadvantage so
under our modern definition of war it
seems to me that that ought to be it
seems to me it seems logical that it
ought to be called an act of war what
Egypt was doing putting Israel at such a
disadvantage so doesn't article 51
definitely need some recent article 51
clearly does not apply all right read
article
we can argue that we can argue that it
was justified but we can't say that
article 51 justifies it not under Daniel
Webster's characterization or any other
one that's accepted by the international
community we might argue and here's
where I think you could make an argument
that if you consider the range of issues
that arose at the time the preemptive
strike was justified maybe one can give
such an argument but the point is that
no argument is given to that effect none
of the relevant facts are considered and
this is regarded as one of the half
dozen cases where just war theory
entails that the use of military force
was legitimate not just war theory
doesn't entail that I wouldn't tell
anything it what it tells you is well I
Michael worth Walter believe this was
justified but without giving any reasons
and without looking into the background
if you look into the background it's a
lot more complex than that a lot of
literature and scholarship on it the
u.s. didn't agree there were all sorts
of possibilities you could have taken I
mean I don't want if you want to run
through the background but it's quite
intricate and complex going back to the
question of free passage through the
Straits of Tiran and whether that should
be brought to the World Court which the
US and Israel refused to do and he
insisted on involves Israeli strikes
against Syrian targets all sorts of
things so yes there's a complicated
background you could look at them you
could decide maybe that in the light of
these complex these complex
circumstances perhaps Israel is entitled
to make a preemptive strike but that's
not what's claimed what's claimed is
that without looking at any evidence
just war theory whatever it is it's not
easy to determine just war theory
entails that this is one of the half
dozen cases in the last century in which
the use of force was no doubt legitimate
and the only case in which preemptive
strike was legitimate we can also raise
the question of universality I mean I
believe and I'm sure you don't believe
that Iran has a right to say carry out
terrorist acts in the United States
right now but undoubtedly it's under
serious threat and undoubtedly the
thread is simply overwhelming as
compared with Iran's capacities but with
the outrageous to suggest that of course
and if it's outrageous to suggest that
why is it legitimate in this case I mean
for 12 pack is to give the right tool
and we can give a whole lot of other
examples I mean let me give it even more
outrageous one okay not not because I
accept that of course but just as an
example nobody I know of who's semi sane
that goes out every December 7th and
celebrates Pearl Harbor Day however if
we use these arguments you can do it
japan on december 7th attacked US
military bases in hawaiian to
effectively to us colonies territories
claimed by the US hawaii in the
philippines tech military bases the
Japanese were perfectly capable of being
of reading what was being written in US
public journals and in fact US
intelligence which had cracked the
Japanese codes know that they knew about
it now what was being written going all
the way up to the high military command
being reported by you know political
commentators and the New York Times was
that the United States was that b-17s
were running off the boeing assembly
line that designs to be able to burn the
to the ground the what they were called
the antiques in which the Japanese lived
these wooden cities burn them to the
ground with their b-17 attacks
furthermore b-17s were being shipped
from the Atlantic where they were needed
to Pacific paces in preparation for such
attacks well you know is that a threat
that's a pretty serious threat is that
justified Pearl Harbor
I mean not in ten million years but if
that doesn't why does why is this
justify
my birthday incidentally so I have a
special interest in that day sir I can't
see I'm sorry I really syrup here cadet
Hobson I just want to know if you
thought that our operations in a war
were preempted for preventive and sorry
I couldn't hear the first point do you
think our operations in Iraq are
preventive or pre-emptive and do you
think that our operations in Iraq or
just or unjust well that was interesting
terminology in that the administration
presented it and in fact the National
Security Council described they had that
in mind but more generally as preemptive
work but it certainly isn't pre-emptive
word by any stretch of the imagination
more accurately you could call it
preventive war okay say we have to
prevent a potential attack against us
personally I don't see much
justification for that even if you
accept that they believed all the
reports that Colin Powell was giving it
the UN Security Council and so on even
if we accept that all that was believed
it doesn't seem to me that a preventive
war in such a case is legitimate and as
you know the world didn't think so
either there were international polls
taken on this and outside the United
States and to Olympus the more limited
extent England you could barely find a
country in the world where support for
it was above ten percent in fact the
only two exceptions in the international
poles that were taken were India and
Israel but both of them had something
different in mind what they had in mind
was their own repression of occupied
territories Kashmir and the occupied
territories yeah they like the idea of
preventive war by the powerful but they
weren't talking about this however the
rest of the world was almost
non-existent ten percent or less what is
it and again we have the same
question if preventive war is legitimate
under those circumstances it's
legitimate for everybody okay that means
it's legitimate for Iran today I mean to
take another case it is simply
undeniable I read it right in US
official document that the United States
has been carrying out a terrorist war
against Cuba since nineteen sixty I mean
at first it was with direct
participation in more recent years is
just with tolerance but that it happened
isn't even questionable no John F
Kennedy assigned his brother Robert
Kennedy the task of running the
terrorist war I was to be his highest
priority Robert Kennedy's official more
or less official biographer historian
Arthur Schlesinger who was well-known
historian it was a Kennedy member of the
Kennedy team a Latin American advisor he
writes that Robert Kennedy's task was to
bring the terrors of the earth to Cuba
and if you look back at the record it
was no joke and it continues now still
based on US soil and the u.s. harbors of
happily harbors the terrorists who were
involved in does that give cube of the
right to carry out terrorist acts in the
u.s. that to prevent this did it ever
give them the right well I don't think
so I'm sure you don't think so but if
preventive war is legitimate why not and
in fact you know and there are many
other cases where takes a Lebanon in
1982 when Israel was preparing the
attack and in fact trying desperately to
conjure up an excuse for the attack they
were bombing Lebanon hoping for some
retaliation that we used as a pretext
and that was a serious attack killed
probably maybe 20,000 people destroyed a
large part of southern Lebanon city
much of it did that give leaven in the
or the Palestinians in Lebanon the right
to carry out the terrorist acts in
Israel prior to it to prevent the war
well I certainly don't think so I'm sure
you don't but if preventive war is
legitimate under such ambiguous cases as
Iraq why isn't that legit so no I don't
think it was just I think it was
aggression sir walter's legal asst
paradigm mom when he describes it he
also describes three revisions one of
which being the human rights provision
saying that it is justified to intervene
if human rights are being violated would
you give any credence to the argument
that your son Saddam Hussein was in fact
a tyrant that did violate human rights
no he said even though even though there
were other reasons given for war such as
WMT and additionally aggressors our
walls are also describes aggressors as
also being Justin to go against the war
get good a war against and 11 and did he
ever lose his status as an aggressor
from the first Gulf War he lost its
status as an aggressor when he was
driven out of Quade just as Israel lost
its status as an aggressor when after 22
years it pulled out 11 it but and I can
give plenty of other examples close to
home but as for the human rights
violations they were horrendous and here
is one of the cases where it really is
important to look at facts before you
make decisions and we know the facts not
secret so yes Saddam Hussein carried out
horrendous human rights violations in
fact he's on trial for him right now but
have a look at the trial Saddam Hussein
is on trial for crimes that he committed
in 1982 right killed is charged with
killing probably accurately killing 150
you're signing the death warrant for 150
or so Shiites who were
involved in an uprising yeah that's a
crime that 1982 happens to be an
important year in u.s. Iraqi relations
this should be headlines in a free press
in my opinion it was a very important
year nineteen eighty-two was the year in
which Ronald Reagan dropped your act
from the list of states supporting
terrorism so the US could starts
providing him with extensive aid
including military including means to
develop biological and chemical weapons
and missiles and weapons of nuclear
weapons he was dropped from Donald room
so the next shortly after went the firm
up the agreement the next charge against
Saddam Hussein one's going to come along
it's been announced is a much more
serious crime the atrocities against the
Kurds in 1997 1988 the all unfold
maskers Halabja they were terrible
molecule 100,000 people us didn't object
in fact the Reagan administration
blocked efforts in Congress even to
protest against it furthermore the
support for Saddam increased and
continued in fact Saddam was given an
extraordinary privilege remarkable and
he was allowed he got away with
attacking a u.s. naval vessel and
killing 37 soldiers of semen in 1987
that's pretty astonishing nobody can get
away with that but we were supporting
the Reagan administration was so
strongly in support of Saddam right
through the worst atrocities they even
let me get away with that I mean in
1980s continued after the end of the war
with Iran after the worst atrocities in
1989 Iraqi nuclear engineers were
invited to the United States to take
part in a conference I was in Portland
Oregon in which they were a trained in
how to develop weapons of mass
destruction mrs. 1989 I furthermore
George Bush number one told us why it
was being done they said we have to
provide aid to Saddam because
it's of our responsibility to help you
as exporter's and because he contributes
to stability in the region in fact that
continued I thinking after the invasion
of Quade after he was driven out of
quake you know Iraq was prickly bombed
in the rubble the US had total control
of the area there was an uprising april
march april nineteen ninety-one shiite
uprising in the south probably would
have overthrown it they were rebelling
iraqi generals a good chance he would
have been overthrown well the bush
administration determined that they
would essentially permit Saddam the
crush it they use the military
helicopters other arm equipment they
don't have to do that that led to a huge
massacre and it was described you know
you can go back and read the New York
Times right after that they said well
you know it's regrettable but there's a
consensus among the US and its allies
meaning Saudi Arabia and Britain there's
a consensus that I'm virtually quoting
that Saddam Hussein offers more hope for
the stability of the region than those
who are trying to overthrow it that's
1991 you know yeah the human rights
violations were horrendous does that
even do with invasion no nothing that's
a Chomsky I'm most regretful that I have
to interrupt the flow of your thought
and you're under a very interesting
presentation unfortunately we are
constrained by military time to end at
this time and but I am happy to say that
the that the occasion the opportunity
for those of you who did not have an
opportunity to ask your question here
may come out in the rotunda I certainly
hope it will there is a reception
immediately to follow but first sir sear
on behalf of the class 2008 I like to
present you with this gift as a small
token of appreciation for speaking with
us site thank you sir very much
you
i usually leave gifts for my
grandchildren open they get a big kick
out of it but i'll change the rules this
time i don't know if you can see it but
