hello and welcome to brasilia Fogo i'm oliveira the president of the association 
Brazilian linguistics for me is a chicken decoration project with committee 
sausage permanent the sausage association 
hi and the latin american rotation of philology and linguistics society 
Argentine of all linguists and what we pass on our part and science 
in particular and in particular the study of languages   and 
of the world's languages   in the face of all the challenges we face in the world 
and then to the association of language schools 
is already bringing everyone together to talk about linguistics and and related by 
all over the world on a platform designed and engineered for 
student researchers to talk about the most varied sports that 
encompass human language let's start this series with sausage from 
name starting today with the name of the man who accepted our proposal 
thanks to braille teacher warwick and also welcomes you today 
here also professor lopes maya here also accepted the challenge of doing with 
that all this was possible thank you very much 
thank you very much miguel bora good afternoon as president international document 
sausages are not very happy to welcome you to the first event 
of braden's series of presentations on important topics in linguistics 
until the next train from us and 3d the local location will be announced at 
teacher clutch where that was the main speaker at our 
congress and and he will talk about I already have 
will our century 
we are very honored to participate with embrace in this series of 
presentations and waiting for the teacher, there are some who provide the first 
lecture he needs no introduction and if he was the first leader of 
leading thinker since the middle of the last century thank you very much and I now turn to 
word professor marcos maya for more presentations professor chomsky 
what's up 
hi good night miguel good night teacher love you you are 
hi and good night everyone who is watching teacher not only what is a 
of the other spectators alive today they that presentation of some pilots the 
people is an activist he not the linguistic singer 
and he reinvented linguistics in the 1950s and played a very important role in 
cognitive revolution is an honor for all of us only to open up a 
abralin series of lages if you are already that agreed to 
answer some questions after the presentation he will speak 
good today will talk about the oracle of dolphins and the message that the oracle leaves 
for us today thank you very much cent in being able to be with you personally 
but we all know what the reasons are 
is the most famous phrase ok the priestess of the oracle of dolphins was so know 
even though it was expanded by socrates to an unstudied life is not worth the 
sorry to be lived and this thought has strength but it does not 
goes far enough and we're the series of how beings 
and also to get to know the world where we 
lives and in addition to human cultures societies have created in all their wealth and 
variety not found are not found in a way more a hint than place 
where to find a meeting is being conducted today the world is not a place 
very happy that moment he plunged into a crisis of severe anemia and that 
will probably lead the world economy to the times of the great depression 
the king ae will kill the incalculable number of people but this is 
just the beginning but we will recover from the crisis at a very cost 
high but there will be no recovery and you have a polar cap regiment 
which is going to cause extreme effects or accelerated pace of global warming and 
sea   level growth will be devastating is from a number of other 
lethal effects that affected the survival of the 
the game of man in today's world the largest bank of the united states in morgan chase 
warns that the survival of the human species is at risk if we continue 
along this path including investments in fossil fuels made by the 
There will also be no recovery from the destruction of the Amazon rainforest that 
an imbalance must come to an end in the not too distant future when the 
forest will hopelessly become desert land the estimate is 
that in about fifty years to five years 2025 the amazon may be the 
out of the lungs the world to the largest gas emitter 
carbon dioxide in sao mateus varzea for brazil and for the whole world we consider 
the essential role that the Amazon plays in the world economy tragically for the 
brazil a un costo a horrible in terms of sight weeks is he is to assault the 
tithe other than the indigenous people having discouraged 
and this is not a problem for the president of brazil when 
military for not following the American military in which the 
Indians many years ago now we are in the middle of two major crises to 
crisis of the invitation of 19 or the coronavirus crisis that is currently is 
consuming all our attention plus a crisis much deeper than 
and puts the survival of the human race at risk in the not too distant future 
and inside this crisis in two ways, countries are alone in the world 
in its reaction is different from almost practically all 
world of your governments are dedicated to amplifying the two crises my 
country saw you the colossus of the north as it is known and the country that long ago 
expected it to become the colossus of the south good and that in some moments arrived 
very close to occupying that role especially the view of the bank 
year year was called the golden decade day of the history of brazil the first 
the millennium of that first decade when Brazil was perhaps the most 
respected in the world hi people now bought the paper more 
regular and ridiculed i don't need to examine what president jair 
bolsonaro is doing and in terms of maximizing the impact of glass your 
partner leonor depressed think which is even more 
and is powerful by the global power that of the united states and even unique dedication 
to dedicate the corporate and governmental priest the mass the harmful effects 
fossil fuels 
which for example the autocad energy being checked 
hi and the reaction of these countries against viruses we really don't even have that husband 
opals of all the details but they are at the level of harm and breaking with the 
world and the united states and the house are confronting 
a coronavirus that way and the plague coming back to the population 
ah and so are unmatched advantages in the united states over 
resources and riches and I buy myth commitment from the 
president trump and has no clarity give has no clarity 
good and the proposals he has for the next year things he put 
in February in February and together with bolsonaro 
and treating the coronavirus as a simple flu and 
and the also systematically cutting funding and incentives 
financial and is related to the whore with health problem in being a problem 
address of the united states and this thanks to the problem of the academy 
the guide requires some metric financial measures and they are also 
a hi cause for the increase 
in the caries video the subsidies related to fossil fuels by 
everybody there hi and this money instead of slacking 
right going out to military issues to protect the united states 
ah and also protect the united states against terrorism and the invasion of 
emigrants and you're being told loud and clear 
and the bones to cover and to cover your message against the 
Americans he's trying he's succeeding with the help of scapegoat 
to ms now he's always ready to target because he's trying to destroy 
the apostles of that organized this and many people cover in africa 
and look at that change is one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world 
and ms has actions so that the advantage terms can survive all this 
plus the famous phrase from bolsonaro speak who cares 
hi and then they come back in which country and played a role 
essential and there in africa also in cuba they 
and then and they made the world available the world 
an unprecedented model sending doctors to everyone there in Europe 
finds itself for rich countries for what are part of the so-called european union 
and most western countries are destroying the environment the environment 
that sustains life and subjecting the people who live there to the problem of 
coronavirus plus a bigger they're also competing 
reception in some some companies are 
competing and the beard 
and the sentence below the intelligence alive death has been a motto in the fight 
corporate 
the beans but then if all these acts and happen laterally they can 
influence the good and maybe bolsonaro center in that case is the 
your doctor's way when the white house 
hi linda just removed the person who was developing the vaccine 
is because I was recommending it to its leaders and bolsonaro can make the 
same thing and in the same way ready it is diminishing the meaning of science 
her importance 
good and all this in the name of the so-called freedom 
and there are four seasons four hours the science media academy and the corporation 
they are all pillars for them to support their ideas 
and the science nor car and is that the trump decreased the value of 
science in federal public policies are disrupting education programs 
research marking a transformation for the government and its effects 
good and who can receive it per year and that yes they see themselves as the biggest 
the target of the attacks parts of the bed and the so 
happiness is going the scientific consensus 
and then the target's father is actually quite 
bigger the other seeing the science of planting the 
health ink and they are ignoring the expert opinion 
and this has been worse than ever 
that's it looks like one and it looks like there are two points in the 
pandemic that has to be considered the united states in brazil the two centers 
and has increased the cycle with respect to 
survival we're not going to let it go and 
let's talk about what we came here to talk about 
let's talk loop calorie tumor and to know yourself don't talk to 
the individual but as a member of the species the 
good and the essential features of all 
and we are unique several ways and the core of each one how to turn off the 
pan that color is the computer the co-creator of the theory of evolution a 
intellectual and moral nature are attributes are very significant 
the biological world and go beyond human capacity 
and the faculty of language is naturally considered the element 
of human capacity to its emergence in the evolutionary register 
what mends the mighty trust adapt to 239 brings the shapes your 
emergence in 
the evolutionary record is certainly considered as an object that stimulates the 
appearance of human capacity the evolutionary record 
and that would be the summary I'm paying for, 
thought which of the progress of the call by the newspaper what happened 
it seems and there was a certain is the structuring of the brain that created the wealth of the city 
the eye language thoughts needed for development 
behavioral changes that are revealed in the records and the 
our spectacular some magnificent ones that have happened since then 
in some of them, it has damaged the survival of men and the rest in 
land which is the main property appeared in all branches the hominids 
many years ago but they considered the operation encoded in the brain that will 
numbers to the repertoire number of expressions and constitute articulation 
human thought that may or may not be analyzed a 
our motor system and samsung sensory and reflects our thoughts more 
deep and and that's what 
and then the remarkable characteristics of 
language learn to scholars sme700m 17th century 18 cm to perceived 
that in first and there closes modern that in some 
moments have some aspects are broken like us some parts of the record 
the human ones especially linguistics may be addressing some scenes 
something like the Galilean revolution to a change 
the careful descriptions of many times the one of much perception for the explanation 
of some principles a step in the 17th century it was very futuristic the sense of 
understanding the world was a greater desire to be surprised by simple symptoms 
why not love an apple fell on the ground and here speed it does it and it is 
us the g1 
and understood it a triangle and its measurements with which it arrives today in general 
what are the main principles behind what happens in the world 
at that time there was a report and among the philosophies the academic 
here on this subject but they often had stories 
mystical with which the Galilean scientific call good morning with properties 
acquired to how sympathetic forms that form the original were explained by the 
science ii xi resemble the games monologue 
of jesus in the attempt 
and mysticism its founders of the scientific revolution will not need 
ignored thinking about the Galilean language and their contemporaries expressed the 
citing their surprise and when they marveled that language allowed 
build from 30 40 sounds a multitude of expressions in although not 
resemble one another but the wow that goes through our mind still reveal all 
the secrets of the mind becomes intelligible to others who cannot 
penetrate the launch and explain everything that we without 
want to understand and all the movements of our soul and this challenge presents 
this present challenge which is called the galilean challenge 
margot usafl we have to know what is one of the greatest rehearsals of the mind 
age and it's language it really transposes millennium 
hi and she transposes 
and general thinking because it includes cultural principles of language 
the guide and gives explanation to the thought 
hi and then it brings important empirical results in conceptual 
and then the empirical victory was limited, but on a conceptual level it was more 
clear how we always managed to capture the joining one part with another to 
understand how language works 
this is so in a totally creative way this is always going to have a load of 
mystery ah but this let's leave these aside 
because structural behaviors entered there despite having been 
recognized until then there was really is clarity until the middle of the century 
play dough it was possible to overcome some barriers that were blocked here 
blocked in fact is the linguistic arts of anthropological structure and 
with that more data was gathered to be considered and then considered 
in the externalization of the language and the code of our brain 
and many discoveries in the mathematical field create created the theory of computation and 
brought the intellectual tool one of the finite elements 
and then they thought about this case of the creative use of language 
and in the end we call it the generativity that comes from these countries 
that's it had its limited role back in the 17th century it was thought that the principles 
were understood I was painted for ideas already 
available on major Sundays 
and thought that the thought they gave understands they were with quickly 
understands understood but not really fully understood and there 
the more if the more you got to pet to investigate more complicated 
stay I saw less clear and in the 17th century people were no longer very satisfied 
with some agreed management knowledge 
the hosted object for example fell faster than the lips were that the 
we were going, for example, when they did experiments with that 
but is it true and not Galilean? 
time the experiments experiment and really 
proved that pronoun could go on in your idea is 
is bringing all this to our money our topic 
I want it was known and believed and language was already a matter of training and 
shelter in broomfield american english stove 
early in the century saying that the idea was very strong 
30 years later in 68 years honey hair but it was one of the most stories 
me until the most sophisticated time they held the stock portfolio clean in 
felt and the zinho that the individual's language for him at some point he 
understood that there were changes they changed this and comprises a certain 
analogy habits and the bars complicate us different 
and it would be silly to believe that there was in the system here the decode was 
the brain and determined the language and he has another there are ten today that 
still follow this principle and not only in linguistics more 
other fronts ok so how to put aside here attention these ideas 
are or are not current and we will go to the 17th century to always know if 
this conflict of hypotheses or less as we call 
and nobody really said what it is but we have a general idea of 
good concept so let's get a key always 
john and tom apple john ate an apple if we remove the object put john 
john with my dad hi and we can put other things 
aside let's put an obvious analogy a jonah sentence is very 
bravo to talk to mine and let's erase object you see john is 
too brave to talk here by analogy 
what it means here john is angry and can't talk to the other and what 
I mean joined with so much anger that nobody will talk to him 
the simple analogy and then you see that this one has already fallen to the ground 
and not interesting questions that appear the more we move more 
when the wall and we find all that when it arrives 
and nobody says what it is there are some challenges but we have a general idea 
is and which is how are we going 
so interpreting is johnny is very difficult is to talk how does the 
so we actually interpret your entire sentence when we start to 
think about generativism and think about the idea that doesn't accept it's on the ground 
as soon as we start to examine them in more depth which is very 
interesting doesn't actually mean that they are not valid even with all 
the inconsistency if they are true they were us 
we go in the 17th century and no problems appear 
immediately afterwards if we take another sentence the man works the man 
who works calmly carefully the fourth his tool she is ambiguous in 
English and what was carefully 
and he working or waiting for the tools 
and if we move the sentence we can remove ambiguity put 
carefully kept at the end of the sentence 
hi and then you have a problem that there is this ambiguity there 
good and because I want to say care again transits in that sentence 
and not exactly on the side that has to be the way we put the 
torture in the sentence and what is it say that we put in 
sentence must be taken care of not necessarily must have put in the 
place where it is expected then we recharge it hinders because we 
changes if looking for there is no linear way example 
structural dependency and this happens with all buildings 
of all languages 
hi and then it gets even more complicated for us to understand 
firstly the computation is complete 
is one more the rejected model that used linear model 
and why then the universal language was measured was chosen at the end and 
others apparently they have shown later that children well 
little ones from the earliest you can have splints i 
to 30 months old for example 
and research that research is ignoring what children hear from 
linear way in which research is and in fact research is looking 
for things that the child does another and doing that 
and with all the buildings of all languages   explosion this is very serious and the 
dilemma that this causes in research is serious as soon as we look at the language in 
17th century perspective the place of independence 
and mainly that linear order is not available for the system 
computationally encoded in the brain and is used to meet the challenge of 
galileo build this meter transmit to others 
what can the doubt so that they can understand thinking but why 
is a training is a habit is an analogy when it is in the mind and any 
of similar ideas that can be used for yourself and it looks like you 
can put these ideas into the hidden properties feature 
and and they don't look like reference from 
language but they seem to contain any kind of relevance to the 
basic nature of the language after searching for many years we find 
what seems to be probably the best answer to these questions the 
language system encoded in the brain the climate the computational operation 
as simple as possible to love full urinary saturation 
is the evolution used took the easy way to that the so-called junino 
and in modern times and it means that the brain uses the most computational system 
simple i will not go into details but it is easy to show there is still a 
unanswered question whether computational change that results in language 
and with basic singer properties and if that operations afonso works 
freely why language expressions are genetically ordered 
it must be because these properties arise from properties that are not the 
language and clearly we see them so I think oil is the system of 
report cannot go to form cultures he is forced to put everything in a way 
linear and externalization of language uses the other mission exit system then 
is subtraction it is not necessary that the visual space offers other options that 
are used and also today calls autoscentral has no 
nothing to do with language and they were there a long time 
and before any modifications in the embellishments language 
which are very want very imaginary if it existed then we conclude that the 
linear order and other surface arrangements does not belong to language 
they belong to some amalgam of language in some other system and not 
has nothing to do with language 
in some followers who knew that when he knows what to expect she wants 
complicity complexity the diversity the ease of language probably 
this ahm some complex this complex process that relates the 
internal system another system that is not related to it can be and the system 
internal 
and what you face corresponds to the Galilean challenge can be a uniform 
totally uneven too and maybe it didn't show up but I think I 
work is converted in that direction and it looks like complexity is 
the device diversity of art of magic especially the functionality 
related to our roads the internal language more or less like the 
your computer the internal part can be fixed but it can be demonstrated 
externally with others to diverse components this could be the first 
genuine expression o characterization of genuine language in the research genius 
language 
and we are everything indicates that we are approaching some similar to that of the 
Galilean revolution in the study of linguistics and the conclusion is strengthened 
if it is a fifth more serious questioning end up going to one for 
they can get to know the fabric in recent literature that are expanded 
in several new directions raising new buildings issues that continue 
unanswered always are the is the this area anxiety is a field still very difficult 
so speaking and know what you just said that is not the demonstration of 
galileo and that is not very different from the fall of bodies so let's see 
again the example that I spoke I carefully the man and worked on 
thick tools and 
and there it is but the situation is more complex 
and sometimes hearing the adverb ignores the structure that was next to it so 
imagine you're listening to me carefully man 
I worked with whoever says care comes before I have a verb 
works or worked well so it's not exactly close to the 
adverbs but it still makes sense 
and it's like computing doesn't know a house but in general 
is are new questions and are partly understood in 
the sound of general conditions is a is the impenetrability fairy that brings the verb 
and the word inaccessible 
and this brings up a new question with her because the impenetrability phase is so 
conditional and what is it so difficult to bring a 
general and genuine question to do that we're going to show 
hi and simple computing language type under independent conditions 
consider it a third factor oh oh oh gee the external data that affects 
as well as getting even the third factor favor ideas 
computational efficiency and can be a natural law outside of language 
and just like others the other nature 
in a tomb of a natural combination of computing with other issues not the 
general computational efficiency it is interesting brings consequences 
interesting for the language and it offers some promise a pleasure a 
more general explanation for college independence skill but there are 
still unanswered questions are coming back 
I'm going back to the oracle and we have an answer to use 
wire and there I have it but it's not that deep 
what's up 
what's up 
what's up 
and there and there 
is one of the problems of speaking on the internet that my puppy wants 
participate goes down goes down we can't 
and there and there 
and there and there 
and then ah so you already have the questions 
and i can't hear you 
and then miguel this one I think he wants 
some that we pass some questions so you can pass it to the staff if 
they want to ask any questions i don't see any questions yet 
today we're just going to announce here that you have any questions we can 
select some and pass to the teacher on the floor says that now the whole 
a look at the live chat and this one you have any questions 
to do for teacher in the chat I'm my name is marco 
good thanks miguel 
and then let me get rid of my dog   excuse me 
the teacher can you hear me is a question for her question here 
about from before yours and the only political election talks is 
is coming we can understand that the new canary in american politics 
could influence causing a change in brazil too 
it is a change in the political system in the united states and it in Brazil is that is 
this and I think it is possible 
and it is possible to recognize that the situation today in brazil in the united states 
and it is always upward placing all presidents in 
conversations is going to bring us nothing nothing happened as it is happening 
today and I'm sorry if I literal 
and he is megalomaniac the psychopathic megalomaniac thought of the pension 
only in it and kill people destroy the planet or that is at that level 
with it the worst on the political scene and the example that I set for you and not 
I know what you're doing very well 
and what is the situation of the world health organization 
and they have to put the blame on someone and she says blame are putting on what 
it's happening in the united states i'm blaming it 
and it seems that for an electorate sector that doesn't like institutions 
internationals think they shouldn't get into national issues 
and this will start the next elections and what will be the consequences 
and Yemen is going through the worst humanitarian crisis in the world 
hi and the government helps poor crop systems 
that's because they receive help they don't know help and that help is being given to me 
nothing because he doesn't want to be helped by it is happening in part in 
latin america and i can't say number for you 
here but the bolsonaro said who cares this is a very outside way 
of sadism common and his tithing is very common 
and we have nothing in the story and no one we've ever seen anyone 
work with your eyes open to destroy your eyes open to destroy 
to the scenario as we have today and he knows that people around us 
also knows more who cares someone who doesn't get that kind of thing 
ah but this is really a naked eye employee 
I'm going back to a normal system and it won't be very good because there are a lot of 
wrong thing with what we call the normal system 
and it is very relative to what you consider used 
and how much the opinions have already turned to the extreme right in this 
last screen see now I understand and he is criticized 
the like saying or because in the revolutionary program let's take a look 
my daughter can't talk about him 
is the great pillar of are universal health to world health 
if you've seen any country with a unique health system 
universal manages to find another who can point out that it has this 
keep the wall and 50 to act there saw provided all Americans the 
teaching and on that occasion 
and instead of bringing the country to a better level compared to other countries not 
maybe it's too revolutionary for him to be the phone to relate to and 
also for Americans can ask question you did not united states 
I go back to what was about 30 pieces of government rodrigo there will be 
different and then it can improve hi and then it is very possible that there is some 
problem but this will pass through Brazil and the whole world because the power 
America 
and they would not in the others if there was no American support he would not be able to 
do what are you doing out there the ok thank you very much teacher now 
we have a question about linguistics and what are your current thoughts 
about and innate knowledge in creating the 
language as there are new discoveries of statistical knowledge and the 
linguistic stimulus is not so much after all there are no results of these 
patients actually speak with her language creation you look at 
truth has no statistics available for example but all very recent 
it's something that we have to be familiar with that we are familiar with 
the community of English and Japanese speakers 
and your look at 9 month old babies more or less 
and his perception capacity starts to change 
and Japanese Japanese babies they ask for some kind of ability with 
discount are exposed to the English language but this does not actually have statistics 
take a look and you look at the data if you have two peaks to talk about if 
English the winner circles with respect to listening 
is the short spectrum the broad inspector 
and it's not statistics on the radio it's numbers it's numbers you get the 
quantity and speaks of quantities but it is not statistical there are other 
statistical results do not 
there is a very deep statistical analysis analyzed about children in the first 
years of life and was made by claudiane 
got involved there at the university than silvana with a computer system 
called being personal who is aline universe consequence 
universal.com.mx and length and speech 
children's day and it consists of doing this small words two 
50 words you can find but they are not more frequent than with 
bigger days you might not find which means that the data that is 
coming to the child they are sparse a lot more space than us 
imagined and then 
and the problem of stimulus poverty 
and it was what we thought was the cause but we don't have patients 
with about it another thing that calm some this rage a straight fury and it's a 
interesting gift has been waiting for 20 years and showed 
what do you take children from eight to nine months and give them 
is a tag along with certification says they are able to interpret 
the probability and they have a barrier a boundary of 
words but they can detect 
there is no high mobility for the next segment to happen and it will not be 
a unit of low ownership of those segments you only one 
word a unit 1 hi and then wow I'm caused one by one 
the mark that what we have here is to believe here the theme of what 
people have learned in the last 60 years is the truth more or less fear movement 
of the 50s the farmer the linguistic theory of 
logical culture and said that the word boundary can 
be detected was going there and that went to the cult by harryti 
hi and he detected it like that but it won't work it won't 
have themes later but it will work with other things 
and they are properties that are needed 
rafaela will be able to be identified that way it was in the end 
investigated in the past someone reggae again was he who invests good 
if you look at english the zap probability of word boundaries 
they saw units but they didn't see words if you have the beginning of a day 
and the principle that the word and it will have a unique hue one 
peak monic donkey and then you will be 
the hunger through the snake 
what is information in the unit information is more important 
and it doesn't really have to be true but for other people already told that 
there are other forms more the artificial production of the speech 
and she has some sympathy for a statistical age test yes but so only 
when there is nothing there of data in fact almost nothing 
ok thank you very much has another linguistic question 
and what do you think if someone is defining it there and in a language like 
unravel the Brazilian did not show the em 
cooperation and do you think it reveals ownership 
the word nothing and if you look at the articles 
of that in a lot of things also cause noise catch a noise 
and the article especially said that this is this is a property of the faculty of 
language and not a particular language and 
was only found in the amazon court not everyone has not everyone uses 
a blindfold 
yes but it is for the dipyrone palace they have the structure they can learn 
Portuguese and there 
hi and what article says is correct or not even if what you said is correct 
for us we were curious 
and it's like that tribe that used to sell on the bus 
and this is like English doesn't take when we see childish elements to save 
to speak it does not mean that they are not part of the ufg 
good thank you thank you one last question french researcher stanislas 
dehaene says that all things are language the similarity is similar 
in terms of parameters of organization of the mind and the agreed the data with that 
his research you could comment on aunty's hypotheses the recombination is general 
not only for language more for learning have a great party 
and it's worth looking at his work carefully and his theory is used in other 
places for example is a crucial problem and 
disturbed the zap for a while 
is how it is and how does everyone every 
cultures and had no evidence that there were 
so much something common all of them but there is some evidence in some way 
how it was never used how do you know 
is a small cultural portion of cultural group has about 100 or 200 
years ago he used an element mentioned but that nobody went back there 
to know if you went you had exposure this chat not all 
cultures are exposed the same things so run 
is can be 
and it may be that the bite in this case I brought to the ubiquity of displacement 
and if you have a range of one element with a word in your common lexicon 
and you see which operations you can have right 
yes it may be that you cannot send two steps back but it is 
possible that darwin the wallace too 
I don't have the key, as the common thing in the language in all of them, music is 
look like intel a universal element 
and asks, do you have some work that says that the core of the music tone they 
involve 
comment operations 
hi people today has morals moral principles team birthday together so it's 
possible hi hi hard to find if you put in 
place it is possible that this operation has appeared 
and in the case of linguistics but then and we don't know anything 
regarding that there is no evidence to leave from here so it's all 
speculation and it's very bad to speculate without evidence is 
a possibility there is a possibility here 
language may have been useful in proliferating it so that everyone uses it is 
a very important reason to believe that the faculty of the 
language today joke 150 thousand years ago we know how 
is that this works within the genome the most distant groups most 
it's more time ago time people in africa when they split up 150 thousand 
years ago maybe this separation happened to me more or less when the language 
language appeared and curtain tip 
is very attracts 
good so now in things we have the language but we can the language when 
this the basic language operation became available it was sold to 
other domains is another possibility is that in a 
form or another of the gringos joined or more 
hi and then onwards or the song or it's very difficult to say see there is no 
empirical difference between what we remember what we speculate we 
speculating this the most we should remember a particle is important 
that the piece was published a text was published by sweet atlantic I want 
found biological evidence 
there have already been 4 volumes is an invitation to 
cognitive intelligence he has an article also one where he speaks the 
our cognitive scientists and does not speak of the evolution of the commission there 
say that for demijohn it's not that it didn't happen but the tool we 
we had to synthesize the evolution of the revolution fails to 
reach the time that we need and that is why maybe you have no evidence 
two thousand years ago it was impossible 
is really a lot of it seems like symbolic behavior maybe there are 
large groups and the other population genetics tools and such a dog they 
he doesn't know much about it either, he has a group of people 
kim really try to research i will ask the interesting question but i work is 
difficult we will be speculating maybe the language languages   or maybe not 
there is life, but we will not find anything 
is what we will count the I think is little 
ok but let me see what we already know something we already know 
as a human because that what humans started to separate not when we go 
the piece appeared Spanish name evidence there is another department before 
have lunch right and have practically no evidence 
biological or a behavior of the symbolic 
and we have simple things like a brand on a stone 
it is but long after the lunch to be developed remember that they are a moment 
revolutionary over 100 thousand years in the afternoon 
and we started to buy material that is more symbolic and for the part of the world 
phone represents I got Paleolithic art and it's 
fabulous opportunity for coconut trees before they are closed in 
france and it's amazing 
and it's much better than any production you have at times when I 
I got there they said that we had not learned anything I will not have 40 
400 years is over again the time of evolution is 
little one there i'll show it just appeared there the language appeared 
with the group have been separating for a long time and then it starts to get amazing 
and men the cognitive chest start to appear 
and it is suggestive is not something that I am manages to be the 
whatever the rg or g-5 because my development is the time of 
tiny development and it seems like not much has happened since that 
moment he has a good window so people don't we have him to 
people have the same way and he the last past there is a lot of work 
important the wind rider a village they ran 
the symptoms often he showed very convincing data i'm the languages 
and make use of click who are the languages   and are most used 
they make intensive use of these in addition to the normal ones for me 
that they borrow elements from other things and not generalization so at 
that looks like the feathers and the connection of the language where so much has happened 
separation in various ways, right and it's not decisive but positive 
think about the wood a little bit there to talk a little about the evolution of the language 
we will not find much, we will find a lot of literature 
but not much but what goes beyond speculation is not because 
it is not the researchers are not exact but it is because it is difficult even the 
messages and he can't get much beyond 
one I got to get and the articulatory system years meet 
without being investigated but before it's not language it's not language 
and it has nothing to do with language the linguistics the linguistics can have a 
touch and you can use in the background you can 
talk any back now we leather and today we just 
and the ending is much like a spoken word and acquiring the 
structural properties of all forms although it has no 
representation or it looks like there's something in there that has this 
gd thing coded in there hi and the manifestation of this is that you 
you can study you can study this evolution for example 
respect about hi day and we will talk about views 
I had a lot of doubts with her when you had to do with language but 
had to do with the motors system whatever it is is the use articulatory system 
has no effect on language in fact it facilitates neo articulatory 
people saying it facilitates none but he is not really he does not do analysis 
phonemic and the other I even pray invitations he 
he also worked very hard and he found that chimpanzees have 
the same auditory system as not and he can hear the same things 
in the system our captain we have a child 
is two years old with more or less listening to speech noises 
and the chimpanzees can hear the same thing that I hear Portuguese for me 
it's noisy chico is also listening to the noise 
and the baby also has the same problem he actually has a worse problem 
when he became Portuguese I have at least a vague language I have 
an idea of   what a language can have but if you are going to drink noise you can too and 
the baby knows nothing no language for it noise too 
hi here is the way mommy talks to baby in a loving way 
and ready maybe the privilege of a more privileged class 
and still do not hear the words of 
mother and has not done in the chimpanzee 
for example shield pleasure and discuss the invented language where 
it to be and the possibilities it brings 
what we do experiments black pieces do not need their own language 
you think you're hearing words but you're identifying it with a 
word after you hear something and manage to make this purple of the 
otherwise it's just noise is you think of a structure inside because you 
it has a base but the baby doesn't have it all has to be built 
very deeply very good so we could show there 
that somehow how is it internally language does saw how it is 
that we can stay the thought and so that it can be penalized 
and then we could demonstrate it and this is uniform and this would be a 
fantastic discovery 
and this was really is thought of by ama i'm by the grammar and the tradition of 
grammar is also good, but I think we are 
walking in that direction 
oh but it looks like we're getting there 
oh ok thanks a lot you would have time for one last question now a lot 
thank you and you mentioned it in your class today 
the third factor concept the 2005 article anthem you had comes 
set the first to characters as we say when like everything third as the 
contact computing capacity to people where involvement of that 
development of this third computational processing and a 
proposal that the processing itself could be seen as the third factor 
and as you see for example symmetry and find locality 
location as candidates and location is an economic factor 
look for minimum for every place in the language we have an example of this 
and the still difficult computational principle of system efficiency 
computational of the 3rd and I gave an example feel 
computational as an example but look this is a principle with the objective with 
someone must have discovery is not specifically with respect to 
linguistic and it's not specifically about the 
language is but speaking specifically of it 
eog're in any part of development is one of the natural laws 
and even an already destroyed mind can develop systems I don't know 
a lot about brain to tell you about it one more day science is going to find out 
hi and the wait must be in the minimum state for here the language is 
develop but that is the property of the third pastor 
in relation to processing processing is very much linked to acquisition of 
language definition 
and the baby who is acquiring the process language, this noise 
find because about that processing 
and it will be what we call the love cake at the heart of this research on 
language acquisition but I think an interesting relationship so let's take 
take a look at this example and the second element that I didn't mention 
is one of the consequences of being a nerd this is the transportation of this ambiguity 
why there was transportation 
i asked the type that you ate what do we have to stop and try 
any object of eating then gets complicated in an attention 
and what we didn't say you ate what 
it's because we have to do this transportation 
how does a spanish college and that's a problem and we consider it a 
problem i consider it a problem i think the clothes me too this brings a 
strange question 
I made compositions here so they are obvious 
but because these pictures were hi hi 
transport is another hypothesis is the simplest form of transport 
this is called a mascot is an internal green 
the external uber is much more complicated and the transport still leaves the copy 
automatic so when it currently generates and it generates you ate what 
and why don't you say this is because of the principle of economics 
and it's much more complex than that is koala everywhere what that you just 
speak in a way is because you need the coast 
computational neuro for draw 
well then you have one and you don't want to do more than that and this one has 
consequence in the communication account and say sorry peace the communication something 
more complex and people working on programs 
specific talk about it they have a problem is faithful to what you have to 
use in the word holes of the words right words in this is difficult to use the 
language 
and it's optimized it's great but outsourcing 
and it depends on the system that it is bad for communication there are a lot of them 
example cover is the ambiguity of the structure can bring a problem with the 
the rule versions don't all happen like that right there 
and you have small islands 
and there it seems simple but it requires 
paraphrase in English you take English paraphrase delivery to Portuguese 
and how many mechanics do you need to fix a car you talk like that in 
English the person has to take this phrase to destroy it and recreate it in their language 
to interpret bullet ah and why does language happen 
she doesn't care about communication and language design and the principle of 
language he she has an almost ready computational competence ah but it is 
how evolution works and how the brain works and can be and it 
disrupt communication five bad 
and additionally what is said that language is a 
instrument of thought but modern theories say it is an instrument 
of course with other side adjustments but it has the 
influences she has to be superior smo 
hi and the poor conception of Darwinism and if you see it is communication 
if you ask how does it work where is it where are you hiding you 
will not understand the opel else gerson you spend are 
means of communication or form but fundamentally the structure of the language 
it doesn't care for complications is the evolution of the scheme the language must 
be returned to the opinion of another type of communication 
and it is very difficult to believe is not radically different from everything that 
we already imagined it but we have no reason to believe it because 
although the language is a useful complication, there is no indication that it has the 
derived from other forms of communication previously used by others 
or asphalt type of communication and bacteria for example 
and it has nothing to do with human language 
thank you it's been almost 90 minutes and we pass 
more we could double this time here listening to you talk but I think it's on 
it's time for us to like we would like to thank you very much for your 
wisdom for your analysis for everything you shared with us today this beautiful 
conversation about the message of the delphic oracle 
thank you very much and it was a very good hotel 
do that thank you so much for your presence miguel wants to say something
