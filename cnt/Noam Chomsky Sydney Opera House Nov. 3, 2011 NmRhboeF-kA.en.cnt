tonight at the University of Sydney
professor Noam Chomsky will be awarded
Australia's only International Prize for
Peace last night Noam Chomsky delivered
the City of Sydney Peace Prize lecture
in the Sydney Town Hall now mom Chomsky
as you know has been leading at least
three very busy distinguished lives
linguist philosopher and political
activist a great number of questions
were submitted to the Opera House for
this session allay fell into about a
broadly a dozen categories and I'm going
to put a question to professor Chomsky
in each category that will attempt to
reflect the thrust the main thrust of
your interests and we will also try and
take some questions from the floor later
in the interests of free speech now Noam
Chomsky's institute professor and
emeritus professor in the Department of
linguistics and philosophy at MIT among
other things that means that he can
supervise phd's in any faculty hailed
even by his critics as arguably the most
important intellectual alive he ranks
with marks Shakespeare and the Bible as
one of the 10 most quoted sources in the
humanities in addition to his
significant work in linguistics and
philosophy though he is celebrated for
his unfailing moral courage and the
inspiration and oxygen he has given
globally to the cause of peace with
justice please welcome the 2011
recipient of the Sydney Peace Prize Noam
Chomsky
welcome to australian owned glad to be
here in your lecture last night you
essentially talked about an integral
part of what constitutes a civilized
human being you said one of the great
moral and universal responsibilities is
to address injustice and the grievances
that are at the heart of much violence
and in particular to cease to be
complicit on crimes for which we share
responsibility and you also reminded us
that our wealth in no small measure
derives from the tragedy of others that
we support dictators when it suits us
and happily set aside the rule of law
when we've had a change of heart my
question is this how can we reconcile
what you're advocating with the three
most frequently used words to engender
unquestionable public legitimacy the
national interest indeed given that so
many of our problems are global how are
they to be tackled when we are each
protecting our national interests that's
an interesting term national interest of
course it's the core notion of academic
international relations theory so-called
realist international theory
international relations theories based
on the concept that states pursue their
national interest that's always seemed
to me that the concept is very far from
realistic in fact had a touch of
mysticism about it it assumes that
there's a common national interest
shared by everyone in the country so the
CEO of General Electric and the janitor
who cleans the floor have the same
interest well actually they have very
different interests often sharply
conflicting interests it turns out that
the interest of the CEO is what ends up
being the national interest not the
janitor so it's it's a constant
that relates to elite conceptions of
what's in their interest and if you look
closely that's the way it's actually
used well there are some shared
interests of course like not being
destroyed by say destruction destruction
of the environment or by nuclear war
well what about those interests how do
we protect them suppose for example it
was determined that the Australian
national interest in this sense that
could be advanced by enslaving the
population of sub-saharan Africa and
sending them to work under miserable
conditions in mines owned by Australian
companies I suppose that that increased
the wealth of Australia and hence its
national interest should we should you
therefore be in favor of it well I think
if we took a vote among people of
Australia a very few would be in favor
of it and I should say that this is not
really a hypothetical example so after
the Second World War when the United
States was in a position of just
overwhelming power I won't go into the
details but there's nothing like it in
history and planners knew it and they
made detailed sophisticated plans to
organize the world so that it would
serve the what they took to be the
American national interest and they
assigned every region of the world it's
what they called its function so for
example the function of Southeast Asia
was to provide resources and raw
materials for the former colonial powers
so that they could then reconstruct
which was in the American national
interest and be allies and purchase the
US manufacturing surplus which is
enormous at the time and so on well as
they went around the world this was
incidentally George Kennan and his
policy planning staff at the State
Department when they got to Africa they
decided that the United States is not
basically and interested in Africa but
we are interested in the reconstruction
of Europe so we will hand over Africa to
the Europeans to exploit term they used
handed over the Europeans to exploit us
to help in their reconstruction well
that these are the Liberal Democrats
we're talking about that George Kennan
himself was considered so dovish he was
soon thrown out of the State Department
considered too soft-hearted for this
harsh world well do we accept that
thinking back is it correct what
Americans then even have said that it's
a right to hand over Africa to Europe to
exploit for its reconstruction not many
would accept that I hope certainly not
now and those are real issues if it
turns out to be in the so-called mostly
mythical national interest to exploit to
harm and destroy others is that a
conflict I mean are we in a conflict
about whether to accept it or not I
don't really think so don't know I'm the
election of Obama engendered a lot of
Hope in the US and internationally he
was awarded the nobel peace prize the
rainbow style execution of Osama bin
Laden under a Democrat present came as a
disappointment and surprise at least to
some point animo Bay hasn't been shut
down has the post 9-11 neo conservative
agenda been more successful more
entrenched and pervasive than you
anticipated I frankly did not share the
hopefulness when Obama was elected I
thought it was mostly illusion in fact
I've wrote about it even before the
primaries just basing myself on his
record his webpage and so on so this is
not entirely afterthoughts nevertheless
it was worse than I expect
so I did not expect things like in many
ways it's worse than bushes programs and
that's been pointed out by conservative
military analyst so for example it takes
a Guantanamo Bay wishes program was to
his way of dealing with suspects and let
me stress suspects there used to be a
principal in anglo-american legal
tradition that people are innocent until
proven guilty in a court of law so the
term suspect is correct the bush
approached the suspects was to kidnap
them send them to a Bagram or Guantanamo
essentially torture chambers and keep
them there without charges indefinitely
that's pretty awful why incidentally
they send them to Guantanamo is rather
than to say Kansas has nothing to do
with security it's ridiculous it's
because they anticipated that Guantanamo
would be regarded by the courts as
outside of the applicant applicability
of American laws actually the Supreme
Court even the conservative Supreme
Court disappointed them on that and did
rule that they have habeas corpus rights
and so on limited rights well that was
the bush program kidnap suspects not of
whether you know anything about it or
not sending the torture chambers and
then maybe have military trials which
are no trials at all Obama's expanded
that he does the same things but it's
expanded now the program is to
assassinate suspects so there are
several places in the world quite a few
by now in which people like us can be
walking around the streets of wondering
whether a minute from now there's going
to be a massive explosion directed by
someone halfway across the world
a drone attack which is aimed at killing
a suspect and whoever else happens to be
around so called collateral damage maybe
us that's the Obama global assassination
program and just in the last few weeks
it's been extended a little beyond and
for the first time got a little bit of
criticism for this it was extended to
purposeful assassination of American
citizens the rocky case and another
American citizen who happened to be
collateral damage well that's a little
bit of an extension there's an elite
assumption that American citizens are
human beings and have certain rights
others are what are sometimes called on
people term of the British diplomatic
historian mark Curtis and his
discussions of the crimes of the British
Empire so their people and unpeopled and
the non citizens are unpeopled so it's
okay to assassinate them if they're such
good but people it's a little expanding
it beyond so a little criticism about
that and in many other ways I go through
the details Obama has stretched
violation of civil liberties and also
expanded war to an extent beyond what I
expected in fact in Afghanistan for
example the US and its allies like
Australia now have forces well beyond
the peak of Soviet forces during their
occupation of Afghanistan and in fact
last year was the most violent year in
Afghanistan since for the firs ince 2001
it's not a pretty picture that in many
ways I think he's a go further details
has gone beyond at least what I expected
in pursuing pretty much the same agendas
with it's not the whole story I mean
there have been a few steps that I think
are positive and better than would have
taken place under say a McCain
administration like he appointed quite a
good secretary of labor and
some of the labor laws were beginning to
be implemented a little bit there a few
other things but in general the picture
is not pretty and I think the strongest
thing he has going for him and what may
in fact win the election is just that
the opposition is I practically off the
planet you know have you been following
us there's nothing like it in the
history of parliamentary democracy that
I can think of and maybe for that reason
he'll be reelected with maybe parts of
his base voting for him he's actually
lost a large part of the base that
enthusiastically worked for him and not
just voted but organized and so on and
are terribly disillusioned and with
justice we turn to Israel and Palestine
and of course there are many issues that
that we could take up but let's look at
prospects you've said that under Obama
the Palestinians will be offered fried
chicken nothing more what do you mean by
that that phrase fried chicken is
actually not mine it comes from the
Netanyahu administration in 1996 shamone
Paris was prime minister and he was then
replaced by Benjamin Netanyahu in a vote
in 1996 in Paris's last press conference
he was asked will there ever be a
Palestinian state he said they'll never
be a Palestinian state will never permit
it actually that wasn't well reported
for an interesting reason he was
actually giving a press conference to a
group of American correspondence
Newsweek and others but there were some
Israeli correspondence there too and you
read about it in the Israeli press the
neighbor aggressives no translations at
that time the reason it wasn't in the
American press is that in the middle of
Paris's press conference news came
through that a verdict was coming in the
oj simpson trial that's all the American
report
scampered out of the room to get the
important news and the Paris could make
these comments to a small number of
Israeli reporters well that was the
Paris administration then Netanyahu came
in this was his first term he's now in
the second term and his his information
minister was asked what what did they
think about whether there could be a
Palestinian state and he answered well
he said our plan is to leave a few
fragments of the West Bank in
Palestinian hands we're not interested
in them we don't bother with the
population and if they want to call it a
state we don't mind where they can call
it fried chicken that's their conception
of what a state would leave and that
that's essentially the conception that
Obama has adopted I for 35 years the
United States has almost unilaterally
barred a diplomatic negotiated
settlement of the israel-palestine
conflict along lines that are well known
and in fact accepted by virtually the
entire world it's an overwhelming
international consensus the basic form
of it is a two-state settlement on the
internationally recognized border the
pre June 67 border and then his phrase
from the formal US position in the early
70s when the US was still part of the
world on this with minor and mutual
modifications to cease fire lines of
straighten it and so on so that's the
international consensus than other
provisions for other issues the first
that was vetoed by the United States at
the Security Council in 1976 and I won't
run through the record but it stays
about the same Obama has pushed it even
further for example his last veto last
februari did get some international
attention because he was actually
vetoing a Security Council resolution
that called for the implement
of official US policy namely a barring
settlement advancement which is of
course illegal everyone agrees to that
even the State of Israel that was pretty
extreme so it got some notice and in
general Obama has taken a position in
many ways harsher and more extreme than
a previous American presidents which is
saying something now if you think about
the current situation and indeed the
role of Australia there's a sort of a
standard conventional view that the
United States has been a kind of an
honest broker desperately trying to
bring together two recalcitrant
opponents Israel and Palestinians
Palestinians being the guilty ones most
of the time and trying to reach a
settlement it's just totally untrue it's
been if there were meaningful
negotiations proceeding they would be
organized by some neutral party picket
as you wish it may be Brazil respected
state that's fairly neutral and on one
side would be the United States in
Israel on the other side would be the
rest of the world almost without
exception well the United States and its
allies don't want honest negotiations
they want negotiations which meet a
variety of crucial preconditions now
again the conventional view is the
Palestinians are asking for
preconditions and Israel wants just
negotiations and of course the u.s. is
neutral if you look at it closely it's
the US and Israel who are imposing
strict preconditions and important ones
the one is that it has to be run by the
United States well yeah that's run by an
extreme extremist rejectionist state
which has been blocking a settlement for
35 years so that's precondition won the
second precondition is that Israel must
have the right to continue expanding
settlements
that's a precondition and it's a
precondition again I stress it's not in
dispute that the settlements themselves
are illegal and certainly expansion of
them is multiplied so expansion in
what's called Jerusalem vastly expanded
region annex by Israel that's doubly
illegal today's announcements for
example it's doubly illegal because it's
also in violation of explicit Security
Council the demands that nothing be done
to change the status of Jerusalem goes
back to nineteen sixty eight in fact the
US which at that time was part of the
world voted with thee everyone unanimous
vote so it's doubly illegal but that's a
precondition furthermore Israel has made
it clear you can read it in today's
papers that the expansion is proceeding
in regions which will be annexed to
Israel illegally of course lots of
further precondition they're already
establishing the borders officially at
which they're going to illegally annex
that's another precondition and under
those conditions preconditions everyone
who has a gray cell functioning and
certainly the Palestinians can see that
nothing will happen negotiations of this
kind can go on indefinitely while Israel
with us port diplomatic military
economic support that simply takes over
what's left of the what is they don't
want in the West Bank and drive but the
population sort of rot in these
fragments and it'll be a kind of fried
chicken if they want to call it a state
okay also the US and Israel insist that
it be separated from Gaza that's been us
Israeli policy since the early 90s in
explicit violation of the Oslo
agreements which insists that you guys
are in the west bank or a single
territorial entity but Israel in the
United States have been trying hard to
separate them since the early 90s an
interesting story and what time to go
into it here but you should know about
it and the reasons are pretty obvious
that means if any fragments are left the
Palestinians in the West Bank they'll be
completely imprisoned with no access to
the outside world they'll be imprisoned
between these regions are next Israel in
the West Bank Israel and the Jordanian
dictatorship Gaza would be the only
access to the outsides of course has to
be separated those are the preconditions
and you can understand why you can ask
whether the Palestinian Authority made a
wise or an unwise tactical move and
trying to approach the United Nations to
get around this but it's perfectly
understandable that they would seek some
way to get around farcical negotiations
of this kind with their obvious
consequences no I'm have a drink because
I'd like to move on to talking about
money next money money okay getting crap
well seems that the simple narrative
that's better that's has been that it
that it's in all our interests that the
rich get richer because that's how they
create more jobs for the rest of us it's
the Occupy Wall Street movement a sign
that there's a a widespread shift in
that perception where do you think the
movement will go what effect what impact
do you think it'll have well first of
all we should ask about this perception
that is the perception of the media the
corporate boardrooms the editorial
boards a lead opinion established a lead
opinion certainly not the general
population that's certainly not the view
of the general population I'm the United
States a very heavily polled society for
good reasons
it's business run society business wants
to keep its finger on the public pulse
that's how you know how to run
propaganda advertising so on so we know
a lot about a public opinion in the
United States and the careful polls
worth looking at not all of them but a
lot of them are the population
overwhelmingly disagrees with this and
has for a long time so right now for
example the population overwhelmingly
thinks that first of all that the
deficit is not the serious problems
minor when the joblessness is but if you
pay attention to the deficit the way to
deal with it is higher taxes on the
wealthy and preserving social benefits
the decision of the right part
bipartisan Commission is probably going
to be the opposite but that's part of
the huge gap between public opinion and
policy which is lies at the basis of the
anger and frustration that's just
sweeping over the country so first of
all that's not the public perception
secondly the public is correct that's
not the way jobs come and we see it
right in front of us at this minute I
mean corporate profits are reaching
records that they don't know what to do
with their money are they creating jobs
no they're not creating jobs they made
us maybe the creating jobs in northern
Mexico or in China where you can labor
cheap can be exploited and people can be
treated brutally but they're not doing
in the United States in fact it's worth
noticing if you read the business press
carefully you'll notice that there are
signs that invest corporate investment
might come back to the United States the
reason is that working conditions and
wages in the southern states like say
Mississippi are becoming so rotten that
they can actually maybe begin to compete
with Foxconn kind of prison camps in
China where people work under horrendous
conditions so maybe jobs will come back
that's the way putting money in the
pockets of the rich might create
jobs furthermore just to make it clear
that this is not just a temporary
phenomenon there was a period not that
long ago a very extensive economic
growth in the United States in fact much
of the world 50s and 60s when it was
still basically under sort of new deal
style Social Democratic structures that
was the period of the greatest growth in
American history and the taxes on the
rich were far higher than they are now
but there was economic growth for many
reasons large part of it the state
intervention but it was it was real it
was extensive if you're a businessman
who wants to invest you might invest if
there's demand but you don't invest
because you have money in your pocket I
mean everyone knows that this is just a
elite myth which has been concocted
which the population has never accepted
rightly and the Occupy movement yes it's
expressing it but I don't really think
it's a shift the shift is that a public
opinion is finally reaching some having
some kind of an expression and organized
activity well how far can this go it's
an important question it's a in my view
and extremely important movement it's
the first large-scale active response to
30 years of what's called neoliberal
globalization which have been a disaster
for just almost everywhere where these
concept been applied the United States
as well so worse disaster in you know
Egypt or Mexico but it's a disaster in
the United States two people are angry
about it upset about it they haven't had
a voice in the political system or
certainly not in the media and maybe a
few marginal people but now there's a
active engaged popular movement that's
beginning to express those concerns and
might go on we'll see it'll obviously
meet a strong backlash of repression
that's predictable if it can withstand
it and overcome it could make it could
be of historic significance we mentioned
growth and that's another term that has
a terrific ring to it I mean what could
be bad about growth we don't challenge
the notion that that growth is good but
are we breeding and consuming our way to
extinction and what's it going to take
for us to recalibrate our expectations
in a fine art world well first of all
again we should be careful to think
about consumerism and the consumption
culture that's talk to a large extent
artificially created and not my opinion
you go back to the say a century to the
origins of the public relations industry
including the advertising industry it's
an interesting history back around a
century ago in the freest countries in
the world England in the United States
there was a recognition conscious
articulated recognition on a leak sector
that enough freedom has been won by
popular struggle so that people can't be
controlled by force anymore so that the
other ways to control them and the other
way to control them is control of
attitudes and opinions that's when you
get the call for manufacture of consent
on the part of progressive intellectuals
wilsonian Roosevelt progressives and so
on we have to have manufacture of
consent but we also have to have
creation of once people have to be
driven to the more superficial things of
life like fashionable consumption
actually I'm quoting from the business
press because that way we can control
people if we can fabricate once it's the
term used by the great political
economist Thorstein Veblen
stood this wrote about it if we can
fabricate once create once we can trap
people we can trap people into
consumerism debt and so on that's very
interesting the way that was done is
there was time I could go into it to a
large extent we live in a culture which
in a society in which enormous resources
are devoted to fabricating once I mean
if you take a look at presume it's the
same here as in the United States if you
look at a television directed to infants
two-year-olds it's already trying to
create a culture of demand demand that
goods in fact there's now an academic
discipline part of applied psychology
which is concerned with nagging
literally the reason is the advertising
industry recognized a couple of decades
ago that there's a big part of the
population that doesn't have any money
so they can't buy so we got to do
something to make them buy and the way
they can its children and the way they
can buy is by nagging their parents so
to have that video cam whatever it is
and and so the advertising aimed at
children television and so on is devises
very various types of nagging that can
be used for different kinds of purchases
well the point is the idea is to trap
infants children into a culture of
fabricated wants so they can then be
trapped into a consumer culture and then
they can be effectively controlled along
with manufacturing of opinions all very
conscious incidentally there's some
quite good studies of this if you're
interested one very good book by a
Canadian law professor Joel bacon has
just come out forget what school it's
something about stealing childhood or
something like that it's a very
concerted effort but quite apart from
that suppose we are to some extent
trapped in it how do we react to the
fact that of course as you say it's a
finite world finite resources we're
going to hit limits well there's two
ways one is the way of the lemmings we
just march happily toward the cliff and
then when it turns out as a cliff we go
over and we're finished that's one way
to react and that's what the business
world is driving us to for the purposes
of short-term profit but they get a full
off too they'll fall off too but you
don't think about that if you're a court
literally so for example in the United
States quite openly the Chamber of
Commerce in the main business lobby
American Petroleum Institute and others
are very openly say it organizing
propaganda efforts to convince people
that global warming is a liberal myth
and it's affected popular opinion you
can see the poles reacting as the
campaign continues now the people who
are running this campaign as individuals
probably share your attitudes and maybe
they're members of the Sierra Club and
they contribute to you know
environmental programs but in the
capacity of a CEO of a corporation you
have a duty that you must perform if you
don't perform it you're out and someone
else is in this is an institutional
property much harder to deal with the
property is you have to maximize
short-term profit and market share in
fact that's a legal requirement at anglo
american law if you don't do that you're
displaced somebody else comes in so
there's an institutional imperative to
destroy the planet to march off the
cliff that's a serious problem it's a
traces back to well known in
efficiencies of market systems that you
can you know you're probably learn about
your first economics course they ignore
externalities technically and that's a
built in institutional property and it
does lead to the leaders of the lemmings
knowing that they're going to fall off
the cliff tube
but we don't have to be lemmings I mean
we can deal with these problems
ostensibly consuming more of the world's
resources is the advertising industry's
image of happiness but it doesn't have
to be ours and I think any sensible
person knows that it isn't it makes me
think we're not coming across as being
very smart here but I do want to get on
to the brain but I don't before before
we do that can we talk about WikiLeaks
for a moment Julian Assange has lost his
extradition appeal recently our prime
minister dismissed him on public
broadcaster as just anarchic the
implication is that all sensible people
know anarchism is ridiculous and
irresponsible common sense right depends
which mean by anarchism if you beat by
anarchism the media image which goes
back to the late 19th century anarchism
just means people running wild breaking
windows and so on okay that's and that
conception of anarchism I would agree
but there's another conception which is
the actual conception which is the core
of the of traditional anarchist thought
and activism goes back to the
Enlightenment in fact literally it comes
pretty much out of the origins of
classical liberalism which one great
anarchist thinker rudolf rocker narco
syndicalist an analyst argued and i
think with some plausibility that
classical liberalism which grew out of
enlightenment ideals and incidentally is
not Riley different when you actually
read Adam Smith from the imagery that's
concocted but the classical liberal
ideas as he put it ran aground on the
reefs of capitalism it was Bard it was
blocked by capitalism couldn't survive
capitalism and he argues that
his particular strain of anarchism
anarcho-syndicalism was the natural
outgrowth of classical liberalism in a
age we have to overcome the barrier is
introduced by the rise of capitalism
later corporate capitalism and I think
there's some sense to that the core of
the anarchist tradition which again has
enlightenment roots is to ask us to
raise questions about authority
hierarchy and domination and to point
out that they are not self-justifying
whatever structure they are you know
master-slave patriarchal husband
obedient wife imperial power dominated
the world whatever the structure of
authority is it is not self-justifying
and it should be challenged and if it
cannot justify itself it should be
dismantled that's the core principle of
anarchism in that sense I think everyone
should be an anarchist and if you look
at the
notice I say if it could not be
justified I think there are cases where
a justification can be given so just
take a personal example I once only once
thankfully slapped my little daughter on
her hand she didn't like it you can ask
her now what she thinks about it she's
growing up now she slaps my hand but the
the occasion was when she was about
three years old and we had an electric
stove and as you know the grills or
whatever they're called they stay hot
after they turn black and she was
reaching to put her hand on the stove so
I grabbed her hand and slapped it one an
only time I think that was you can give
a justification for that but it takes
effort to justify it was an act of
authority of course you have to be work
pretty hard to justify structures of
authority and domination usually they're
not self justified and as moral
consciousness expands which I think it
does over time there have been repeated
challenges to these structures in our
own lifetimes in fact and I think their
moves in the right direction and that's
the basic anarchist conception it leads
on to a conception of social order in
which voluntary free association
creative work under one's own control
and so on assume major proportions and
revise the nature of the society
actually these questions are coming up
in the Occupy movements for long-range
commitments and I think that's good
that's the way the social moral
evolution should go I don't think Julie
is here but she might listen to the
podcast
moving on to media free speech and
democracy no move it's probably fair to
say that there's probably no support
among media organizations for more
regulation so you're a great advocate of
free speech you've also written about
media bias but get given the critical
role of media in a democracy why
shouldn't the general news and current a
comment media be subjected to the same
requirement as public broadcaster's to
provide balance so if a public
broadcaster is lined up in a spectrum of
other media and many pumping out redneck
propaganda and where's the level playing
field and isn't this an example of where
freedoms in fact lead to a lack of
diversity and indeed undermine
democratic principles and in the end
isn't it in fact money that's doing the
talking money is of course doing the
talking that's inherent and I was what
is just talking about for example
fabrication of a consumer culture but
manufacturing consent that's money
talking no secret about it as for
balance in public media I can't comment
in Australia but thought about the
United States or there's there is kind
of balance in the public media they're
different than say fox news on the other
hand the balance is of a very specific
kind which is actually taught in
journalism schools so if you go to one
of the better journalism schools in the
United States you're taught a concept of
objectivity how you can be an objective
reporter you're an objective reporter if
you and an honest reporter if you report
accurately what's going on the phrases
inside the beltway meaning inside
Washington circles if you report that
accurately you say the Democrats
this the Republicans say that and so on
that's balanced it happens if you look
that that balance excludes the opinions
and often the overwhelming opinions of
those are large majority of the public I
gave an example and it's not the only
one by any means it's a an enormous gap
between public opinion and public policy
and an objective reporter and the
balance in the public media is to
present the views of elite sectors
accurately again no Democrats say this
Republican say that if the large
majority of the population is against at
all that would be subjective biased and
so on if you presented it so I think
there are questions to raise about the
notion balance which is not but turn to
your actual question it's certainly true
that money is going to talk personally
I'd be against efforts to regulate that
I don't know who we're with the
regulation be coming from well be coming
from state power but I don't I think you
should be very cautious about assigning
the state the power to determine that
what said and what isn't said I think we
have to go after the core problem which
is the fact that money is talking the
fact that there's such a disparity of
wealth and power that a democratic
system simply can't function properly
and that shows up at every point from
for example take say that the United
States in the last 30 years has become
rather extreme in this respect but it's
an extreme version of something that
exists generally so for example now in
the nuts the last roughly 30 years in
the United States the young Reagan
Thatcher neoliberal period elections
increasingly are simply bought literally
you can predict the outcome of an
election quite well by just looking at
the amount of campaign spending and you
can predict the policies that are
soon by asking about where that campaign
spending comes from so it should
surprise no one that Obama despite his
nice talk is essentially a pursuing the
policies of a small financial elite you
know that's where its funding came from
to come from in the next election
actually this goes back very far there's
good studies of it by fine political
economists but it's been very sharply
exaggeratedly this neoliberal structures
not just in the United States everywhere
by now it's reached the point where even
in Congress the old traditions of
parliamentary functioning have been
pretty much dissolved so it used to be
the case that somewhat in Congress that
would get a position of influence say
chair of a committee on the basis of
seniority and performance a lot of
questions about that but at least that
was the idea that's been pretty much
thrown to the winds if you want a
committee chair at this point you have
to buy it from the party you have to put
money in the party coffers then maybe
you'll get the chair now that simply
drives members of Congress into the
pockets of the corporate sector by now
mostly the financial sector and further
erodes democracy and what you described
in the media is part of that
incidentally it holds of not just the
media the I mean I i do right about the
media but personally I don't think it's
very different from the general
intellectual community if you look at
the elite media you know the opinion
that sometimes called the agenda-setting
media the ones that provide the
framework the smaller newspapers adhere
to New York Times CBS News and so on
those I don't think there's much
different difference between their
conceptions and their boundaries and
those that you find in and say the
academic world they share the same
general academic culture it's it's
easier to study the media than to study
scholarship
because it's just easier to carry out
the careful analyses and so on and so
forth but I've done a lot on this this
I've written a lot about if you're
interested but I don't think is very
different and it all reflects reflects
to a substantial extent the actual
distribution of power and society that's
is an observation that's considered
radical but as old as Adam Smith I mean
Adam Smith was not the caricature that
you read about in elementary school
Smith for example recognized that in
England the England of his day the
people who basically owned the society
the merchants manufacturers he said they
are the principal architects of
government policy and they design policy
so that their own interests are very
well served however Grievous the impact
on others including the people of
England well you know since is wealth of
nations 1770s and that's basically
correct now it's not emergence and
manufacturers it's a multinational
corporations investment firms and so on
but the same principle holds and it
holds an increasingly in an exaggerated
form under the impact of neoliberal
ideology to it almost grotesque form
well that's these are real problems or
deep social problems and I think we have
to go after those rather than calling on
state efforts to regulate speech and
publication we better talk about the
brain known before we run out of time so
what I'd like to know is why the study
of how we acquire language was important
to you and what what is it revealed to
us in a broad sense about how the mind
works well you don't traditionally the
capacity for language has been
understood to be almost a defined
property of the human species if you go
back and say to the saitek cartesian
philosophy 17th century dominant
philosophy that out of which grew the
Enlightenment and so on for Descartes it
literally was the defining property
remember for Descartes it was critical
to distinguish creatures with Minds mind
soul or minds from those who didn't have
them the ones who didn't have souls and
minds where machines was the mechanical
philosophy that was the basis for early
modern science they were machines those
with souls and minds were human well how
did it how would you determine whether
some creature has a mind the proposals
that come from Descartes and his
followers were by testing their language
abilities you ask that do they have this
fundamental a creative capacity that
humans have and that they exhibit in
their normal use of language what's the
creative capacity I think they captured
the essence of it pretty accurately it's
the ability which all humans share and
know according to them though animal or
machine machine shares to create and
produce freely new expressions which are
appropriate to situations but not caused
by situations they're not the result of
stimuli coming from the outside or for
that matter even internal stimuli there
as a big difference between being caused
and being appropriate appropriate to
crucial difference hard one to capture
but we recognize it so there and the
this innovative behavior has no limits
it can go on indefinitely in fact most
linguistic performances new sentences
maybe never produced in the history of
the world
your own experience at least and they're
also intelligible to others they who
recognize you I could have expressed
that thought in that way if it had come
to mind well that capacity sort of a
creative aspect of language use it was
regarded and I think plausibly as a kind
of a core component of human cognition
human morality moral judgment and in
fact a human activity this was connected
especially in the early days of
classical liberalism people like Smith
von Humboldt than others this was
connected with the belief that the
humans basically have a need of
fundamental need to carry out creative
work under their own control this was
put very nicely by vilhelm von humboldt
the founder of the modern university
system also a great linguist and one of
the founders of classical liberalism he
his point was the way he put it is that
if an artisan it creates a beautiful
piece of work under on command we may
admire what he did but we despise what
he is namely a tool in the hands of
others on the other hand if that
partisan produces the same beautiful
work under his own control and
initiative we admire not only the piece
of work but also the the artisan himself
who it is actually Adam Smith said the
same thing everyone has read the first
paragraph of wealth of nations were you
know the talks about the butcher does
this and the Baker does that and
everybody's happy it comes out in favor
of division of labor a very few people
have gone on a couple hundred pages into
this rather dense book when Smith
returns to the notion of division of
labor and says that division of labor
cannot be tolerated because it will turn
people into creatures
stupid and ignorant as a human being can
possibly be just routinely under command
performing the same actions over and
over and he says in any civilized
society that the government's going to
have to step in to do something about it
education other things if you take a
look at the scholarly editions of wealth
of nations say the University of Chicago
Bicentennial scholarly edition you take
a look under division of labor and
you'll notice this passage isn't even
listed in the index most important
passage about division of labor it's not
I'm sure it was not intended to seat I
think they just couldn't understand it
it's just an unintelligible view in the
modern conception so you kind of read
the words but they don't get beyond the
eyes and butt but that conception is
really fundamental to classical
liberalism I think it's correct and they
related it loosely to the creative
aspect of language use well we're very
far from having answers to any of these
questions they should say but there are
steps towards it and the major steps do
happen to be in the study of language
doesn't their applications thoughts
about it elsewhere but that's where the
main work is and some other surprising
things have come out I think sort of
useful to compare what's been done in
the last roughly sixty years to the
early very early days of modern science
one of the great breakthroughs in modern
science say Galileo Galilei in period
was to be willing to be puzzled about
things that seemed obvious that's a
tremendous step forward so for example
for literally thousands of years it had
been accepted by important scientists
that we have answers to some very simple
questions like when I will hold this
thing up if I let it go
the cups going to drop if this happened
to be boiling water inside and I lift
the lid the steam will go up so the cup
drops and the steam rises well Aristotle
had an answer to why they're seeking
their natural place and that was taken
to be the appropriate answer for
thousands of years when Galileo and
others began to be said let's let's be
puzzled about this let's just not take
it for granted because it comes from
Authority and when you start being
puzzled about it modern science begins
you see you don't know the answers and
when you try to find out the answers
they break down all it shows that all
sorts of intuitions are just wildly off
and you finally out of this slowly comes
modern science and I think that's what's
been happening in study of language
since roughly the early 1950s
approximately a lot of things that seem
completely obvious were looked at
carefully and they all turned out to be
extremely puzzling so take a simple
example which is kind of evolved in
industry of analysis at take the
sentence a small short sentence can
Eagles that fly swim okay we all
understand it we know that the word can
is associated with swim not fly we're
asking can they swim not could they fly
similarly we can say things like our
eagles that fly swimming but we can't
say our eagles that swimming that flying
swim actually think about it that's a
fine thought it says are the Eagles that
are flying swimming too so our eagles
that flying swim but just can't say it
that way that thought can't be expressed
in that form well you know it's a wrap
if you think about it it was taken for
granted for forever that that was just
sort of intuitively obvious but if you
think about it's not at all obvious
Aristotle defined language as sound with
meaning
what the pursuit of this inquiry tends
to show is that that's not correct that
actually languages meaning with sound
and it need not be sound it can be sign
or some other mode of externalization
that's a big difference it means that
the core character of language is the
set of principles that yield structured
expressions and assign them a meaning
and that part of languages probably
can't show it yet but it looks like it's
uniform among humans it doesn't seem to
very much and if we knew enough maybe at
all it's just a core property of humans
that we have this set of principles that
yields and unbounded array of structural
expressions that have a somatic
interpretation that means something and
when you look into it's pretty strange
what it means but that just needs to be
shared among humans all together there
is no known difference among remote
tribes and papal haven't had other human
contact for tens of thousands of years
and the children who grow up here and if
you interchange them at infancy they'll
grow into their own society without any
problem so that seems to be a core
property of human nature the
externalization that what we call the
sound court is marginal and it also
follows from that that communication is
marginal and it's kind of a like a Dogma
among even scientists who write about
these topics that language is basically
a means of communication and evolved as
a means of communication you look at
current publications on evolution of
language that's just eight for granted
it apparently is all false it turns out
that from the closer analysis of
language that it's actually a tool for
thought it's a means of expressing
thought and on the side you can use it
for communication as you can use
anything else for communication that
gives it actually if you just introspect
for a minute that shouldn't be surprised
just ask yourself what is most of your
own use of language well if introspect
it turns out that probably ninety nine
percent of it is talking to yourself I
talking to yourself is not communicating
you can't it takes a tremendous act of
will not to talk to yourself try it it's
very hard you're walking down the street
you talking to yourself in fragments of
sentences it goes on all night
unfortunately but haha and sometimes
it's used for communication but even the
external part is not much well that's a
radically different conception of
fundamental human nature and it does
lead to in other directions like at
least exploring these thoughts about
creative work about moral judgment and
so on and I think you know I wouldn't I
don't exaggerate this is by no means a
universally accepted even among
scientists but I think that's the
direction in which work has been moving
and I think it is a way of finding out
basic things about what kind of
creatures we are no I'm thank you but we
are running out of time and a decision
has to be made there is so much left to
ask you we haven't spoken about a
universal moral grammar we haven't
spoken about free will the existence of
free will and I also want to know what
what the sources of your own inspiration
are but we also need to take questions
from the floor so I propose a referendum
we have ten minutes left would you like
us to continue with these questions or
okay those who object okay all right
thank you now I'm just just quickly I
didn't hear that sorry oh look i'm sorry
but i think you know being a democracy
you've been out moden maybe professor
Chomsky will take one from you
personally at the end would you be happy
with that um so just quickly gnome if if
possible please you're an institute
professor at the most distinguished
engineering institute in the world and
can you comment briefly about the role
of elite academic institutions that
don't appear to be very radical places
but you've been there now for over half
a century can they contribute to social
change or are they a barrier to change
well my own institutions a good a good
example it is I think it's fair to say
the greatest engineering science based
university in the world and it was back
in the 1950s when I got there in the
1950s the first was almost entirely
Pentagon funded but contrary to what a
lot of people believe that was the
freest period the Pentagon didn't care
what you were doing during the 1960's my
own instant my own the laboratory in
which I worked was a hundred percent
funded funded by three armed services it
was also the center of anti-war
resistance I don't mean protest I mean
resistance that meant support for
deserters tax resistance technically
criminal activities I was coming up for
a long jail sentence other colleagues
were involved in this too all coming out
of the same it was the main academic
center in the country on this that was
coming from the same laboratory that was
100% funded by the three armed services
that has to do with a fact about the
advanced economy
which is pretty well understood by
participants engineers it doesn't seem
that we well understood by economists or
the general public and that is that the
modern economy depends very heavily on
massive state intervention if you use a
computer the internet satellites micro
electronics the information technology
and so on you're feeding off of public
funding and public initiative and
Pentagon understood that it was the
funnel for raiding the taxpayer under
false pretenses you know the Russians
are coming so it wasn't wasn't
Democratic at all but it was essentially
telling the public you pay us we're
going to create the technology the
future they'd say that that's what was
happening so they didn't really care
what you're doing you want to overthrow
the government that's your business just
do your work you know but that was of
although that was the fact that was a
very small part of the Institute most of
the Institute was extremely conventional
that people did to work didn't ask
questions you just developed science and
technology it's kind of you know Tom
Lehrer song about very fun Brown which
you may know when the rock where the
Rockets come to the Rockets go up where
they come down is not my business and
that was essentially the conception
whether a small group of students very
small maybe a dozen or so in the 1960s
who began to be caught up in the general
a student activism the 60s and it worked
quite hard to try to change the
atmosphere I won't go through the
details but they succeeded succeeded to
the point that by say the end of the 669
it got to the point where actually the
administration called a day off just to
deal to focus on seminars discussions
and talks and so on about the uses of
technology should we be concerned with
how
science and technology are used and a
lot of self-criticism came out of that
quite important groups form union of
concerned scientists and so on it just
changed the atmosphere of the place and
by now those are common attitudes what
was once you just do your work and shut
up has become we have to think about
what we're doing and why and that
expands into other forms of social
activism to in all sorts of ways I mean
one very dramatic change at MIT you can
just see it walking down the halls when
I got there in the 50s it was white all
white male well-dressed conventional do
your work you walk down the halls today
it's like universities elsewhere a half
women a third minorities in formal dress
which is not insignificant that means
informal relationships and a lot of
activism those are quite big changes
they came about largely through the
activism of small groups of students
couple faculty but mostly students who
just essentially organized the place
through their own activities a lot of
interesting actions took place which
change things so what is a university
will you know it depends on the people
in it they can turn it at these are very
free institutions in many ways a lot of
things wrong with them but not want to
exaggerate but among the institutions of
the society these are perhaps the most
free and that's particularly true of the
sciences in the sciences you you just
can't Institute external controls and
expect them to survive you could you can
see that in the old Soviet Union you
know biology couldn't survive under
external controls the sciences are based
on their basically anarchist in this
sense that I was describing before
students are expected in a good
scientific university or courses they're
not expected to just
repeat what they were told they're
expected to challenge like a lot of the
new ideas innovation comes from that so
students expected to say you know I
don't believe what you're saying and
here's an argument to the contrary
that's good that's what we try to
encourage and if you didn't try to
encourage that des Sciences would die so
this is kind of like a built-in dynamic
that kind of frees them up it doesn't
mean that they're going to go beat to
the point of raising questions about the
use of technology in science now they
didn't and in fact they're classic
crazed examples of this which people
should think about so it takes a
creating the atom bomb there were two
main institutions in the United States
Chicago and Los Alamos Chicago they were
basically constructing you know the
materials in Los Alamos they were
turning it into a weapon there you go to
places like Chicago and Los Alamos I
mean they had some of the most
outstanding intellectuals in the world
these were many of them European Emma
Grey's who were you know the Einstein
types very impressive people cultured
literate most many of them but we would
call pretty radical music the arts
thinking about things they were working
in closed environments in which about
the only thing that they pursued was how
to carry out huge massive destruction in
Japan they were pretty sure they were
never going to use it in Germany in
Japan which might end the human race
because they weren't really sure and it
was single-minded pursuit of that
objective now if you look closely the
first protests questioning came out of
Chicago not Los Alamos and the reason
was that the Chicago face phase of the
operation was completed earlier they
were providing the materials and of
course that was prior to turning it into
a weapon
and it wasn't until their phase of the
scientific activities was over that some
of them began to raise questions about
what the heck are we doing and the
things like the pugwash movement so and
grew out of that the Los Alamos it
didn't happen until after the bomb went
off literally and when they began
reflecting about it later there was a
lot of justified self-criticism here you
had you know the most amazing group of
intellectuals you could imagine very
lots of broad interests all sorts of
things and they were single-mindedly
pursuing a highly dangerous maybe
potentially lethal activities not just
for the victims but even beyond without
thinking about it well that can happen
too and the question about what a
university can be or what academic life
or free intellectual life can be that
these questions always arise you can get
up get caught in what was called the
sweetness of the problem too sweet
problem we really want to solve it you
can easily get caught up in that or you
can ask what am i doing what's the
purpose of it what's the right way to
distribute your energies in the world
and life there's a lot to say about that
so I don't think there's a simple answer
to your question no and
my next question was about free will and
I've been contemplating how I can
possibly turn into a multiple choice
where the answers either yes or no but I
don't think that's going to work folks
so I think that's where we're going to
have to leave it I'd like to thank all
of you for coming I'd like to thank the
many of you who sent in questions I'd
like to thank the inimitable professor
Stewart Reese his executive officer dr.
Hannah Middleton dr. Peter Slezak at dr.
Clinton Fernandez who is a fountain of
knowledge and his generosity knows no
bounds and of course i'd like to thank
professor Noam Chomsky I know that you
would not travel to Australia for some
time because you were taking care of
your wife at home and in in times when
we have out sourced caring for dying
loved ones I think that is the ultimate
act of humanity in personal life you
continue to be a beacon for how to live
thank
knowledge for saying that
