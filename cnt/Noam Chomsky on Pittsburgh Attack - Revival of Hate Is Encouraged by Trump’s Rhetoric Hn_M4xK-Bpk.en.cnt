the war and peace report
I'm Amy Goodman the nation is continuing
to grieve the 11 Jewish worshippers who
were gunned down at the Tree of Life
synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday what's
being described as the worst
anti-semitic attack in US history
funerals are held Thursday for three
more victims of the shooting
husband and wife Sylvan and Bernie Simon
and Richard Gottfried Robert Bowers
who's accused of the mass shooting
pleaded not guilty Thursday he's charged
with 44 counts including murder and hate
crimes over 30 of which could be subject
to the death penalty Bauer's has a
history of posting anti-semitic and
xenophobic content and was posting on
the far-right social media site gab
until just before the shooting he
referred to the migrant caravan as an
invasion repeating the words that
President Trump uses we continue our
conversation now with Noam Chomsky the
world renowned professor linguist and
dissident who was born in Philadelphia
Pennsylvania Chomsky was I asked him
about the synagogue shooting in
Pittsburgh and other recent right-wing
attacks when I was a child the the
threat that fascism might take over much
of the world was not remote that's much
worse than what we're facing now my own
locality happened to be very
anti-semitic we were the only Jewish
family and uh Irish mostly Irish and
German Catholic neighborhood much of
which was pro-nazi so I could see it
better on the ground what we're now
seeing is a revival of hate anger or
fear much of it encouraged by the
rhetorical excesses of the leadership
which are stirring up
passions of Terror even the ludicrous
claims about the Nicaraguan army ready
to invade us Ronald Reagan the caravan
of miserable people planning to kill us
all all of these things plus you know
praising somebody who body-slammed the
reporter one thing after another all of
this raises the level of anger and fear
which has roots the roots lie in what
has happened to the general population
over the past 40 years people really
have faced significant distress it's an
astonishing fact about the United States
is that life expectancy is actually
declining that doesn't happen in
developed societies apart from you know
a major war or the huge famine but it's
happening because of social distress and
not necessarily impoverishment the
people who are demonstrating this fear
and resentment maybe even moderately
affluent but what they see is they're
stagnating in the past there was you had
this dream you worked hard you could go
I'd get ahead your children be a little
better now it stopped it stopped for the
last 40 years as a result of very
specific socio-economic policies which
have been designed so that they sharply
concentrate wealth they enhance
corporate power that has immediate
effects on the political system for in
perfectly obvious ways even to the point
where lobbyists literally write
legislation this onslaught has literally
cast the popular bunch of the population
aside the
stagnating they're not moving forward
they see no prospects and they're bitter
and angry about it
this anger and bitterness can take
pathological forms
it could take very constructive forms it
could lead to popular organized
movements which would dedicate
themselves to overcoming these blows
against decent human existence which
certainly can be done the groundwork for
that has been severely undermined for
example by the destruction careful
planned destruction of labor unions the
main force historically for leading the
way towards more progressive humane
policies all of these are a package
they've all gone together for 40 years
as precursors of course and it has led
to a situation where you get an outburst
of what Gramsci once called morbid
symptoms pathological developments of
the kind that you mentioned growing out
of a soil that is rich in incitement to
such things happening so and then if you
could talk about specifically the
targeting of the Jewish worshippers I
mean and the clear connection that the
shooter made between this temple and the
highest the what's formerly known as the
Hebrew immigrant Aid Society the group
that has helped to resettle refugees of
any religion for well over a hundred
years and he repeated words that Trump
has begun using more and more about you
know they're helping the invaders come
in if you could respond specifically to
that well I think it's pretty clear
these whipping up terror about
invasions people pouring across the
border to plan to kill us all to destroy
our civilization
you take people are already somewhat
disturbed living under harsh conditions
this can incite them to acts of extreme
violence against targets like the Jewish
Jewish temple all the anti-semitic
tropes are pointing in that direction
but most also against afro-americans
McGrew ants
any vulnerable population or population
that's easy to target for lots of
cultural and historical reasons all this
amplified by the loud speaker up in the
White House and his minions who are
doing what they can to terrorize the
population create the conditions under
which you can get something like the
attack on the synagogue so I wanted to
turn then to a clip of the Israeli
ambassador to the United States Ron
Dermer who was interviewed by a man
wielding on MSNBC on Sunday so soon
after the Pittsburgh synagogue Massacre
Dermer was asked if Trump's rhetoric is
in part to blame for the massacre I seat
a lot of bad people on both sides who
attack Jews this is not the first time
that a Jewish community has been
attacked it is the worst anti-semitic
attack in 200 years in the United States
if you have 11 dead Dermer said no world
leader had made stronger statements
against anti-semitism than Trump and
then he went on to blame both sides to
simply say that this is because of one
person or it only comes on one side is
to not understand the history of
anti-semitism or the reality of
anti-semitism one of
big forces in college campuses today is
anti-semitism and those and the
anti-semites are usually not neo-nazis
on college campuses they're coming from
the radical web this is right after the
white supremacist attack on the
synagogue and the Israeli ambassador to
the u.s. is now injecting saying this
comes from both sides if you could
respond to this interestingly two days
later when Trump and his family went to
Pittsburgh the only and this is pointed
out in the New York Times the only
public official standing there to greet
him was Israel's ambassador to the
United States Ron Dermer people like the
Pittsburgh mayor and the others said
this was not the time to come well I
think it's quite easy to understand
there is a an alliance of reactionary
repressive States developing under the
US aegis Israel is a leading member of
it Saudi Arabia's and other one of the
most brutal of regressive harsh states
in the world United Arab Emirates Egypt
under the harsh brutal dictatorship the
United States Israel and the United
States of course very specially under
this the alignment goes way back but the
Trump administration is going way out of
its way to lend support to Israeli
crimes Israeli expansion and the Israeli
right-wing of course is filled which is
increasingly dominant as delighted so
the fact that say the Israeli ambassador
would come out and say that is really no
more surprising than the fact that John
Bolton would praise the election of a
strong advocate of torture murder
repression all fits the same pattern
this issue of the number of people who
died this weekend the horrific massacre
11 Jews died the model of the coverage
of knowing who each person was hearing
their names their life stories their
ages who their families were knowing
when the funerals are taking place
through the week what about this being a
model for what's happening in Gaza I
mean for example on I think it was
Friday six Palestinians were killed with
those ongoing protests near the
separation wall Israeli military has
gunned down more than 200 Palestinians
that was Friday six Palestinians died
and on Sunday three Palestinian
teenagers were killed in an Israeli
airstrike on the Gaza Strip your
thoughts on Dermer trying to make this
connection to get away from the issue of
white supremacy and somehow someway
blame the left well the what remember
all of this in Gaza is being done with
overwhelming US support even US weapons
literally the Gaza is on the verge of
becoming literally uninhabitable the
International monitors UN and others
have warned that within just a few years
it may be literally unlivable I mean
right now there's virtually no potable
water the sewage pours into the the sea
because Israel is bombed and destroyed
the power plants and the sewage plants
when back in 2005 when Israel
withdrew its illegal settlers and Gaza
moved them to illegal settlements in the
West Bank it imposed a siege on Gaza the
official terms for that official not
making this up are we have to impose a
diet on Gaza not harsh enough so the old
died the implication being that wouldn't
look very good but harsh enough so they
can barely survive and there have been
quite apart from the brutal siege there
have been repeated attacks on Gaza by
the Israeli army gas is a virtually
defenseless this is one of the strongest
armies in the world lashing out to
devastate Gaza
there's always pretext there pretext for
everything the Hitler errata pretext for
invading Poland he was protecting
Germany from the wild terror of the
poles and the Israelis with us backing
have concocted pretext no time to go
through it here there's plenty and print
about it every one of them collapses on
inspection it's just a punching bag and
the effect on the people of Gaza is to
create utter desperation the the current
March is just an attempt to somehow
break the siege make life possible the
problem could be overcome easily simply
by providing them with the opportunities
for survival that's it not not trying to
block every attempt at political
unification of the fact factions it's
often been a pretext for another attack
some of what's going on on parts of it
we've seen or just a grotesque like when
a highly trained Israeli cyber murders
young woman far from the border who's
trying to help a Palestinian volunteer
medic young woman who's trying to help
wounded man and a sniper of murders are
trained highly trained snipers they know
what they're doing the International
monitors have gone to the hospitals are
shocked by the kinds of wounds they're
finding purposely designed to maim
people so they'll barely not kill them
but maim them so they won't be able to
have a even take part in the minimal
life that exists they're actually a
trump had a solution to this to the
misery of Gaza and the prospect that two
million people half of them children
will soon be in a situation of literally
beyond the possibility of survival they
had a lifeline what's called the UN raw
support international support which was
barely keeping them alive so Trump's
reaction is to cut it cut support for it
and even had a reason he said they're
not being grateful enough to me
for my efforts to give them the ultimate
deal that I'm planning altima deal which
means give up all your rights and forget
it to leading American political analyst
specialists on the Middle East with long
government service Robert Malley Aaron
David Miller really encapsulated the
Trump program very simply I said the
Trump messages to the Palestinians
you've lost forget it go away you're
done and because the people of Gaza are
not sufficient on the on the West Bank
or sufficiently appreciative let's cut
the lifeline that fact let's even as he
did cut support for underfunded
Palestinian
hospitals in the West Bank let's cut the
funding for the Lin Ross School in the
Shatila refugee camp and Lebanon still
reeking from the hideous Israeli Run
Massacre they're back at the end of
their invasion and eighty to see little
kids playing in the mud and dark alleys
we'll never get out children will be
there and so on they had a one hope
though in Ross cool good let's kill that
all of this these things are just one
after another taking place indescribable
I mean the the the the war in Yemen
which finally at last is getting a
little bit of attention has been a major
Horror Story of the most careful
estimates of the killing that are now
just coming out show that there may be
seven or eight times as high as what has
been the numbers that have been given
there were in the order of 70 or 80
thousand the analysis of these Saudi
emirate programs a long study that came
out of the Fletcher School of
International Diplomacy at Tufts
University recently showed quite
persuasively that the policies of the
attackers are aimed at destroying the
food supplies making sure the population
starves to death they're also trying to
close the port through which some
supplies come all of this is fully
backed by the United States US and
Britain secondarily supply the arms us
supplies of the intelligence for the
city Air Force which is carrying out
massive atrocities all of these things
are happening for years they've been
barely discussed now finally you're
seeing pictures on the front page of
starving Yemeni children even a call for
a ceasefire much belated a little
attention to our crucial responsibility
for it just like our responsibility
which is overwhelming for the plight of
the miserable people trying to escape
from the troika Honduras El Salvador
Guatemala the three countries that have
been completely under our thumb and our
suffering bitterly for it now tried to
escape so we turned them into an
invasion mob planning to destroy us all
of this is surreal that only is
overshadowed by the failure to attend
even minimally to the literal
existential threats that are not remote
do you consider this one of the gravest
times in your lifetime in US politics no
it's one of the gravest times in human
history humans have been around for
200,000 years for the first time in
their history they have to decide and
quickly whether organized human society
is going to survive for very long and
that's not in the remote distance the
again there are two with all the
problems and horrors in the world which
should be attended to there are two
existential threats both being increased
one is the threat of nuclear war which
is terminal the other is the threat of
severe environmental catastrophe which
doesn't destroy all human life
but it does undermine the prospects for
organized society and you mentioned
earlier a third threat also dating back
to the end of the Second World War at
the end of the Second World War was the
opening of the nuclear rage and as I
mentioned that's kind of a miracle that
we survived it it's also the opening of
what geologists are now calling the
Anthropocene the age in which human
activity is radically affecting the
environment there's been debate about
its origins the world geological society
more or less settled on the end of the
the beginning the end of the Second
World War of the late 40s and on where
there was a sharp spike and damaged the
environment the third is what's called
the sixth extinction the extinction of
species the fifth extinction was around
65 million years ago when it's assumed
that a huge asteroid hit the earth and
ended the age of the dinosaurs it
destroyed most of the species on earth
we're now in the midst of the sixth
extinction with very rapid destruction
of other species and of the kind of
environment in which they can survive
like wilderness for example we're
pushing to the edge of not only our own
survival but that of much of the much of
life on Earth so is it the most gravest
moment in my life yes but also in all of
human history and things like the
election next week will have an impact
on this world renowned professor
linguist and dissident Noam Chomsky
speaking to us from Tucson Arizona where
he is now teaching at the University of
Arizona
is the Institute professor emeritus of
linguistics at the Massachusetts of
Institute of Technology where he's
taught for more than 50 years has
written over 100 books was born in
Philadelphia Pennsylvania will air more
of the interview with Noam Chomsky next
week this is democracy now when we come
back Ilana Glazer joins us yes of Comedy
Central broad city but she'll be talking
about serious things right now she'll be
talking about what happened last night
and an event she had planned for a
Brooklyn synagogue where she was going
to be talking about politics but before
the midterms the event had to be
cancelled because of anti-semitic and
racist graffiti that was scrawled just
before the event around the synagogue
stay with us
