my guest today is one of the world's
most prominent most controversial public
intellectuals know'm Chomsky the
internationally renowned professor of
linguistics published his first critique
of American politics and foreign policy
forty years ago back then he was fired
up by the war in Vietnam today he is
still raging against America's malign
influence the world has changed a lot in
40 years has Noam Chomsky changed too
[Music]

professor Noam Chomsky welcome to hard
talk
thank you very much glad to be here it
is 40 years since you published your
first real political book in the United
States and an awful lot has changed in
the world in 40 years has your political
worldview changed as well do you think
my worldview is not very different from
the first article I wrote which was in
1939 fourth-grade newspaper which I was
the editor and only reader so it was an
article on the fall of Barcelona and the
rise of has a danger of fascism
spreading through Europe I mean I
wouldn't endorse what I said in 1939 but
it's the same point of view and I've
seen you describe yourself the young
Noam Chomsky is as an anarchist what
does that mean I mean when you look at
politics today you live in the United
States you consider democracy as done in
the United States and you look at the
u.s. role in the world what does it mean
to be an anarchist well I cannot repeat
what I've written anarchism is a very
broad brush covers lots of things but
there are some leading principles I
think the main one is that is a
skeptical attitudes towards Authority
and domination and the recognition that
any form of the domination hierarchy
control has to be has a burden of proof
it's not self justifying it has to
demonstrate that it's legitimate
just as any use of force or coercion
does and if and it therefore deserves to
be challenged and if it's challenged and
it cannot justify itself it should be
dismantled and when it comes to
political governance does democracy have
a place in your view of how human beings
should organize their society yes I
think democracy should be the ideal to
which an anarchist the system would
strive
and in fact it's critique of
contemporary systems would be that they
deviate so radically from any acceptable
notion of democracy would you say here
in 2009 with Barack Obama president of
the United States that America has a
surprisingly resilient functional
democracy and the other hand knows that
the Obama election reveals even more
dramatically and than in the past often
how deeply flawed the democratic system
is and in fact was designed to be flawed
and pretty much the way it is why do you
say that the election of Obama makes
that even more obvious well why did
Obama win there basically two reasons
the one he had enormous support from the
financial institutions that's the core
of his funding and the financial
institutions are by now the the
essential element of the economy since
the financialization of the economy in
the 1970s let me stop you there because
you've chosen to begin by talking about
the financing of Obama's politics but
Obama raised money in a completely
different way from any politician in
America before I looked at the figures
something like two hundred and seventy
five million dollars of his campaign war
chest came from donations of two hundred
dollars or less for assistance is
Americans ordinary Americans nearly you
know first of all has to be very careful
about this
this is evaluating those figures but
let's assume it to be true it's like
saying that the stock market is
democratic because everyone has three
stocks and a pension fund
do you see Obama simply then as a tool
as a puppet of big business -
essentially shares the same that I do
they assume I listen to you and i I get
the sense that you feel frankly that
Obama really doesn't mean very much
signifying much in terms of any change
in America but it's not just about Obama
because if one looks it the way
Americans
he works the way information flows
things are very different from the way
they were when you started to become a
prominent political critic in the 1960s
I just think of the Internet of the way
in which quote unquote citizen
journalism is changing the way in which
information flows between people and
power does this not matter I think the
Internet is a wonderful tool it does it
affect power marginalization it does
because you know you're famous for using
Lipman's quote about the media
manufacturing consent and developing
that idea and quote you propaganda is to
democracy what the bludgeon is to a
totalitarian state that's right but
these things don't really work so easily
that idea seems less powerful where it's
more they it's more diffuse so the
Internet is a kind of a blunt instrument
it's a cult generator anybody can put up
anything they think that's nice we're
talking about the internet and whether
it changes the nature of engagement
between citizen and and power we've got
a host of questions put to us for you
from viewers over the internet and I'm
going to put one to you now it's from
Philip Lindstrom in Sweden and his
question is this professor Chomsky how
important do you consider the internet
will be as a tool of democracy and for
democracy in the coming decades he says
you know we've already seen content
control and Net censorship rising
government's try to monitor in certain
situations net traffic he says so at the
golden years of whistleblowing and
independent media online already behind
us I don't think they're behind us
because they never happened never
happened I mean there's some and it's
fine but you know more than when Dan
Ellsberg released the Pentagon Papers
which happened to be correctly 40 years
ago I've interviewed a lot of prominent
writers and thinkers on this program
from the left in the United States and
I'm thinking recently Studs Terkel we
went to Chicago to interview before he
is death we've interviewed gore Vidal a
lot of figures who have a very high
profile and their voices are very well
known but it seems to me and maybe
you're in this category too huge number
of followers and supporters but your
views don't resonate on Main Street
mainstream America why is that first of
all I know they don't resonate on in
National Public Radio the New York Times
and so on but if Main Street means the
people of the country when I go home at
night I'll have 20 invitations on email
to come anywhere you know I speak at
community groups immigrant groups labor
groups I've spoken at West Point I mean
this a very large number of people be
that as it may my main contention is
this that you would like to believe that
the American public is more sort of left
inclined than its leaders its power
system but I would put to you that
Americans are fundamentally a
conservative people I'm conservative too
and in fact I don't express my opinion
there's massive evidence on people's
attitudes and on social and political
issues
it's rather rather consistently both
political parties are well to the right
of the population health care is one
example but the same is true on
international issues and so on
