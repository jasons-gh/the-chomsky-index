esta aqui Thank You professor Chomsky
to be with us I let's start with your
biography your you say in one of the
your latest book that your father was
poor he was immigrant and he was able to
study a PhD and to become a middle class
man well how was your family why you
decided to study linguistics what'd you
learn about this your family your
experience how was your life when you
were a child and then when you became
student well actually my father came
from a small village in the Ukraine
shtetl little village which was full of
mud and medieval basically and he
emigrated in 1913 the he was 17 the it
was mainly to escape the Czar's army
which was virtually a death sentence for
Jewish boys
and came across in steerage didn't know
any English no money got a job as a in
Baltimore as sorting rags and uh and
some kind of a company and anyway he
gradually pretty soon he was learned
English she managed to go to college
ended up with a PhD became a scholar and
of course I didn't know any of this when
I was a baby but he you follow him I
said well a lot easier for me I grew up
in a middle-class family my father was a
he actually directed Jewish education in
the city of Philadelphia he was a
recognized scholar one of the first I
mean I was old enough to read his
doctoral dissertation when it came out
was a study of a 14th century Hebrew
grammarian which was a history of
submitting Semitic swizerland it done I
sort of learned this is a nine or ten
year old child and he was pardoned he
was an influential injury interest to
study linguistics it was one of several
strands that led to it but I had a kind
of a firm childhood a sort of some sort
of background and Semitic linguistics
and and that's why you study
not really it's just many things came
actually I got I was a 16 year old
student in college and I had looked
forward very my I went to an academic
high school which was extremely boring I
was looking forward to college which had
all kind of exciting descriptions of
courses and I took what after another
each one was extremely boring I was
almost ready to drop out when I happened
to meet through other connections
political connections actually a very
impressive person who turned out to be
the the leading as theoretical linguist
in the country maybe the world
zelich harris and but but our
connections were through our common
interests and kind of the radical
politics at that time was a lot of it
was concerned with what was in Palestine
and it was groups which were then called
Zionists are now called anti Zionist
which were opposed to the idea of
creating a Jewish state wanted a Jewish
Arab socialist Commonwealth and
Palestine which I was interested in as a
child he had been involved in as a
leading intellectual figure and activist
and he suggested that I take his
graduate course in linguistics I took
that and then started taking other
graduate courses I never really had an
undergraduate education under political
thinking the roots of your political
thinking many people say you are an
artist or they say you are an anarchist
socialist or but beyond the level how
can you describe your main I think ideas
well these terms are very vague and of
many different applications but there is
a strand of thinking that grows out of
classical liberalism has much deeper
roots of course it foundered with the
rise of capitalism which was
inconsistent with I think with classical
liberal ideals and out of this complex
there emerged stream which is
one of the main streams of anarchist
thought in action which is fundamentally
committed to a central principle that
structures of hierarchy and domination
of any kind have no self justification
there the assumption is they're
unjustified they have to demonstrate
that they are justified the burden of
proof is on any form of control
domination Authority and when it turns
out that the justification cannot be
given which is usually the case then
that structure should be dismantled as a
step towards a more free addressed
society and that holds from everything
from personal relations to international
affairs and everything in between and I
think that's the core principle of the
anarchist thought that developed out of
the Enlightenment and classical
liberalism and I would I think it's a
guiding principle that can be applied
over and over again to all sorts of
situations and from childhood that I was
kind of interested these ideas the
anarchist revolution in Spain in 1936
was of particular interest to me by the
time I was 11 or 12 years old I was
spending a lot of time in anarchist
offices in New York and fry or by thirst
Emma the Yiddish anarchist movement in
those days in New York I don't know you
New York City but Union Square and down
South fourth Avenue we're full it's now
all gentrified in big buildings and so
on but then it was small stores
secondhand bookstores many of them run
by emigration Spain I found those
anarchist emigrate from Spain I picked
up pamphlets talk to people learn things
still have a lot of the pamphlets and
but do you think for example do you
think that something has been improved
in after liberal democracy or it's just
another way of domination if you look
over the long stretch of history you
find fairly consistent progress there
are periods of regression of course but
many things that we now take for granted
we're considered unthinkable not very
long ago so I think over over time
there's a consistent tendency towards as
Martin Luther King put it bending the
moral arc of the universe towards
justice slowly sometimes it bends back
but over time I think one can see this
tendency in human affairs but for
example in your book of rakim for the
American Dream it seems to me that you
are saying today we are leaving
in some way how can you say a period of
decline of the era of regression but I
think it's a dip in a long term tendency
and I think it's now we're now seeing
resistance to it developing in all sorts
of ways
some of them constructive some
destructive but out of this could come
can't sure but could come a new
enlightenment after this crisis the
linear rate of regression which is we
can time it it's socio economic policies
were instituted pretty much globally
around a generation ago roughly 1980 all
over the world one form or another and
Latin America
was the imposition of the structural
adjustment programs which essentially
terminated a growth and development in
Latin America for several decades lost
decades the then began to pick up again
later and still other problems in
regression and the United States it's
the same in Europe in the United States
if you take a measure like say just real
wages how much does a person earn it's
been pretty stagnant for about thirty
years there has been growth and but it's
gone into very few pockets so very
making the high concentration of wealth
pretty much stagnation for much of the
population the sense that each
generation does a little better than the
last and if you work hard you'll get
ahead that's been killed for many people
not just here Europe as well taken other
forms in Latin America and Africa and so
on so there's you know world that's not
even things develop in complicated ways
but this tendency is striking around
much of the world and it's related I
think to the so called neoliberal
policies that were instituted that were
directed towards undermining social and
collective commitment and responsibility
throwing people into a labor market in
which they had few rights and could not
organize the policies that concentrated
wealth cutting taxes for the rich all
sorts of others have led to very
naturally towards a an effect on it sets
off a vicious cycle as wealth and power
concentrate they determine the way the
political system evolves which then
produces legislation which enhances the
right of the powerful when you get
this spiral which we're seeing in much
of the world that has led to anger
resistance what's called populism which
not a very good term for which to come
the collapse of centrist institutions
the sense of alienation from existing
institutions a dislike of them
resentment and so on which can take very
positive forms sometimes does can be
very harmful as well
it has resonances of the 1930s which are
do you think that a new form of populism
right populism could arise out of this
crisis well populism is a strange term
there was a major populist movement in
the United States in the late 19th
century it was it actually developed it
was a movement in Italy of radical
farmers independent farmers who were
joined together to resist the control
over their lives by North Eastern
capitalists merchants of banks and so on
which had a which controlled the the
credit the the marketing everything for
the farmers and was leaving them in
great distress and they organized to
develop their own systems independent
systems of of production of the
distribution and so on and it became a
major movement of Texas Kansas all
through the Midwest it began to link up
with the rising labor movement this is
the early stage was a big to labor
and others and became a very powerful
and important movement it was finally
crushed by force okay that was the real
populist movement it was the most
democratic moment in American history
what's now called populism is just
resentment and anger that's something
okay well and do you think there are new
rules in the world do
rules rulers rulers yes food rules you
know there have been major changes one
of the striking elements of the
neoliberal revolt against growth the
growth and development of earlier
periods was the enormous expansion of
financial capital by now it's I mean you
go back 50 years ago 60 years ago banks
were actually banks there were places
were if you had a little excess money
you can put it in the bank they would
lend it to someone to start a business
by a car or send their children to
college or something that's basically
what a bank was they were connected to
the real economy the real economy and
and there were no crises there were no
financial crises they didn't I'm talking
about the United States the reason was
that the New Deal legislations of the
1930s were in place and they assisted
they controlled a financial system which
was contributing to the real economy an
effect that was one of several factors
that led to the greatest growth period
and probably in American history 50s in
the sixties a very rapid growth some
progress on social issues civil rights
movement egalitarian growth there was
the first period and almost the first
period in American history where African
Americans had a opportunity to begin to
enter into the general social life
one of the aspects of this period
because of labor militancy and other
forms of activism was that the society
became more democratic and participatory
and one consequence of that was a
declining rate of profit the corporate
sector was losing and was still very
profitable but it was declining in power
and profit and there was the growth of
Democratic participant
was quite threatening to elites across
the spectrum and there came a reaction
the reaction to that is in fact the
neoliberal period which has been pretty
regressive in many respects except in
one respect the rate of profit shot up
so that's a success look I'm in the
thinking of ruling the world be it shot
up particularly in those parts of the
economy which do not contribute to the
economy the financial sector so if you
go up to the point of the and then there
was crash after crash of course you know
every time there's a crash the public
bills out the institutions they become
richer and bigger than before the last
one was 2008 and right at that time in
the United States for about almost half
of corporate profits about 40% were in
the financial institutions which
probably contribute they may have a
negative impact on the economy they
certainly don't contribute much these
are banks started being something
totally different these are places where
all sorts of complicated financial
instruments are created all kinds of
transactions take place very rapid
trading a huge amount of speculation the
fuse it's kind of interesting that
economists haven't studied it very much
but the few studies that exist suggest
that it's it has a probably a negative
effect on the economy um you can see it
in particular corporations so take the
biggest corporation in the world Apple
computers as it grows it's its funding
internal to the corporation its funding
for research and develop and developing
new products declines and its funding
for financial manipulations and
transactions increases this has happened
across the corporate sector
because it's more immediately profitable
bonuses are bigger you know so it means
that in the longer term research and
development will shift somewhere else
these are tendencies that are part of
the financialization of the economy the
same happened in Europe it seems
happening elsewhere so you have a shift
and who the if you want the rule what
Adam Smith called the Masters have been
going the Masters has been kind they're
somewhat shifting in composition and
much less participating far less in the
real economy and there is a general
decline in democracy and disillusionment
with formal democratic institutions
which is quite understandable it's very
striking in Europe so if you're say a
citizen of Italy you have you may vote
in formal elections but even even if
Italy itself was one hundred percent
democratic wouldn't matter much because
the decisions are being made in Brussels
nothing wrong and they're being made by
unelected officials the European the
troika it's called the International
Monetary Fund which Italians don't vote
for of course it's pretty much a branch
of the US Treasury Department the
European Central Bank and the European
Commission which is unelected that's
where the basis for the sites are not
elect the people who the sites are not
elected no unelected and and it's led to
it's led to what's called populism but I
think of some better name is needed it's
an amalgam of resentment anger
recognition of loss of rights loss of
opportunity that much of which is quite
realistic there's no economic
justification for it in fact if you take
a look at the International Monetary
Fund the
it's kind of interesting the wrong
economists conclude that these austerity
policies are harmful but they're the
political actors within the institution
support them and it's late especially
now let me ask you another subject you
are interested in teleports you have
written about the intellectuals in the
70s you wrote about the intellectuals
and now you publish this year a book
about intellectuals and you can see that
they have a responsibility it's very
interesting because you say most of the
intellectuals are not critical also
there are a critical intellectuals but
how can what game can complain the
intellectuals today or are the begging
I'm the very concept of intellectual is
a very strange one
so suppose say in university there's a
scientist say a physicist - won the
Nobel Prize and spends 60 hours a week
working on his on his scientific
problems and so on that we don't call
him an intellectual suppose the janitor
who cleans the room where he works
happens to be self educated very astute
thinks about social and political issues
as interesting ideas participates in
labor activism and social activism we
don't call him an intellectual the the
people we call intellectuals are those
this category are people with certain
degree of privilege who whatever they
come public or say they somehow deal
with or claim to do
issues that are significant for human
affairs those are the people we call
intellectuals they may not have anything
to say maybe the janitor who cleans the
floor knows more than they do but
they're the intellectuals but then
there's a general going back to the
question of responsibility there's a
very general principle that holds for
everyone the more opportunity you have
the more responsibility you have and
since intellectuals by definition are
people with a certain amount of
privilege the privilege confers
opportunity which confers responsibility
then comes the moral issue of what you
do with your responsibility you have the
the a moral commitment to take to use
the advantages that you have which
society has granted you to be a
constructive citizen of the world to
contribute to justice to freedom to
progress and so on if you you have
another choice the other choice is to
serve power in fact you can be what
Henry Kissinger describes as the best
intellectual the person he's very frank
and honest about it it's an intellectual
as a person who can articulate clearly
the interests and concerns of the people
in power in other words you serve the
powerful as someone who can formulate
for them the interests and concerns that
they have doesn't matter about anyone
else
that's one conception of intellectual
another is the conception of a person
who uses the privilege and opportunity
that they have to meet the
responsibilities of any decent human
being it's the same for everyone but
intellectuals happen to be in a
particularly privileged situation have
opportunities those don't
so the responsibility is greater and you
can use follow-up Kissinger's Avenue or
you can follow the avenue of say Martin
Luther King to pick one but do you think
that in the these thirty last year's
intellectuals pale role in changing all
these ideas about power economy no they
pay a very important role huge role from
take that say take the George W Bush
administration or the Kennedy
administration they were staffed by
intellectuals and the policies that
developed they called themselves in fact
the best and the brightest during the
Kennedy years in the Bush years it was
the neoconservative intellectuals and
they we can see what they achieved all
intellect these critical intellect parts
of the 60s and 70s and right up to the
present what happened because they were
more popular no they weren't they were
no the critical intellectuals of the
1960s were persecuted were attacked by
government programs the marginalized
take say the Vietnam War the respected
in fact but george bundy who was the
national security adviser for Kennedy
and Johnson the former dean of Harvard
head of the Ford Foundation leading
intellectual figure had an interesting
article in foreign affairs the main
establishment journal about about 1968
when the anti-war movement was really
developing and he discussed the role of
intellectuals he said there were serious
intellectuals the ones who were called
at the time technocratic and policy were
and as intellectuals they're the ones
who were following Kissinger's model you
articulate the interests of people in
power then there were the sort of bad
people
the value-oriented intellectuals he
called them the wild men in the wings
the people who not only who even go so
far as to question the motives and goals
of people in power they're the bad
people we've got to get rid of them
those are the critical intellectuals in
every society that I know of almost at
Prezi they're marginalized in this whole
Soviet Union they were the dissidents
not the Commodores and it's pretty
constant across across the electoral
world well um let's talk about the
public opinion let me ask you you have
been well-known because you defended and
I think it's very I agree defense that
of the free speech without restrictions
you have been criticized because you
conceded that the free speech suppose
free speech not restrictions of any kind
well I wouldn't I don't think there are
any principles that are absolute there
might be in fact my own view is that the
US Supreme Court in 1969 under the
pressure of the popular activist
movements of the 60s that took a
position on freedom of speech which I
think is generally quite appropriate
famous court decision Brandenburg the
Ohio Court took the position that speech
should be free up to the point of
participation in an eminent critical
action that means for example that if
you and I go into a store with the
intention of robbing it and you take out
a gun and I say shoot that's not that's
not protected speech that's
participation in an imminent critical
action but up to that point from the
speech would be basically free now this
is like any general criterion
it's not an algorithm that you can apply
mechanically depends very much on
circumstances all sorts of things but as
a general guiding principle I think
that's pretty legitimate for example
what happens with the hate speech they
speech delivery my only feeling is that
the way to deal with hate speech is not
by silencing it but by confronting it so
for example if white supremacists is
invited to give a talk somewhere the
right response is not to silent shout
him down and beat up the supporters and
so on but to use the opportunity to
educate and to organize and to confront
and to develop expects exposure and
officer and organized opposition to the
ideas and that works many cases so we'll
take a concrete case about there must
have been maybe 20 years ago a
neo-fascist group in the United States
planned to have a demonstration a march
in a town in Illinois Skokie Illinois
which happens to be have many Holocaust
survivors in it and they were going to
have a kind of a neo-nazi march through
the town the American Civil Liberties
Union defended the right to have the
March and I think correctly and what
happened is that public opposition was
organized that was so impressive and
overwhelming that they simply withdrew
because they didn't want to be
confronted that's the way you deal with
for example lying in public they're
lying
public as post truth this concept I mean
it has different meanings but you can
lie to destroy the references of any
other exposure
that doesn't do any good to have the
state to give the state notice we're
word if you ban free speech you're
giving the state the power to determine
what's true and we know exactly where
that leads so very wise and explosive
don't bring in the police to tell them
you're lying
and don't you think that sometimes these
are strategies to destroy the public
opinion
in fact we have huge industries which
are devoted to controlling public
opinion it's called the public relations
industry the advertising industry its
commitment is to control and manipulate
public opinion should we ban it by law
should we ban one of the major
industries of the world by law because
it is committed to controlling and
manipulating public opinion and does so
very effectively it drives people
towards a subordination towards
marginalization and in fact it says that
that's what it's doing you go back to
the origins of the public relations
industry when people were more frank and
honest than they are about it now they
said that the goal is to direct people
to the superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption that I'm quoting
from the business press and if we do
that they'll leave us alone they won't
bother us the conceptions which
incidentally were held across the
spectrum by liberal intellectuals walter
Lippmann others that is that the public
conception is that the I'm actually
quoting now the public are stupid and
ignorant of the issue they're Outsiders
with the intelligent men of the
community should that's us should
determine and control policy and we
should be protected from the trampling
and the roar of the bewildered herd of
people now in a free society there
allowed to vote unfortunately but we
have to make sure that they are under
control you take Reinhold Niebuhr one of
the leading theologian intellectuals
highly respected by the liberal
community his view was that you have to
people are stupid and ignorant you have
to provide them with necessary illusions
and emotionally potent simplifications
to keep them quiet and in the background
and not disturb us those are fundamental
principles of what we call liberal
democratic society should they be banned
by law or should they be exposed and and
confronted I think the answer to that is
quite clearly first of all they control
the law well I want to go back to the
strategies of the corporation you were
talking about what about have you been
several times in Mexico you have I think
you understand very well the situation
of Mexico today with NAFTA and all these
kind of things how do you see Mexico and
the global economy and the situation of
countries like Mexico and Mexico so we
have objective information about it
since NAFTA Mexico has had one of the
lowest growth rates in Latin America
NAFTA was designed in such a way as to
undermine and destroy Mexican
agriculture Mexican campesinos may be
very efficient but they cannot possibly
compete with us
agribusiness which incidentally doesn't
work by free markets it's very highly
subsidized by the state so you have huge
mega corporations which are subsidized
by the most powerful state in the world
and a farmers obviously not going to be
able
compete with them so one of the
immediate consequences of NAFTA is to
drive people off the land into urban
concentrations 1 another element of
NAFTA is that these are called free
trade agreements they're not they're
investor rights agreements is to one
element is to that Mexico must give
what's called national treatment to an
American a u.s. corporation that means
it the u.s. a you a Mexican citizen
doesn't get national treatment in the
United States obviously but a business
does get national treatment okay that
has gonna have obvious effects of the
it's claimed that makes it that NAFTA
increased trade and take a look at what
it increased the what's called trade by
economists is not trade it's its
decision its interactions within a
command economy so for example if a ford
motor company that produces parts in
indiana sends them to the next northern
mexico to be assembled and then sells
the car and los angeles economists
called that trade in both directions but
it's very much like as in the old soviet
union if parts were made and some
factory in the Urals and sent to Poland
for assembly and sold and Leningrad we
didn't call that trade its interactions
within a command economy now
corporations are command economies they
have by now global since the 90s and
afters when part of it the global supply
chains which involve interactions inside
the mega corporation many of the people
those involved may not even know what
they're doing they're just putting
things together somewhere Apple
computers for example the design and
development in the United States
so the assembly is in China under the
control of a Taiwanese Corporation which
subsidiary of Foxconn meanwhile the they
set up their office in Ireland or in the
Jersey Island so they don't pay taxes
and this is called a free enterprise in
trade so when you look at the figures
for trade cross borders it's extremely
misleading people don't corporations are
secret institutions they don't tell us
what they're doing and it's very hard to
get details about their internal
operations you know the government can
do it under subpoena power if they
investigate otherwise use indirect
information but it's probable that about
maybe 50 percent of the so-called trade
between Mexico and the United States is
not trade in any serious sense The
effect of these there are many other
aspects to these agreements when Donald
Trump says we ought to tear up NAFTA and
start over he has a point but not the
way he wants to reconstitute it there
are very interesting proposals that are
coming up mostly from Canada about how
to reconstitute NAFTA one of them
proposal is that in Mexico company
unions should not be permitted you
should there should be a freedom for
independent unions develop not on the
control of the companies of the
government that should be an element of
NAFTA another proposal from Canada is
that the laws in the United States which
are designed to undermine and destroy
unions should be abolished there's a
what are called in the United States
right-to-work clause this is the age of
or well doesn't mean right to work
it means right to destroy unions this is
these are laws which allow a worker and
a plant to have protection from the
Union but not pay dues to it
that's called right-to-work it's
obviously designed to destroy unions
it's probably now going to become
federal legislation the latest there was
a the Supreme Court was split on this
issue but with the new appointment by
Trump it'll probably go to accept that
the Canadian proposal is to change NAFTA
to instituted nafta principles which ban
these measures designed to destroy the
opportunity for working people to
organize for their rights
of course this never gets reported in
the United States
you're responsible intellectually you
don't talk about things like that but
that's these are directions and these
and other directions are ways in which
NAFTA could be reconstructed
they could be reconstructed in accord
with the ideals of the man who's honored
as the founder of modern capitalism Adam
Smith who was quite anti-capitalist in
fact and if you look at his what his own
writings what he says is he's generally
opposed to regulation by the state
should allow the market to function but
if regulations are instituted for the
benefit of the worker then they could be
legitimate so fine let's do that let's
have regulations and benefit of people
not private concentrations of power and
after could be reconstructed along those
lines and it could be an effective way
of organizing interaction among several
countries in the for the benefit of
their populations and not for the
benefit of investors in private
corporations these are all when you
think that this is not possible in
perfect because of global globalization
for example China
it was supposed with NAFTA the
investments of the corporations in
Mexico it should come to Mexico and then
they want to China or they go to Vietnam
or they go to other they are speculating
with their wages who makes those
decisions
well the corporations and they on this
if we simply ask ourselves who makes
those decisions then could we the answer
is obvious the bank's the board of
managers and so on but why should they
have the right to make the decisions
about where things are produced and
distributed
why not the workforce why not that you
know no I agree with you okay I'm just
questioning but that they are now in
English and settles this client then
let's change the institutions
institutions have been changed in the
past until pretty recently
slavery was considered legitimate that
was a major institution in fact it was
the major institution if you look at
Industrial Development industrial
capitalism England in the United States
later Europe it was very heavily based
on slavery the early Industrial
Revolution was it was based on cotton
it was textile production required cheap
cotton how do you get cheap cotton by
the most vicious system of slavery in
human history
that's the origins of modern industrial
capitalism of modern finance said the
banks developed commerce retail was all
based on again literally the most
vicious system of slavery in human
history
that's called free-market capitalism I
mean if we look at the actual history
and compare it with the doctrines and
ideology that people are told the gap is
extraordinary and going back to the role
of intellectuals
yeah it's their role to expose this
they're in a position to do it they have
the resources they have the privilege
access they can use it and some do and
you think that for example they media
are not also under control of
corporations and they are be made yes
they are corporations they're not under
the control like New York Times
Washington Post the major corporations
parts of mega corporations I mean a lot
of the work they do is extremely
valuable the first thing I do in the
morning is read the New York Times you
know it's indispensable source of
information yes but with in a framework
of ideology and doctrine that determines
what is considered worth reporting what
is not reporting and how you describe it
and so on so for example or we've just
been talking about in my opinion ought
to be headlines but you have to search
to find it you came here to talk about
today's environment how do you see this
it's a real crisis the year the evidence
is quite overwhelming that we're moving
towards a situation in which organized a
human life and anything like the form
that we know will be impossible I mean
take something I'd be simply because of
the use of fossil fuels the fossil fuel
use continues at anything like its
present level we can expect the sea
level to rise several meters and
probably within the lifetime of our
children
can you imagine what life would be like
if the to just take the prediction of
the National Climate Commission in the
United States pretty conservative out a
couple of weeks ago they came out with
their projections for the next coming
years one of them is that at the current
level of fossil fuel use the sea level
will rise more than two meters may rise
more than
two meters there's some uncertainty but
before the end of this century just
think what the world would be like with
two meters rising sea level you can ask
what Mexico would be like but ask what
Bangladesh would be like it's a flat
coastal plain with hundreds of millions
of people what happens to them and you
get a me may have instead of the 60
million refugees you may have 500
million where they gonna go what's going
to happen to countries like South Asia
where the water supply which is already
in danger will be devastated and you
have two nuclear powers in India and
Pakistan fighting for the same water and
what's the world going to look like when
cities and coastal cities are underwater
when agriculture is undermined and the
prospects are devastating and could be
much worse there are things that are
uncertain
so there's what's called permafrost of
right up near the surface yes and the
huge areas a huge amount of carbon in
there and what it's starting to melt
what happens when it melts no you could
have sudden so-called nonlinear
processes suddenly exploding there are
other aspects buried in the permafrost
or ancient bacteria from long time ago
they start appearing humans have and
other animals have no immunity to them
what happens then these are the
circumstances were facing and how are we
facing them by continuing and maximizing
fossil fuel use so a couple of months
ago you may have seen Mexico announced a
new great discovery of new opportunities
in the Gulf we could bring in foreign
corporations produce a lot more fossil
fuels and destroy the life of our
grandchildren those are the but again it
doesn't seems that any country is really
taking serious measures against these
Germany says that they are doing
but they are consuming the energy of
France which is uranium energy
I mean I don't I think it's a little
better than that the there are steps
being taken to restrict the to move
towards a more sustainable energy system
they're being taken in many places
they're not enough but they're happening
and a very harmful development was that
last November an administration was
elected in the United States which
denies that climate changes take place
and was calling for expanding the use of
the most destructive fossil fuels but
even in the United States it's a split
story so if you go to the there's a
conference right now and international
conference UN conference and Bonn
attempting to the countries of the world
attempting to move forward and setting
standards for moving towards sustainable
energy the United States has two
delegations there one of them is from
the federal government which is saying
let's have more coal let's destroy the
environment the other is from states and
cities Jerry Brown governor of
California Bloomberg former mayor of New
York others are meeting also involuntary
will join the international effort and
it's a it's a real battle and struggle
has to be solved pretty quickly and we
don't have a lot of time to deal with
this it's one of the two major
existential crises that current
generations are now faced the others the
threat of nuclear war also expanding
professor Chomsky thank you for this
interview and nice to have you here in
Mexico thank you
hemos tenido el privilegio de estar con
el professor Noam Chomsky unit electric
sin duda reconocimiento del mundo e que
que las preocupaciones a Bourdon temes
como el de la democracia que hemos
platica con el y los rios goes la
reduccion de la democracia temes como le
Cano Mila localization y las gnosis
truck tours de poder que gobierno nel
mundo y tambien algo muy importante el
papel de los intellectuals a pesar de lo
que hemos estado bien no y Plata condo
Conair el tiene una vision positiva
frente los problemas de medio ambiente
frente a los problemas de una democracy
increases inclusive frente los problemas
Delp LSA i alternate eva's que pueden
podemos seguir ecozone el mucho lo que
los intellectuals pueden decir lo que
los intellectuals NOS pueden descubrir
irregular intellectuals como por ejemplo
el mismo norm Chomsky muchas gracias por
estar con nosotros
