as of today like to discuss
100 journalists 771 students thousands
of political detainees hundred trade
unionists 50 lawyers and many more
prominent intellectuals and academics 9
elected parliament members in jail as
well as convicted artists however
Western countries continue to present
Turkey as an ideal model for the Middle
East how do you explain this
contradictory view of the West it's not
contradictory I mean the West has always
supported dictators much worse ones than
arahant so take say the Arab Spring up
until the point where the army turned
against the dictators the US Britain and
France supported the dictators they
supported Ben Ali and initiated France
supported Mubarak and in Egypt the
leading ally of the United States and
Britain is Saudi Arabia which is the
most extreme Islamic fundamentalist
state a lot the West has nothing against
dictators supports them consistently
what the West is concerned about is
democracy that would be dangers so the
West will try to adjust what it does to
reduce the threat of democracy and to
try to restore in the case of the Arabs
or North African states to restore
something like the old regime but with
new names so in Egypt for example the
United States can is reasonably happy
with the Muslim Brotherhood which they
don't care if they have Islamic you know
if the call for Sharia or something what
they care about is that they accept
neoliberal programs which they do there
are business oriented party which
conforms to us global economic
principles and so they're more or less
acceptable and in fact it takes a
certain genius not to see what's going
on because this is a
that is repeated over and over again
there's a kind of a routine game plan
when your favorite dictator is facing
difficulties what you do is support him
to the last minute if it becomes
impossible to support it say if the army
turns against him with the business
classes turn against then send them off
somewhere try to get rid of an issue
passionate statements about your love of
democracy that's the role of the
intellectuals and then try to restore
the old regime it's been done over and
over again so democracy is a very
serious threat you know all over the
world but in the Arab countries - and so
the policies that are taken essentially
are trying to restore the old regime as
much as possible maybe with new names
you can't do it totally but as much as
possible and that's exactly what you'd
expect it's a traditional policy versus
fact as far back as the history of
imperialism
you have made some positive comments on
a keep in a piece recent policies for
example Turkey's stance against American
foreign policy as well as against Israel
when you look at Turkey's
socio-political environment today as
your perception perception changed well
at there were particular policies that I
did approve of so for example I think it
was quite significant in 2003 that
Turkey didn't accept US orders to become
part of the war against Iraq of course
well the polls in Turkey showed that
about 95 percent of the population were
opposed to it so it's not very dramatic
that the government went along but at
least they did one of the few countries
that did I thought that was a good step
with regard to Israel I think
Turkey's made some steps that are bitter
than others they the one country that
has pressed the Mavi Marmara issue they
have openly opposed
some of us Israeli offensive actions or
that's fine but it's not a general
perception about the AKP
I mean they've done some things I
approve of everything is not OK and when
you look at it today do you think if
your perception has changed in certain
areas do you know what caused this
change can you read the West I mean the
19 could go back a little bit in 1990s
were absolutely horror story starting
around 2000 there was progress I mean
there was a reduction of repression
there were more opportunities for
courage expression you know you didn't
have to be I mean I I'm here the first
time I visited I was in jail but you're
the followed by Turkish security
officers and with the a couple of
Turkish intellectuals I won't mention
their names but and the head of the
actually the Human Rights Watch
represented in Turkey was very good
person I mean if if they saw children
who whose clothes matched the Kurdish
flag that would make us go in another
direction because of the threat to the
families from the television pictures on
the security officers I met people who
were living in caves not driven out of
the villages later and met people in
Turkey in slums and Istanbul hideous
slums and they stumble
the Kurdish refugees are living in
horrible conditions and that that was
what was going on it did ease in the
last ten years it improved went later
it's easier then in the last couple of
years it started to reverse its going
back to harsher repression and to
undercutting the possibilities for some
peaceful and humane settlement of the
Kurdish issues and it's pretty clear how
to proceed if they really want to deal
with it Prime Minister Donn had many
controversial comments and policies
recently during his power he for example
ordered the statue to be removed because
only because it was not up to his taste
in the eastern northern is no part of
Turkey
he told one that they should have at
least three children he targeted at
leasts openly he stated that men and
women are not equal and he personally
makes the list of parliament members to
be elected during the elections and he's
appointing the people loyal to him two
key points in burocracy many journalists
lost their jobs only because they
criticized them and the government can
we still define such a such a regime as
Democratic can you describe the Obama
regime is democratic when it initiates
policies like what I mentioned before
with declaring it to be a support for
terrorism if you speak to a group on the
terrorist list and advise them to turn
to nonviolent measures the Obama
administration is just a supported
legislation which grants the government
authority to place people under
permanent detention without charges if
they're accused of being members of
terrorist groups
actually that caused a little uproar but
only because it extended to American
citizens so there was actually a court
case I was one of the plaintiffs meant
to the court saying that's going to
Florida courts or that so you can't do
to American suitors you can do it anyone
else can do it to you you know is that a
democracy I mean look the democracy is a
mixed story it has or takes a take
elections for example I'm the United
States technically as free elections but
you can predict the outcome of an
election for Congress or president very
well simply by looking at the amount of
campaign funding and you can predict the
policies pretty well by looking at the
concentration of campaign funding that
this quite good research on this and
it's a very hard predictive well I mean
is that democratic that's not that's why
the and the public is aware of it and if
you look at attitudes towards the
government here at public attitudes
towards Congress are the lowest they've
ever been in history a support for
Congress is literally in single digits
support for the president isn't that
much higher opposition to banks is
enormous operation corporations is
enormous there's a huge gap between
public policy and public opinion but
still it's in many ways one of the most
free countries in the world there's no
simple answer to these questions is a
lot of dimensions so yeah the things you
describe are an attack on Turkish
democracy and they're a reversal of what
appeared to be happening for a couple of
years in the early part of the century
there was an improvement now there's a
regression and move towards work
autocratic policies and more repressive
ones of the time you've described well
that's what has to become about it
whether it's in Turkey or in the United
States or anywhere else
I just have one more question do you
have any message for the political
detainees that are in jail in Turkey
right now
the message for them is that we ought to
be doing first of all you would admire
their courage and integrity and
resisting regression but also do
whatever we can to overcome the policies
that have forced them into jail
legitimately and that requires the
International Solidarity and
understanding and information of what's
happening
you
