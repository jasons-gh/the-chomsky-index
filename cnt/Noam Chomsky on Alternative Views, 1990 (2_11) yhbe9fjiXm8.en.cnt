one of the most prominent modern
American political scientists Harold
Lasswell who is a leading figure in
communications and such things he wrote
the article on propaganda in the
international encyclopedia of Social
Sciences which was published in 1933 and
in it he says that we should not succumb
the Democratic dogmatism about men being
the best judges of their own interests
they are not the best judges are the
elites us smart guys the cool observers
and we must therefore be ensured the
means to impose our will for the common
good of course this he said will require
a whole tech new technique of control
largely through propaganda because of
the ignorance and superstition of the
masses same theme all the way through
the basic problem is this the idea is
that if you have a society in which the
voice of the people is heard you got to
make sure that that voice says the right
thing in totalitarian societies it's not
a big problem you got a club in your
hand and if people don't behave the
right way you hit them with a club or
threaten them with it so it doesn't
really matter much what they think what
matters is what they do and that you
control by force but as the capacity of
the state to control by force erodes
it's necessary to control what people
think and in fact I think you find much
more sophisticated concern for thought
control precisely as the society becomes
more free I don't think it's surprising
that the sophisticated discussion things
like the public relations industry and
the academic side of it and you know the
journalistic side and all this kinds of
things have been sampling I suspect if
one did a comparative study you'd find
that they develop primarily in
relatively free societies ours is a very
free society in the sense that the state
has by comparative standards very
limited resources to control by force
and I think it's undoubtedly in fact the
most sophisticated in the terms of in
the reliance on techniques of
indoctrination and control public
relations industry in particular as
American creation you'll notice of
course the close similarity to Leninist
ideology to Bolshevism which also
assumes that the radical intellectuals
are the specialized class the Vanguard
they've got to lead the stupid and
ignorant masses to a better society in
fact the two conceptions are very much
alike I think that's probably one of the
reasons why there's been historically
such an easy transition from one to
another the move from being a Leninist
enthusiast to a you know a passionate
supporter of state capitalism and you
know working for America names that
takes place overnight it's been going on
for years it's called the God that
failed transition and it happens very
simply I mean in the early stages it had
some authenticity to it when people like
Ignacio salona and others were making
this transition but in recent years has
become just a farce I mean technique of
opportunism and the transition is very
easy i think because there isn't much of
a difference in ideological change it's
just a matter of where you think power
lies if you think there's going to be a
popular revolution and you can ride that
revolution to state power and then wield
the whip over the masses you're a
Leninist enthusiast if you see that
that's not going to happen and power
lies in the state capitalist
institutions which you have to serve as
a manager an ideological manager you do
that but it's basically a very similar
position and in fact in the last century
or so since there's been more or less
identifiable secular inteligencia I
think you find typically that they fall
into one or the other of these two
categories they associate themselves
with one or the other system of power
and hierarchy and subordination in fact
what I just said is almost a tautology
it's only if you submit to those systems
that you're counted as a respectable
intellectual for obvious reasons well
coming up to more modern times in the
post-second World War period karoke fine
again deep concern over the need to
control and deceive the public
control the public mind presidential
historian Thomas Bailey wrote in 1948 at
the time when we were sort of setting
off on a new war that Cold War he wrote
because the masses are notoriously
short-sighted and generally cannot see
danger until it's at their throats our
statesmen are forced to deceive them
into an awareness of their own long-run
interests deception of the people may in
fact become increasingly necessary
unless we're willing to give our leaders
in Washington a freer hand and in 1981
as the United States was launching a new
crusade for freedom Samuel Huntington
the professor of government at harvard
said in a private but published
discussion and interchange you may have
to sell intervention or other military
action in such a way as to create the
misimpression that it is the soviet
union that you're fighting that's what
the united states has been doing ever
since the Truman Doctrine which is quite
accurate and gives a certain insight
into the nature of the Cold War in
particular into the nature of the war
against Nicaragua which is what he
specifically had in mind well these
concerns over controlling the public
mind tend to rise to the surface
particularly after periods of wars and
turmoil like the 17th century revolution
the Civil War or like the First World
War when woodrow wilson launched the
major Red Scare which is the major
example in modern American history of
all of American history of state
repression that was really large-scale
and effective in destroying unions and
destroying independent politics and
eliminating independent thought and so
on and the same thing happened after
World War two with the phenomenon that's
mislabeled McCarthyism it's mislabeled
because it was actually initiated by the
liberal democrats in the late 1940s
McCarthy just came along at the tail end
of it and vulgarized it a little the
reason for this is an
is that periods of wars and turmoil have
a tendency to arouse people from apathy
and to make them think and to make them
organized often so that's why you get
things like the Red Scare and
McCarthyism right after periods of war
and turmoil and the same thing happened
after the Vietnam War which had the same
effect after the Vietnam War elites were
concerned about what they called a
crisis of democracy in fact one of the
most interesting books on this topic are
one of the most interesting books on
most of the insightful books I think on
modern on the modern democratic system
is called the crisis of democracy it's a
study the only book-length study
published by the trilateral commission
it's important group put together by
David Rockefeller in 1973 and it
represents the more or less liberal
internationalists from the three major
centers of modern capitalism the United
States Western Europe and Japan and it's
trilateral and remember this is the
liberals this is the group out of which
Jimmy Carter and most of his
administration came the quite what's the
crisis of democracy that they're
concerned with in all of the democratic
societies well the crisis is that during
the 1960's large groups of people who
are normally passive and apathetic began
to try to enter the political arena to
press their demands and that's a crisis
I would has to be overcome the naive
might call that democracy but that's
because they don't understand the
sophisticated understand that that's a
crisis of democracy the American
spokesman again Samuel Huntington wrote
in his report that Harry Truman had been
able to govern the country with the
cooperation of a relatively small number
of Wall Street lawyers and bankers in
those days there was no crisis of
democracy things were working just right
but in the 1960s you got all this
turmoil I mean young people and women
the labor and all kinds of weird people
who were supposed to be sitting quietly
and the corners began to get involved
and caused this crisis I mean the same
crisis that arose in the 17th century
and there repeatedly arises when people
begin to try to take advantage of the
formal opportunities that exist among
the terrible things that were happening
during the 60s causing this crisis they
said was that you had this group of
people who they called value-oriented
intellectuals people who are concerned
with things like truth and justice and
all that sort of nonsense and they're
opposed to the good guys the
technocratic and policy oriented
intellectuals they call them the
commissars that ones who just do the job
which had these value oriented
intellectuals they were doing all sorts
of horrible things like under my D
legitimizing the institutions that are
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young like schools and universities
remember this is an internal discussion
so they kind of let their hair down
there are general proposal at the end of
all of this these lengthy and thoughtful
discussions was that what we need is
more moderation in democracy to mitigate
the excess of democracy and overcome the
crisis
