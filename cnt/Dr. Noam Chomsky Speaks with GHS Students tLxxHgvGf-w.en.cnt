Rick Mohney pick all the people no we're
not gonna mess rulers hello dr. Chomsky
my name is Tristan bayville my name is
all Patel and I'm a cosh Punjabi thank
you very much for speaking with us um
we're representing the Society of young
philosophers and we're very grateful for
you to talk with us you are you waiting
no it's fine thank you very much um
we've got a couple questions for you and
we'd love it if you'd answer all right
we've liked it all right um so our first
question is how do you think the recent
events in Ukraine will affect the future
of not only Europe but the entire world
it's a very difficult situation that's
there is a thread on a major 3somes read
of a militant east-west military
conflict is in the background for the
Russians Ukraine is a very sent part
there of their own lives and existence
of the West remotely trying to encourage
in that area I mrs. if some hostile
power took over say Mexico and was going
to join I don't know the company Chinese
from the world system in the United
States with the enemy but when the
pressure is beyond that actually the
Russian the
that Ukraine has stood the first a large
part of the population is Russian
speaking and supportive of Russia they
hadn't the ones you pushed out of power
now but they're there Russia has a major
naval base military base Ukraine's only
base which is a warm water port we have
more pledged to Russia has only one way
to get through of basically
international waters us through your
black support as Ukraine the so it's
this trip and Russia has moved troops in
portray the claims team military
maneuver totally believes that so it is
potentially threatening how the turnout
is very unclear for one thing because
it's unclear who the opposition is to go
on the west applause from this wonderful
Democrats but when you look closely it
said it's a mixture that's not not very
appealing in many ways there's a lot of
neo-fascist in the Nazi elements that
fish elements in anti-semitic elements
maybe they're not dominant we don't
really know much about but certainly in
the background and how this will sort
out is very difficult to say I'm the
country basically split arms down the
middle between the war progression and
more for a Wesen of course the West
Julian stoles / western part but
how does one term I thought I think it's
not so clear and it does have a
threatening acid do you want an
expression all right the second question
we have is what is the significance of
educating students in all areas of
learning despite their intended
specialization for example a future
engineer learning about poetry and with
you wouldn't want to live the bitchin
good life you want to be dedicated
person you're on got a veteran that's
basically the end if an education is
directed trying to expand people's
capabilities let them understanding that
breaks the lives of course or include
them the treasures of the civilization
that thing cumulated and repented or
encouraged and participating not just a
revote crusade or music or listen music
participate that's what a real education
is open that Akane you could have saved
occasional training we train people to
work in a certain skill and that's what
they do the rest of their lives but
that's not educating a person on the
contrary that's that's undermines your
education another question we have is a
what aspect of today's education is
failing everyone you hear in the news
all the time how the education system is
failing our students but what aspect do
you think is that that they're referring
to or
the education is going pretty well
country versus adult both do it and for
the past 30 years great there's been a
major campaign condemning the
educational systems failing and saying
we therefore active changing and the
changes are partly to privatize that is
undermine the public education system
that's part of the general effort during
the Europe Neil little hero to transfer
more and more the power into
unaccountable private hands organization
and thus one of these happenings of the
public education system the other thing
is to redirect the educational system
internally so that it becomes more
business or in teaching the next
corporatization the university's
installing business models of support
that takes a teaching to test the
teaching test is a perfect way to
undermine and educational I mean I'm
sure all of you just like me that of
course is where you weren't interesting
the course so you stay to the exam so
the best pass the exam the week later
about accordions about yeah that's good
actually that's it a model it was
condemned hundreds of years ago for me
enlighten it was described as a model of
Education in which you pour liquid into
a vessel and then the vessel pours it
out again that they left them must
contact the fish is supposed to induce
people encourage the young people to
create Explorer you know the challenge
think themselves of our joy discovery
doesn't matter how many
they give you a fence any period schools
are underfunded seriously underfunded
features are poorly paid as distinct
from OPEC countries teachers
hebbronville respect in the United
States it's a respected profession in
most of the front knee goes a Finland
which has the highest educational
standards by Muslim fists teachings very
respected education that teachers are
given freedom of the right to vote their
curriculums and the result server are
both excellent the claim that the
schools are underperforming is simply
untrue there's the c1 actual serious
evidence that some of one of the best
studies but a very perspective that
scholar education scholars and ravaged
it was interesting because she came out
of a very conservative background Reagan
I background but we thought her views
and just you know a recent book which
because there's a lot of data on this so
given the way school to create or
perform pretty respectively but they
claim that their underperforming is a
step towards instruction like if you
want to suppose you want to privatize
the Margaret Thatcher and it wouldn't
want to privatize the Broward so what do
you do first you on your fine one so
that I'll working very well if you won't
mind you and then you start making a lot
of publicity about a lawful way on then
you hand them over to private enterprise
and of course they performing works and
then you have to kind of read you know
get the public back in again that
happens all the time but that's part of
the drift towards the whole concept
privatization is a way of transferring
things from the public into
unaccountable pans is something that you
know you're supposed to be mine eyes
and a lot wrong the government but one
of the properties of them is it somewhat
responsible to the population the word
democratic a society is the mortgage
response private hands are a hundred
percent unresponsive private corporation
you have no role none you're in the book
it's in the hands of its a tyrannical
organization powers at the top is down
to the bottom it has a one
responsibility to make money we see the
effects of privatization in the United
States takes the health after the United
States from up from the developed
countries the United States by far the
most privatized health care system kinda
unique in that respect it's also the
worst in the developed world has twice
the per capita costs of comparable
countries as some of the worst out you
know that's the result of putting health
into the ends of the corporations which
have no interest in golf whatsoever an
insurance company is not interested in
health verax making them so if you put
health care in their hand that's exactly
what they're going to do we expect them
to do their institutional nature in
requirement and they were of course
they'll make all kind of nice things
they both people help you know the best
that's not what business is about the
business is not about the beneficial
organization so by making money and the
same is going to be true you put the
educational system into those men and
the propaganda you're talking about is
evidence part the effort to undermine
and chassis is it a more subtle reason
for the attack of public education but
also the same with the attack on social
security the education is based on
principle the principle is that I care
with a huge
i'm willing to pay taxes so that the kid
across the street could school my age on
our kids in school learning that bran
children school but in a the public
education system is based on the
assumption that I should care enough so
that I will improve it to butter me
point school you care about the people
the same a social security it's based on
the idea that I should care about the
disabled widow across town but she get
food now there is a drift kind of an
ideological derision aside a lot of
every propaganda trying to drive people
to believe I want to make responsibility
said to myself I I want to enrich myself
amount representing else at the kind of
extreme over and get it in Iran but it's
all over this is done this is a major
stress of the ideology in the modern
Middle that ruler goes way back back to
the mid 19th centuries beginning of the
Industrial Revolution and the working
people and Massachusetts started we're
complaint denouncing Lee what they call
the new spirit of the age being well
forgetting all that stuff you all heard
that it's been a hundred years of trying
to drive it into people's head and of
course you get a savage brutal society
that point the one is great for the
people as well and the power truth
finder when Elsa cuz that's the only
thing that's important than we're
ingratiate now but if people have
sympathy with other solidarity's others
this is a sense of mutual support and so
on you both are pretty different on each
side it's kind of a ironic that the
exponents of this new appeal by Adam
Smith Adam Smith had exactly the
opposite view he shot that society ought
to be based on
sympathy so very in mutual support in
fact his famous phrase invisible ten he
almost never used many two or three
times one of the uses was to say that
and talk about England is if some rich
landlord to Hewlett's a huge amount plan
he will never be more appropriately well
for himself it will be a motivated to
make sure that other that poor people
have enough it by and therefore as if by
an invisible hand the society will
become a gala Terry that's because of
sympathy is all there that's not the
what the people who screamed out of
Smith today is name but and I think part
of the attack on some public schools
just comes back to that it's based on a
dangerous radical notion mention care
about other people you should care about
the that shows up everywhere like right
now say we are marching towards of
precedence fast fast and environmental
destruction three series that we're
maximizing the effort to get others a
euphoria of Saudi Arabia 21st century
hundred years of energy independence
gotta get every drop of fossil fuel out
of the ground now I'm not saying let's
race over the Christmas as possible well
that's that's means that one of the
things don't care about is the fate of
your friendship what you hear about is
how much will I get happen tomorrow I
don't care what happens to my
grandchildren or two people who fumbled
ish or going to be wiped out on now
that's the essence of this principle
it's just a distant and destructive and
you hear it all the time
yeah um so many of us are actually in
economics right now and we're studying
in the class so like we've noticed that
laissez-faire capitalism is treated as
if it's a nearly perfect way of
distributing resources and basically
every other economic system is
considered inferior so what's like the
benefits of schools teaching other
systems besides capitalism teacher you
besides apples they're teaching you
about the United States which is very
remote cabin with society determine that
you use computer to the internet and
where they come from mostly from the
state sector like most of the advanced
economy its development public expense
substantially in the state sector of the
economy a few posts like right where I'm
sitting I wish is where the nineteen
fifties or sixties computers and the
internet were being ago about what hun
represent public expense now after many
years of development a center ended over
private enterprise to market and make
profits from do return on television
come to rehab Emma will get an ad the
advertising industry is most radically
anti-capitalist course in the society
you took an economics or economics
courses so you learn about markets right
all right and you learn that markets are
based on import and swimmers making
rational choices is that what the
advertising industry spends there have
been in thousand years would when you
look at an ad is it per se a car is it
trying to create an informed consumer
who will make a rational choice no I'll
time they were radically anti-capitalist
they hate capitalism or take a look
the financial institution with the
dominance of anxiety now recently there
was a study by the International
Monetary front of the big banks in the
United States asking where their profits
came turned out their profits come
almost entirely from the government
insurance policy what's called too big
to fail it's not just dail out it's also
access to cheap credit higher credit
ratings because the gun no matter what
risky transaction in a if it collapses
the tax Bureau fail and he'll pay or so
of course they get higher credit ratings
and so on actually bloomberg news
business breasts try to estimate the
numbers now they can do about 83 million
dollars a year given to the big banks
from you from the taxpayer that capital
I mean this who chronically any capital
is right and that's true across the
society I'm their element that's it
capitalism but it's basically socialism
for the rich and capitalism to the poor
and if they don't teach you that an
economics course something wrong
front-end economics courses turned on
and open at is and you can compare that
with what a marketing supposed to be
that you can read the great personal
business brace up the big banks no
freedom doesn't take a lot look at the
history computers in the internet o
satellites or micro electronics for
pharmaceuticals for that matter large
part of it serious work research
development heart Boston work under
those the marketing and no that's enough
private section pushing make profit up
I'm intake say to the pilot bill bh one
of the richest maybe richest man in the
world much later they sent taxpayer
subsidy he was able to move it some
clever things with
to geta after the basic work on hardware
and software even done poetry packet out
a way to and gain and monopoly which is
again radically at a cabin with Windows
virtual not so there's a virtual
monopoly Brennan anti-capitalist that
enabled Microsoft to make huge killings
on has reached and the world that cabin
someone wrote notes are on right thank
you thank you very much thank you to the
darkie thank you stare like he's gone
hey how are you hang up on Chomsky I
couldn't hang on
I wasn't Ellis Thomas Davis I 15 for my
house I think you heard what he said
right about funding you start talking
about the privatization of education and
what they're doing it if you don't pay
attention to what happens in state
statutes with education it's looking
less why you care
