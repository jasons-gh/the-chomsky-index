well let me start with my favorite
philosopher David Hume who was notorious
for liking paradoxes and one of the
paradoxes that he came across was when
he was reflecting on the first
principles of government and what caught
his attention was that I'll quote him he
said I find nothing more surprising than
to see the easiness with which the many
are governed by the few and to observe
the implicit submission with which men
resigned their own sentiments and
passions to those of their rulers when
we inquire by what means this wonder is
brought about we shall find that as
force is always on the side of the
governed the governor's have nothing to
support them but opinion it is therefore
on opinion only that government is
founded and this maximum extends to the
most despotic and most military
governments as well as the most free and
most popular that's what i mean by Humes
Maxim and seasonally reasonably well
supported but it does require a
qualification it applies with much
greater force to the more free and
popular governments as it becomes more
difficult to control the population by
force actually that was already becoming
clear in Humes day and well before he
was writing a century after the first
democratic revolution in England in the
1640s and at that time
those who described themselves as the
men of best quality were appalled as
quote them a giddy multitude of beasts
and men's shapes rejected the basic
framework of the civil conflict that was
raging at the time in England between
King and Parliament they rejected rule
by king or Parliament they called for
government by countrymen like ourselves
that nowhere wants not by knights and
gentlemen that make us laws and are
chosen for fear and do but a press s and
do not know the people sores and the
manifest quality were deeply offended by
this naturally they recognized as they
put it that if the people are so
depraved and corrupt as to confer places
of power and trust upon wicked and
undeserving men they forfeit their power
in this behalf unto those who are good
though but a few namely us the men of
best quality that persists right to the
present fundamentally the same
principles underlie the u.s.
constitutional system you read the
debates in the Constitutional Convention
you see that quoting Madison that the
system was designed to ensure that power
would remain in the hands of what called
the wealth of the nation those who
sympathize with property owners and
their rights and those who understand
that a primary goal of government is to
protect to ensure that the majority of
the opulent are protected from the
majority this is Madison's explanations
during a constitutional convention
actually raised issues that go back to
Aristotle who incidentally took the
opposite position looking at the same
dilemmas well that however became more
difficult over time
what the run through the year history
which you know and it led to growing
concerns in fact it was one factor that
lay behind what is one of the really
great contributions of American society
namely the introduction of mass public
education not without qualifications
which for example were noted by Ralph
Waldo Emerson he commented that
political leaders call for popular
education because they fear that this
country is filling up with thousands and
millions of voters and you must educate
them to keep them from our throats but
educated the right way of course you
have to limit their perspectives and
understanding you have to discourage
free and independent thought has to
train them for obedience gas theft
programs like No Child Left Behind the
race to the top and so on designed for
these purposes very live issues right at
the moment well it shouldn't be any
surprise that the most sophisticated
propaganda systems developed in the most
free societies actually that follows
from the qualification to Humes Maxim
the first was Britain the British
Ministry of Information of course they
always have good Orwellian titles the
Ministry of Information was its task was
to direct the thought of most of the
world but they didn't care about most of
the world what they cared most about was
progressive American intellectuals like
the Dewey circle and they had a task to
their task was to drive a reluctant
public to war and they thought they had
achieved this very well they took great
pride in their achievement and their own
words from the New Republic their main
they said the task of the intellectuals
which they carried out was to serve as
the faithful and helpful interpreters of
what seems to be one of the greatest
enterprises ever undertaken by an
American president of course Wilson's
decision to enter the European war
immediately after complaining and
winning on peace without victory and the
achievement of the intellectuals as they
described it was to impose their will
upon a reluctant or indifferent majority
using such devices as fabrications about
hun atrocities that were provided to
them by the british ministry of
information there were of course a few
scattered who refused to participate in
the great enterprise so for example
Randolph born he was barred from the
intellectual journals others were jailed
like Bertrand Russell or Eugene Debs
here Rosa Luxemburg in Germany but
they're small periphery most of the
intellectuals lined up enthusiastically
in the noble enterprise on all sides and
that's pretty characteristic well Wilson
I'm sure you know quickly found at his
own propaganda agency another Orwellian
title the Committee on Public
Information called the Creole Commission
and it was very successful the
population had been generally pacifist
but within months they were turned into
raving daddy German fanatics it was
quite an impressive achievement
and these grand successes inspired a
progressive Democratic theorists and
also the huge public relations industry
which is just beginning to develop at
the time among the notable members of
the krill Commission were walter
lippmann leading public intellectual
20th century the author of were called
progressive essays on democracy and
another was edward bernays one of the
founders of the public relations
industry both of them incidentally were
I'm sure you know were Wilson Roosevelt
Kennedy liberals you know on what we
call the left end of the spectrum I
won't talk about the right and his what
are called his progressive essays on
democracy Lippmann drew explicitly very
explicitly from the achievements of
thought control carried out by the
Creole Commission and so did burn eyes
referred specifically to these great
achievements in what he came one of the
first manuals of the of the pr industry
it was called propaganda that term was
then used freely it took on negative
connotations during the second world
wars of now the terms used mostly for
propaganda of the enemies in some
languages there's a Hebrew for example
makes a distinction between a word
propaganda which means what those guys
do and the word translates as
explanation which refers to what we do
since it's so obviously right all you
have to do is explain it and we have the
same usage without the splittin term so
we don't use propaganda for our
presentation of our own propaganda the
alipin and Bearnaise
and they were and other prominent
figures two were very much impressed by
what they called the engineering of
consent bearnaise a manufacturer of
consent the lips and Lippmann which had
been called a new art and democracy and
the goal was the same as the manifest
quality in seventeenth-century was
necessary to ensure as they put it that
the intelligent minority that's the men
of best quality must rule and not
troubled by the trampling and the roar
of the bewildered heard these guys out
there who are ignorant and medals and
outsiders they do have a function in a
democratic system let's call the
function their function is to trample
periodically in support of one or
another members of the manifest quality
the leadership class that's what we call
an election the free society needs some
quoting still a mechanism which controls
the public mind and enables the
intelligent minorities so to mold the
mind of the masses that they will throw
their newly gained strength in the
desired direction in this way so between
educational systems that keep them from
our throats and propaganda systems that
regiment their minds so that they do the
right thing voluntarily we can perhaps
ensure that the men of best quality will
be saved from the raging rabble the have
to continue to regiment the public mind
much as an army regiments the body of
its soldiers and this process of
engineering of consent is the very
essence of democracy of the democratic
process the same was true in scholarly
world term propaganda entered the
Encyclopedia Britannica in 1922 one of
the leading scholarly figures dealing
with propaganda was
Harold Lasswell also liberal progressive
he advocated the sophisticated use of
what he called the new technique of
control of the general public that was
pioneered by woodrow wilson the great
Generalissimo on the propaganda front he
explained that the public is a threat to
order because of the ignorance and
superstition of the masses and we should
not succumb to democratic dogmatism
'he's about men being the best judges of
their own interests they are not the
best judges we are the men of best
quality so we've got a workout organized
the world so that for their own benefit
we rule just as you don't let a
three-year-old child run into the
streets couldn't let the masses express
their opinion freely or even have an
opinion again runs through the
educational system the propaganda system
we don't call it propaganda and so on we
call it public relations often and the
main function of the public relations
industry of course is commercial
advertising extremely successful in the
United States it influenced others
gurbles for example was quite impressed
with American commercial advertising and
tried to mimic it to successfully
unfortunately the Bolsheviks also were
impressed and tried to mimic it but very
clumsily so didn't work but weren't
sophisticated enough in the United
States and Britain the main task is what
Veblen called fabricating consumers and
directing people to the superficial
things of life like fashionable
consumption don't mind if you're quoting
you okay
business leaders the public relations
industry also now pretty much runs
elections and the very well aware of it
so for example as you may recall after
Obama's election in nineteen 2008 that
have to be right before the annual
meeting of the professional society of
advertisers they give an award every
year for the best marketing campaign of
the year and they gave it to Obama and
the if you look at the business press
like Financial Times reports about the
reactions of business leaders really
pretty excited about this they have a
new model for diluting the public which
was just worked out so effectively in
the Obama campaign by his PR managers
the and running elections is pretty much
like commercial advertising the main
function of commercial advertising is to
undermine markets that's transparent it
takes genius not to notice it anyone has
taken an economics course knows that
markets are supposed to be based on
informed consumers and making rational
choices and anyone who's turned on a TV
set though is that commercial
advertising is designed to achieve the
opposite effect to create uninformed
consumers who would make irrational
choices if we had market systems we have
information presented but when you can't
have markets allow market systems
because of oligopoly and cutting down
price wars and so on then you have to
undermine markets which is the main
function of commercial advertising huge
amounts of money every year and when you
move to the political domain it's
essentially the same the kind of
democratic theory you learn in eighth
grade civics classes is about informed
voters making rational choices but
election campaigns are designed to
ensure that you have
uninformed consumers making irrational
choices although in a sense rational
because the regimented minds are
supposed to be directed and in the
proper direction by the men of best
quality well this usually were often
works well but it often does not and the
fact that it doesn't work well is
illustrated by here an enormous gap
across the board foreign policy domestic
policy between public opinion and policy
on many crucial issues fortunately we're
going to be defended from knowing
anything about this pretty soon there's
a new amendment and the Coburn amendment
and in Congress's states that the NSF
can't provide any more support for
political science unless it's the work
is designed to improve competitiveness
and the economy so put an end to all of
these studies of public opinion and
policy with all of their dangerous
conclusions the main conclusions that
have come out of quite good recent work
on professional political science are
people like the Martin Guillen's Larry
Bartels main page and others is to show
that about seventy percent of the
population the lower seventy percent on
the income scale are almost completely
disenfranchised that their opinions have
no effect on policy and as you move up
the scale you get greater and greater
influence at the very top you know tenth
of one percent essentially you get what
you want there's a recent study by Ben
Larry Bartels on one of the issues on
the front pages namely what to do how
what about the deficit and it turns out
predictably that the higher you go up on
the wealth income scale the more
concerned there is for the deficit as
you get down to the great mass of the
population the rabble they're concerned
with jobs they don't care about the
deficit they're quite right but the
bank's one concern about the deficit the
rich one concerned about the deficit so
when we have a sequester it's about the
deficit not about job and the policy is
just sharply the distinct from a opinion
on this and also rationality there's a
much more important case a very striking
one which may have to do with survival
of a decent survival of the species now
that's environmental disaster it's built
into market systems that you must have
environmental catastrophe of course we
don't really have a market system but to
the limited extent that we have it's
driving in that direction and the pub
there are huge propaganda campaigns
probably public by Chamber of Commerce
American Petroleum Institute and so on
to try to convince the population not to
worry about it nothing doesn't matter
because from a business point of view a
destruction of the environment is an
externality and a kind of thing ever in
a footnote in economics articles it's
just one of those things that happens
when you're trying to maximize utility
and transactions but the public doesn't
agree the United States is somewhat off
the spectrum in policy the United States
way off the spectrum internationally
it's the only country out of
over a hundred relevant ones that it
doesn't even have a national policy on
emissions or national goals on
alternative energy but the public
doesn't agree the public is quite close
to the scientific consensus and the
general international consensus and
that's caused serious concerns the
american legislative exchange council
alec this corporate funded group that
designs legislation for states and it's
pretty effective because of its clout
coach brothers and all those guys they
have a new program designed to overcome
the danger of the public being too
rational paying too much attention to
the overwhelming scientific consensus
the program is a k-12 education program
to try to introduce what they call
balanced teaching into the school's
balanced teaching means we'll say
something about what's agreed by 99% of
the scientists in the world all the
National Academies of science ever
science journal so we'll mention that
but we have to balance it by talking
about the climate change denial and how
nothing's happening and if something is
happening humans have nothing to do with
it or maybe as Michele Bachmann put it
if something's happening it's God's
punishment for homosexuality or whatever
the reason may be but we have to have
balance teaching balance teaching and
interest as critical thinking and that's
already been adopted by several states
and probably will go on it's kind of
like what's called balanced teaching of
evolution theory along with creation
theory because
students have to have children have to
have open minds well it's necessary to
you may recall that a couple of months
ago at the Republican governors
conference bobby Jindal warned the
Republicans that they're going to become
the stupid party but Alec it goes beyond
they and the corporate sector generally
they want it to be the stupid nation to
make sure that you don't interfere with
what really matters a short-term profit
making the matter what happens in the
longer term well one of the ways to deal
with the gaps between public opinion and
the goals of dominant power centers is
just to ignore the public as is done
pretty successfully when say seventy
percent of the public has no influence
on policy and take a look at senatorial
decisions they don't pay any attention
to the lower third maybe a little
attention to the middle Thor quite a lot
of attention as you go on up of course
about half the population don't even
vote in presidential elections look at
the people that don't vote they tend to
be the more poor overwhelmingly
Democrats and more important than that
Social Democrats they want welfare state
measures and so on and jobs stimulus and
so on so better for them not to vote and
the various devices to achieve that as
I'm sure you know the Republican Party
is trying to right now push through all
kinds of devices to prevent the rabble
from voting Democrats the ones vote
either cus they have the wrong thoughts
and probably nobody's really studied it
not a single study as far as I know but
it's probable that people don't vote
just because they without reading the
professional literature and political
science they know that what they think
just doesn't matter in a plutocracy so
why should they bought it seems to be
what's happening well that's one way to
to get rid of the gravel ensure that the
men of best quality rule and another way
is to turn to control of the public mind
then accord with Humes maxim and the
various ways it's been implemented over
the years particularly in the free
societies than the in the united states
and the most free society in the most
sophisticated forms and there's been
plenty of successes up to the present
moment some of them pretty spectacular
but there's always been resistance it's
always a problem to keep the rabble
under control and of course it's by no
means necessary to accept the task that
is assigned to the educated classes the
one illustrated by the self praise of
the left liberal intellectuals during
world war one often elsewhere that's
unfortunately the case that that task
usually is accepted back to the earliest
recorded history but it's not a law of
nature
