so now there's a question about your
view on artificial intelligence and that
the threat or hope that it presents when
anyone asks that question the first
thing that comes to mind is a famous
comment that was made by a great
biologist at MIT Jerry leptin in a
debate about artificial intelligence
back around 1960 and at the end of the
debate he conceded that artificial
intelligence was pretty interesting but
he said it was miss named should have
been called natural stupidity but it's a
bit unfair but not totally there's a lot
of hype about our artificial
intelligence and there are some
achievements like say Google Translator
achievement robotics can make some
achievements but it's doing very little
in from a scientific point of view it's
achieving things from a kind of an
engineering point of view which is ok
nobody should be opposed to bigger
bulldozers if they work now but we
shouldn't be mislead about the insight
that it's supposed to be providing into
the nature of intelligence it's not
doing that it's often some other
direction so it's a valuable pursuit
which can be useful if it does insofar
as it is part of science which it is
partially it's just ordinary cognitive
science an effort to try to find the
nature of intelligent behavior using
computer-based models as a technique of
research and it's fine that it's pretty
close to the kind of work of I don't
know all my life myself but the the you
should be pretty cautious about
evaluating the PR that's associated with
it which often pretty often is quite
remote from the actual level of insight
obtained by these measures now there are
also threats of artificial intelligence
see
that's particularly true in the weapon
system if the weapon system becomes
automated we're in deep trouble
automated systems fail all the time any
of you who have computers are familiar
with this they cannot be made reliable
and if they're unless there are very
narrow controls tight controls they can
blow up actually I gave a couple of
cases when I was talking past cases we
know the u.s. record is fairly open the
Russian record is probably much worse we
don't know but in the u in the case of
the United States there have been
literally hundreds of cases when there
were the autumn the the automated
detection systems that detect an alleged
missile attack just gave the wrong
answer misfire and often we were within
minutes of responding a human
intervention interceded and that's going
to be true pretty generally that's a
serious problem
so using AI and the weapon system is
something extremely dangerous as is the
weapon system itself in other areas the
techniques can often be useful the fear
the idea that say robotics are going to
displace working people and you know
people will be out of jobs with all
these smart machines around there's just
no evidence for that at all I mean if
you look around the country there's a
huge amount of work to be done take a
walk in any city you know they're all
falling apart plenty of things to be
done
education way underfunded research to
vastly more the vast needs all over the
place there are plenty of idle hands
there are resources to use those idle
hands to do the necessary work but the
system is so
corrupt that it can't put them together
that's the problem not the fear that
robots are going to displays us in fact
to the extent that dull boring work can
be taken over by automata that's
liberating it frees people to do more
interesting things including having
leisure the United States has much less
leisure than comparable countries and
nothing wrong with using leisure to
enrich your own lives and whatever way
you choose and there's certainly nothing
wrong with freeing people to do more
creative independent work and let the
robots do the boring and dangerous stuff
