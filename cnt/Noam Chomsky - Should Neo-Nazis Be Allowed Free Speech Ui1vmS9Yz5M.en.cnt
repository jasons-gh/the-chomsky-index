I don't think the way to deal with
neo-fascist groups is to try to shut him
out forcefully you should try to win the
argument it's it's quite remarkable to
see how it works so it takes a Holocaust
denial in a lot of Europe the Holocaust
denial is a crime in France it's a there
were laws against it you can't do it in
the United States it's not a crime the
consequence is that in the United States
Holocaust denial is unknown there's
plenty of it
you know there's professors that tenured
professors and universities who
published books denying the Holocaust
nobody pays any attention to as
ridiculous or I forget about it it's
just crazy business in France and a lot
of Europe it's all over the front pages
ton of publicity you know some guy
somewhere does some marginal thing
everybody knows about it that's it's a
way of giving publicity to Holocaust
denial if you treat it the sensible way
it's about like somebody claiming the
earth is flat okay forget it
there's no no in fact I just don't think
it's even tactically the right way to
deal with say you know fascist groups
and it does give them an argument as you
said they can claim freedom of speech
which is a valuable
