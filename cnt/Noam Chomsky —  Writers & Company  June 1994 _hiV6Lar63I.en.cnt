I'm Eleanor Wachtel and this is writers
and company today dissident intellectual
and world famous linguist Noam Chomsky
described as a latter-day Copernicus
Chomsky has turned around the way we
think about language and about political
discourse in democracies the most
frequently quoted praise of Noam Chomsky
originates in the New York Times Book
Review it says Noam Chomsky is arguably
the most important intellectual alive
today these words appear on the dust
jackets of Chomsky's books and they're
mentioned whenever reporters talk about
chomsky's political activism the irony
is that for Chomsky the New York Times
is one of the major perpetrators of what
he calls a web of deceit or thought
control in a Democratic Society the
story goes that Chomsky's dentist notice
that he'd been grinding his teeth his
wife observed that it wasn't happening
at night when he was asleep eventually
they figured out it was occurring every
morning when Chomsky reads the New York
Times Noam Chomsky is an iconoclast and
an assiduous gadfly of power he speaks
for no particular ideology and no party
claims him despite his fierce critique
of American foreign policy during the
Cold War he was no favorite of the
Soviet Union either his works even his
scholarly writings on linguistics were
banned there in Chomsky's view the
responsibility of intellectuals is to
speak the truth and expose lies he said
that more than 25 years ago and he still
believes that today the Oxford Companion
to the English language says that
Chomsky is considered to be the most
influential figure in linguistics in the
later 20th century in the late 50s and
60s Chomsky argued that humans have an
innate capacity to learn language a kind
of deep grammar that is bred in the bone
and as part of our genetic makeup a
fundamental element of being human he
said is the ability to create language
the impact of his work was so great it's
been dubbed the Chomsky and revolution
according to the citation index in the
arts and humanities and the social
sciences
ski is the most cited living author and
he ranks eighth if you include living
and dead writers beating out Hagel and
Cicero Noam Chomsky is 65 years old and
he maintains a daunting schedule he
spends several days a week on the road
lecturing 20 hours a week answering mail
plus his day job as a professor of
linguistics at MIT he produces about a
book a year I estimated forty five
titles he said he didn't know for sure I
talked to Noam Chomsky from National
Public Radio Station WGBH in Boston the
picture that I have is of a really
tireless dedicated and even ascetic life
and on a long time ago that's how Norman
Mailer described you after sharing a
jail cell briefly because of a vietnam
war protest to use the word ascetic how
does that word sit with you it's more or
less accurate I guess although you might
do plenty of things to that are quite
totally self-indulgent I even think
increasing now that I have grandchildren
can you give me an example of a
self-indulgent playing with my
grandchildren for example that's that's
the maximum of self-indulgence is it I
was waiting for something a little
richer you know richer oh well you know
over the summer we I go into total
hermit over the summer the only way I've
been able I've discovered over the years
of the only way I can survive this
schedule from beginning of September
through the end of June as to disappear
entirely over the summer and you know
barely answer the telephone see a couple
of old friends and family comes by and
that sort of thing and then I work most
of my wife and I both work most of the
day but we will take off in the late
afternoon and go swimming or had peugeot
sale i have sailboat out there that sort
of thing that's even during the summer
you'll be working most of the day oh
yeah most of the day you once said that
it's not unlikely that literature will
forever give far deeper insight into
what is sometimes called the full human
person that any modes of scientific
inquiry might may hope to do and yet you
rarely refer to work so
the imagination how have you been
influenced by fiction um that's hard to
say I I read a lot of fiction I read a
lot more when i was younger i do
actually refer to it now and then but
it's it creates one's sensibility in
ways that are hard to explain
understanding of people and what they do
would enrich is one one's intuition in
particular ways i find it hard to point
to when you read fiction what do you
turn to Eternia I have fairly
conservative tastes usually 19th early
20th century literature sometimes modern
things I was struck and maybe just the
sort of the nature of the world that I
move in which is more literary and I've
struck my sentencing that you said about
how you'd always been resistant
consciously resistant to allowing
literature to influence your beliefs and
attitudes in so far as I can so for
example I would not like not just
literature but the visual arts
documentaries and so on but I it it's
one thing to have your your imagination
stimulated and heightened and so on it's
another thing to find the truth entity
one can't get out of one skin naturally
but to the extent that self-awareness
and self-criticism allows I would try to
put to the side intuitive feelings
emotional reactions perspectives that
are not determined by the evidence
itself that's a an unattainable ideal
and I don't claim to attain it and I
don't even know the extent to which i
try but at least one ought to as a
normative principle I think it's a good
one noam chomsky i'd like to get at the
origin of your sense of justice your
sympathy for the underdog
the origins like the origin of my life
or and it's the origin my life comes
from having grown up in the depression i
suppose and early childhood memories
being people coming to the door and
trying to sell rags or apples or
something like that driving in a coming
traveling a trolley car passed a textile
factory where limiter on strike and
watching police riot where they beat the
strikers and and then on to the
experience that isn't immediate or the
kind of experience that comes from
reading from from film from secondary
sources plus plenty of personal
experience there's there's an from
another point of view it just comes from
the assumption that human beings have
fundamental intrinsic rights which are
infringed upon in it numerous ways
leading to sometimes grievous injustice
right before our eyes and a particular
concern to the extent that we ourselves
I myself let's am involved in it so I'm
much more concerned about crimes
committed say by the united states where
i have some degree of responsibility
than for the crimes of Genghis Khan I
could get upset about those but I can't
do much about them what effect do you
think it had on you to grow up in a
neighborhood in Philadelphia that that
was Pro Nancy during the early days of
the war that was kind of frightening I
was we were the open for large part of
my childhood the only Jewish family in a
neighborhood that was mainly german and
irish catholic very heady semitic most
of the kids went to Catholic school in
fact I should say that until I was well
past the age of reason I still had a
kind of a visceral fear of Catholics in
Catholic school it was hard to overcome
when I met people like say the
berrigan's and others although I knew it
was irrational
I the the neighborhood was pro-nazi this
was the 1930s and I recall celebrations
when Paris fell my brother and I knew
that we had particular paths that we
could take not others to you know get to
the bus or to the store or whatever I
don't want to exaggerate that either I
mean the anti-semitism was real but you
could still play with the kids you know
or you never knew what was going to
happen next but so there's a little
weariness but some to some extent part
in the neighborhood that was always in
the background and then of course the
what was I was the what was happening in
Europe was very frightening I mean I can
remember listening to Hitler's Nuremberg
rallies not really understanding but
understanding my parents reactions and
then by the time I was say you know
eight or nine or ten are able to
understand what was happening in the
world to some extent watching one part
of Europe after another fall to
hitlerism I was that that was
frightening especially when right nearby
me and around me I could see the
resonances of it so that your anarchist
interests go way back to early childhood
how did that come about I find it a hard
to picture a early Gemini yeah I know
young a young kid and having a grasp of
that or an affinity to that well I was
very miss is the 1930s remember which
was a very lively exciting period with
lots of political debate and discussion
a lot of all those deep depression lots
of hope for the future my family was
large part of it was unemployed the
working class but though there was the
poverty objectively speaking was worse
than unemployment was certainly much
worse than anything we have nevertheless
there was a sense of hopefulness and
discussion and debate and work and I
grew up in the midst of that and became
very much involved the entry
in all these issues and by the time I
was old enough to sort of act on my own
at all I I was frequenting fourth Avenue
bookstores in New York anarchist offices
picking up literature talking to people
or members that put the relatives who
were involved in these movements and
concerns were important later holder
other people I met Matt now the Spanish
Civil War was one event that really
caught my interest enormously I actually
guess the first article I wrote or can
remember writing was right after the
fall of Barcelona and your two later I
was beginning to pick up the anarchist
pamphlets and literature and think about
what had happened then the and and what
it meant and those interests and
concerns would simply never changed i
mean my my own greatest political
involvement at that time was with in
what was then palestine what became
Israel later this is early 1940s I was I
grew up in a famine a virtual ghetto I
suppose my family were my parents were
both deeply they lived primarily in a in
a Jewish environment a Jewish sort of
first-generation immigrant environment
they're both Hebrew teachers and the
important thing in life was the revival
of Hebrew culture and the the cultural
revival of in Palestine and the i would
read Hebrew literature with my father
from childhood nineteenth and twentieth
century Hebrew literature and older
sources of course I spent my time in
Hebrew school later became hebrew
teacher and out of all of this came a
very
connected with my political interest
this naturally converged to an interest
in Zionism and I was at that time that
committed to a a wing of the Zionist
movement which was signet still
significant in the 1940s which was
opposed to a Jewish state though it was
considered part of a live part of the
Zionist movement and was concerned with
the possibility of arab-jewish
cooperation in a framework of
cooperative socialist institutions and
so on I never actually joined anything I
wasn't much of a joiner than the actual
movements that were involved in these
things I was I couldn't I was associated
with them but i could never join them
because they were all either Stalinist
ER trotskyist and I was very anti
Leninist already at that time
anti-marxist in fact and so I well I
agreed with them about lots of things I
could never really become a member I did
actually live on a kibbutz from those
groups some years later for several mob
for a brief period in fact thought of
staying there but joining was an
impossibility because of my anarchist
commitment these anarchists commits
going back to such a young age I mean
the fall of Barcelona writing this piece
for the school newspaper when you were
ten saying that from the time you were
around that age around the 12 or 13 that
your views haven't really changed that
much what what is I'm obviously they've
gotten more sophisticated but what does
that say about you that your views would
be so firmly fixed at such a young age
hmm it means that I'm up to or maybe
it's a matter of seeing that something's
right and just sticking to it and trying
to understand I mean I think that those
are the right ideas when I think about
human nature and human fulfillment and
self-realization it seems to me that the
intellectual tradition that led to
modern anarchism and that includes
incidentally the mainstream of classical
liberalism which in my view is very much
misinterpreted by that I mean Adam Smith
the lungs and humble too inspired mil
the libertarian side of Rousseau Rizzo
sort of complex but there is a
libertarian side and that developed into
the classical liberal tradition which
was then seriously aborted in my opinion
by the rise of industrial capitalism
that tradition i think is of is a very
valid one it leads to modern libertarian
socialism were parts of the anarchist
tradition and I think that it's it's
basically a sense that human beings have
a fundamental right to self-realization
self-fulfillment under conditions of
freedom and voluntary association the
classical liberals like Humboldt did not
want they were not individualists in the
primitive style of Rousseau but so as
humble put it he wanted to remove the
fetters from human society but to
increase the bonds these being bonds of
voluntary self-association classical
liberalism in this form had was sharply
critical of property values so for
example Humboldt argue to get again that
the worker who cultivates a garden is
more its owner than the the person who
simply enjoys the fruits of the others
labor but they technically own it Adam
Smith sandy capitalism derives from the
same root a recognition and he was in
many ways anti-capitalist his
recognition that division of labor is
ultimately intolerable because it will
turn every human being into something as
stupid and ignorant as it as possible
for a creature to be there for thereby
undermining the essence of human nature
which is the right to create freely and
constructively under one's own control
and without external constraints out of
this comes a conception of
freedom and rights and social
organization which places any form of
authority and domination under challenge
asks that it justify itself sometimes
such justifications can be given maybe
under contingent historical
circumstances or maybe more deeply but
the burden of proof is on the system of
authority and domination quite typically
that burden can't be met in which case
one will try to work with others to
overcome that the structures of
authority and domination and to increase
positive freedom freedom not simply in
the sense of removal of say state
controls but freedom in the sense of
forms of social organization that allow
people to realize their their their
potential there there there need to be
active creative too and or whatever
other aspects their personality may have
have there been any societies where
these ideals have been put into effect
yeah in every society to some extent so
for example at our society to some
extent these ideals or realize to other
assessment than other respects they're
not what we seek if we're honorable in
my opinion is the respects in which they
are not met which are enormous and those
we try to confront and remove remove
those fetters create new social bonds in
Humboldt terms it's 30 years now since
you made a decision to become an
activist to commit so much of your life
to political action it was nineteen
sixty four you were a successful
linguist you had a family everything was
sort of perfect have you ever looked
back have you ever thought about the
things that you had to give up oh sure
lots it I knew right away I mean as it
as you mentioned as we've discussed I
hadn't really changed my views at that
point but I did decide that it was just
intolerable to simpin intolerably
self-indulgent merely to take a passive
role in
the struggles that were then going on so
signing petitions and you know sending
money and showing up now and then in a
meeting and so on I thought it was
critically necessary to take a more
active role and I was well aware of what
that would mean it's not the kind of
thing where you could put a foot in and
then on the water and get it wet and
then leave you go in deeper and deeper
and I knew that I would be following a
course that would confront privilege and
authority and would therefore be my own
views which were indeed highly critical
but I didn't have much of an effect when
I expressed my opinions and small groups
or to you know are so let's say refuse
to get clearance in the lab at MIT or
something like that it would become a
much larger part of life and damaging
part as I proceeded I have no illusions
about the nature of the intellectual
community it's conformism its techniques
for marginalizing or trying to eliminate
critical and independent thought it's
always been true remains true and I had
a fair picture of where it was going
didn't was unhappy about it means giving
up lots of things but felt it was
necessary and whatever any compensation
what what sort of things did you give up
and what what sort of damage would have
did you have to injure well you know why
I live in a world in which a world of
constant lies vilification denunciation
also simply marginalization and what I
gave up is lots of free time to work on
things that I find really exciting as I
do right now plus just the other you
know the large parts of life just
disappear I'm so for example large parts
of personal life simply disappear for
playing physical reasons because it day
has 24 hours what pushed you over into
that level of activism back then it was
a combination of what was happening in
this or
movement and the growing US war in
Vietnam which by 1964 was very serious
and that i felt i should say completely
hopeless about it at the time recall
that in 1964 there was virtually no
opposition to the war no organized
opposition or vocal opposition in fact
that didn't develop four years later and
it seemed to me highly unlikely that it
would ever develop what did develop a
couple of years later came to me is a
big surprise and the early stages were
by no means Pleasant so for example as
late as takes a Boston which is where I
live which quite liberal city may be the
most liberal city in the country until
late nineteen sixty-six that means when
there were a couple hundred thousand
American troops in South Vietnam and the
US had been bombing North Vietnam for
regular leifur than a year and a half
until about then it was virtually
impossible to have a a public outdoor
demonstration against the war in Boston
even meetings and churches were attacked
they were just physically attacked and
that was even true of meetings in in
churches i will remember in early
nineteen sixty-six when public meetings
and downtown churches were simply
physically attacked and that was
considered right so there was no protest
against that by the liberal community
they in fact on the contrary there was
protest against these people who were
daring to question and criticize a
american state power and it's it's
exercise and that's pretty much what I
expected i also got involved very
quickly in the resistance movement and
felt that anticipated that that would
have unpleasant consequences like for
example years in jail which was not
remote at that time noam chomsky in
boston he's my guest today on writers
and company on cbc stereo and in the
united states on the news and
information station of minnesota public
radio I'm Eleanor Wachtel now back to my
conversation with linguist and political
radical noam
you're sharply critical of American
foreign policy everywhere in the world I
think that's probably been an
understatement I get the sense that it's
not so much that the United States
behaves badly because you recognize that
all countries act out of self-interest
and if I can quote you violence deceit
and lawlessness our natural functions of
the state any state and given that the
United States is such a big and powerful
state it only follows that it will do
all that in spades but what really seems
to enrage you is the hypocrisy of the
American system that it claims to take a
high road is that true the hypocrisy of
the political leadership doesn't
particularly enrage me ice take that for
granted but what I do what what what I
do find well rage is the right word I
guess and never get over this emotion
though I realize it's impropriety is the
way in which the educated sectors behave
in the manner of commissar class it's
their deceit and distortion and
subordination to power and unwillingness
to face the realities in front of them
that just from a in aesthetic or
emotional point of view I find it
hardest to tolerate maybe because I sort
of live in those circles yeah I should I
should understand that objectively that
that's their role as much as it's the
role of a person who wields state power
to be deceitful but it's I the
distinction is nevertheless there
emotionally no but commissar classier
referring to intellectual world or
academia of the media the world that you
expect more from I don't expect any more
from them and I never did it's just that
seeing what happens day after day in not
all of course in honor exaggerated but
in large parts of the media and in
educated respectable educated sectors
rather generally that strikes me is just
appalling and intolerable though I
recognize that that's an emotional
reaction because I never expected
anything else and I don't know either in
fact if you look back at history
I eating all the way to the earliest
sources this is the way it's always been
say to take the Bible you know the
earliest literary source that we have
and consider the people who are now
respected the prophets well they were
then reviled they were you know
imprisoned driven into the desert hated
and so on be in large part because of
their both because of their moral
teachings and because of their
geopolitical analysis a large part of
what they gave was what we would today
call political or geopolitical analysis
they warned of the consequences of
policies that were being taken the
people who were honored at that time
were those who we now call false
prophets and I think that that that
there are good reasons for that
obviously pandering the power will lead
to respect and authority and privilege a
condemnation of immorality of the abuse
of power of the destructiveness for the
general public of the use of power such
policies will lead to antagonism on the
part of those who have the capacity to
to use violence or to organize masses
against people who question their
authority that's obvious and the picture
that you see in the Bible is one that
replicates itself over and over again in
every society including ours I don't
want to accuse you of presumption but do
you identify with these prophets in the
world no I would say that this is true
of every critical element in any society
I mentioned that because it's the
classic example how does the media do
what it is I mean is it as the target of
your critique the hypocrisy of the media
is a key subject they claim to be
gadflies but you you find that they
their work in a blinkered and complicit
way how do they do that how does it work
so well I should say incidentally that
the media are not fundamentally
different in my opinion
from a substantial part of scholarship
and intellectual opinion so say the
journals of opinion and the action you
know the operations of those who call
themselves public intellectuals or
whatever are not very different from the
media the media are a lot of easier to
study because there's a ton of material
and you can look at it systematically
and it's there a day by day and so on
but what they bring out is not unique
how does it work well they they operate
within a rather generally there again
there are exceptions these are these are
overwhelmingly true generalizations I
think they operate within a framework of
assumptions and understanding which are
supportive of existing power structures
which tend to exclude or downplay or
some sometimes totally eliminate or even
lie about actions of domestic power
state and other power in our societies
that means corporate financial state
power actions that are that they that
are conducted by these power centers
that are inhuman violent harmful to
human values and human interests those
are marginalized and downplayed and a
picture of the world is presented that
is conducive to and that tends to
justify their authority and their
actions in fact if the institutions
didn't behave that way they themselves
would be undermined and replaced by
others that do so for example if the New
York Times let's say started telling the
truth about the world including the
truth about the exercise of domestic
power financial corporate and state
power it would not exist for very long
it after all is a major corporation
selling a product other businesses it
relies on its relations to the state for
a good bit of its function and this
would be gone also if individuals
entered into the major media
at high managerial positions I include
by that cultural managers like editors
and columnist and so on who did not if
such individuals moved into those
positions who hadn't internalized those
values they wouldn't last very long now
it's not that the people are lying I
think they're being honest but for the
most part but they get where they are
because they've internalized values that
are supportive to power although on you
know again I don't want to say claim
that it's monolithic so for example the
Boston Globe just ran an op-ed of mine a
couple of weeks ago and I have you know
I've personal friends they're all the
way up to the top editors over the years
so it's it's it's it's a complicated
country yes it's a any you know and any
complication of any complicated system
is going to be misleading it is over
what we happen to have a highly
effective doctrinal system and a very
narrow ideological spectrum but there
are exceptions furthermore it's widened
over the years in my opinion so for
example the media are considerably more
open now in my judgment than they were
say 30 years ago why do you think that
is I think it's because the country has
changed and when the country changes its
institutions change so the the public is
far more critical and far more dissident
just by orders of magnitude than it was
30 or 35 years ago I mentioned a little
while back that the even in the mid-60s
1965 in 1966 in a liberal city like
Boston public demonstration say on the
Boston Common or even meetings and
churches were simply physically attacked
often by students incidentally with the
support of the media liberal media in
this city that's an inconceivable today
in fact the the gently move the the
attitudes and perceptions and
understanding of the general population
have changed radically on a whole host
of issues well what take take what's in
some ways the most striking the original
sin
of American society is what the Founding
Fathers were honest enough to call the
extermination of the native population
that's one which that's the people like
John Quincy Adams were pretty appalled
by at at least in his later years but in
American culture that was really not
recognized until the 1960s I mean when I
was growing up we played kids played
cowboys and Indians we were the Cowboys
and felt nothing of it until the 1960s
when a major cultural change took place
in the United States there was no
recognition of the horrifying atrocities
that led to our living where we are and
doing what we do the fact that the
American industrial revolution like the
English Industrial Revolution was based
on extermination of the native or
expulsion of the native population in
the United States and then in you know
enslaving masses of people well to
something certainly known in a certain
sense but it wasn't recognized as the
major crime that it was it's only since
the 1960s that there has been even in
scholarship I should say a recognition
of the enormity of what happened to the
native population and a general
willingness to at least come to try to
come to terms in some some ways with
that extremely ugly aspect of our
history you could see it in 1992 it was
assumed that the Quinn Centennial would
be a celebration of the discovery and
liberation of the hemisphere that didn't
happen not at all and it didn't happen
because the public simply wouldn't
tolerate it 30 years ago that's exactly
what it would have been well those are
that's one aspect of a of an improvement
in moral values of a of a cultural
advance which is quite significant shows
up in many other ways with regard to
feminist issues ecological issues
solidarity with third-world peoples and
many
respect multiculturalism is a case in
point all of these things have their as
in the case of any popular movement
there's going to be a fringe which is
unpleasant ridiculous maybe intolerable
but the main development is quite
significant I think and it has affected
the media as well so the kinds of the
kinds of support for us violence and
terror that would proceed without
question in the 1960s that you might
find them in short bursts today but they
would be open to criticism in a sense
didn't map in a manner that was not true
then it's very nice to hear you talk
this way after go out reading a lot of
very fiercely critical books of yours of
American I point this out all the time I
mean I don't put it and I don't put it
in headlines I know I know I know that's
true too that's true John skin
revolution in linguistics suggests that
we're born with this linguistic silver
spoon in her mouth was the capacity to
acquire language that nature has given
us this head start on language it also
does seem to go beyond language at it
seems that at heart a more democratic a
more optimistic view of humankind it
could come out of it uh you can I don't
want to push it too hard because when
you get beyond language and you know
some aspects of vision and a few other
things real scientific knowledge begins
to drop off very fast and we're back in
the area where we started beginning
looking at literature and history and
experience and intuition and so on but
it can be used as the basis for a rather
optimistic view and indeed was if we go
back to the to the Enlightenment again
these connections of this kind were in
fact drawn well for example by humboldt
inverso i mentioned earlier who
developed the kind of an optimistic view
of human nature the idea that the human
nature is based on what was later called
an instinct for freedom a drive to be
free creative outside the free of
external constraints and so on and that
indeed came from a basically Cartesian
picture saying that some asked that
fundamental aspects of human nature in
particular human freedom are simply
beyond the outside the range of any
mechanism that at the core of human
nature is what was called as far back as
the 16th century a generative capacity a
capacity to create to innovate to
construct from the resources of your own
mind the principles on which your
knowledge is based and in fact to
construct new thoughts to express new
thoughts the idea that the intelligence
is a generative faculty in this sense
goes back at least to the late 16th
century and was developed richly in the
Cartesian revolution and later picked up
by the romantics and in the
Enlightenment and entered into political
theory in this in a way which is rather
natural though by no means proven the
belief that at the core of human nature
is this drive for self-fulfillment under
conditions of free action undertaken by
oneself and out of one's own volition so
from the point of view of say Humboldt
again of the every person is at heart an
artist and if they act a craft a
craftsman let's say who acts under his
or her own volition is an artist if the
same craftsman does the same thing under
external control well as humble puts it
we may admire what he does but we hate
what he is you have a lot of faith in
ordinary common sense that people with
only they had all the information would
make the right decisions and at the same
time you probably more than most of us
have spent a lot of time scrutinizing
international atrocities being aware of
what goes on in the world and looking at
it when most of us
even if the information we're available
to us don't really want to or our too
preoccupied elsewhere with our daily
lives to spend to pay that kind of
attention mm-hmm well you know how
optimistic or pessimistic I or some
other person is is really not important
I mean suppose that I were to believe
that there's let's say two percent
probability that if people are brought
to see the actual facts of the world
about them then they'll act in a moral
and humane way then I would devote
myself to that two percent and so would
any reasonable person to enhancing that
two percent probability and seeing what
can be done with it no I haven't you
think it's a much much greater than that
i should say incidentally that this kind
of what in my view is so than what you
described as optimism about people's
capacity to act in decent humane ways
when they understand the realities
that's shared by by people in power
almost universally if you look through
history including George's today you'll
very rarely if ever see a say a
statesman or a leader of some sort turn
to the public and say look it would be
an hour interest to go slaughter those
guys over there or to rob them or
torture them or terrorize I'm so
therefore let's do it you never find
that what you find is an elaborate set
of rationalizations and excuses and
quite elaborate constructions developed
by intellectuals which make it appear as
if robbing them and torturing them and
killing them and so on is right and just
well why bother with that unless you're
afraid at some level of your
consciousness that if people know the
truth they're not gonna let you get away
with it no I'm Chomsky you've
occasionally been chided by your friends
for not coming up with enough positive
alternatives for not coming up with some
revolutionary strategy to get at the
root of problems how do you respond to
that it's image that part of you is that
part of your job sure I mean to the
extent that I
first of all I don't think that anybody
certainly not me is smart enough to plan
in any detail of a you know a perfect
society or even a you know the society
to show in detail how a society based on
more humane commitments and the and
concern for human values would function
I think we can say a lot about what it
would be like but we can't spell it out
in great detail furthermore what it
would be like I think is reasonably well
understood that has been for in some
ways for centuries we would like to see
a society in which people in which we
overcome course of institutions
absolutist unaccountable institutions
should not be tolerated in our time that
means primarily the financial and
corporate centers which are basically
totalitarian in character and are now
transnational and scale and the state
powers that and by now larger than state
powers that respond to their interests
and the same is true for structures of
authority and domination down to the
level of inside the family those should
be combated and overcome we should work
for democratic control in communities in
workplaces over investment decisions
eliminating hierarchic relations and
Relations of dominance among people and
states and ethnic groups and so on all
of that's understandable I think you can
go on to describe in greater detail how
possibilities about how such freer and
where Democratic structures might
function but the real answers will come
by experienced and testing we don't
nobody understands enough to spit you
couldn't spell out in detail in the mid
18th century how a parliamentary
democracy might work you had to try it
the general ideas could be there but had
to try them and explore them the
experiment with him and so on and the
same is true of expansion of freedom and
democracy and justice today as for a
revolutionary strategy I've never heard
of
when I look over history the only
strategy I see is trying to educate
yourself to help others become educated
to learn from others to organize and to
the extent that organization proceeds to
take action to try to relieve injustice
to extend freedom and so on now that
action can take many different forms so
just in my own life have been involved
in things ranging from direct resistance
to giving talks or don't think important
meetings and the there are no further
secrets as long as far as I'm aware I
mean the problem is one of dedicating
oneself to the extent you can at least
nobody's a saint to dedicating oneself
to the tasks that have to be undertaken
and you know we can see what they are
you used to draw parallels between the
Soviet Union and the United States as to
power blocks and the Soviet Union the
dictatorship resorted to violence to
maintain control in the United States it
was more as democracies do relying more
on propaganda since the breakup of the
Soviet Union do you see any I know the
what's confronting us now into when we
look in that direction is obviously not
particularly positive but do you take
anything positive to come out of that
well the elimination of Soviet tyranny
is a major step for human freedom in
fact in my view it's a great victory for
socialism contrary to the propaganda of
both of the great power blocks the
Western power block in the Eastern power
power block contrary to their propaganda
the Soviet Union from its first days
from the days when lenin trotsky took
lenin trotsky to power was militantly
anti-socialist in every respect they
immediately destroyed the socialist
institutions and understood what they
were doing it was done in principle so
there's a great I think there's an
opening for freedom on the other hand
the Soviet Union though most of Eastern
Europe quite predictably and I
is now being driven back to a third
world level to a large extent that's
what the third the Cold War was about
the no part in an international society
dominated by private capital and private
power and it's it's state manifestations
no sector that a large part of the world
is just kind of a service area the south
or the third world given one or another
designation former colonial world and no
part of it is permitted to be to pursue
an independent path doesn't matter
whether it's Grenada or you know or six
of the world and to a large extent the
Cold War was fought about that really
began in nineteen seventeen and nineteen
eighteen as the better historians notice
okay the West the more powerful
combatant one war meeting the rich and
powerful sectors in the West won the war
the large part of the population in the
West lost the war in fact the Eastern
Europe or large parts of it is now
returning to its third world origins
pretty much where it was back at the
early part of this century that means a
very serious decline and it also means
enrichment remember a third world
Society has sect typically has any of
our dependencies have sectors of great
wealth and privilege and Eastern Europe
does as well so take Russia the the
economy is collapsing people are
suffering UNESCO really recently
reported that there's about an excess of
they estimate about half a million
deaths a year in the Soviet Union since
1989 as a result of the collapse
including the neoliberal reforms that
are imposed on them on the other hand
they're selling were mercedes-benzes for
150 thousand dollars a shot than in
Moscow than in New York and the people
are buying them are often the old
communist party leaders there's what's
sometimes called nomenklatura capitalism
they're the victors of the Cold War not
the people of Russia large parts of
Eastern Europe are returning to a kind
of third world service role that offers
new weapons against working people in
the West so
General Motors or Audi and so on can
find workers in Eastern Europe at a
fraction of the cost of Western workers
who are now being called upon by the
business press to abandon what are
called their luxurious lifestyles and to
reduce them set to to become more
competitive meaning to face the fact
that it's easy to gain profits and power
by exploiting much cheaper labor in the
east now when General Motors moves over
to say Poland they of course insist on a
let's say a 30-percent tariff protection
or something of that kind as VW does
when it goes to the Czech Republic
because they don't believe in free
markets they believe in free markets for
the poor not for the rich state power
and protection for the rich but these
are the consequences of the end of the
Cold War ensure they're not pretty on
the other hand there is the elimination
of one of the worst systems of tyranny
of human history and that offers all
sorts of possibilities of liberation and
new scope for human spirit and human
freedom I'd like to thank you very much
thanks again for taking the time and
coming in and thank you thank you Noam
