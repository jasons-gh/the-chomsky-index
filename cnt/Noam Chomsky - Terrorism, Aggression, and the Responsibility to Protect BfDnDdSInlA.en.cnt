yes I feel like the definition of
terrorism that's being discussed is kind
of like an on definition or at least an
on distinction because even in large
scale military compact big country
against big country there's always the
real threat is the threat against a
civilian population either it's going to
be collateral damage from conventional
warfare or the implied threat is after
we wanted to be destroys an army the
implied threat is we'll do as we wish
and impose what we want on an opposing
civilian population so I'm not really
seeing the distinction there well
they're perfectly right the distinction
the terms are not precise but the terms
of political discourse are not precise
all together in fact outside of
mathematics and part of physics terms
are not really precisely defined even in
the history of mathematics they weren't
defined until fairly recently so these
terms are loose as you say but
nevertheless they're useful there's a
difference between terrorism and
aggression and under the category of
aggression sometimes there are actions
that should count as terrorism namely
those directed as aimed at intimidating
and terrifying and controlling civilian
populations by violence or the threat of
violence that's a tactic that can be
used within aggression but aggression is
worse than terrorism aggression is the
dispatch of armed forces to the
territory of another country without
their request I mean that's aggression
it's pretty well defined in
international conventions and the
aggression is also defined in the
Nuremberg principles which are part of
the foundation of modern international
law under Nuremberg aggression is
described as I just dafonte
characterized it is identified as the
supreme international crime differing
from other war
crimes in that it encompasses all of the
evil that follows those are the
principles under which the Nazi war
criminals were hanged and that we ought
to think about them
so take say the invasion of Iraq is a
textbook case of aggression no ambiguity
about it u.s. British aggression and it
is a supreme international crime it
encompasses all the evil that follows
including for example the sunni-shia
conflicts that were that had been
simmering but they were really elicited
by the aggression are now tearing the
region apart and its variant that's part
of the that's part of the crime of
aggression that we carried out it's
interesting to see the way that's
discussed so for example a couple of
weeks ago David Brooks in The New York
Times had an article in which he argued
that the real threat in the Middle East
what we really have to pay attention to
is not just a hunger Massacre and so on
but the spreading sunni-shia split which
is tearing the region apart and there's
some merit to that then he attributes
that to the withdrawal of US forces or
as he puts it the withdrawal of our
moderating influence that's turning
things on their head in our most
grotesque fashion it's the result of our
invasion not our moderating influence
and if we at least if we're willing to
take seriously the tribunals that hang
Nazi war criminals as we certainly
should we should ask ourselves what does
that mean for us but it's perfect but
it's related to the president I think
the context in which David Brooks wrote
that article in a situation like Syria
where the dictator with the army is seen
as responsible for most of the killing
of a hundred thousand people who at
first tried to
is up peacefully as in some other Arab
Spring countries there is a liberal
internationalist view that the West or
the US in particular has a
responsibility to intervene because no
other power can stop the slaughter do
you find that zero convincing well first
of all it's a separate point it was not
his point his point was that it was the
withdrawal of our moderating influence
that led to the sunni-shia conflict and
in fact it was the opposite it was our
carrying out the supreme international
crime that led to it turning to Syria
that's a separate question there is a
doctrine which of responsibility to
protect it's constantly cited it's been
you know we have articles about it in
the mainstream press academic journals
and so on it's important to look at it
and because it's continually
misrepresented in Western discourse
crucially misrepresented there is a
doctrine of responsibility to protect it
was approved by the United Nations
General Assembly in 2005 and it
therefore stands as a respectable
principle of proper international
behavior now if you read that if you
read the General Assembly proposals
resolution what it says is first that
states have a responsibility to protect
their own citizens and if they fail to
do that the international community has
a responsibility to try to mitigate the
crime and to do so in accordance with
the United Nations Charter the
fundamental the basis of modern
international law the United Nations
Charter as this resolution repeats
allows intervention under two
circumstances one if it's authorized by
the Security Council of the United
Nations - if it's in self-defense
against armed attack until the in
Security Council has a chance to
act well the second is obviously
irrelevant here and the first isn't
applicable there's a second doctrine of
responsibility to protect which has no
status other than the fact that it's
accepted by the West that's the version
that came out of a committee in 2001 run
by Gareth Evans former Prime Minister of
Australia is usually called the Evans
Commission and that develops a constant
concept of responsibility to protect
which is the same as the one later
endorsed by the General Assembly with
one crucial exception and that's crucial
the Evans Commission adds that if the
Security Council fails to act regional
organisations can carry out intervention
by force in the area of their
jurisdiction
subsequent subject to subsequent
authorization by the Security Council
now there's only one regional
organisation that can carry out such
actions that's NATO not for reasons of
law but for ins of power so what the
Evans Commission is saying is
irrespective of international law NATO
has the right to intervene by force when
it chooses in the area of its
jurisdiction which is worldwide well
that's a pretty crucial difference the
version of responsibility to protect
that's discussed in the West is the
Evans version that's not the one that
has any international legitimacy
