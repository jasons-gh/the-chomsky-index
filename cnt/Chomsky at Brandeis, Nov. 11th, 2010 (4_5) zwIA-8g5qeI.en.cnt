as I mentioned well what are the options
today for us one option is that US
policy will change as it did briefly and
taba then returned to the norm the US
will abandon its rejectionist and join
the rest of the world in calling for the
settlement that's you know you can
debate details but the basic outlines of
it are pretty clear controversial have
been for 35 years that's one possibility
it's commonly argued that that's now
impossible I suspect that Diana who is
here a couple days ago probably said
that and it's very widely held they say
the project of settlement is gone so far
that this is impossible personally I
don't believe it I think that there are
simple ways to implement it talk about
it if you like but a bear in mind that
if that's impossible then it follows
that any political settlement is
impossible because there's no real
alternative to this it's held that there
is an alternative if you follow the
debates on this issue you'll see that
among Palestinians and among the
supporters of the Palestinians that's
commonly proposed that Israel should
take over the whole of former Palestine
the entire West Bank and i'll come back
to gaza with the entire West Bank as one
Palestinian
I negotiator sorry to say but it will
give Israel the key they can take the
whole thing and then we'll carry out a
civil rights struggle an anti-apartheid
struggle like South Africa maybe we can
win that one that's a completely
academic proposal there's no reason in
the world why Israel would ever accept
it they don't want to mean that they
don't want the Palestinians and they
have an alternative these are not the
two alternatives it's a third
alternative the third alternative is
what the US and Israel are in fact doing
they can continue with that and what
they're doing is not obscure so you're
right on the ground if you happen to be
there you can read about it if you want
the details are quite plain they're
essentially implementing a plan which
has a lot of antecedents but it's now
pretty much identified with ariel sharon
called the sharone plant it was later
made explicit by his successor they had
only prime minister who called it
convergence he actually presented to
Congress 2006 two standing ovations
convergence sure on Flynn means that
Israel takes everything within behind
the what's called the separation wall
it's actually an annexation wool which
cuts through Palestinian territory puts
a lot on the Israeli side and it's not
just the quantity it's also the quality
what it puts on the Israeli side are
first of all the pleasant suburbs of Tel
Aviv and Jerusalem which of course
Israel would like to keep
it includes a arable land some of the
most important arable land and crucially
it includes the water resources for the
region Israel already exploits most of
the water west of the Jordan but this
includes the main aquifer so it
everything behind the annexation wall
will be annexed it includes greater
Jerusalem there's something called
Jerusalem but that's not anything like
what Jerusalem ever was it's many times
the size of Jerusalem Jerusalem the
actual Jerusalem was annexed illegally
over the in violation of orders and
Security Council repeated orders but
then it was greatly expanded so what's
called Jerusalem goes well into Judea I
think it's maybe five times or so the
original area roughly that with the
debate right now about our foe mom you
know the new settlements that's an
expanded Jerusalem neighbor Jerusalem
the sort includes expanded Jerusalem
takes cuts off a big piece of the West
Bank it includes the Jordan Valley which
means everything else is imprisoned the
Jordan Valley is being settled and
Palestinians are being driven out of it
by the usual means
the possibility of access to water
rejecting an effort to build a school
and so on usual quiet means of
essentially ethnic cleansing so includes
Jordan Valley a big piece of the West
Bank again arable land and leaves the
rest in prison and then in addition to
that there are salience cutting through
there's one east of Jerusalem which goes
virtually to Jericho on essentially
bisects the West Bank includes the town
of mal de mim big town established in
the 1970s but developed primarily under
clinton that essentially cuts the west
bank in half and in a northern part of
the west bank there are two other
salience the one going through the town
of arielle new town in the West Bank of
course all of this illegal and another
one that goes through to me that breaks
up the remaining region into unviable
Canton's now Israel has may let me say a
word about Gaza at this point ever since
by the 1980s Israel recognized that it's
a mistake to try to hold on to Gaza it
had already been virtually destroyed
under the occupation it was unlivable it
was just the nuisance not much point
keeping it
the people from television go to the
beach on sunday the with the Oslo
agreements the Oslo agreements in 1991
1993 established that Gaza and the West
Bank are an indissoluble unit one
territorial unit so any crime that's
carried out in the West Bank it's
perfectly legitimate to resist it in
Gaza there one unit but Israel the
United States have been dedicated since
it's almost 20 years now two separate
Gaza from the West Bank now that
continues the imprisonment of the quite
apart from what it means for people in
Gaza it continues the imprisonment to
the west bank because it loses its
outlet to the sea now it's really a
prison of course it's totally illegal it
means that to say if a person in Gaza's
needs medical assistance that they could
get in a Palestinian hospital in East
Jerusalem they have to go through the
Israeli authorities but now they also
have to go through Palestinian Authority
and Hamas authorities who are bad enough
in their own ways but that means you
can't get medical treatment can't get
medicines in you can't go to school if
you happen to be a student who lives and
Gaza studies and appears in the West
Bank you can't get there and so on the
idea is to break them apart two separate
entities the plan for Gaza is just to
destroy
say a little bit about the history about
what happened in Gaza in Gaza the
repression was pretty bitter but it
became much worse in Israel did finally
withdraw a few thousand settlers from
Gaza that was great phenomenon you
looked at the Boston Globe I had front
page pictures of a little boy pleading
with the soldiers you know don't destroy
my house cries of never again and so on
and so forth I was the great event of
withdrawal from Gaza was all staged
completely staged for international
attention if Israel wanted to throw from
Gaza they could have done it very simply
all they had to do was announced on it
was in August on August first on that
the IDF the army is withdrawing from
Gaza at that point the seven or eight
thousand settlers who were there
illegally in subsidized homes would
climb into the lorries that are provided
to them and be taken to their subsidised
homes in illegally in the West Bank and
it wouldn't he would have made the front
page of the Boston Globe in fact nobody
even noticed but that's just the point
the point was to stage a national trauma
this was so transparent that was being
ridiculed in the Israeli present but
what made it even more transparent was
that it was replaying a script from 1982
after the Camp David agreements in which
Israel the United States accepted so
that's 1971 offer they had to evacuate
yummy the city they'd built on the in
occupied Sinai and the other the other
settlements so a big national trauma was
staged could have done it exactly this
way but they made it look like a huge
drama in fact there was a member
headline in Arabs the main newspaper
which said national trauma 82 okay that
was the the game played for the benefit
of the the goyim you know out there back
in 82 they redid it in 2005 with Gaza
and they simply and they say it pretty
frankly they said look this is just a
way of settling the west bank
immediately after that the so-called
withdrawal which kept as a totally under
control incidentally shortly after that
Palestinians really committed a major
crime there was a free election only for
election in the Arab world carefully
monitored everyone agreed was free and
fair January 2006 the vote came out the
wrong way the US attitude towards
elections is extremely clear if they
come at the right way we hail them as a
triumph of democracy if we come out the
wrong way and we ever throw the
government we invade we sanction you
know and so on which is exactly what
happened the vote came out the wrong way
instantly within days the United States
and Israel instituted harsh sanctions
your wit along more or less
wait that harsh a couple of months later
the US and Israel decided to try to
overthrow the government with a military
coup so they organized a military coup
in Gaza run by Fatah strong man I
Madeline the coup was beaten back the
elected government Hamas beat back the
coup and took power they're not nice
people at cinelli they run Gaza quite
brutally don't like them at all but they
were the elected government whatever you
think they beat back the military coup
and that is a real crime at that point
the US and Israel imposed a very harsh
siege extremely harsh beg as is barely
livable by land by sea of course by air
fishermen are driven through the shore
so they can't fish it's very harsh and
that was the punishment for first
elected on people and secondly beating
back a military coup intended to
overthrow the government
