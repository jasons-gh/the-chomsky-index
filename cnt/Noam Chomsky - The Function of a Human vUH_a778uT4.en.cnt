the function of you I don't think humans
have functions we're not pieces of
equipment the humans have lives not
functions to think of humans as having
functions is to be humanized so I don't
think there's an answer to that question
things have functions because we give
them functions like it's a you know
computer let's say the computer itself
has no function I mean we can in fact
you can use it for a paper you know for
a paperweight if you want or you can
figure out how a way to design a devise
a program which the computer will then
implement okay then the computer has a
function namely implementing the program
that you that you wrote for it but it's
you the human being who were assigning a
function to it and the function can be
anything like I say a computer could be
a paperweight or if they say a hammer
what's its function well in the hands of
a torturer or its function could be to
beat somebody's brains it in the hands
of carpenter its function would be to
build a house but the hammer itself has
no function and to dehumanize people is
to turn them into objects with functions
like slaves you dehumanize them their
function is to pick cotton or workers in
a factory their function is to follow
orders affected the early in the
enlightenment the period you know the
18th 19th early 19th century the idea
that humans have functions was
considered outrageous in fact that you
know you have like the founder of the
modern university system the lump on
Humboldt the wrote then a famous
classical liberal is that if if a
craftsman that produces a beautiful
object on command we may admire what he
did but we despise what he is namely a
tool in the hands of others with a
function of producing that beautiful
artifact and that's what the
humanization is a lot of
what we call civilization is
dehumanization taking away turning human
beings into creatures with functions
assigned to them by power systems and
there's no way to humanize people they
are human you can dehumanize them and
you can help them develop their human
human characteristics but you can't turn
them into human beings that they artists
are
