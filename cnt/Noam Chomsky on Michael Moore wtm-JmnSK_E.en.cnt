thundering what's your opinion form and
such overly populist left-wing agitators
such as Michael Moore I whether they're
of any remote help in America today well
I don't exactly know what overlaid
populist means he's trying to reach the
general public that's for sure
I think he's had a very significant
effect uh I don't know if it's the left
he reaches a general audience just out
of curiosity my films he films much but
my wife and I went to watch Bowling for
Columbine and went purposely to a sort
of lower middle class word unless
neighborhood really see what the react
more interested in the reaction and in
the film and it was interesting I mean
in a way he was mocking their beliefs
and commitments but it was a pretty
soozee a state audience whether it
because entirely clear whether it was
because they were regarding it as a
satire or not meaningful or whether they
resonated that what he was saying but he
certainly has has reached the very wide
audience not particularly the left but
she's not talking to bold if they don't
like guns
but and of course there's a backlash so
across the spectrum of educated opinion
from what's called left in the United
States like the New York Times which
recently was described as the most
left-wing institution on the face of the
earth by the president's economic
adviser distinguished economists from
Harvard the so from the New York Times
over too far right there's a they
exploit his exploit him as a a way it
kind of undermine anything he's speaking
for actually that's true in England too
I don't read the English press regularly
of course but I did happen to be your
last May when the can festival was going
on and I did one came close to winning a
prize and it was a long interview with
him in one of the British journals maybe
the independent recall which is a rather
derisive interview and I call the author
but entity made the standard accusations
that were lies and he's not trustworthy
and so on and the proof that he lies the
main purse that he lies I was just
interesting is that he claims to have
come from a working-class background but
his father owned the house and owned the
car so he's lying
his father was an auto worker and he's
claiming to come from a working-class
background we've told you something
about not about him but about England
not about the way the notion class has
been eliminated from consciousness so if
persons working-class he's not working
class if he happens to own a car every
steel worker does but that's pretty
standard the kind of division of his
somewhat class-based and somewhat
populist critique what the overall
effect is it's hard to say because the
propaganda is all on the other side so
what reaches readers of the press and
people watch television and so on as the
derision and the fabrication about is
this
untrustworthiness and so on on the other
hand he reaches a lot of large audience
so it's a mix mix today
