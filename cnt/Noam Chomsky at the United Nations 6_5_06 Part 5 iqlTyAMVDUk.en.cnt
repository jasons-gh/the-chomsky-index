there's one if you don't have been I'll
tentative is on corp on corporations I
wonder what here's an example they're in
in Somalia right now it's like a Fitz a
truly failed state and there's an
Australian oil company trying to
negotiate side deals with with you know
warlords I wonder how you think
corporations can be regulated in a world
with with obviously there's some places
where there's no regulation at all and
usually the home regulator is very Pro
corporations as for regulating
corporations there's very little in the
way of international law on that that's
mostly I mean it's mostly the
responsibility of the states in which
the corporations are technically located
and you're right there's a very weak
regulatory apparatus and that the
reasons are not a deep secret it's that
state states and corporations are very
tightly linked to a very large extent
concentrated private power just
dominates the state in fact even staffs
it so they're very unlikely to regulate
it and it sets the constraints in which
state policy is made well that shouldn't
be true there should again
democratization of societies would
reduce that in fact in my opinion
corporations are themselves at
legitimate I take a very conservative
position on this as you may know when
the modern corporation was created about
a century ago by state intervention
mostly judicial intervention wasn't no
legislation about it but when corporate
law and the current sense was
established in the early 20th century by
the courts there were people have
bitterly opposed it namely conservatives
there used to be conservatives in those
days now that term is around but not the
concept conservatives bitterly condemned
it as a return to feudalism which in a
way it was and a form of communism that
was the reaction to the radical revision
of corporate law in the United States
and elsewhere to grant corporations of
collectivist legal entities the rights
of people of flesh and blood as a major
attack against classical liberal
principles and conservatives meaning
classical liberals were bitterly
offended by that and I think they had a
good point well since that time it's
gotten a lot worse the decisions you
look through corporate law it has talked
about the United States was already
different elsewhere major decisions
about eighty years ago ninety years ago
by the Court determined that
corporations are not only persons but
they are necessarily pathological
persons that is they determined that a
corporation the corporate management
must dedicate itself to increasing
profit and market share whatever the
effect on anyone for a corporation to do
anything benevolent was determined to be
illegal that was the issue that came up
i'll go through the court case if you
like and that's been fortified by
further corporate law mostly in the
courts not legislation the corporations
are allowed to do something benevolent
if the TV cameras are on so if you're
doing it for public relations purposes
yeah then you're allowed to do something
nice in fact the courts have gone so far
as to advise corporations that they
should carry out benign acts or else I'm
now quoting an aroused public may
discover what you're up to and what the
government is up to and take away your
privileges so you better do nice things
to prevent an aroused public to find out
what's going on in the recent
international trade agreements which do
provide a kind of a framework for
corporate behavior corporations are
given rights that go way beyond persons
so if General Motors let's say invests
in Mexico they can demand what's called
national treatment
have to be treated like some Mexican
mom-and-pop business if a Mexican of
flesh and blood comes to New York and
asks for national treatment it will be
lucky if he's not sent to Guantanamo the
reason is that private Pyrenees
collectivist private attorneys legal
legally created entities are given
rights way beyond persons by the
so-called trade agreements which not
much to do with trade certainly not with
free trade well you know all that can be
changed yeah corporations are private
tyranny a corporation if you look at its
structure is about as close to the
totalitarian model as anything the human
beings have created man it control is
completely from top down you can be
inserted in the middle somewhere like
junior manager take orders from the top
down from the top you hand them down
below at the very bottom people are
allowed to rent themselves to it it's
called getting a job and there's a very
weak accountability to the public
extremely weak and when you get you know
when the right wing comes into power
like the Reagan administration or the
Bush administration they're a primary
goal is to weaken the regulatory
apparatus so the Reagan administration
for example essentially informed the
corporate world that they were not going
to enforce the regulations on business
practices you can read all about it in
Business Week which had a good reports
about it and described how you know the
number of illegal firings of union
organizers i tripled shot up and other
labor abuses shot up because the
government simply said we're not going
to force the law so do what you like and
they did what they like so yes these are
there's a very real question about the
legitimacy the institution in the first
place but insofar as it exists and again
let me stress something the very
conservative position on this that is
the position was the position of
conservatives when they did really exist
with justice so that's a serious
question but if they exist yeah they
should be accountable to the public
and that means in many respects for
example there's no you know it's not a
law of nature that they should work for
the benefit of shareholders shareholders
doesn't mean somebody who has five
dollars in a mutual fund corporate
ownership is very highly concentrated
the top 1% of the population probably
holds about half of it so there's no law
that says that they shouldn't happen to
be a law but there shouldn't be one not
a justifiable law that says that they
should work for the benefit of the tiny
percentage of the population that has
the on the country why not for what are
called stakeholders meaning the
community the workforce future
generations because of the effects they
have on environment and so on now that's
so there's a reasonable proposals and
there's no reason why a democratic
society should enforce them
