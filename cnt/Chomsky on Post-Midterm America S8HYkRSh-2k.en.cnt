welcome to the real news network I'm
Paul Jay in Cambridge Massachusetts now
joining us is a man who needs no
introduction so I'm not going to do one
thanks for joining us mr. Chomsky glad
Peter again so we are told by many
people across the political spectrum
that the problem is we just can't get
along on the front pages of the
newspapers today the story is will the
Democrats work with the Republicans and
their polling about whether more
Republicans want their representatives
to fight or not fight we're told by
people like Jon Stewart that the problem
is that we need a more rational Center
and more rational discussion the problem
is the people on the left extreme and
the right extreme and there's always
been this division between what's called
liberalism and conservatism and that's
the basic division of American society
and the problem is the Liberals and the
Conservatives just need to have a more
fruitful discourse they need to get
together and figure out a sane Center
this all at a time of perhaps the
gravest crisis in terms of global
economy certainly since the 1930s and
who knows it may turn out to be even
more profound than that what's your take
on this whole positioning of what the
problem is I think there's very little
truth to it what's happened over the
past roughly 35 years is that both
parties have drifted to the right I
don't think the thermos liberal and
conservative mean much in fact if you if
you take a look at the there's quite
serious inquiry into the actual
attitudes of people who call themselves
conservatives so the group of people who
say I'm in favor of small government to
cutting back taxes put aside the social
issues they're different what turns out
most of them have more or less social
democratic attitudes though they think
there should be more money spent on
health more on education more on
assistance to the poor but not welfare
Ragan succeeded in blackening the term
welfare with his tales about you know
black women and limousines coming to the
welfare offices and so on so no welfare
but assistance to the poor
no foreign aid but then when people are
asked how much should we be giving they
typically say considerably more than we
actually are
and what you basically have among the
so-called conservatives in the
population is what we call liberal
attitudes on issue after issue take say
the health care reform that Obama passed
which is the you know the real fighting
issue all the people a majority the
populations opposed to the health care
reform if you take a look at the reasons
a substantial number are opposed because
it didn't go far enough and on
particular matters that Obama gave away
likes a public option it was pretty
strong support for allowing the
pharmaceutical corporations to get away
with murder because the government's not
allowed to negotiate prices with them
overwhelming opposition but certainly in
the last election just a few days ago
but the what got articulated as a
position people voted for at least as if
you look at through the media lens is
you know loaded no taxes people should
fend for themselves
you know this whole idea the nanny state
is under attack a more extreme version
of what the right might have been by
beepers that certainly true among the
spokespersons for the right but again if
you take a look at the polling of people
who take those views and you ask them
should we cut down on say Medicare
should we cut down on systems for
education should we cut down on
infrastructure development they say no
well the way you've positioned that is
you're talking about what out in society
amongst
ordinary people that have conservative
values but is this something that
doesn't get discussed and then maybe is
this it's kind of the point on the edge
there for example I know what I'm
getting at is this is that there's a
quota of George will which I keep
quoting over and over again practically
every story I do right now and in the
fall of 2008 heading into the o8
elections George will is on
Stephanopoulos show and there's a
back-and-forth with Donna Brazile and
finally will blurts out he says let's
not get sentimental about democracy we
don't get to choose whether or not the
elite will govern we get to choose which
elite will govern and as part of the
issue here that this liberal
conservative dynamic is it dynamic
within the elite and that doesn't get
talked that way about what goes on in
the rest of the society it's a dynamic
among the articulate those who have
access to who have public access to
express themselves like will but the
attitudes of the population are quite
different in fact if you look over the
years and there have been quite
extensive studies the general will of
the population is quite different from
policy on major issues
I couldn't refer you to some studies if
you like but there are quite careful
studies of it in fact on many major
issues save me I'm supposed to be
radical left I find myself more or less
an agreement with a majority the
population more or less you know not
exactly but that's totally different
from policy so for example it takes a
foreign policy issues which have been
studied carefully there's a book by have
been page and Waterloo ton called the
foreign policy disconnect in which they
study over many decades attitudes of the
public on foreign policy is compared
with policy and there is a sharp
disconnect so say on international
issues considerable majority think that
the United Nations ought to take the
lead not the United States and
international crises actually majority
think that the u.s. ought to give up the
veto over the Security Council it was
clear before the Iraq war the majority
of public
and let the UN finish its inspection
yeah but that's standard I mean you get
when you get a month when the when the
United States is at war and there's a
lot of propaganda baths or our lives are
at stake and so on or then things change
for example if you go back about three
takes a the main foreign policy issue we
ran to consider the threat the world
order now there's less couple years been
a ton of propaganda about it
if you go back right before the
propaganda that say January 2007 when
there were extensive studies of Iranian
and American public opinion turned out
they were pretty similar they both
agreed that large majorities that Iran
should have the right to develop to
enrich uranium as a sign or the
non-proliferation treaty but not develop
nuclear weapons they both favored
negotiation and a threat of force and so
on down the line
in fact that huge a little large
majority thought the United States about
a move toward abandoning nuclear weapons
if you get back to the policy debate on
domestic questions it's being positioned
as stimulus versus austerity less
government no taxes over here slightly
taxed slight tax reform with some
stimulus although the liberal section of
the the leadership is also buying into
the necessity as sooner than later get
to fight the debt in other words get to
a stereo that's why Obama has a deficit
Commission so what should people be
demanding or what what's what's the
vision ordinary people should have and
what you know in the last election this
small government lower taxes you could
get people can get their head around
except that they don't believe it
because when you ask them what should be
cut point by point they say not this not
that I want more spending through them
so it's a it's a slogan you know get the
government off our backs and remember we
have a business run propaganda system I
mean shouldn't be a secret and business
of course would like to have smaller
government that would like to get the
government off our back because that
means they get on our back so the
corollary to get the government
on our back Mabel to give the
concentrated private power even more
power than it has now
so people who call themselves
libertarians and say you know we don't
want to be run by others they're saying
we want to be run by private tyrannies
though they should be free to do what
they like that's the part that's not
expressed but if you think it through
that what's going to happen take the
specific issues when people are asked
you want more taxes no horrible here
April 15th that's considered a day of
mourning some alien force is coming to
steal your money well that's quite
interesting that's the result of decades
of intense propaganda to try to get
people to hate the government so that
the corporate sector can run things
without interference and of course the
corporate sector wants a big government
they don't want to cut the government
they just want a nanny state for
themselves but the propaganda has been
very extensive and it tells you
something I mean if there was a
democratic culture functioning
democratic culture people would
celebrate April 15th they would say
April 15th is the day when we
collaborate to implement the policies
that we chose but they don't say that
it's part of the problem that an
important section of the left and
certainly the leadership of the
Democratic Party don't want to deal with
the fact that this form of big
government is very alienated from people
and that this big government is totally
entwined with this corporate sector but
they try to I would drop the term left I
mean what we call what it's called the
left and the media is what used to be
called moderate Republicans the the
so-called New Democrats are apparently
they're essentially what moderate
Republicans were 3040 years ago the
Republicans rashly and openly the party
of private power private tyranny they
they're I mean they talk about that
we're the common man and elites but
so does everyone if you look at the
policies that's what it is
it takes a Obama and the core of his is
a funding in the 2008 election was
actually financial institutions and when
groups of investors get together to
control the state what we call it
election they expect to be paid back and
it were you can see man who got
appointed as a bond rating you know
instantly they were other people who
could have been appointed so so what's
the vision for ordinary people now what
should they be demanding what what
should they articulate they should be
demanding a functioning democratic
society in which decisions are actually
made by the public and their own
organizations their own meetings I mean
you know all let's take say the
primaries so say New Hampshire has the
first primary typically well if you had
a Democratic Society functioning one not
just a formal one what would happen
would be that a town in New Hampshire
would get together fountain meeting
whatever organizations they have and say
these hash out the kind of policies they
want the government to follow come to
son
more or less agreement say well we'd
like it to do so in two then if I can if
a candidate wants to come they should
say okay you can come and we'll tell you
what we want you to do and if you can
really commit yourself to this honestly
they will vote for you
that's not what happens what happens is
the candidate comes in with a huge PR
operettas and makes a speech to the town
and says here's how wonderful I am and
here's what I'm gonna do people probably
mostly don't believe in properly and
then we go on that's it's the opposite
of democracy now what would the economy
look like well what's the demands on the
economy well you know I think if the the
term stimulus has been turned into a
dirty word like taxes but if there was
real discussion about this public
discussion about it I think most of the
population would probably agree with
leading economist Nobel laureates would
say what we need is a big sin it is
deficit reduction down the road maybe
but still we haven't we didn't have a
stimulus and if you take a look at the
Obama stimulus I mean it contrary to
tons of lies about it as good objective
evidence that it didn't save maybe a
couple million jobs however it was a
very small stimulus and it was wiped out
by cutbacks in government spending at
other levels so the stimulus was
actually more or less the same as the
cutback in state and local spending so
as there was no to me as part of this
missing critique on the limits of
stimulus that there's a point where even
if there's even a direct government jobs
program for that matter but the
underlying problem of the stagnant wages
and chronic now high end it goes back 35
years so does there not need to be some
addressing of that because stimulus
alone is not like a resident for an
immediate problem so what's the
wuzzleburg now there's a problem of low
demand corporations who have money
coming out of their ears
they've this huge profits just stored up
they're not creating demand yeah in fact
they're going offshore with the money
now most of them a lot part of it now
that's part of the problem which goes
way back not for now the population
can't people just lost roughly six
trillion dollars it's not small that's
what the housing bubble was and maybe a
couple million more trillion more and
their mutual funds and so on so roughly
a trillion dollars of wealth have been
lost for the population so consumer
demand is it's there but limited now in
that kind of situation the only way you
get the economy moving again is by
government creating demand then but then
one if the economy gets moving again
it'll grow and then with the growth of
the economy
you can return and overcome whatever
but what's pretty much away it's my
dependent of past but in terms of this
democratization of the society doesn't
there need to be something on economic
front that reflects that and if you go
back to the same kind of economy we had
pre-ground we're going let's go back to
that you mentioned stagnating wages
that's a 35-year problem there was a big
growth period without historical
president in the 50s and the 60s into
the early seventies in the mid seventies
there was a major change in economic
policy didn't happen an instant that
type of ever time and it was escalated
by Reagan again by Clinton even more so
by Bush but the it's bipartisan
started in the late Carter years two
things which are related one of them was
a shift towards financialization of the
economy so the share of the profits by
financial institutions started to
increase by now it's you know this
varies estimates roughly a third of
corporate profits they don't contribute
the financial institutions do something
for the economy but nothing on that
scale that's basically harmful to the
economy but it increased enormously now
they're the solid core of economic power
say a third of corporate profits there's
nothing like that associated with
hollowing out of productive industry so
it's a continuation of a processes so
what do you do what should people be
demanding in terms of structural change
on wind on the economics
let's just look at the consequences of
this the consequences are for that for
roughly thirty five thirty years a
little more wages for the majority real
real wages have pretty much stagnated
working hours of increase people have
been getting by by having two adults
working so a lot more women in the
workforce at lower wages and by it
and by asset inflation like say the
housing bubble well that's just not
viable and meanwhile these same people
see that there's plenty of wealth around
but it's going into very few pockets I'm
at the top maybe 1% or even 1/10 of 1%
of the population have been making out
like bandits and so we we now have this
incredible inequality maybe back to the
20s maybe a record and this is part of
people's consciousness I'm working
harder things are getting worse I'm
working more hours benefits which were
never very good declined meanwhile other
people are getting very rich something's
wrong
give me an answer they have a right to
ask for an answer they're not going to
get it from the Democrats the Biegler
called the left because they are the
ones who have been designing and
implementing the policy they're not
going to say yeah that's true that's
what happens when we participated in the
huge growth of the financial sector
which is of dubious significance for the
economy may be harmful largely we did
that and we assisted the policy of
hollowing out production which is a
policy of setting working people in
competition with each other throughout
the world so Eric what we call our trade
policy's a bad term for certainly not
free trade policies were called free
trade policies are essentially a program
of setting working people against each
other throughout the world but
protecting privileged people so for
example we don't allow foreign doctors
and lawyers and economists and others to
practice here there's all kind of
barriers to it so it has a chance
there's some baek's basic structural
change and the Democrats are not going
to say this obviously the Republicans
won't say it the press won't say it so
what comes along is George will the Tea
Party Rush Limbaugh and others who say
ok I have an answer if you listen to
them and I
listen to them I'm interested in it has
it the answer that you get has a kind of
internal coherence
I mean it's off the wall as far as
reality is concerned but it has an
internal logic and at least it's an
answer so you can see why people believe
it and they end up with completely
contradictory attitudes like let's cut
taxes and get the government off our
back but let's increase spending on all
the things I care about
get the government off our back nobody
says get the corporation on your back
well we should have a reasonable
discourse about this but that would
require you know there's only one way
that's going to come about and they
believed by reconstituting a functioning
democratic society to the extent that
there was one which means popular
organizations in which people
participate that's how you get ideas
even if you're working in say on this
floor of MIT in the sciences you don't
sit by yourself you talk to others you
cooperate you work together you figure
out your own thoughts you sharpen other
people's music that's what the labor
unions used to be well that's one of the
reasons why business hates labor unions
so much and has been trying to destroy
them for 60 years
they're dangerous they have a
democratizing effect they bring people
together to read and to allow them to
work together not just to raise their
wages but also to work out what you know
exactly what you're asking what should a
social Republic policy being and of
course they're not the only such
organization we have others and some
still survive churches free things but
to have this expression effective if you
can have this kind of democratization of
the politics at least the beginning of
that process and people start to talk
about these kinds of issues what kind of
economy do we want and and what would
that policy look like well I think what
it kind of economy we want we go way
beyond it I'm just talking about the
very superficial level I'm talking about
let's go way beyond it what sort of
changes should people do it's because
it's the problem let me concrete
yeah because the thing the Tea Party
gave is whatever you make of it it
seemed to be a vision one could fight
for
what's a vision youth an alternative
vision you think that would be more in
the interests of democracy and that has
very concrete aspects so instead of
being abstract about let's take a real
case the government well my
administration essentially took over the
auto industry they basically owned in
quality well there are things that could
have been done what was done was to
continue the policy of shutting plants
shipping work overseas and so on under
the same pretty much a few different
faces but essentially the same
management there's an alternative there
are things the country badly needs for
example high-speed transit when you go
abroad and you come back to the United
States in many ways it looks like a
third-world country give details but
what one typical example is the lack of
efficient mass high-speed public
transportation well the same plant GM
plants that are being shut down have a
skilled workforce in which they could
develop that technology and variety to
the country it would be extremely
important for the economy in the longer
term that would be a step towards
addressing the extremely serious global
warming problem but instead of doing
that what's happening is what the
policies are that the plants are being
shut down trim the workforce got back
meanwhile the Transportation Secretary
is traveling around Europe using federal
stimulus money to get contracts from
Spain and France and other places to
provide high-speed transit for the
United States and it's so in other words
a public option and for the auto
industry that would mean worker take
over the factors which because
management isn't going to agree and
bankers aren't going to agree but it
would mean that the workforce ought and
the community what are called the
stakeholders ought to essentially take
over the the productive system then they
could do this well certainly the
the government with GM and Chrysler
could have had any makeup of the board
they wanted yeah they could have they
could have had stay covert what about on
the finance sector then why not the same
thing a public option for the finance
sector well I say the finance sector
really has to be picked pared down
significantly but there are some
interesting studies going on about this
among economists and take a look at the
last issue of Daedalus and Journal of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences but there are several lengthy
discussions in it by very well-known
economists including Nobel laureates who
raised the interesting question what
does the financial system do for us and
they discuss ways in which you could
find out they haven't really been
investigated but their judgment
basically is well awful lot of it is
harmful it there is a service that the
financial institutions can perform like
directing investment to directing funds
storage fund you know what you leave in
a bank to usable to productive
investment but a huge amount of it is
not doing that
it's devoted to cutting off a couple of
nanoseconds from the financial transfers
which then you reverse the fueling are
seconds later there is nothing to the
economy but absorb huge funds and it
also draws some of the highest talent
which is also a cause well with
financial institutions a real question
is to what extent that we need them I'm
a so extent ok Paul Fokker you may
remember a while back said the only
useful innovation in the financial
sector for the last couple of decades is
the ATM machine he was exaggerating and
making a point but there is a point so
the the financialization of the economy
and incidentally this is the global
economy that is a major issue that has
to be reversed it ever since it happened
roughly the seventies and is there any
way to do that without the same logic
that was the President Obama gave for
the health care system would not be the
same for the finances you can't really
do it without some kind of
public instrument with that could have
easily been done just as it could have
been the technically the same thing
because they really dependent on public
money yes so instead of just saying okay
we'll bail you out and then pay you off
because okay we own you now and will
reconstruct you in a socially useful way
that would require the kind of mass
popular organization that for example
led the New Deal now the New Deal didn't
come out of nowhere
in fact of Roosevelt's it forced me to
do it have yourself a nice boutique of
that is that then puts too much
concentration of power within a federal
government knowing but see if we had a
democratic society functioning one the
federal government would be the
population so it would power in the
hands of the population and their
representatives that's called democracy
so short of it is to Demick democratize
the economics you got to democratize the
politics and vice versa and democratize
the public you have to reconstruct
functioning significant public
organization of the kind that unions
were in the past and will limited extent
still are and there plenty of others
that's what a we can say okay we're not
going to have a democracy fine then
let's just give it all to Goldman Sachs
and Blackwater let them do it that's I
think what George wheeler saying okay if
so let's say you know but if we're going
to pretend to be a democracy let's
become one
let's move towards the kind of society
we're April 15th is a day of celebration
because we were implementing our plans
April we just didn't pay your side taxes
they pay your taxes means okay we're
cooperating to implement the programs
that we've decided on and the same thing
could happen in you know a town where a
GM plant is located and being closed
down and the stakeholders work for some
communities that you know we're going to
take it over and produce what the
country needs right that would require
some federal stimulus just like for GM
to proceed as in the past required a big
federal stimulus but we've done it
different ways we don't have to go to
Spain to get high-speed France
we don't have to go to China to get
solar panels these are social decisions
made by people in power primarily these
days bankers and other financial
institutions and there's no reason for
the public to tolerate that now as long
as I'm going to have that you're going
to get these contradictory attitudes
like cut down on the government cut down
on taxes but increase everything that I
want which is basically what you have
now thanks very much for joining us and
thank you for joining us on the real
news network
