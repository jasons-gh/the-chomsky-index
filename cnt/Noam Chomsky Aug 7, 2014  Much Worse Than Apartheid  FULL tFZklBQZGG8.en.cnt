peach report I'm Amy Goodman with Juan
Gonzalez well to talk more about the
crisis in Gaza we go now to Boston where
we are joined by Noam Chomsky
world-renowned political dissident
linguist author Institute professor
emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology where he's taught for more
than 50 years he has written extensively
about the israel-palestine conflict for
decades 40 years ago this month known
Chomsky published peace in the Middle
East reflections on justice and
nationhood his 1983 book the faithful
triangle the United States Israel in the
Palestinians is known as one of the
definitive works on the israel-palestine
conflict professor Chomsky joins us from
Boston welcome back to Democracy Now
known please first just comment since we
haven't spoken to you throughout the
Israeli assault on Gaza your comments on
what has just taken place it's hideous
atrocity of sadistic vicious murderers
totally llege credible pretext it's
another one of the periodic Israeli
exercises and what they delicately call
mowing the lawn that means a shooting
fish in the pond to make sure that the
animals stay quiet and the cage that
you've constructed for them after which
you go to a period of what's called
ceasefire which means that Hamas
observes the ceasefire as Israel
concedes while Israel continues to
violate it then it's broken by an
Israeli escalation Hamas reaction then
you have a period of mowing the lawn the
this one is in many ways more sadistic
and vicious even in the earlier ones and
one of the pretext that Israel used to
launch these attacks could you talk
about that the and at what to what
degree you feel would have any
led as high Israeli officials concede
Hamas had observed the previous
ceasefire for 19 months the previous
episode of mowing the lawn was a
November 2012 that was a ceasefire the
ceasefire the terms were that Hamas
would not fire rockets what they call
rockets and Israel would move to end the
blockade and stop attacking what they
call militants in Gaza Hamas lived up to
it Israel concedes that in april of this
year an event took place which horrified
the Israeli government the unity
agreement was formed between Gaza and
the West Bank between Hamas and Fatah
Israel has been desperately trying to
prevent that for a long time there's a
background we could talk about but it's
important any of the unity agreement
came Israel was furious they got even
more upset when the u.s. more or less
endorsed it which is a big blow to them
they launched a rampage in the West Bank
what was used as a pretext was the
brutal murder of three setter teenagers
there was a pretense that they were
alive though they knew they were dead
that allowed a huge of course they
blamed it right away on Hamas they have
yet to produce a particle of evidence
and in fact their own highest leading
authorities pointed out right right away
that the killers were probably from a
kind of a rogue a clan in hebburn cosmic
clan she turns out apparently be true
they've been a thorn in the sides of
Hamas for years they don't follow their
orders but anyway that gave a
opportunity for a rampage in the West
Bank arresting the hundreds of people
reading many who had been released
mostly for targeting Hamas killings
increased finally there was a Hamas
response the so-called rocket attacks
and that gave the opportunity for mowing
the lawn again you said that Israel does
this periodically Noam Chomsky why do
they do this periodically because they
want to maintain a certain situation
there's a background for over 20 years
Israel has been dedicated with us
support to separating Gaza from the West
Bank that's in direct violation of the
terms of the Oslo accord 20 years ago
which declared that the West Bank and
Gaza are a single territorial entity
whose integrity must be preserved but
for rogue states solemn agreements are
just an invitation to do it or you want
so Israel with us backing has been
committed keeping them separate and
there's a good reason for that just look
at the map if a Gaza is the only outlet
to the outside world for any eventual
Palestinian entity whatever it might be
the West Bank if separated from Gaza the
West Bank is essentially imprisoned
Israel on one side the Jordanian
dictatorship on the other furthermore
Israel is systematically driving
Palestinians out of the Jordan Valley
sinking Wells building settlements the
first golden military zones and put in
settlements usual story that would mean
that whatever canton's
are left for Palestinians in the West
Bank after Israel takes what it wants
and integrated into Israel they would be
completely imprisoned Gaza would be an
outlet to the outside world so therefore
keeping them separate from one another
is a high goal of policy us and Israeli
policy and the unity agreement
threatened that threatened something
else Israel asthma claiming for years
one of its arguments for front of
evading negotiations is how can they
negotiate with the Palestinians when
they're divided well okay so if they're
not divided you lose with that argument
but the more significant one is simply
the geostrategic one which is what I
described so the unity government was a
real threat along with the tepid but
real endorsement of it by the United
States and they immediately reacted and
normal what do you make of this of the
as you say Israel seeks to maintain the
status quo at the same time continue to
create a new reality on the ground of
expanded settlements what do you make of
the continued refusal of one
administration after another here in the
United States which officially is
opposed to the settlement expansion to
refuse to call Israel to the table on
this attempt to create this its own
reality on the ground well your phrase
officially opposed is quite correct but
we can look at you have to distinguish
the rhetoric of the government from its
actions and the rhetoric of political
leaders from their actions that should
be obvious so we can see how committed
the u.s. is to this policy easily for
example in February 2011 the UN Security
Council considered a resolution which
called for
or it's called on israel to terminate
its expansion of settlements notice that
it the expansion of settlements is not
really the issue it's the settlement the
settlements the infrastructure
development all of this is a gross
violation of international law that's
been determined by the Security Council
the International Court of Justice every
every country in the world outside of
Israel recognizes this but this was a
resolution calling for an end to
expansion of settlements official US
policy what happened Obama vetoed the
resolution that tells you something
furthermore the official statements to
Israel about the settlement expansion is
accompanied by what in diplomatic
language is called a wink and a quiet
indication that we don't really mean it
so for example Obama's latest
condemnation of the recent as he puts it
violence on all sides was accompanied by
sending more military aid to Israel they
can understand that and that's been true
all along in fact when Obama came into
office he made the usual statements
against settlement expansion and his
administration was a spokes persons were
asked in press conferences whether Obama
would do anything about it the way the
first George Bush did something mild
sanctions up to block settlement
expansion and the answer was no this is
just symbolic well that tells the
Israeli government exactly what's
happening and in fact if you look
step-by-step the military aid continues
the economic aid continues the
diplomatic protection continues the
ideological protection
venues by that I mean framing the issues
in ways that conform to Israeli demand
all of that continues along with kind of
clucking of the tongue saying what we
really don't like it and it's not
helpful to peace any government could
understand that I want to turn to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu who spoke to a foreign
journalist yesterday accepted and Hamas
rejected the Egyptian ceasefire proposal
of July fifteenth I want you to know
that at that time the conflict that
claimed some 185 lives only on Monday
night that Hamas finally agreed to that
very same proposal which went into
effect yesterday morning that means that
ninety percent a full ninety percent of
the fatalities in this conflict could
have been avoided and Hamas not rejected
then the ceasefire that it accepts now
Hamas must be held accountable for the
tragic loss of life Noam Chomsky can you
respond to the Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu response and abroad
response the narrow response is that of
course as Netanyahu knows that ceasefire
proposal was arranged between the
Egyptian military dictatorship and
Israel both of them very hostile to
Hamas it was not even communicated to
Hamas they learned about it through
social media and they were angered by
that naturally they said they won't
accept it on those terms that's the
narrow response the broad response is
that a hundred percent of the casualties
and the destruction and the devastation
and so on could have been avoided if
Israel had lived up to the ceasefire
agreement after the in from November
2012 instead of violating
constantly and then escalating the
violation in the manner that I described
in order to block the unity government
and to persist in their policy of the
policies of taking over what they want
in the West Bank and keeping get
separated it from Gaza and keeping guys
on what they've called a diet of ice
glasses famous comment the man who
negotiated the so-called withdrawal in
2005 pointed out that the purpose of the
withdrawal is to end the discussion of
any political settlement to block any
possibility of a Palestinian state and
meanwhile the Gazans will be kept on a
diet meaning just enough calories
allowed so they don't all die because
that wouldn't look good for Israel's
fading reputation but nothing more than
that and with its vaunted the technical
capacity israel israeli experts are
calculated precisely how many calories
would be needed to keep the Gazans on
their diet under siege blocked from
export to block from import the
fishermen can't go out the fish the
naval vessels driving back to shore
large part probably over third maybe
more of Gaza's arable land is barred
from entry to Palestinians it's called a
barrier that's the norm that's the diet
they want to keep them on that mean well
separated from the West Bank and
continue the ongoing project of taking
over describe the details but it's not
obscure taking over the parts of the
West Bank that Israel intends is
integrating into Israel and presumably
will ultimately
acts in some fashion as long as the
United States continues to support it
and block international efforts to lead
to a political settlement and nomaz this
whole month has unfolded and these
images of the carnage in Gaza have
spread around the world what's your
assessment of the impact are they
already abysmal relationship that exists
between the United States government and
the Arab and Muslim world I'm thinking
especially of all the young Muslims and
Arabs around the world maybe had not
been exposed to prior atrocities in the
in the israeli-palestinian conflict
first of all we have to distinguish
between the Muslim and Arab populations
and the government striking difference
the governments are mostly dictatorship
when you read in the press that the
Arabs support us and so and so what is
meant is the dictator support us not the
populations the dictatorships are
moderately supportive of what the US and
Israel are doing that includes the
military dictatorship in Egypt very
brutal one Saudi Arabian dictatorship
Saudi Arabia is the closest US ally in
the region in its the most radical
fundamentalist Islamic state in the
world that's also spreading its Salafi
Wahabi doctrines throughout the world
the extremist fundamentalist doctrines
it's been the leading ally of the United
States for years just as it was written
before it they've both tended to prefer
radical Islam to the danger of secular
nationalism and democracy and they are
fairly supportive of they don't like
they hate Hamas they have no interest in
the Palestinians they have to say things
too
modify their own populations but again
rhetoric and action are different so the
gut the dictatorships are not appalled
by with what's happening they probably
are quietly curing it the populations of
course are quite different but that's
always been true so for example on the
eve of the Tahrir Square demonstrations
in Egypt which overthrew the Mubarak
dictatorship there were international
polls taken in the United States by the
leading polling agencies and they showed
very clearly that I think about eighty
percent of Egyptians regarded the the
main threats to them as being Israel in
the United States and in fact
condemnation of the United States and
its policies was so extreme that even
though they don't like it ran a majority
felt that the region might be safer if
Iran had nuclear weapons we'll look over
the whole polling story over the years
it kind of varies around something like
that but that's the population and of
course the Muslim populations elsewhere
that don't like it either but it's not
just the Muslim populations so for
example there was a demonstration in
London recently which probably had
hundreds of thousands of people was
quite a huge demonstration protesting
the Israeli atrocities in Gaza and
that's happening elsewhere in the world
too it's worth remembering that you go
back a couple decades now Israel was one
of the most admired countries in the
world now it's one of the most feared
and despised countries in the world
Israeli propagandists like to say well
this is just anti-semitism but these are
to the extent that there's an
anti-semitic element which is slight
it's because of Israeli actions the
reaction is to the policies
as long as Israel persists in these
policies that's what's going to happen
actually this has been pretty clear
since the early 1970s chief I've been
writing about it since then but so
obvious that I don't take any credit for
that in 1971 Israel made a fateful
decision go for the most faithful in its
history I think President Sadat of Egypt
offered Israel a full peace treaty in
return for withdrawal of Israel from the
Egyptian of Sinai that was the Labour
government so-called moderate Labour
government at the time they considered
the offer and rejected it they were
planning to carry out extensive
development programs in the Sinai build
a huge big city I'm eatin on the
Mediterranean dozens of the settlements
2-butene others big infrastructure
driving tens of thousands of better ones
off the land destroying the villages and
so on those were the plans beginning to
implement them and Israel made a
decision to choose expansion over
security a treaty with is with Egypt
would have meant security that's the
only significant military force in the
Arab world and that's been the policy
ever since when you pursue a policy of
repression and expansion over security
you're going to certainly there are
things that are going to happen there
will be moral degeneration within the
country there will be increasing
opposition and anger and hostility among
populations outside the country you may
continue to get support from
dictatorship and from you know the US
administration but you're going to lose
the populations and that has
consequence the you could predict in
fact I others did predict back in the
70s that is just a quote myself those
who are call themselves supporters of
Israel are actually supporters of its
moral degeneration international
isolation and very possibly ultimate
destruction that's what that's the
course that's happening it's not the
only example in history there are many
analogies drone to South Africa most of
them pretty dubious in my mind but
there's one analogy which i think is
pretty realistic which isn't discussed
very much it should be in 1958 the South
African nationalist government which was
imposing the harsh apartheid regime
recognized that they're becoming
internationally isolated we know from
declassified documents that in 1958 the
South African foreign minister called in
the American ambassador and we have the
conversation he essentially told him
look we're becoming a pariah state we're
losing old everyone's voting against us
in the United Nations we're becoming
isolated but it really doesn't matter
because you're the only voice that
counts and as long as you support us
doesn't really matter what the world
thinks that wasn't a bad prediction if
you look at what happened over the years
opposition to South African apartheid
grew and developed there were there was
a UN arms embargo sanctions began
boycotts began it was so extreme by the
1980s that even the US Congress was
passing sanctions which President Reagan
had to veto he was the last supporter of
the apartheid regime heaton Congress
actually pad
reinstated the sanctions over his veto
and he then violated as late as 1988
Reagan the last holdout his
administration declared the African
National Congress Mandela's African
National Congress to be one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
so the US had to keep supporting South
Africa of the sporting terrorist
terrorist group but it wouldn't done on
Angola finally even the united states
joined the rest of the world and very
quickly the apartheid regime collapsed
now that's not fully analogous to the
Israel case by any means there were
other reasons for the collapse of
apartheid two crucial reason that one of
them was that there was a settlement
that was acceptable to South African and
international business simple settlement
a keep the socio-economic system and
allow put it metaphorically allow blacks
and black faces and the limousines
that's that was the settlement and it's
pretty much what's been implemented not
totally there's no comparable settlement
in Israel Palestine but a crucial
element not discussed here is Cuba Cuba
sent military forces and put them tens
of thousands of technical workers at
doctors and the teachers and others and
they drove the South African aggressors
out of Angola and they compelled them to
abandon illegally held Namibia and more
than that as in fact Nelson Mandela
pointed out as soon as he got out of
prison the Cuban soldiers who
incidentally were black soldiers
shattered the myth of invincibility of
the white super men that had a very
significant effect on both black
the white South Africa it indicated in
the South African government and
population that they're not going to be
able to impose their hope of a regional
support system quiet system that would
allow them to pursue the their
operations inside South Africa and their
terrorist activities beyond and that was
a major factor in the liberation of
black Africa no we have to break and
we're going to come back to this
discussion we're talking to Noam Chomsky
world-renowned political dissident
linguist author Institute professor
emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology this is democracy now we'll
be back with professor Chomsky Noam
ha
while with his hot gun on me mol didn't
now get down
taking our town sure is stop
Oh
are you
well
more dead and Gaza moans by Dave littman
this is democracy now democracynow.org
the war and peace report i meani Goodman
with Juan Gonzalez our guest is
professor Noam Chomsky I want to turn to
President Obama speaking Wednesday to
news conference in washington d.c long
term there has to be a recognition that
Gaza cannot sustain itself permanently
closed off from the world and incapable
of providing some opportunity jobs
economic growth for the population that
lives there particularly given how
densest that population is how young
that population is we're going to have
to see a shift in opportunity for the
people of Gaza I have no sympathy for
Hamas I have great sympathy for ordinary
people who are struggling within Gaza
that's President Obama yesterday noam
chomsky can you respond well as always
for all states and all political
leadership we have to distinguish
rhetoric from action any political
leader can produce a lovely rhetoric
even a Hitler Stalin where we want what
we ask is what are they doing so exactly
what does Obama suggest or carry out as
a means to achieve the goal of ending
the us-backed Israeli siege blockade of
Gaza which is creating the situation
what is it done in the past what does it
propose to do in the future there are
things that the US could do very easily
it's a point again don't want to draw
the South African analogy too closely
but it is indicative and it's not the
only case the same happened as your
member on in the Indonesia East teamwork
case when the United States Clinton
finally told the Indonesian generals the
game's over they pulled out immediately
the u.s. power is substantial and in the
case of Israel it's critical because
Israel relies on virtually unilateral us
support the plenty of things the US can
do to implement what Obama talked about
and the question is and in fact when the
u.s. gives orders Israel obeys that's
happened over and over again that's
completely obvious why given the power
relationships so things can be done they
were done by Bush to buy Clinton by
Reagan and the US could do them again
then we'll know whether those words were
anything other than the usual Pleasant
rhetoric about separating rhetoric from
actions Israel's always claimed that it
it no longer occupies Gaza we had the
democracy now recently spoke to Joshua
Hampton who's a senior adviser to the
Israeli ambassador of the United States
and a former spokesperson for the
Israeli Defense Ministry and hatman said
quote Israel actually left the Gaza
Strip in 2005 we removed all of our
settlements we remove the IDF forces we
took out ten thousand Jews from their
houses as a step for peace because
Israel wants peace and it extended its
hands for peace your response well
several point first of all the United
Nations every country in the world even
the United States regards Israel as the
occupying power and Gaza for a very
simple reason they control everything
there are they control the the borders
the land sea air they determine what
goes into Gaza what comes out they
determine how many
calories Gazan children need to stay
alive but not to flourish that's
occupation under international law and
no one questions it outside of Israel
even the US agrees their usual backer
that puts with that we end the
discussion of whether they're an
occupying power or not as for wanting
peace that look back at that support
withdrawal notice that it left Israel as
the occupying power by 2005 Israeli
Hawks led by Ariel sharone in Matic Hawk
recognized that it just makes no sense
for Israel to keep a few thousand
settlers in devastated Gaza and the
devote a large part of the IDF the
Israeli military to protecting them many
expenses and breaking up Gaza so that in
two separate parts and so on made no
sense to do that made a lot more sense
to take those settlers from their
subsidized settlements in Gaza where
they were illegally residing and send
them off to subsidized settlements in
the West Bank in areas that Israel
intends to keep illegally of course that
just made pragmatic sense and there was
a very easy way to do it now they could
have simply informed the settlers and
Gaza that on august first the IDF is
going to withdraw and at that point they
would have climbed into the lorries that
are provided to them and going off to
their illegal settlements in the West
Bank and incidentally the Golan Heights
but it was decided to construct what
sometimes called a national trauma so a
trauma was constructed a theater it was
as ridiculed by in leading specialists
in Israel like the leading sociologist
bar Kimberly
just make fun of it and trauma was
created so you could have little boys
pictures of them pleading with the
Israeli soldiers don't destroy my home
and shout and then the background calls
of never again that means never again
make us leave anything referring to the
West Bank primarily and a stage national
trauma what made it particularly
farcical was that it was a repetition of
what even Israeli press called national
trauma 82 when they staged the trauma
when they had to withdraw from Yummie
the city they illegally built in the
Sinai but they kept the occupation they
moved on and it i'll repeat what vice
gloss said recall he was the negotiator
with the United States showrooms
confidant he said the purpose of the
withdrawal is to end negotiations on a
Palestinian state and Palestinian rights
this will end it this will freeze it
with us support and then comes
imposition of the diet on Gaza to keep
them barely alive but not flourishing in
the siege within weeks after the
so-called withdrawal Israel escalated
the attacks on Gaza and imposed very
harsh sanctions backed by the United
States the reason was that a free
election took place in Palestine and it
came out the wrong way well Israel in
the United States of course love
democracy but only if it comes out the
way they want so the US and Israel
instantly imposed harsh sanctions is
really a tax which really never ended
escalated Europe to its shame went along
as in Israel in the United States
immediately began plan
named for a military coup to overthrow
the government when Hamas preempted that
coo that was fury in both countries the
sanctions and military attacks increased
and then we're on to what we discussed
before periodic episodes of the only
known we only have a minute very quickly
at this point a lot of us media is
saying in the US has been sidelined it's
now all about Egypt doing this
negotiation what needs to happen right
now we the ceasefire will end in a
matter of hours if it isn't extended
what kind of truce needs to be
accomplished here well for Israel with
us backing the current situation is a
kind of a win-win situation if Hamas
agrees to extend the ceasefire Israel
can continue with its regular policies
which I described before taking over
what they won the West Bank separating
from Gaza at keeping the diet and so on
if Hamas doesn't accept the ceasefire
and Netanyahu can make another speech
like the one you the cynical speech you
quoted earlier the only thing that can
break this if the is if the u.s. changes
its policies as has happened in other
cases i mentioned to south africa team
or as others and that's decisive if
there's going to be a change it will
crucially depend on a change in US
policy here for 40 years the United
States has been unilaterally backing
Israeli rejection ism refusal to
entertain the overwhelming international
consensus yeah we totally we have to
leave it there but we're going to
continue our conversation post show and
we're going to post online at
democracynow.org Noam Chomsky
world-renowned political is democracy
now democracynow.org the war and peace
report I'm Amy Goodman as a new 72-hour
truce in Gaza appears to be holding we
turn now to part two of our interview
with noam chomsky the world renown
political dissident linguist and
Institute professor emeritus at the
massachusetts institute of technology
where he's taught for more than 50 years
he's authored over a hundred books
including most recently gaza and crisis
reflections on Israel's war against the
Palestinians which he wrote with
Professor Ilan Pappe I spoke to nam
cheong Chomsky on Thursday in the middle
of the initial 72-hour ceasefire I
started by asking him about us media
coverage of the conflict by playing him
a clip from a recent CBS Face the Nation
show with host Bob Schieffer in the
Middle East the Palestinian people find
themselves in the grip of a terrorist
group that is embarked on a strategy to
get its own children killed in order to
build sympathy for its cause a strategy
that might actually be working at least
in some quarters last week I found a
quote of many years ago by goal to my
ear one of Israel's early leaders which
might have been said yesterday we can
forgive the Arabs for killing our
children she said but we can never
forgive them for forcing us to kill
their children that was CBS journalist
Bob Schieffer Noam Chomsky can you
respond well we don't really have to
listen to CBS because we can listen
directly to the Israeli propaganda
agencies which is quoting it's a
shameful moment for us media when it
insists on being subservient to the
grotesque propaganda agencies of a
violent aggressive state as for the
comment itself Israeli common which
equaled the propaganda comment which he
quoted I guess maybe the best comment
about that was made by the great Israeli
journalist on the Rojas who just
described it as sadism masked as
compassion it's about the right
characterization
I wanted to also ask you about the UN's
role and the US visa V as well the
United States this is the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights Navi
Pillay criticizing the US for its role
in the Israeli assault on Gaza they have
not only provided the heavy weaponry
which is now being used by Israel in
Gaza but they've also provided almost 1
billion dollars in providing the iron
dome's to protect Israelis from the
rocket attacks but no such protection
has been provided to garson's against
the shelling so I am reminding the
united states that it's a party to the
international human rights and Italian
law and human rights law that was Navi
Pillay the UN High Commissioner for
Human Rights Nome on Friday this was the
point where the death toll for
Palestinians had exceeded Operation Cast
Lead it had passed 1400 president obama
was in the White House and he held a
news conference he didn't raise the
issue of Gaza in the news conference but
he was immediately asked about Gaza and
he talked about he reaffirmed the u.s.
support for Israel said that the
resupply of ammunition was happening
that the 220 million dollars would be
going for an expanded Iron Dome Israel
has a right to defend itself from rocket
attacks that terrorized the Israeli
people there's no country on earth that
can be expected to live under a daily
barrage of rockets there's no country on
earth that can be expected to live under
a daily barrage of rockets and I'm proud
that the Iron Dome system that Americans
helped Israel develop and fund has saved
many Israeli lives but then the weekend
took place yet another attack on a UN
shelter on one of the schools were
thousands of Refuge
Finian's had taken refuge and a number
of them were killed including children
and even the US then joined with the UN
in criticizing in criticizing what
Israel was doing can you talk about what
the US has done and if you really do see
a shift right now well let's start with
what the US has done and continue with
the comments on of the with the UN Human
Rights Commission right at that time to
time to quote you gave over the radio
over the that you gave before there was
a decision that the debate in the Human
Rights Commission about whether to have
an investigation no action just an
investigation of what had happened in
Gaza an investigation of possible
violations of human rights possibles
kind of a joke it was passed with one
negative vote guess who Obama voted
against an investigation while he was
giving these polite comments that's
action the United States continues to
provide as be like pointed out the
critical the decisive support for the
atrocities when what's called Israeli
jet planes bombed defenseless targets
and Gaza that's us jet planes with
Israeli pilots and the same with the
high-tech munition and so on and so
forth so this is again sadism mascis
compassion those are the actions what
about opinion in the United States can
you talk about the role that it plays we
saw some certainly remarkable changes
MSNBC
the reporter a man maulding who had been
at Al Jazeera very respected he had been
together with Sherine Tadros in 2008 the
only Western reporters in Gaza covering
Operation Cast Lead tremendous
experience in the area and he was pulled
out by MSNBC but because there was a
tremendous response against this with I
think what was trending was let Amon
report he was then brought back in so
there was a feeling that people wanted
to get a sense of what was happening on
the ground there seemed to be some kind
of opening do you sense a difference in
the American population how the attitude
toward what's happening in Israel and
the occupied territories very definitely
it's been happening over some years and
it's it there was a kind of a point of
inflection it increased after cast lead
which horrified many people and it's
happening again now you can see it
everywhere takes a the New York Times of
the New York Times devoted a good part
of their op-ed page to a Gaza diary a
couple of days ago which was
heart-rending and eloquent they've had
strong Abed's condemning extremist
Israeli policies that's that's new and
it reflects something that's happening
in the country you can see the polls
especially among young people among if
you look at the polling results of the
population below 30 roughly by now has
shifted substantially that you can see
it on college campuses I mean I see it
personally I've been giving talks on
these things for almost 50 years I used
to have police protection literally even
to my own University the meetings were
broken up violently you know enormous
protest within the past roughly a decade
that's changed substantially
the Palestinian solidarity may be the
biggest issue on campus huge audiences
can't there is Nene hardly get a hostile
question that's a tremendous change
that's strikingly among younger people
but they become older however there's
something we have to remember about the
United States it's not put the mockers
it's a plutocracy there's study after
study that comes out in mainstream
academic political science which shows
what we all know or oughta know that
decision political decisions are made by
a very small sector of extreme privilege
and wealth concentrated capital for most
of the population their opinions simply
don't matter in the political system
they're essentially disenfranchised get
the details if you like but that's
basically the store now public opinion
can make a difference even in
dictatorships the public can't be
ignored and in a partially democratic
society like this even less so so I this
will make a difference and how long
ultimately is well that's up to us we've
seen it before that takes a the the East
teamwork case which I mentioned for 25
years the United States strongly
supported the vicious is ray Indonesian
invasion and massacre virtual genocide
it was happening right through 1999 as
the Indonesian atrocities increased
escalated after Delia the capital city
was practically evacuated by after
Indonesian attacks us was still
supporting it finally in mid-september
1999 under considerable international
and also domestic pressure Clinton
I Utley told the Indonesian generals
finished and they they had said they'd
never leave they said this is our
territory they pulled out within days
and allow the UN peacekeeping force to
enter without without Indonesian
military resistance well you know that's
a dramatic indication of what can be
done South Africa is a more complex case
but has similarities and there are
others sooner or later it's possible and
that's really up to us that domestic
pressure will compel the US government
to join the world on this issue and that
will be a decisive change MIT professor
Noam Chomsky after break we'll talk
about BDS the boycott divestment and
sanctions movement
this is democracy now democracynow.org
the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
as we continue our conversation with MIT
professor Noam Chomsky the world
renowned political dissident linguist
author has written more than a hundred
books one of his latest Gaza in crisis I
interviewed him on Thursday no I wanted
to ask you about your recent piece for
the nation and Israel Palestine in BDS
you were critical of the effectiveness
of the boycott divestment and sanctions
movement one of the many responses came
from use of money year the executive
director of the Jerusalem fund and it's
educational program the Palestine Center
he wrote quote chomsky's criticism of
BDS seems to be that it hasn't changed
the power dynamic yet and thus that it
can't there's no doubt the road ahead is
a long one for BDS but there's also no
doubt the movement is growing all other
paths toward change including diplomacy
and armed struggle have so far proved
ineffective and some of imposed
significant costs on Palestinian life
and livelihood could you respond well
actually I did respond you can find it
on the nation website but in brief far
from being critical of BDS I was
strongly supportive of it one of the
oddities of what's called the BDS
movement is that they can't many of the
activists just can't see support a
support unless it becomes something like
almost worship repeat the Catechism if
you take a look at that article it very
strongly supported these tactics in fact
I was involved in them and supporting
them before the BDS movement even
existed the right tactics but tact but
it should be second nature to activists
and it usually is that you have to ask
yourself when you conduct some tactic
when you pursue it what the effect is
going to be on the victim
you don't person with tactic because it
makes you feel good you pursue it
because it's going to estimate that it
will help the victims and you have to
make choices now this goes way back
you'll say back during the Vietnam War
there were debates about whether you
should the resort to violent tactics a
weathermen style tactics he could
understand the motivation people were
desperate but the Vietnamese were
strongly opposed and many of us me
included were also opposed not because
you know the horrors don't justify some
strong action but because the
consequences would be harm to the
victims the atactic would increase
support for the work for the violence
which in fact is what happened those
questions arise all the time
unfortunately that Palestinian
solidarity movements have been unusual
in their unwillingness to think these
things through that was pointed out
recently again by Raja Shahada leading
figure in lives in vermont all alone
upon support of the founder of all
thought the legal organization a very
significant power of a figure he pointed
out that the Palestinian leadership has
tended to focus on what he called
absolutes absolute justice this is the
absolute justice that we want and not to
pay attention to pragmatic policies
that's been very obvious for decades it
used to drive people like equal Achmed
really committed and knowledgeable
militant that used to run crazy they
just couldn't listen to pragmatic
questions which are what matter for
success in a popular movement in
nationalist movement
the ones who understand that can succeed
the ones that don't understand it can't
do you what choices do you feel that the
BDS movement that activates interracial
very clear but to discuss them in the
article those actions that have been
directed against the occupation have
been quite successful very successful
most of them don't have anything to do
with the BDS movement so take see one of
the most extreme and most successful is
the European Union decision directive to
block any connection to any institution
governmental or private that has
anything to do with the occupied
territories that's a pretty strong move
that's the kind of move that was taken
with regard to South Africa just a
couple of months ago the Presbyterian
Church here called for divestment from
any multinational corporation that's
involved in any way in the occupation
and there's been case after case like
that that makes perfect sense there
there also so far there haven't been any
sanctions so BDS is a little misleading
it's me d really but that could be
sanctions and there's an obvious way to
proceed there has been for years and has
plenty of support in fact on this
international cold for it during the
cast led operations that's an arms
embargo for the u.s. to impose an arms
embargo or even to discuss it would be a
major issue major contribution that's
the most important of the possible
sanctions and as a basis for it us arms
to Israel or in violation of US law
direct violation of US law you look at
US foreign assistance law it bars any
military assistance to anyone in country
unit whatever engaged in consistent
human
violations well you know Israel's
violation of human rights violations is
so extreme and consistent that you
hardly have to argue about it that means
that US aid Israel is in military aid is
in direct violation of US law and as
people I pointed up before the u.s. is a
high contracting party to the Geneva
Conventions so it's violating its own
extremely serious international
commitment commitment by not imposing
working to impose the Geneva Conventions
that's an obligation for the High
Contracting Parties like the US and that
means to impose to prevent a violation
of international humanitarian law and
certainly not to a vet it so the u.s. is
both in violation of its commitments to
international humanitarian law and also
in violation of US domestic law and
that's there's some understanding of
that I wanted to get your response known
to Nicholas Kristof on the issue of
Palestinian non-violence writing in The
New York Times last month Christoph
wrote quote Palestinian militancy has
accomplished nothing but increasing the
misery of the Palestinian people if
Palestinians instead turn more to huge
Gandhi style non-violence resistance
campaigns the resulting videos would
reverberate around the world in
Palestine would achieve statehood and
freedom Noam Chomsky your response well
first of all it's a total fabrication
Palestinian non-violence has been going
on for a long time very significant non
violent actions I haven't seen the
reverberations and Kristoff's columns
for example or anywhere I mean there is
among popular movements but not what
he's describing
there's also a good deal of cynicism in
those comment what he should be doing is
preaching non-violence to the United
States the leading perpetrator of
violence in the world hasn't been
reported here but an international poll
last December the Gallup here and its
counterpart in England leading polling
agencies was an international poll of
full of opinion one of the questions
that was asked is which country is the
greatest threat to world peace I guess
it was first nobody even close the
United States was way in the lead far
behind was Pakistan and that was
probably because mostly the Indian vote
well that's what Nicholas Kristof should
be the comedy on he should be calling
for non-violence where he is where we
are where you and I are that would make
a big difference in the world and of
course non-violence in our client states
like Israel we provide directly the
means for the violence or Saudi Arabia
extreme brutal fundamentalist state
where we send them into billions of
dollars of military aid on wasted on
discuss that would make sense it's easy
to preach non-violence to some victim
somewhere saying you should be violent
will be as violent was any life but
you'd not be violent that aside the
recommendation is correct and in fact
it's been a recommendation of people
dedicated to Palestinian rights for many
years fo epilim ado I mentioned 40 years
of his you know its background he was
active in the Algerian resistance a long
long history of both very acute
political analysis and direct engagement
in third world struggles he was very
close to the PLO consistently urged this
as
many many people did be included and in
fact there's been plenty of it not
enough but as I say it's very easy to
recommend to victims and you be nice
guys that's cheap what's even if it's
correct it's cheap what matters is what
we say about ourselves are we going to
be nice guys that's the important thing
particularly when it's the United States
the country which quite rightly is
regarded by the internationally as the
leading threat to world peace and the
decisive threat and the Israeli case no
no hamid suleiman palestinian human
rights worker in gaza wrote in The
Huffington Post during the Israeli
assault quote the reality is that if
Palestinians stop resisting Israel won't
stop occupying as its leaders repeatedly
affirmed the besieged Jews of the Warsaw
Ghetto had a motto to live and die in
dignity as I sit in my own besieged
ghetto he writes I think how
Palestinians have honored this universal
value we live in dignity and we die in
dignity refusing to accept subjugation
we're tired of war but I also can no
longer tolerate the return to a deeply
unjust status quo I can no longer agree
to live in this open-air prison your
response to what Muhammad Suleiman broke
several points in first about the were
so ghetto there's very interesting
debate going on right now in Israel and
the Hebrew press as to whether the
warsaw ghetto uprising was justified it
began with an article by survivor it
went through many details and argued
that the uprising which was a sort of a
rogue element he said actually and
seriously endangered the truths of the
surviving chosen Guetta and harms of
them came responses and there's a debate
but that's exactly the kind of question
you want to ask all the time what's
going to be the effect of the action on
the victims it's not a trivial question
in the case of the Warsaw Ghetto
obviously the maybe the Nazis are the
extreme and brutality in human history
and you have to stop surely sympathize
and support the ghetto inhabitants and
survivors on the victims of course but
nevertheless the tactical question
arises this is not a and it arises here
to all the time if you're serious about
concern for the victims but his general
point is accurate and it's essentially
was trying to say before Israel wants
quiet once the Palestinians to be nice
and quiet a non-violent way Nicholas
Kristof urges and then what will Israel
do we aren't the guess that's what they
have been doing and they'll continue as
long as there's no resistance to it what
they're doing is briefly taking over
whatever they want whatever they see is
a value in the West Bank leaving
Palestinians and essentially unviable
cations pretty much in prison separating
the West Bank from Gaza in violation of
the solemn commitments of the Oslo
Accords keeping Gaza under siege and on
a diet meanwhile incidentally taking
over the Golan Heights already annexed
in violation of explicit security
council orders vastly expanding
Jerusalem way beyond any historical size
in and Xing it in violation of security
council orders don't huge infrastructure
projects which make it possible for
people living in the nice hills of the
West Bank to get to Tel Aviv in a few
minutes
without seeing any Arabs that's what
they'll continue doing just does it have
been as long as the United States
supports it that's the decisive point
and that's what we should be focusing on
we're here we can do things here and
that happens to be of critical
significance in this case that's going
to be it's not the only factor but it's
the determinative factor and what the
optimal will be MIT professor Noam
Chomsky author of among many other books
Gaza in crisis after break he'll talk
about how is Israel's actions and the
occupied territories compared to what
happened in apartheid South Africa stay
with
this is democracy now democracynow.org
the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
as we continue a conversation with MIT
professor Noam Chomsky world-renowned
political dissident and linguist is
written over a hundred books including
Gaza and crisis I spoke with him on
thursday in the midst of the initial
72-hour ceasefire I asked professor
Chomsky about Congress unanimously
passing resolutions last month in
support of Israel that's right because
and that's exactly what we have to
combat by organization and action take
South Africa again it wasn't until the
1980s that Congress began to pass
sanctions as I said Reagan vetoed them
and then violated them and they were
passed over Z 2 at least they were
passing them but that's decades after
massive protests were developing around
the world it infected you know BDS style
tactics that was never BDS movement the
BDS style tactics began to be carried
out on a popular level in the United
States beginning in the late 70s but
really picking up in the 80s that's
decades after a large skill actions of
that kind were being taken elsewhere and
ultimately that had an effect well we're
not there yet you have to recall it's
important to recall that by the time
Congress was passing sanctions against
South Africa the American business
community which really is decisive at
determining policy had pretty much
turned against apartheid just wasn't
worth it for them and as I said the
agreement that was finally reached was
acceptable to them difference from the
Israeli case we're not there now right
now Israel is one of the top recipients
of the US investment Warren Buffett for
example recently bought a couple of
billion dollars spent for
some factory in Israel and installment
and said that this is the best place for
investment outside the United States
Intel is setting up its major a new
generation chip factory their military
industry is closely linked to Israel
well this is quite different from the
South Africa case we have to work
because it'll take a lot of work to get
there yes you done and yet gnome you say
that the analogy between Israel's
occupation of the territories and
apartheid South Africa is a dubious one
why many reasons for take say the term
apartheid in the occupied territories
what Israel is doing is much worse than
apartheid to call it apartheid is a gift
in Israel at least if by apartheid you
mean South african-style apartheid
what's happening the occupied
territories is much worse there's a
crucial difference the South African
nationalists needed the black population
that was their workforce with eighty
five percent of the workforce of the
population and I was basically their
workforce they needed them they had to
sustain them the bantered stands were
horrifying but South Africa did try to
sustain them they didn't put him on a
diet they tried to keep him strong
enough to do the work they needed for
the country they tried to get
international support for the batter
stint the Israeli relationship to the
Palestinians and the occupied
territories is totally different they
just don't want them they want them out
or at least in prison that's a rat and
they're acting that way that's a very
striking difference which means that the
apartheid analogy South African
apartheid to the West back to the
occupied territories is just a gift is
really violent it's much worse than that
if you look inside Israel there's plenty
of repression and discrimination
about it extensively for decades but
it's not apartheid it's bad but it's not
a part of it so the term I just don't
think is applicable I wanted to get your
response to gear a lawn former Israeli
national security advisor speaking to
The New York Times Ilan said quote you
cannot win against an effective gorilla
organization when on the one hand you're
fighting them and on the other hand you
continue to supply them with water and
food and gas and electricity Israel
should have declared a war against the
de facto state of Gaza and if there's
misery and starvation and Gaza it might
lead the other side to make such hard
decisions Noam Chomsky if you could
respond to this that's that's basically
the debate within the Israeli political
echelon should we follow those vice
glosses a position of maintaining them
on a diet of bare survival so you make
sure children don't get chocolate bars
but you allow them to have say Cheerios
in the morning should we should we
actually known can you explain that
because when you've talked about it
before it sort of sounds more this diet
sounds like a metaphor but can you
explain what you meant when you said
actual diet like you're talking number
of calories you're actually talking
about whether kids can have chocolate
Israel has Israeli experts have
calculated in detail exactly how many
calories literally gazans need to
survive and if you look at the sanctions
that they impose their grotesque I'm
even John Kerry can then them bitterly
their sadistic just enough calories to
survive and of course it is partly
metaphoric because it means just enough
material coming in through the tunnels
so that they don't totally die
Israel restricts medicines but you have
to allow a little trickle in when I was
there right before the November's 2012
assault visited the onion is hospital
and the director showed us that there's
they don't even have us they'd only have
simple medicines but there's something
so the died and the same is true with
all aspects of it keep on a diet
literally and the reason is very simple
and it pretty much said it if they die
something look good for Israel the we
may claim that were not the occupying
power but the rest of the world doesn't
agree even the United States doesn't
agree we are the occupying power and if
we kill off the population under
occupation not going to look good it's
not the 19th century when as the u.s.
expanded over its terror to what's its
national territory it pretty much
exterminated the indigenous population
well by nineteen centuries Imperial
standards that was unproblematic this is
a little different today you can't
exterminate the population and the
territories that you occupy that's the
dovish position vice Claus the hawkish
position is island which you quoted
let's just kill them off and who do you
think is going to prevail as I speak to
you in the midst of this ceasefire the
Vice Glaus position will prevail because
Israel just you know it's it's already
becoming an international pariah and
internationally hated if it went on to
pursue Highlands recommendations even
the United States wouldn't be able to
support it you know interestingly while
the Arab countries most of them have not
spoken out strongly against what Israel
has done in Gaza Latin American
countries one after another from Brazil
Venezuela to Bolivia have
a number of them have recalled their
ambassadors to Israel I believe Bolivian
President Evo Morales called Israel a
terrorist state can you talk about Latin
America and its relationship with Israel
just remember the Arab countries means
the Arab dictators are friends it
doesn't mean they are populations our
enemies but what he said about Latin
America's is very significant not long
ago Latin America was what was called
the backyard they did whatever we said
we in strategic planning and very little
was said about Latin America because
they were under Eric domination if we
don't like something that happens we
install a military dictatorship or a
carrier back huge massacres and so on
but basically they do what we say last
10 or 15 years that's changed and it's a
historic change it's for the first time
in 500 years since the conquistadors
Latin America is moving towards degree
of Independence of imperial domination
and also the degree of integration which
is critically important and what you
just described is one striking example
of in the entire world as far as I know
only a few Latin American countries have
taken an honorable position on this
issue Brazil Chile Peru Ecuador El
Salvador have withdrawn ambassadors and
protest they join melilla in Venezuela
which had done it even earlier in
reaction to other atrocities that's
unique and it's not the only example it
was a very striking example like it's
maybe a year or so ago the open society
forum did a study of support for
rendition rendition of course is the
most extreme form of
torture what you do is take people you
assessing people you don't like and you
send them to your favorite dictatorship
so they'll be tortured Cortez that was
the CIA program of extraordinary
rendition of the study was who support
who took part in it well of course the
Middle East dictatorships did you know
Syria Assad the Mubarak and others
because that's where he sent them to be
tortured Qaddafi they took part Europe
almost all of it participated England
Sweden other countries permitted abetted
the transfer of the prisoners to the
torture chambers for to be grotesquely
tortured if actually look over the world
that was only really one exception the
Latin American countries refused to
participate now that is pretty
remarkable for one thing because it
shows their independence but for another
while they were under us control they
were the torture a torture center of the
world not long ago a couple of decades
ago that's a real change and by now if
you look at hemispheric conferences the
United States and Canada are isolated
the last major hemispheric conference
couldn't come to a consensus decision on
the major issues because the US and
canada didn't agree with the rest of the
hemisphere the major issues were
admission of cuba into the hemispheric
system and steps towards
decriminalization of drugs that's a
terrible burden on the Latin Americans
the problem it lies in the United States
and the Latin American countries even
though right wing ones I want to free
themselves of that US and canada
wouldn't go along
these are very significant changes in
world affairs I wanted to turn to
Charlie Rose interviewing the Hamas
leader holla'd Michelle this was in July
Michelle called for an end to Israel's
occupation of Gaza nah at least the shop
owner this is not a prerequisite life is
not a political that life is a right for
our people in palestine since 2006 one
the word they refused the outcomes of
the elections our people actually lived
under the siege of eight years it is
this is a collective punishment we need
to lift the siege we have to have a port
we have to have an airport this is the
first message the second message in
order to stop the bloodletting we need
to look at the underlying causes we need
to look at the occupation we stop the
occupation Netanyahu doesn't take heed
of our rights mr. Kerry months ago tried
to find a window through the
negotiations in order to meet our target
to live without the occupation to reach
our state Netanyahu has killed our hope
our killed our dream and he killed the
American initiative that is the Hamas
leader Halid Michelle and his last few
minutes we have left Noam Chomsky talk
about the demands of Hamas and what
holla me she'll just said well he was
basically reiterating what he and it's
Melanie on other Hamas spokespersons
have been saying for a long time in fact
if you go back to nineteen eighty-eight
that when Hamas was formed even before
their they became a functioning
organization they their leadership chef
s in who was assassinated by Israel
others offered settlement proposals
which were turned down and it remains
pretty much the same by now it's quite a
verte pics effort to fail to see it you
can read it in the Washington Post
they proposed is they accept the
international consensus on a two-state
settlement they say yes let's have a
two-state settlement on the
international border they do not they
say they don't go on to say will
recognize Israel but they say yes let's
have a two-state settlement in a very
long purse maybe 50 years and then we'll
see what happens that's been their
proposal all along that's far more
forthcoming than any proposal in Israel
but that's not the way it's presented
here what you read is all they're
interested in is destruction of Israel
which here is Bob schaeffer's type of
repetition of the most vulgar Israeli
propaganda but that has been their
position it's it's not that they're nice
people like I wouldn't vote for them but
that is their position six billion
dollars of damage and Gaza right now
about 1,900 Palestinians are dead not
clear actually how many as the rubble
hasn't all been dug out at this point
half a million refugees you've got
something like 180,000 in the school's
the shelters and what does that mean for
schools because they're supposed to be
starting in a few weeks when when the
Palestinians are living in these schools
makeshift shelters so what is the
reality on the ground that happens now
is these negotiations take place in
Egypt well there is a kind of a slogan
that's been used for years Israel
destroys Gazans rebuild Europe pays it
will probably be something like that
until the next episode of mowing the
lawn and what will happen unless US
policy changes what very likely to
happen is that Israel will continue with
the policies it has been executing no
reason for them to stop from there
point of view and it's what I said take
what you want in the West Bank
integrated into Israel leave the
Palestinians there in unviable Canton's
separated from Gaza keep guys on that
diet under siege of course control keeps
away Golan Heights and try to develop a
greater Israel this is not for security
reasons incidentally if that's been
understood by the Israeli leadership for
decades background 1970 I suppose azer
vites month later the pregnant air force
general later president pointed out
correctly that taking over the
territories does not improve our
security situation in fact probably
makes it worse but he said it allows
Israel to live at the look at the scale
of at the scale and with the quality
that we now enjoy in other words we can
be a rich powerful but you hear
repeatedly Hamas has in its charter a
call for the destruction of Israel and
how do you guarantee that these
thousands of rockets that threaten the
people of Israel I don't continue very
first of all if you Hamas charter means
practically nothing the only people to
pay attention to it are Israeli
propagandists and love it it was a
charter put together by a small group of
people under siege under attack in 1988
and it's essentially meaningless there
are charters that mean something but
they're not talked about so for example
the electoral program of Israel's
governing party leaked hood states
explicitly that there can never be a
Palestinian state west of the Jordan
River and they not only state it in
their charter that's a call for the
destruction of Palestine explicit call
for it and they don't only have it their
charter you know their electoral program
but they implement it that's quite
different from the Hamas charter MIT
