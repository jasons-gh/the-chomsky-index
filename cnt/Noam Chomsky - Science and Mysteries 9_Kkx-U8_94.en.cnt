so as I understand it you're talking
about lakhs modest modest proposal to as
I understand it answer the house of life
and not necessarily the wise so you know
that's that's kind of a departure from
what a lot of us think of that science
can really do for us you know
tell us everything and I think what we
what you discuss kind of shows us that
we can't know everything from it so I'd
like to you know ask what you personally
take from the study of science what is
it really worth to you why do you do it
well first of all it's you're quite
right it's very commonly believed that
we can in principle understand
everything there's that can give you
references if you like there's a very
standard thesis in the sciences and in
philosophy of science by leading people
that's a very strange thesis because it
was understood centuries ago that it
can't be true Humes
all the people who make these statements
also worship David Hume as one of the
kind of founders of modern thought but
he very clearly pointed out as I quoted
that while Newton did remove some of the
mysteries of nature he left other
mysteries in a state where they will
always remain mysterious to us and he
had reasons for it often it's argued
that on evolutionary grounds we have
simply evolved so that we can answer
every possible question that's part of
you know natural selection selected us
to answer questions I mean that goes
back a long time charles sanders peirce
argued that and all the way to the
present but it's totally crazy
I mean hunter-gatherers did not evolve
to solve problems of mechanics you know
or little in quantum theory
so this is nothing to that and that's
we're stuck with there are things we can
understand there are limits to
understanding and we can we might even
in principle discover what the limits
are it's not contradictory it's hard but
it's not contradictory to think that
inquiry into the nature of human
intelligence might explain why it can it
deal with some things and not deal with
other things like to take a crude and
oversimplified but maybe not false
example we can humans can deal with
determinacy a lot of science deals with
determinacy can deal with randomness a
lot of work on randomness but maybe
there are things that don't fall within
randomness indeterminacy like for
example the creative aspect of language
use which doesn't seem to be determined
by circumstances and obviously isn't
random but is appropriate to
circumstances and is understood to be
and what that gap is is pretty obscure
we recognize it all the time
you know but it doesn't mean we can
understand it maybe it falls beyond the
bounds of human science that's possible
but and incidentally this extends to
choice generally not just to its
dramatic in the case of language that
was Descartes point but so what's the
point of science to understand as much
as you can we want to understand as much
as we can about the nature of things
it seems worthy objective
