in plain terms what that means is that
the public has to be reduced to their
proper state of apathy and obedience and
driven from the public arena if
democracy is to survive and the
appropriate sense with the specialized
class you know the cool observers smart
guys the technocratic and policy or an
intellectuals doing our job in the
interests of the people who have real
power that's the liberal side I won't go
into what the reactionary side says
about the matter well to summarize there
is a standard view of democracy and it's
the view of Justice Powell the public
should assert or the review that he
expressed at least the view that the
public ought to assert meaningful
control over the political process and
there's a contrary view the contrary
view is the public's a dangerous enemy
and it has to be controlled for its own
good of course the way you control
children like you don't let a
three-year-old run across the street the
first view is the rhetorical view the
second view is the view that's actually
held and you can see that it's actually
held when a crisis of democracy erupts
and the unwashed masses begin to try to
enter into the political arena and have
to be somehow repressed either by force
as in the Red Scare or by other means in
order to overcome the crisis of
democracy well with regard to the media
play a big role in this and with regard
to the media to there is a standard view
the standard view for example is
expressed again by Justice Powell and
same discussion when he claims that it's
the crucial role of the media to affect
the societal purpose of the First
Amendment that is to allow the public to
assert control of the political process
standard view was also expressed by
Judge gur fine in an important decision
the Pentagon Papers decision when he
permitted the New York Times to publish
the Pentagon Papers and he said we have
a cantankerous press an obstinate press
a ubiquitous press and it must be
suffered by those in authority
in order to preserve the even greater
values of freedom of expression and the
right of the people to know that's one
view that's the standard view and given
that view we then have a debate the
debate is over whether the over whether
the media have gone too far in their
defiance of authority and their
adversarial stance the right wing claims
they've gone too far they're overcome by
a liberal bias we've got to do something
about it the Liberals as in the
trilateral commission or in fact degree
they in the same study they say that the
media threaten government authority by
their adversarial stance and they've got
to be curved if they can't curb
themselves the government is going to
move in to curb curb them the executive
director of Freedom House Leonard
Sussman asked whether free institutions
must be a must free institutions be
overthrown by the very freedom they
sustain rhetorical question meaning we
got to do something about this excess
freedom that the press is using to
attack the government he was writing
about the Freedom House study of the
coverage of the Tet Offensive which
became a sort of a classic allegedly
showing that the press lost the war in
Vietnam by unfair criticism of the
government during the Tet Offensive it's
an interesting if there's no time to
talk about it I may try to get back to
it if not maybe get through discussion
very interesting study was total fraud
falsified the data you know whole thing
was faked when you actually correct the
errors it turns out that the press that
the real charge of Freedom House was
that the press although completely
supportive of the government policy and
working completely within the framework
of government propaganda nevertheless
was too pessimistic they said they
didn't tell you by what standards it was
too pessimistic the obvious standard is
to compare it with say internal US
intelligence assessments which we have
thanks to the Pentagon Papers and it
turns out the press was more optimistic
than US intelligence because they were
believing the public statement and no
the private statements so freedom
house's complaint reduces to the fact
that the press though those totally
supportive of the propaganda didn't do
it in an upbeat enough fashion I
wouldn't have surprised George Orwell
that that should be the criticism of the
press produced by an organization called
freedom house but that's become the
that's become the standard since
everyone refers to that as the study
that proves that the press was too
adversarial well that's the debate then
then the defenders of the press say no
we're not through adversary we are too
adversarial but you got to tolerate us
even though we're cantankerous and so on
that's essentially the issue well
outside of that debate between those who
say the press is too adversarial and
must be curbed and those who say well
yes the presses can't anchor isn't
impossible but we just have to suffer
that in the interest of freedom outside
the spectrum of that debate which
constitutes virtually the entire
mainstream discussion virtually the
entire discussion but outside the debate
there is another position the other
position challenges the factual
consumption that's taken for granted in
the debate according to this alternative
view the media do indeed fulfill a
societal purpose but a very different
one their societal purpose is to
inculcate and defend the economic and
social and political agenda of the
privileged groups that dominate the
domestic society and they do this in all
sorts of ways they do it by selection of
topics by distribution of concern by the
way they frame issues by filtering of
information by emphasis and tone by
simple fabrication sometimes but
crucially by the bounding of debate to
make sure that it doesn't go outside of
certain limits the bounding both in the
news columns and in the opinion columns
because of course the news columns
themselves embody all sorts of
assumptions and ideological
presuppositions and so on to the
according to this alternative view to
the extent that there is a liberal bias
it serves primarily to bound thinkable
thought
that is to instill the unchallengeable
assumptions which in fact reflect this
rather narrow elite consensus so the
liberal bias performs a real function it
says thus far and no further as far as
you can go and I go as far how far I go
is still accepting the basic
presuppositions as unchallengeable now
within those bounds there's ample
controversy and it reflects the tactical
divisions among elites over how to
achieve generally shared aims but these
limits are very rarely transcendent so
the media thus function in accordance
with what my co-author a determinant I
have called a propaganda model in a
recent book that's another view well the
property propaganda model has a lot of
predictions as a lot of predictions
about how the press is going to behave
but it also has a further prediction the
further prediction is that no matter how
well confirmed the propaganda model is
it cannot be taken seriously and
therefore must be effectively excluded
from mainstream discussion and that
actually follows from the model itself
the reason is that the model if you
think it through the model rejects
certain principles that are serviceable
to power that is it falls outside the
spectrum defined by the presupposition
that the media are adversarial and
cantankerous perhaps excessively so now
that presupposition is a useful one it's
serviceable to the interests of
established institutions to believe that
what you're reading is actually
criticism if it's in fact support that's
a technique it's a sophisticated
technique of indoctrination and of
course it's very serviceable to the
media themselves nice to think that
you're you know pride yourself on being
an independent that courageous adversary
of power and since those assumptions are
serviceable they're going to be upheld
according to the propaganda model and no
serious challenge will be permitted so
that prediction indeed is very readily
confirmed the propaganda model has never
taken seriously it can't be considered
notice that the propaganda model has a
rather disconcerting featured to it
plainly as a matter of logic it's either
valid or invalid if it's invalid you can
dismiss it if it's valid you must
dismiss it because it's saying the wrong
thing so one way or another it's got to
be dismissed by its very nature and
notice that truth is no defense it's
very much like the traditional doctrine
of seditious libel the doctrine that
it's you can't it's libelous it's crime
to criticize state authorities because
that undermines power doctrine runs up
to pretty modern times and truth was
never a defense against the dishes libel
in fact truth simply heightened the
enormous and Norma T of the crime of
calling authority into disrepute and the
same is true here well of course the
basic the basic questions are factual
are the standard assumptions correct
that is is it true that the press is
independent cantankerous adversarial may
be excessively so or are the assumptions
of the propaganda model correct that's
factual question and that's the main
topic but i'm barely going to be able to
get into
