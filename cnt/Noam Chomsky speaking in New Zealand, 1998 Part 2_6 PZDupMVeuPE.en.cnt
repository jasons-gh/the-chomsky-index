so for example at the large part of the
u.s. Pentagon budget is dedicated
keeping the price of oil within a
certain range not too low because the
profits go back to the US energy
companies but not too high because that
might be harmful to the US and other
industrial economies so there are any
moments the major US intervention forces
have always been poised at the Middle
East there's nothing to do with Russians
that's now officially conceded and has
always been obvious that's also true of
the nuclear weapon system and so on all
of that it has to be calculated into the
price of oil in fact it's not the kind
of thing that economists study at least
if they want to get jobs but there is
one technical step count I know only one
technical study carried out by a
department of energy consultant in the
United States his estimate is that
military expenditures alone amount to
about a thirty percent subsidy to the
price of oil which from which he
concludes realistically that that means
that all estimates about the efficiency
of trade anything else are wildly off
base for that reason alone and we can
continue on and on the market ideology
is a simple fraud for enormous for all
sorts of reasons of which these are some
the environmental crisis is very real
the it's tied to the not limited to use
of hydrocarbons that incidentally is in
motor crisis that is coming along at
least if the general consensus of
geologists is anywhere near accurate the
oil is obviously a finite resource it's
been building up for millions of years
it's going to be destroyed in roughly
200 years the there's no alternative
known feasible alternative
available though there might be if
enough effort we put into finding them
probably would be it's not being done
it's an exhaustible resource and
furthermore the exhaustion may not be
very far away there is a misleading oil
blood at the moment but it's expected to
be quite temporary royal usage has about
fifty percent of oil oil usage has been
in the last twenty years since the oil
crisis of the early 70s that led to
acceleration of use of oil as I say
about fifty percent furthermore the rate
of discovery has been going down it went
up from the mid 19th century and
straight up until mid 1960s since then
it's been going straight down the
chances are that what was around is
known and is getting harder and harder
to get and most of it the overwhelming
mass of it is in the Persian Gulf area
Middle East as has always been the case
Caspian Sea is as small as estimated to
be roughly the scale of North Sea small
blip on the oil usage and that means
that the Middle East will play a much
more and more central role in world
affairs efforts to control it by force
by the United States primarily will
continue and in fact escalate it's a
turbulent region I don't have to tell
you there's a lot of conflict so the
conflicts are going to continue and
probably be exacerbated by the growing
share of the Persian Gulf region the
Arabian Peninsula Gulf region in oil
production it's expected that but the
sort of what's always been regarded as
the crucial point is when in a total
known inter explodable energy resources
are fifty percent utilized and that's
expected to common maybe 10 or 20 years
maybe less and after that it's where
down slide that's the very usage of oil
is itself a kind of human disaster
because of the environmental effect the
absence of it will be another kind of
disaster interacting with the presence
of nuclear weapons and obvious ways all
of these things interact so you know
there are many ominous developments
lying head and one of them are
inevitable and you do not laws of nature
these are the results of human decisions
shaped by ideological considerations in
the interests of power sectors and
they're not hard to identify it's
commonly argued that the use of oil is
the result of the basically consumer
choice in a market system so the use of
oil pick say the United States but
generalizes is primarily automobiles and
airplanes and that's no consumer choice
free market etc that's more fraud the
use of automobiles and oils and
airplanes was a political decision
pressed by the major enterprises by
actually it began you know involving an
enormous social engineering government
social engineering projects biggest ones
history I suppose which completely
changed the nature of the United States
and as that patterns proliferated around
the world takes a airplanes there
wouldn't be any airplanes if it wasn't
for massive public funding the aircraft
industry has never been a
self-sustaining it developed in the
1920s in the 1930s through federal
government funding for post office and
that sort of thing in the Second World
War it took off but that was of course
state development growing which now is
one of the two companies in the world
that monopolizes the commercial jet
market the other is Airbus also a
governmental
boeing's a national there's a state
company it's called private its profits
are private but it's it it's it's been
developed through government subsidies
as a kind of an offshoot of the military
system and the door space as taking off
in the Second World War and continuing
that way and furthermore this is well
known so right after the Second World
War the major business press Fortune
magazine the business we pointed out
that the aeronautical industry cannot
survive in a competitive free enterprise
economy and the government must be the
savior they meant they extended that all
of high-tech industry with primarily the
airplane industry which is the biggest
u.s. exporter and a source of enormous
profits through tourism and so on but
it's fundamentally publicly subsidized
and developed a public expense including
the airports and the you know the
aircraft design and the jet motors and
the rest of it that's not a consumer
choice that's private decisions clearly
made because the industry is
non-competitive could not exist in a
free market system and therefore the
government must be the savior which
means the public has to pay for it
leading to a shift to the use of
airplanes and favour of other kinds of
transport which would be much more
energy intensive less use of energy for
the same purpose railroads for example
that's not part of the story the same is
true of automobiles the mistake a city
like Los Angeles wish I missing from
some of you have visited the lesson does
kind of like a maze of freeways big
highways you race around all over the
place no public transportation system
that didn't happen through consumer
choice it happened through a literal
conspiracy I don't use the term loosely
is a conspiracy in the sense that it
went to court been led to fines for
conspiracy three major corporations
General Motors our meals Standard Oil of
California and Firestone rubber biggest
rubber producer got together and
conspired to destroy a very efficient
electric rail system that was working in
Los Angeles so they brought it up and
destroyed because they wanted people to
use automobiles for obvious reasons well
that was a conspiracy they were brought
to court and condemned I think they were
fine something like five thousand
dollars or something on that order bad
enough for the pleasant dinner they
spent celebrating their defeat and that
led to the elimination of the public
transportation system highly efficient
public transportation system in Los
Angeles which is you know the automobile
capital of the world and the same
happened throughout the country so New
England was where I was tied together
through electric railways the early part
of this century all of that's gone you
want to survive you have to course
that's not consumer choice in the early
in the 1950s the government the
Eisenhower administration inaugurated
the what they call the National Defense
highway system if you want to organize a
public subsidy to big industry you
always have to put in the word defense
okay so that's the cover makes people
willing to pay for it
