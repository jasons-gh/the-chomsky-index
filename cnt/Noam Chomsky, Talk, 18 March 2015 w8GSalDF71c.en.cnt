a bit of housekeeping pre-signed books
will be available in the lobby from
garcia street books also for those of
you in the Eldorado hotel which I
understand now is standing room only
please come to the lens ik after the
event to get books well good evening
Santa Fe when a stylist told us to stay
there's bienvenidos I'm David bar Samuel
and welcome to one of the most
anticipated events of this or any other
year noam chomsky
in backstage I was joking with gnome I
held up this flyer it said sold out
which will be I think ammunition for his
enemies but rest assured Noam Chomsky
has never sold out thanks to the Latin
foundations in pursuit of cultural
freedom series which organized this
event thanks also to Lannon for an
abling alternative radio to digitize or
noam chomsky audio archive which now
numbers close to 250 recordings and go
to alternative radio org thanks Lana I
started alternative radio because of
Noam Chomsky I wrote him a letter he
wrote back
we started corresponding then after a
while I suggested we do an interview he
said yes of course that was 31 years ago
it's an honor for me to introduce Noam
Chomsky but how to introduce someone who
as they ritually say needs no
introduction
well do something different I thought
like tell a story there's a parable from
the Sufi tradition called the elephant
in the dark
Sufism for those of you not familiar
with it is the esoteric inner dimension
of Islam Rumi and others have told this
story and I've added a bit to it it's
called the elephant in the dark some men
when women perhaps who've never seen an
elephant are blindfolded and are asked
to touch different parts of the elephant
and identify what they are touching so
one touches an ear and says it's a fan
another touches the tail and says
confidently it's got to be a rope
another touches the tusks and says well
for sure it's a spear another a leg says
with great confidence oh it's a pillar
and on and on and on and they start
bickering among themselves each
adamantly
insisting that he was right their voices
were getting louder and louder and then
along comes a sage who tells them guys
chill out this is not in contempt I can
hardly imagine in the 13th century the
sage would say God is chill out but kind
of modernized a little bit let me remove
your blindfolds see it's an elephant and
they were all flabbergasted for many of
us all over the world and Noam Chomsky
is that sage the Sufi guide Murshid
never showboating or grand standing but
simply laying out what he sees backed up
with a torrent of facts and
documentation he doesn't tell you what
to do but like the Sufis he teaches by
example the next step is up to you you
have to figure out your path of societal
involvement and action for decades he's
been illuminating the dark crevices of a
rapacious economic system and then
imperialist foreign policy and always in
a calm soft voice and listened for the
irony by any measure
he's led a most extraordinary life he's
a pioneer in the field of linguistics to
call his efforts tireless and his
writings prolific are huge
understatements if records are kept for
such categories as giving lectures and
interviews writing books and articles
Chomsky would be world champion at 86
he's still a rebel without a pause and
as they say in Yiddish a mensch and yes
here comes that four-letter word
children cover your ears
love he is deeply loved by many I've
seen it on the faces of people from
Porto Alegre to Denver and it's no
wonder because he's been there for so
many from East Timor to Nicaragua from
Palestine to Colombia and this evening
he's here for us brothers and sisters
please welcome Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
it's now 70 years since the end of the
most horrific war in history it ended
with the use of an ultimate weapon which
can bring human history to an end a day
which I happened to remember very well
we've been living under that shadow ever
since 20 years later two of the leading
figures of 20th century intellectual
life
Bertrand Russell Albert Einstein issued
an appeal to the people of the world
calling on them to face a choice that is
stark and dreadful and inescapable shall
we put an end to the human race or shall
mankind renounce war they recognized of
course that war can very quickly turn
into terminal nuclear war in 1947 The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
established its famous Doomsday Clock
setting at 7 minutes to midnight
midnight is the end last January it was
advanced to 3 minutes before midnight
that's a threat level that had not been
reached for 30 years at a grim moment to
which I'll return the accompanying
explanation invoked the two major
threats to human survival nuclear war
nuclear weapons and unchecked climate
change the call condemned world leaders
who are endangering every person on
earth by failing to perform their most
important duty ensuring and preserving
the health and vitality of human
civilization the Russell Einstein appeal
differs from the current declaration in
two crucial respect
one is that it did not include the
threat of environmental catastrophe
which 50 years ago was not sufficiently
understood and secondly it directly
addresses the people of the world not
the political leadership that this
difference is of some significance
there's substantial evidence that on
climate change nuclear weapons planning
international policies generally the
population seems much more concerned
than the political leadership who do not
regard their most important duty to be
ensuring and preserving the health and
vitality of human civilization as ample
evidence reveals it's hardly a secret
that even in the most free and
democratic societies the governments
respond only in limited ways to popular
will for the United States it's
well-established in academic scholarship
that a considerable majority of the
population at the lower end of the
income wealth scale are effectively
disenfranchised their views are simply
ignored by policymakers influence
increases slowly as one moves up the
scale and at the very top which means a
fraction of 1% the policy is pretty much
determined that being the case the
attitudes at the top of the ladder are
of very great significance
these are revealed dramatically in a
poll of CEOs that was released last
January at the Davos conference in
Switzerland the conference of masters of
the universe as the business press
describes them by rather ominous
coincidence this was just at the moment
when the Doomsday Clock was a
two three minutes to midnight the poll
revealed that climate change did not
merit inclusion among the top 19 risks
that concern CEOs worse still at the top
of their ranking of perceived risks was
regulation that that is the prime method
for addressing environmental catastrophe
their overriding concern was with growth
prospects for their companies that's not
surprising whatever their individual
beliefs in their institutional role the
CEOs are constrained to adopt policies
that are designed to pose extraordinary
and undeniable threats to the continued
existence of humanity in the words of
the Doomsday Clock declaration and given
their enormous role in determining state
policy it's less surprising that policy
lags behind public opinion on the
concerns that move the clock so close to
midnight the effects are before our eyes
every day so take last Sunday's Wall
Street Journal typical example there's a
weakened review section it's it features
an article entitled fossil fuels will
save the world
really the lead story in the news
section is headlined US producers ready
new oil wave the article glory is in the
thought of what they call an ocean of
oil from US shale as American energy
companies are poised to unleash a
further flood and while they lead us
exuberantly
to the precipice scientists are well
aware that most of the oil must be left
in the ground if there's to be some hope
for a decent life for our grandchildren
but who cares as long as there are
spectacular
profits for tomorrow on International
Affairs as well a popular opinion
diverges significantly from that of the
decision making classes among many other
examples a considerable majority in the
United States have held that the United
Nations not the US should take the lead
in international crises such views are
so remote from Aelita opinion that
they're barely even articulated publicly
a good part of the reason is the nature
of a lead opinion and as often is the
case it's the critical end of the
spectrum that's the most informative so
here's an example from a featured
article by the former director of the
Carnegie Endowment for international
peace in the current issue of the New
York Review of Books leading u.s.
intellectual journal rather left-liberal
and orientation here's what she writes
American contributions to international
security global economic growth freedom
and human wellbeing have been so
self-evidently unique and have been so
clearly directed to others benefit that
Americans have long believed that the
u.s. amounts to a different kind of
country where others push their national
interests the US tries to advance
universal principles well comment should
be superfluous but in what's important
is that this is what many in so-called
enlightened circles actually believe
it's quite an astonishing fact in a free
society where information is readily
available and the impact on policy is
not obscure nuclear weapons policy
reveals very dramatically how
governments and also the concentrated
domestic concentration
of power that largely dominate
governments how both regard the
principle that ensuring and preserving
the health and vitality of human
civilization is their most important
duty when we inquire we discover that
regrettably governments have
consistently and not even considered
security of their own populations as a
particularly high priority
it's rather enlightening to review the
record I'll begin with some high points
or maybe low points so let's begin with
the early days of the ultimate weapon at
a time when the United States had
overwhelming wealth and power
the remarkable security there was
however a potential threat International
ICBMs with nuclear warheads there's a
standard scholarly review of nuclear
policies spy McGeorge Bundy he was the
national security adviser for presidents
Kennedy and Johnson he had access to the
highest level documents he dozen quoting
him now he says the timely development
of ballistic missiles during the
Eisenhower administration is one of the
best achievements of those eight years
yet yet it is well to begin with a
recognition that both the United States
and the Soviet Union might be in much
less nuclear danger today if these
missiles had never been developed and he
then adds a remarkable comment he says
I'm aware of no serious contemporary
proposal in or out of either government
that ballistic missiles should somehow
be banned by agreement in short there
was apparently no thought of trying to
prevent the sole serious threat to the
United States the threat of utter
destruction rather the institutional
imperatives of state
power prevailed much as in the case of
the CEOs for whom the fate of the
species is of such little concern that
it does not even enter into the ranking
of risks furthermore these shocking
facts seemed to arouse little interest
or comment in fact I've never seen a
reference to them it could the
development of these missiles have been
prevented there might have been
opportunities one suggestive indication
is a proposal by Stalin in 1952 offering
to allow Germany to be unified with free
elections on condition that it not join
a hostile military alliance which was
hardly an extreme condition in the light
of the history of the preceding half
century Stalin's proposal was taken
seriously by the respected political
commentator James Warburg but apart from
him it was ignored or ridiculed actually
recent scholarship has just begun to
take a different view the bitterly
anti-communist
Soviet scholar autumn olam Harvard takes
the status of Stalin's proposal to be an
unresolved mystery Washington he said
wasted little effort in flatly rejecting
Moscow's initiative on grounds that were
embarrassingly unconvincing leaving open
the basic question was Stalin genuinely
ready to sacrifice the newly created
German Democratic Republic
East Germany on the altar of real
democracy with consequences for world
peace and for American security that
could have been enormous
Melvin Lafleur is one of the most
respected Cold War scholars that
recently published a review of research
and released Soviet archives
he observes that many scholars were
surprised to discover quoting him now
that Lavrentiy Beria the sinister brutal
head of the secret police proposed that
the kremlin offered the west to deal on
the unification and neutralization of
germany agreeing to sacrifice the east
german communist regime to reduce
east-west tensions and improve internal
political and economic conditions in
russia opportunities that were
squandered in favor of securing german
participation in NATO it's actually a
shocking decision that is being relived
right now under the circumstances of the
early 50s it's not impossible that
agreements might have been reached that
would have protected the security of the
US population from the gravest threat on
the horizon but the option apparently
was not even considered and possible
opportunities were dismissed with
ridicule another indication of how
slight a role authentic security plays
in state policy and to heighten the
extraordinary significance of this
failure it was just at that time that
the Doomsday Clock was moved to two
minutes to midnight the closest it has
ever been these events from the early
days of the Cold War have considerable
resonance right now and right at the
borders of Russia in Ukraine for serious
crisis that traces right back to the end
of the Cold War a crucial issue at that
time around 1990 had to do with the fate
of NATO
now that the alleged threat of Russian
invasion had disappeared one might have
believed that NATO would have dissolved
quite the contrary
expanded radically mikhail gorbachev
agreed to allow a unified germany to
join nato rather significant concession
but there was a quid pro quo namely that
NATO would not expand one inch to the
east that was the phrase that was used
in high-level internal discussions
referring to East Germany and NATO at
once expanded to East Germany Gorbachev
naturally objected but he was informed
by Washington that these were only
verbal commitments nothing is writing
the kind of unspoken implication is that
if you're naive enough to accept a
verbal gentlemen's agreement with the
United States it's your problem
clinton came along and expanded NATO to
the borders of Russia and as another
leading international relations scholar
John Mearsheimer recently pointed out in
the major establishment Journal of
Foreign Affairs he pointed out that the
indications that Ukraine might be
assimilated into the Western system
possibly even into NATO could not fail
to be threatening to any Russian leader
we need only imagine how the United
States would have reacted at the height
of Soviet power
if the Warsaw Pact had taken over most
of this hemisphere and now Mexico were
preparing to join the Russian run
military alliance last December the
western-backed Ukrainian Parliament
voted 303 to 8 to rescind the policy of
non-alignment that had been adapted
adopted by the ousted President and they
committed Ukraine in their words to
deepen cooperation with NATO in order to
achieve the criteria required for
membership in this organization the
growing crisis concerning Ukraine is no
slight threat and it is an avoidable one
by diplomatic steps to guarantee
Ukrainian neutrality steps which
regrettably are not being taken
well returning to the 1950s other
developments reveal the low priority
assigned to authentic security when
Nikita Khrushchev took over after
Stalin's death he recognized that Russia
could not compete militarily with the
United States and that if Russia hoped
to escape its economic backwardness and
the devastating effect of the war of the
arms race would have to be reversed
accordingly he proposed sharp mutual
reductions in offensive weapons the
incoming Kennedy administration
considered his offer and rejected it
instead turning to rapid military
expansion the policies are summarized by
distinguished international relations
scholarly Kenneth waltz pointed out that
the Kennedy administration undertook the
largest strategic and conventional
peacetime military buildup the world has
yet seen even as first Jeff was trying
at once to carry through a major
reduction in conventional forces and to
follow a strategy of minimum deterrence
and we did so even though the balance of
strategic weapons greatly favored the
United States well once again the
decision u.s. decision severely harmed
national security while enhancing state
power how severely it harmed national
security was revealed in 1962 when
Khrushchev sent missiles to Cuba
partially that was a foolhardy attempt
to write the balance partially it was
because of the very
clear threat of US invasion in the
course of a major terrorist campaign
that Kennedy was waging against Cuba
kind of erased from our history but very
much alive in real history Hersh Jeff's
effort set off what Arthur Schlesinger
called the most dangerous moment in
history and what happens happened then a
merits clear careful consideration no
time to go through the details but it's
worth remembering that at the peak
moment of the crisis October 26th and
27th of 1962 Kennedy received a letter
from Khrushchev offering to end the
crisis peacefully by simultaneous public
withdrawal of cuban of russian missiles
from Cuba and u.s. missiles from Turkey
these were Jupiter missiles liquid
propelled meaning slow to set in motion
which means that they were first strike
weapons not intended for a deterrent
they were also obsolete weapons the US
had already issued an offer and had a
Tory issued an order to withdraw them
because they were being replaced by even
more lethal weapons invulnerable Polaris
submarines
so that was Kennedy's choice shall we
publicly withdraw obsolete missiles from
first strike missiles from Turkey on the
border of Russia which are being
replaced by even more lethal mass
missiles or shall we free refuse he
refused his own estimates objective
estimate of nuclear war at the time was
between 1/3 and 1/2 that's in my view
one of the most appalling decisions in
history and even more appalling is that
Kennedy is praised for
is cool courage and handling the crisis
well 10 years later Henry Kissinger
called a nuclear alert this was in the
last days of the 1973 Israel Arab war
the purpose of the alert was to warn the
Russians not to interfere with his
delicate diplomatic maneuvers these were
designed to ensure an Israeli victory
but a limited victory so that the US
would still be in control of the region
unilaterally and the maneuvers were
delicate we've learned a lot about them
from recent Declassified sources the
United start out the United States and
Russia had jointly imposed a ceasefire
but Kissinger secretly informed Israel
that they could ignore it hence the need
for a nuclear alert to frighten the
Russians away unfortunately they were
frightened away security of the
population was a matter of little
concern as usual 10 years after that the
Reagan administration launched
operations to probe Russian defenses
that meant simulating air and naval
attacks against Russia that these
actions were undertaken at a very tense
moment right at that time pursing two
missiles were being installed in Western
Europe these at a 5 to 10 minute flight
time to Moscow very destructive missiles
also Reagan had announced his so-called
Star Wars program which was presented
here as if it were defensive but every
strategic analyst on all sides
understands that missile defense is a
first-strike weapon if missile defense
ever worked which it might not it could
not stop a first strike but it
conceivably might stop a retaliatory
strike which means it's a first strike
weapon and that was being installed at
the time
all of this very seriously caused great
alarm in Russia especially with the
simulated attacks that led to a major
war scare in 1983 that was the last time
that the Doomsday Clock reached three
minutes three minutes before midnight
1984 newly released Russian archives
revealed that the danger was even more
severe than historians had previously
assumed there's a recent comprehensive
US intelligence study which runs through
the evidence now available and concludes
in its words the war scare was for real
and they conclude he concludes that US
intelligence underestimated Russian
concerns and underestimated the threat
of a Russian preventive nuclear strike
which would have been the end recently
we've learned that it's was even more
dangerous than that in the midst of
these world threatening developments
Russia's early warning systems detected
an incoming missile strike from the
United States sending the highest level
alert the officer on duty the Russian
officer on duty stanislav petrov decided
that it was a false alarm and he did not
transmit the warnings violating protocol
that was the difference between survival
and extermination Russian air defense
systems are much less sophisticated than
those of the United States they pretty
much rely on radar which means
line-of-sight detection of incoming
missiles u.s. systems rely on satellites
we can detect them at the point of
launch so the Russian systems are on
much more tense alert of great danger to
us of course
well 20 years before that back in the
Cuban Missile Crisis a Russian submarine
commander named Vasili arkhipov blocked
the launching of nuclear tipped
torpedoes which could have set off a
terminal nuclear war - there were three
submarines Russian submarines the two
other commanders had authorized the
launch when the three submarines were
under attack by US destroyers
during the Missile Crisis according to
the protocol the agreement of all three
was required arkhipov refused to agree
yet another sign of how thin is the
thread that we grasped for survival
there are chilling estimates about
failures of us systems which as I
mentioned are surely far more reliable
than the Russian ones there's a recent
review in The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists of several years of data on
us accidental reports of Soviet military
launches by the automated systems
aborted by human intervention the
hundreds of these these were right in
those years of the greatest dangers 1979
to 1983 the author of the review Seth
Baum concludes that nuclear war is the
Black Swan we can never see except in
that brief moment when it's killing us
we delay eliminating the risk at our own
peril now is the time to address the
threat because now we are still alive
the former commander of Stratcom
general lee butler recently reviewed his
long career as a strategic weapons
planner and he wrote that he had been
among the most
of these keepers of the faith in nuclear
weapons but now it is his burden to
declare with all of the conviction I can
muster that in my judgment they served
us extremely ill and he outlines the
reasons like the ones I've mentioned and
he then raises a haunting question by
what authority through succeeding
generations of leaders in the nuclear
weapons States usurp the power to
dictate the odds of continued life on
our planet most urgently why does such
breathtaking audacity persist at a
moment when we should stand trembling in
the face of our folly and united in our
commitment to abolish its most deadly
manifestations
general Butler went on to conclude that
we have so far survived the nuclear rage
by some combination of skill lack luck
and divine intervention and I suspect
the latter in greatest proportion
looking over the record one can
understand his judgment plainly these
are not risks that would be accepted by
any sane decision-maker they are being
accepted by decision makers who are
perfectly sane just as the devastating
risks of environmental catastrophe are
being faced with eyes open and ignored
by the Masters of the Universe
all of them are trapped by an
institutional logic that is deeply
pathological and that must be cured and
quickly if we are not to put an end to
the human race in Russell and Einstein's
words thanks
