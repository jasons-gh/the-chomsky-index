there are basically two facts about
Colombia that I think we should bear in
mind the rest is all footnotes the first
fact is what you've just been hearing it
has a horrendous human rights record
right now at wins first prize in the
hemisphere which is not an easy prize to
win the political killings as you heard
or somewhere variously estimated at five
to ten a day mostly state security
forces the second fact is that colombia
receives more than half of US military
aid for the hemisphere
that when bill clinton came in he was
gonna change that and he did he
increased it by about twelve percent and
when the pentagon budget was not ample
to deal with the increase he turned to
emergency over drawing facilities
available to the president pretty much
as in the case of the recent bailout of
investors in mexico the crimes in
colombia have been pre awful through the
80s they've been increasing they got
worse under the most recent president
says our Gaviria he was a special friend
of the united states in particular bill
clinton who liked him so much that he
rammed them through a Secretary General
of the OAS under a with a power-play
that was pretty much resented in the
hemisphere and the State Department in
affirming their support for president
Gaviria said praised him particularly
for his steps towards extending
democracy in Colombia under very
difficult conditions that the conditions
are difficult is not in doubt
thank you can ask the several thousand
murdered people of the one opposition
party though were they around would be
glad to tell you about it and president
Gaviria helped substantially in creating
and expanding these conditions so the
support for him made a lot of sense now
there's actually nothing new or or out
of the general pattern in this
correlation between the most horrendous
human rights record and the mat on the
largest US contribution in this case
literally more than half the military
aid for the hemisphere in fact that's a
standard correlation it's been shown
over and over there was an important
study of it by the leading academic
specialists on human rights in Latin
America very mainstream scholars Lars
Schultz University of North Carolina did
a study in an academic journal was
published in nineteen eighty in which he
simply compared US foreign aid in Latin
America with torture in Latin America
and found that they were remarkably well
correlated as he put it
US aid flows primarily to the most to
the worst human right to countries that
torture their citizens to the most
egregious violators of human rights in
the hemisphere this continued right
through the Carter years no change it
included military aid and as he was
careful to point out it was on
related with need it was not that the
countries that torture happened to be
the most meat needy in fact there was no
correlation at all
well that might lead a superficial
observer to conclude that the United
States just likes torture but you're all
scientists and you know that you can
deduce causality from a correlation and
in fact another study was done at the
same time that sheds further light on it
this was done by a economist at the
Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania a longtime colleague and
co-author and friend of mine Edward
Herman and we published it in a joint
book about the same time Hermann did a
broader global study of the correlation
between human rights and between torture
and foreign aid and certainly the reason
why torture is picked is because Amnesty
International does an extensive survey
of torture they are an important
organization but they have a very
specific mandate that they keep - and
one of the things it's torture says
pretty good record of torture and he
found that across the world the same
correlation held there's a very close
correlation between torture and US aid
in fact he concluded quite realistically
that Washington is the torture capital
of the world if you trace back torture
to its source I don't think any
statement we published in that book has
aroused so much fury but I'm afraid it's
true the correlation was global but
Herman also did a second study which
shed some light on it
he compared US aid with the climate for
business operations in a country as
measured by ability to repatriate
profits and so on and he found that
foreign aid was very closely correlated
to the climate for business operations
the investment climate
now that correlation makes sense the
purpose of foreign aid after all is for
the US taxpayer to pay off US
corporations via some other
tree and therefore the which is what
foreign aid in fact amounts to
overwhelmingly and like most social
policy and in and the fact that foreign
aid increases as the climate for
business operations include increases of
course is completely natural fact almost
automatic as people would know if there
was such a subject as international
relations or political science or
government where you study the things
that go on in the world in fact it's
almost a truism now why should there be
a correlation between US aid and torture
well that's a secondary correlation
there happens to be a very good reason
why improving the climate for business
operations is associated with torture
one of the best ways of improving the
climate for business operations is to
murder union leaders torture priests and
nuns who are trying to organize peasants
that kill human rights activists and so
on that has a marvelous way of improving
the climate for business operations it's
one of the main things that contributes
to were called economic miracles and
another department down the street and
so naturally you have a Carlat so that's
a reasonable correlation to and if you
put those two reasonable correlations
together you just happen to find by
accident a secondary correlation between
US aid and torture so the proper
conclusion is not that US leaders kind
of enjoy torture it's that it's a matter
of total indifference what they care
about is profits for US investors and it
just happens that that's correlated with
torture a global phenomenon a perfectly
understandable one actually it's broader
than that in the case of Colombia
illustrates it it's an important feature
of maintaining a favorable climate for
business operations an important feature
of it is creating a society that has
formal democracy with ample oppression
and to maintain formal democracy with
oppression
does require plenty of torture and
killing and social cleansing and other
things and to maintain a an economic
system of extraordinary injustice of the
kind you just are described where that's
where half the children are hungry for
example and so on that that requires
harsh measures and that's what security
forces are for well all of this is
completely familiar to anybody who looks
around the world in the case of Colombia
it was explained quite clearly some time
ago by the president of the Colombian
permanent Committee on Human Rights
afraid of Vasquez de Sousa he pointed
out I'll just quote this description he
said that Colombia has a wonderful is a
wonderful democracy you know since 1991
but you know I think 1886 or something
like that whenever the first
constitution was really nice almost as
nice a democracy as the Soviet Union
under Stalin which also had quite a
beautiful Constitution the he says that
the behind the facade of a
constitutional regime we have a military
militarized society which has been under
a state of siege virtually constantly
there is for example land reform
legislation big plenty of land and it's
only I should say Colombia is quite a
rich society it's not that it's a poor
impoverished Society as an enormous
wealth mineral wealth oil resources
agricultural resources even had the
beginnings of Industrial Development and
in fact it's not impossible that it
might have had an industrial revolution
if it hadn't been under the leadership
of business classes who are more or less
committed to free-market policies and
one of the sort of small secrets about
economic development
very well established over several
centuries is that free market Papa Papa
policies are a recipe for total disaster
part of the reason why the first world
is first world and the third world is
third world although they were more or
less alike back in the 18th century is
that the first world without exception
the United States this most extreme
example but it's true of everyone else
followed extreme protectionist policies
and still does whereas what we call the
third world pretty much followed in
free-market policies but it was rammed
down the throat and the difference is
notable and whatever possibilities there
were for an industrial revolution in
Colombia which were not slight given its
resources and its population and
everything else they were essentially
aborted by the fact that they followed
the rules the rules that they teach you
about in the IMF in the World Bank and
so on the and it's not the only case in
fact it's remarkably uniform also well
known to economic historians ition see
the so Colombia is a rich country but a
very poor one for most of the population
it had a land is a big problem not that
there's a shortage of it but it's owned
by you know very tiny number of people
and there is land reform legislation
it's been on the books since 1961 but it
simply isn't implemented the reason it
isn't implemented is the country is run
by the landowners and the army who
worked for them Hana were paid by you
and me we were taxpayer money you as to
that is well-known as well in fact it
this present system was pretty well
established by the kennedy
administration which among its
innumerable crimes which were quite
remarkable and that's something that
might interest us around here since it
was a cambridge-based administration
right from the elite universities
Harvard and MIT and following all the
right rules the people design
invent and teach here the Kennedy
administration in 1962 Kara instituted a
change in hemispheric policy which is
one of the most important things that
ever happened in the entire history the
Hemisphere and would be well known if we
were to study things like history and so
on
in 1962 the Kennedy administration
shifted the policy of the Latin American
military and of course we're in a
position to do that the they changed the
mission of the Latin American military
from hemispheric defense as it was
called to internal security well a
hemispheric defense was kind of a
holdover from the Second World War when
you know he had to worry about the
Germans and stuff but in turn that
didn't mean anything
the only threat to anyone in the
hemisphere was in Washington and that's
not what they were being paid to defend
themselves from the but internal
security isn't a joke internal security
is just a code word that means war
against the population and that shift
from hemispheric defense to internal
security which was implemented in
planning in training officers in
equipment and so on
that led to a very substantial change in
fact it set off a horrifying plague of
repression throughout the hemisphere
worse than anything in its quite bloody
history and that's well known too so for
example some years later the men who was
in charge of the counterinsurgency for
the Kennedy and the early Johnson
administration's Charles mate sling he
described what happened pretty clearly
and accurately
he said the this change in 1962 this
change in the Latin American military
what made a change from u.s. toleration
of the rapacity and cruelty of the Latin
American military to direct US
government complicity in the methods of
Himmler's extermination squads that's
pre accurate and in fact the reference
to Himmler's extermination squads is
also accurate there's quite a good study
done by one of the recent main
researchers of MST international Michael
McClintock two-volume study and who
actually did a study called instruments
of statecraft it's the third of a three
volume study in which he simply looked
into the background of US
counterinsurgency doctrine the kind that
was taught to the Colombian military and
indeed it goes straight back to the
Nazis after the Second World War Varma
generals and specialists were brought to
the United States and they taught showed
how it was done in the early army
training manuals in fact our motto nee
modeled on the minute Nazi manuals
during the Second World War in which
they study hey control the enemy the
enemy being the partisans and the good
guys being the Nazis and so on it's
quite literally true and it comes right
on into the neo-nazi states that were
established throughout the hemisphere
primarily by the Kennedy administration
and its followers so may slings
reference to the methods of Heinrich
Himmler's extermination squads is not
simply a metaphor well that was also
understood well by the Kennedy
intellectuals for example in internal
communications now be classified between
Robert McNamara Kennedy's main Vietnam
War advisor and McGeorge Bundy the
National Security
advisor whose former Harvard Dean Micmac
Merrick wanted out to Bundy that the
military training that had been provided
to Latin American officers this was in
1965 so after a couple of years the US
military training provided the Latin
American officers with the understanding
of an orientation toward US objectives
and he says that was quite important
because in the Latin American political
culture the Latin American military must
be prepared to remove government leaders
from office whenever in the judgement of
the military the conduct of these
leaders is injurious to the welfare of
the nation he didn't bother saying which
nation but since they had been trained
in the understanding of an orientation
towards us objectives I guess it really
didn't matter which nation he had in
mind
he was doubtless thinking specifically
of the greatest achievement of the
Kennedy administration and foreign
policy namely the military coup in
Brazil which had just taken place called
the greatest victory for freedom in the
mid 20th century by Kennedy's ambassador
Lincoln Gordon who then went on to
become president of Johns Hopkins
University it's all in the family you
know this this greatest victory for
freedom in the mid twentieth century was
a military coup which overthrew the
parliamentary regime which was getting
out of line and instituted the first of
the neo Nazi national security states of
Latin America and Brazil is a big place
so it had a domino effect and pretty
soon it was spreading all over the place
well the generals there had an
understanding of an orientation toward
u.s. objectives so pretty soon we had a
wave of torture and
in massacre in an economic miracle
investors were doing very nicely foreign
investors about maybe five percent of
Brazilians were doing very very nicely
in fact living beyond anything that we
can dream about and most of the rest
were kind of sinking into the state of
Central Africa but that's the definition
of an economic miracle if you look
around the world that's what it is
including Mexico we've just seen the
most recent one the also called an
economic miracle until December 19th
1994 the in Colombia this had its
effects as well continuing with Vasquez
de Sousa's remarks in the 1960s he
points out the violence in Colombia was
exacerbated by external factors the
Kennedy administration turned the army
into counterinsurgency brigades
accepting the new strategy of the death
squads assuring in what is known in
Latin America as the national security
doctrine the right to combat the
internal enemy as set forth in the
Brazilian doctrine the Argentine
doctrine the Uruguayan doctrine and the
Colombian doctrine it is the right to
exterminate social workers trade
unionists men and women who are not
supportive of the establishment human
rights activists and so on by torture
assassination mass murder and
disappearance which the military learn
once they are given the understanding of
an orientation towards US objectives and
follow the and follow the training that
they pick up in the school of the
Americas and use the arms that you and I
pay for well the official doctrine I
might as well read you the way the
Colombian military sees it the Colombian
Minister of Defense in 1989 described
the official apparatus of terror he says
it's an apparatus designed for total war
by state power
in the political economic and social
arenas I'm quoting now officially of
course the targets with the guerrilla
organizations but a high military
official explained in 1987 that the
guerrilla organizations were of minor
importance as you just heard but this is
now a military officer not a human
rights lawyer speaking he said the real
danger is what the insurgents have
called the political and psychological
war the war to control the popular
elements and to manipulate the masses
the subversives hope to influence unions
universities media and so on every
individual who were in one in one or
another manner supports the goals of the
enemy must be considered a traitor and
treated in that manner
Antti those are quotes from a 1963
military manual provided under the
guidance of the Kennedy instructors in
the manner of the Nazis
so anyone in the economic political and
arena anyone among the popular elements
anyone in the unions universities media
and so on who in any manner supports
what the military decides to be the
goals of the guerrilla guerillas they
can be handled by the Argentine doctrine
or the Uruguayan doctrine and so on in
this morning's New York Times there's a
story 20 years too late but it's nice to
have it about the Argentine doctrine a
military officer a naval officer who was
involved in implementing the Argentine
doctrine describes how his remorse over
his participation in torture drugging
throwing thousands of people he didn't
do all thousands of them but he and his
colleagues throwing thousands of people
out of airplanes and so on that was the
Argentine doctrine all with us support
and enthusiastic support
I can look at some of the comments by
Jean Patrick and others at the time
which weren't quoted at the Times was
rather polite about that maybe in 20
years we'll learn something about the
Colombian doctrine that's going on today
there was indeed a rare official window
into that namely the official report
that when Pablo mentioned of the
Trujillo massacre and that's kind of
worth quoting I think it gives you a
graphic account of what the Colombian
doctrine is that's our doctrine remember
that's what we teach people and we are
trained to understand and support and
pay and this was a hundred and eighty
six report that was 186 page report that
documented one atrocity which by some
miraculous accident got investigated
this is the massacre and Trujillo back
in 1990 under President Gaviria the
report was written by a commission which
was consisted of members of the
government Colombian government the army
the police and a number of human rights
groups the reason it happened was under
foreign pressure mainly OAS pressure
Organization of American States and
other pressure which led the Colombian
government finally to agree to an
official investigation of they and they
concluded was everybody knew and what
you can read about at great length in
human rights reports and international
Americas watch that constantly coming
out that never reported if you're
interested I have a pretty detailed
survey of them in a recent book but they
were quite easily available and the
official report simply reiterates what
has long been known and long suppressed
they point out that the Colombian Armed
Forces and national police entered the
region the region where brought where to
the village
broaden their scope of action stepped up
their intelligence activities they
managed to get somebody under torture to
concede that he'd been associated with
the guerillas or to say it you never
know what anybody means when they say
something under torture for obvious
reasons gave other names for whatever
reason then the report says the horror
began people were picked up around the
village detained then just after 7:00
a.m. I'm now quoting the report major
ruin yeah he was the one in charge or
the army and associate arrived first
they had breakfast then the major and
several members of the armed group went
into the shed where the people were kept
and demanded identification cards a list
was drawn up then they were taken
blindfolded one by one the first a 59
year old woman to another part of the
Hacienda a coffee sack was tied over the
head of each victim and he was thrown
onto the ground then major Moragne took
a water hose turned at full force on the
face of each victim the mouth and nose
and began to interrogate them when he
finished the victims were piled one on
top of the other and someone called for
the blowtorch and the chainsaw each
victim was decapitated cut into pieces
with the chainsaw and left to bleed the
heads and torsos were put into different
sacks and later that night loaded into a
blue 1956 Ford truck you know the detail
straight
drove driven down to the river and
dumped into the water that's the quote
from the official government report as
to what actually happened you can add
your own imagination and this was the
one of the participants it was too much
for him after a while and he reported it
to the Colombians Colombian judicial
authorities and auxiliary to the major
this continued for weeks afterwards
right
for the time when the headless body of
the parish priest was found he was the
27th victim and it went on and on the
testimony was given to a special the
Office of Special Investigations of the
Prosecutor General's Office it was then
reported in detail by a study of the
peace and justice group that's a church
based I think Jesuit Jesuit based I
think group in Colombia which does most
of the human a lot of human rights
publication of course nobody paid
attention to that the person who
released the information then went back
to visit Trujillo the town he was
disappeared by a group of armed men in
the central square he hasn't been heard
from since the since there had been
publicity there was a trial and the army
officers in charge everyone in charge
was acquitted of all charges that was
1992 but there was continuing
international pressure leading to this
meeting of the inter-american Commission
of the Organization of American States
which led to the report that you have
just heard which concludes that the
Colombian Army and police officers were
directly responsible for the massacre
and that members of the Colombian
government and justice system were to
blame for covering it up that's the
conclusion they recommended that
criminal investigations be initiated
against the major in charge but the
Commission expressed its pessimism as it
put it that national channels will ever
be able to overcome the impunity and it
also records the strong opposition
voiced by the Commission's government
members to the exploration of any kind
of international legal mechanisms
nevertheless they did recommend that a
special prosecutor reform the church
speech some justice group which repeats
the report can prevents the report
points out that there had been 350 other
massacres since the Trujillo massacre
none of them
stated but they point out that this one
is important for one reason because it
challenges insight into the more moral
fiber of former Colombian President
Cesar Gaviria and now the head of the
Organization of American States thanks
to Liberal Democrats here and it also
gives insight into the values and
principles of the army but more
interesting to us I think the values and
principles of those who train and arm
and instruct the army and construct the
doctrines in which not only the
Colombian army but all the others under
their influence operate as for Colonel
the president is credit president
stomper and January 31st did concede
that the Colombian government was
responsible for this I think that's a
historic first I don't think anything
was ever conceded colonel Aranea was
removed from active service that's his
punishment the army rallied around him
and dismissed the Commission's findings
and said that nothing further would
happen the Commission was presented but
to the Organization of American States
on February the 7th the report was with
a an agreement that in six months the
government must respond and this peace
and justice reports ends by saying the
country is waiting how long it waits
depends on whether anybody does anything
about it here if nobody does anything
about it here they'll wait forever
because nothing will happen
there's nothing has happened in any
other case well that's the one case
where the government itself described
what had happened and the and years
later the governments in Brazil and
Argentina and not Chile because the army
is still on top there
other places are conceding some of the
things that happened under the doctrines
that were instituted after this historic
1962 change so it's good to know that
our taxes are being well spent and
recalled that's more than half of US
military aid joining up under Clinton
we're the under the Latin American
cultural environment the military are
forced to act in this fashion possibly
someday there'll be questions raised
here about the North American cultural
environment but we'll probably wait a
long time for that and if we don't do
anything about it and we'll wait forever
and plenty of people will suffer well
u.s. advisers were involved in counter
insurgency in Colombia since the early
1960s since the Kennedy period
incidentally Kennedy period was bad
enough but it all reached its peak under
in the Reagan years raked the Reaganites
were virtually just regarded Kennedy as
their symbol they virtually duplicated
Kennedy's policies internationally and
even domestically to a large extent and
the whole thing just shot out of sight
and that's what that's the reason why
the studies that I mentioned about
torture and aid were done in 1980 in the
years that follows nobody bothers and
it's like proving that two and two is
four there's no point undertaking and
study the and as I said it's still going
on the worst human rights violators also
the greatest recipient of us a well us
advisers were involved in
counterinsurgency Colombia had the
biggest training program for officers in
the 1980s when the situation was really
getting horrendous they had three times
as many officers trained in the school
of the Americas and so on as El Salvador
which wasn't very pretty as you remember
the they also have Israeli instructors
German instructors and British
instructors not only the army but also
the narco traffickers where they
are involved in the training of
assassins and paramilitary forces
according to the Columbian intelligence
that bas and the cording to Columbia
intelligence reports which have been
released the narco-traffickers also have
North American instructors American that
means US instructors training assassins
and paramilitary forces that Colombian
report has yet to be published here as
far as I know and if it's been followed
off I haven't heard about it I mean
published in the mainstream you know
sort of out in the fringes it's being
reported
well the without going into this any
further the pretext for all of it as you
know is drug work the drug war was
launched or more accurately relaunched
by George Bush in September 1989 with a
lot of hoopla in August 1989 a month
before the largest shipment of arms ever
was ever authorized under the foreign
assistance act foreign assistance act as
emergency provisions and the largest
shipment of arms ever authorized was
sent to the Colombian Army in August
1989 that's right before the drug war in
fact that was more arms than all the
arms sent through 1980 which was plenty
the arms were sent to the army they were
helicopters planes you know so on and as
was pointed out at the time and
completely obvious at the time those
arms were totally useless for the drug
war about 90 to 95 percent of whatever
was being done about the drug war was
being done by the National Police
not with bombers and helicopters but the
Bombers and the helicopters and so on
were useful for something else and you
could see the effects right away in the
reports bombing of villages massacres
and so on things of the kind that
the one kind that was reported they
increased rapidly the and in fact their
major effect probably was to strengthen
the already existing strong links
between the security forces and the
narco traffickers security forces the
narco traffickers and the landowners are
about the same thing
I mean it's hard to distinguish them and
that's well known the the Columbia gets
arms from other countries to or at least
theoretically it does the major source
of infantry weapons machine guns and
rocket launchers is Israel but that's a
fraud that's just us arms israel's one
of the funnels by which the United
States sends arms to its various
murderous clients and Columbia's AKC
point also clear aircraft and so on
those are all US taxpayer funded
armaments going to our clients remember
United States alone provides more than
half volts all its military aid in Latin
America to Colombia when we add the
indirect aid that the United States
provides through its clients and the
other members of the the the enormous US
international terror network including
written in Germany Taiwan Israel and so
on the aid to Colombia is quite
substantial there's a lot of talk right
now about the Omnibus anti-terrorism
bill but you'll notice that there's a
kind of an auto mission namely the
center of Internet
terrorism where the bill happens to be
passed and that one isn't mentioned for
some curious reason again
well the apart from the role in
maintaining the system of oppression
under democracy and a good climate for
US investment the arms going to Colombia
have other needs the person of the main
act academic monitor of the rqs of arms
sales overseas William Hart Cohn just
published a recent book in which he
pointed out that the u.s. arm sales to
the third world including Colombia
satisfy an addiction which is
considerably greater than the addiction
for drugs namely the addiction for arms
the United States now has about
three-quarters of the market close to
three-quarters of the market for arms
sales to the third world and that's a
very important fact because if you look
at pentagon documents or even White
House documents you'll see that there's
a reason why we have to maintain the
Pentagon at approximately cold-war
levels in fact it's higher in real terms
than under Nixon the reason is that
although superficially it seems that the
threat disappeared namely the Soviet
Union that's not really true the threat
is really the same as always except now
the threat is what is called I'm quoting
the technological sophistication of
third world powers and to make sure that
that threat is real enough so that we
have to maintain a big Pentagon budget
we have to make sure that there's plenty
of technological sophistication there so
we have to send them advanced armaments
otherwise where they're going to get the
technological sophistication that we'll
have to protect ourselves from
furthermore this is all completely
explicit and Frank if you read say
lockheed propaganda they say it Jane's
Defence weekly you know the main
international
military journal says it's straight out
and so does the Pentagon so for example
right now if you want to know what your
tax dollars are going for one of the
things they're going for is paying the
Lockheed corporation which happens to be
headquartered in Cobb County Georgia
it's paying the Lockheed corporation to
upgrade f-16 so they become more lethal
so then we can sell them the third world
dictatorships that's another gift from
you because they're sold on loans from
the export-import bank which is another
loan gift from US taxpayers to the
Lockean corporation and then that makes
it necessary for the Lockheed
corporation to get more money to produce
f-22 advanced fighters which will defend
us from the threat of the upgraded f-16s
that we're sending them Cobb County
incidentally happens to be the district
represented by a gentleman named Newt
Gingrich which happens to get more
federal subsidies than any suburban
county in the country outside of
Arlington Virginia which is quite a
Washington that's where the Pentagon is
in the Kennedy home of the the Florida
home of the Kennedy Space Center another
component of the state sector designed
by the Kennedy people to supplement the
Pentagon ripoff of the taxpayer for the
benefit of advanced industry this all
came to a head very neatly and
symbolically a couple of days ago I
don't know if you noticed it but buried
in the discussions of the house this
debate over school lunches was a
harassing amendment that the Democrats
put in sort of half seriously only half
seriously because they support this
whole system as much as the Republicans
but in the debate over school lunches
the question you know they're cutting
six billion dollars roughly from food
for poor children we still don't have
half the children in the country
starving like in Colombia but they're
trying
really hard to get there the take some
time through the much richer country
we'll make it the so of six billion
dollars cutting off school lunches and
the Democrats put in a half-hearted
harassing amendment suggesting that that
money be kept and be paid for by d'Alene
not stopping but delaying the deployment
of F twenty-twos well that one was shot
down very unceremoniously because
welfare to Newt Gingrich's wealthy
constituents has very high priority and
others like them we all know about that
at MIT since we live off that same goal
pretty much but the main purpose of the
Pentagon very self-conscious since the
late 40s has been to maintain the system
of high technology industry V through
these methods and therefore we got to
keep selling arms and Sun fortunately
doesn t mean any other thing we can do
with them at the moment nobody much to
drop them on right now so now 75% of the
arms market that's an addiction and a
real one the economy very heavily
depends on it and the selling arms to
Columbia helps that too that's another
factor that we can add to the Herman
insights about the correlation between
military aid and torture well I'm not
going to review the human rights record
you heard something about it but just
let me end with a couple of comments on
the drug war the completely fraudulent
pretext for all of this it's worth
thinking through as interesting aspects
Columbia became a big player in the drug
war in the late nineteen seventies
that's when it started producing
becoming the main producer of cocaine
and why does all this happen in fact why
do peasants in Latin America even bother
producing coca apart from their own use
which they've done forever well there
are reasons for that they have to do
what's up on that blackboard there are
policies social and economic policies
imposed on the third world one of them
is that they have to stop producing for
their own needs they have to start
producing crops for agro-export and they
have to open their markets which is
which the Western countries have never
done of course but never in their
history certainly not us
wheat but they have to open their
markets to subsidize us agricultural
exports we don't believe in the free
market remember so areas are subsidized
subsidized u.s. agricultural exports all
easily undermine domestic production and
since the local farmers are being
explained in the proper lessons of
economics they have to become rational
producers which means produce crops for
agro-export and being rational as indeed
they are they go for the crops that make
the most money and guess what that is
so in fact coca production has just shot
out of sight and it's part of the basis
for the economic miracles so Jeffrey
Sachs from Harvard who has recently been
plying his trade with great success in
Poland and Russia won his fame by
setting things in order in Bolivia in
1985 Bolivia was in real trouble but he
moved in with proper free-market theory
and pretty soon it was all fine the
macroeconomic statistics really nice and
so on very side effects one of them was
that most of the exports maybe 2/3
there's nothing where cocoa which
happened to improve the economy and of
course cause some other side effects
well that's one reason and there are
other things so for example in 1988 the
United States compelled the coffee
producers to break the two
break up the coffee agreement which had
kept prices at some reasonable level and
in coffee prices fell 40 percent that's
Colombia's main export crop but also way
down the region and when coffee prices
dropped 40 percent then you know you got
half the children starving already
people are likely to turn to something
that will make some money and there
happens to be one thing around so one
major source for the huge increase in
the group and the export of Coca is lies
right in the free market policies that
are imposed on the third world but of
course never accepted in the rich
countries not in their history and not
today a second reason which is somewhat
narrower has to do with us drug policies
u.s. drug policies have been designed to
try to compel people to drop using soft
drugs like marijuana and to turn to hard
drugs like coke that's actually the case
I don't say they thought of this and
decided to do it but that's what the
policies are in fact so almost a
concomitant of the fact that marijuana
is big and bulky and easy to detect and
highly industrialized drugs are harder
to detect furthermore there's another if
some of you want to do a research
project somebody around here wants to
make sure they never get a job but once
we study something interesting you might
look into the history of white abaq oh
is legal but marijuana is illegal
I mean tobacco is vastly more lethal and
destructive than marijuana they're not
even in the same domain
you know most police whole substance
around actually the second most legal
lethal substance known the most lethal
sugar I guess but tobacco is close
second and the so why is tobacco elite
illegal but marijuana illegal well I
think there's a speculation that comes
to mind the speculation is that
marijuana it's kind of like solar energy
marijuana and growing
anywhere you can grow it in your
backyard you know and I you know it's a
weed grows everywhere on the other hand
tobacco's an industrial crop he can make
money on it
a lot of inputs you know it takes a lot
of capital and so on now you know if you
have something legal that everybody can
do you're not gonna make any profit on
it so you better make it illegal on the
other hand if there's something that
people can make a lot of profit on
especially you know agribusiness and
pesticide and some fertilizer companies
and so on it better be legal so you can
get away with it
that's just a speculation I've never
seen a study on the topic but you might
want to look into it in any event the
again if you don't if you don't want a
job that's a qualification but fact is
that marijuana was made illegal though
and it's probably not good for you but
as far as anybody there hasn't been one
recorded overdose I think in about 60
million users as far as I'm aware but
marijuana was essentially made illegal
and a very high percentage of the people
now in jail are there because somebody
found a marijuana joint in their pocket
quite literally the but and so Columbia
in fact shifted from producing marijuana
which is now mostly produced here to
producing cocaine and industrial drug
and that led the whole network you know
peasants and bolivia and sending things
up to marijuana and processed and coming
through Mexico where one of the thugs
who was the brother of the president
just got picked up president fled to
Harvard he's going to be teaching in the
Harvard Business School I think
the the not that any of this is any
surprise everybody knew it who was
looking at Mexico
it wasn't the least did a secret except
in respectable circles the so that's a
second second fact or a third question
that arises about the drug traffic has
to do with its scale well there was a
study by the OECD you know the
organization of the rich countries just
a couple of months ago and it estimated
the profits from the international drug
traffic get roughly a trillion dollars a
year of which they say more than half is
received by the United States and
circulated through its financial system
well that suggests a way to deal with
the drug problem you have a look at the
place where more than half the profits
are being circulated you know like your
friendly banker down the street
what about Colombia well according to
the OECD report Colombia gets about six
billion dollars which is two to three
percent of what remains in the United
States I'm quoting now the big business
is therefore in this country the United
States I'm quoting from a report on this
by the Andean Commission of Jurists and
Latin American Association of human
rights which was given considerable
publicity in in the leading newspaper in
the country accepting that to be this
country it was Mexico the major
newspaper in Mexico Excelsior government
newspaper basically but freer than the
New York Times evidently published the
report of the OECD report which
describes where the drug business is
really going on I haven't yet seen it
around here
but you know maybe in 20 years the what
about the bankers the people who are
handling over half of this half trillion
dollars well there actually is a program
in the United States which makes that
illegal and indeed it's occasionally
even been implemented there was
something called Operation green bag
that was functioning ground early the
early 80s to try to catch people who
were bankers who were handling drug
money is a pretty easy way to do it a
law was passed requiring that every bank
informed the Federal Reserve if it gets
deposits of more than ten thousand
dollars and you know with modern
computers and stuff's pretty easy to
monitor the flow of money well it was
discovered that a huge sum of money was
suddenly coming into Miami banks right
after the cocaine racket was beginning
to pick up so the Justice Department
went into operation but the operation
was terminated in 1982 by the man who
was drug czar under the Reagan
administration a gentleman named George
Bush who decided this didn't look like a
good thing to do and therefore that
operation was ended so the we don't know
any more about this half trillion
dollars the throws through the finance
system however there were other places
which are were more easily investigated
like Panama in Panama and the u.s. right
after the drug war was announced with
again with huge fan for fair by George
Bush the u.s. invaded Panama because of
those Hispanic narco traffickers coming
down here to shoot up our kids and stuff
led by the archfiend Noriega and what
they did was Institute in power the
narco traffickers the bankers were
reinstituted the Attorney General and
the Treasury the Treasury Minister had
been directors of the first inter
America's bank which had been closed
by Noriega incidentally with applause
here he was in our friend because it was
implicated in drug trafficking so they
came back in after the invasion as
Attorney General and Treasury Minister
president and dar himself within his law
firm to their necks in it panama is now
a major player in drugs may be twice as
much flowing through as before but again
that's not one of the things you're
supposed to be paying attention to well
that's part of the drug racket banking
there's another big part of it drugs
high-tech drugs not marijuana require
chemicals and in 1989 and the six months
preceding the announcement of the drug
war preceding it the colombian police
found 1.5 million gallons of chemicals
with used for cocaine production many of
them with us corporate logos on them
well that's interesting particularly
interesting because the CIA reported
that US exports of such chemicals in
there were far exceed any legal
commercial uses and the Congressional
Research Service its drug unit concluded
that more than 90 percent of the
chemicals used to make these things come
from the United States so that's just
another way to deal with the narco
trafficking problem where anybody
serious and fighting a drug war
well what about substance abuse more
generally as I mentioned there's a much
more lethal drug than marijuana in fact
much more lethal than cocaine that's
about 100 times as many recorded deaths
here the former head of the office of
drug abuse policy Peter dr. Peter Bourne
pointed out not long ago that the number
of Colombians who die every year from
substances produced in the United States
with a subsidy incidentally and
realized far exceeds the number of North
Americans who died from cocaine in fact
the same is true here and cocaine isn't
subsidized by the government although
the military that we support is involved
in producing and distributing it right
and it isn't openly advertised like they
don't have big ads all over the place
with a whatever the equivalent of a
Marlboro Man is or something like that
this is a big story in itself there's no
time to go into it but it makes the
whole narco-trafficking matter look
pretty minor in comparison
well what about President Gaviria our
friend as I say the human rights record
got worse but he did do one thing he
destroyed the one of the big cartels and
that a eaton cartel and handed its
business over to the other cartel the
Cali cartel now there was an interesting
report on this by the same peace and
justice group a couple of months ago
they point I don't know the details of
this so somebody who knows better can
check whether this is accurate but their
report was the following they said that
these two cartels were quite different
in their nature these are two big
cocaine cartels one of them the Medellin
Cartel was lower-class in origin Pablo
Escobar the big shot was from the little
slum somewhere and most of them were
peasants or middle you know lower middle
class people or workers it sort of made
it up through the rackets and apparently
the Medellin Cartel though very rural
and killing a lot of people and so on
and so forth had a kind of a Robin Hood
--is-- character to it so in fact it was
pretty popular there was a lot of
popular support for it they were
building sports stadiums and kind of
like old fashioned city bosses in the
United States I mean pretty brutal foes
but they were kind of nice to people you
know you came around if your kid was
sick and they gave you money and that
sort of business which is one of the
reasons they had such popular support
the colleague cart and they were wiped
out the Cali cartel is quite different
they're just rich businessmen there are
the guys who
on Wall Street and you know chemical
corporations and all into the you know
the things that aren't called rackets
mainly just mass robbery of people and
so they were untouched and now they run
the whole thing and apparently the drug
war was very carefully crafted to
destroy one cartel but to build up the
other which seems to have been the
effect well that's the derivative or a
final comment that ought to be made
about it is that the US has tried to
help now and then so in the 1980s when
the cocaine business was really building
up the government of Colombia did
approach the United States for
assistance in building a radar station
which they could use to high-tech radar
station which they could use to detect
low-flying planes coming in from other
parts of the Andes into Colombia and
therefore stopped a drug the drug war
and the Reagan administration was very
enthusiastic about this idea and they
did in fact construct for them a radar
station it was on Sun and race island
which is about which as far as you can
get in Colombian territory from a place
where the planes were flying but happens
to be off the shore of Nicaragua and
therefore could be used as part of the
u.s. terrorists war against Nicaragua so
we did help them out with a radar
station in the same years Costa Rica
approached us also with the same request
and the u.s. offered help to them to
Costa Rica however turned to British
experts for advice on analysis and the
British informed them that the station
that the US was planning to build would
have been totally useless for any drug
purpose but would have been able to be
part of the the aerial surveillance over
Nicaragua which was used to guide the
u.s. trained terrorists to attack soft
targets there like health clinics and so
on on so Costa Rica didn't go around
there so we do help out sometimes well
as far as the drug war these are sort of
small facts about
or words worth bearing in mind as for
the drug war itself it has a number of
purposes for one thing it is a straight
cover for counter insurgency and for
simply maintaining the oppressive the
oppression under democracy the Latin
American Bureau and Britain described
them of Colombia one says it democracy
without people which is pretty much
accurate so in part it's the it's the
drug war is a cover for all of that for
another thing it's a cover for our arms
production addiction which is a really
serious one it also has the useful
advantage of providing a means to lock
up the superfluous population at home
and that's important because there's a
major war going on against the general
population here and which the big effort
being made to try to turn the United
States into a third world country and
that means with a big perf lewis
population there's nothing to do with we
don't yet carry out social cleansing by
the security forces so you got to have
other things and one of the things you
do is lock them up and drugs are
primarily used for that purpose most of
the people in jail are for victimless
crimes and the crimes are carefully
crafted so for example a very carefully
crafted if you look take say cocaine the
drug of choice and the ghettos happens
to be cracked the drug of choice in the
rich white suburbs happens to be
powdered possession of powder is a
misdemeanor nothing happens to you
possession of crack you know you
probably get the death penalty for well
that's typical class-based legislation
and it explains a good part of what the
drug war is about and it also explains
why the prison rate is assuming beyond
any other country in the world and
expected to go up thirdly the drug war
is very useful for frightening the
population people have to be kept from
seeing what's happening to them and
their classic ways of doing this one way
is to get them to be frightened of one
another and the drug war
another thing we learned from the Nazis
and plenty of others and the drug war
does play that role I don't know how
much it affects the general population
because it's hard to test but you can
more easily test how it affects the
intellectuals and their it's extremely
effective so if you want to have an
example you can take a look look at the
latest issue of the Harvard magazine
that's the fancy magazine that goes
around to alumni and it has a cover
story on some guy who's developed some
new leadership techniques which are now
considered really hot stuff they're
teaching him in the business school and
so on and he gives an example of his
leadership techniques and how much they
improve things and the best main example
that he gives is George Bush's calling
the drug war which he says Bush made a
mistake in follow up his methods he
followed old methods and the way he
describes it is like this he says when
Bush came into office there was a huge
fear and concern about drugs all over
the country and Bush reacted by calling
the drug war and going after Noor yeah
you gotta try to stop the drugs and that
didn't work because he didn't follow the
right leadership techniques the only
problem with the whole story is the fact
when Bush came into office that was
virtually no concern about drugs in fact
a couple of weeks before the drug war
was announced concern over drugs was one
of the lowest things on all the polls I
mean a lot of concern about the budget
and jobs and stuff but drugs were
virtually undetectable when Bush
announced the drug war and the media
went into operation that created the
fear about drugs
that's testable the polls show it there
was a huge media campaign I actually did
a review just a curiosity for the month
of September effort was announced it
reviewed the AP wires for a month and
stories on drugs were outnumbered
stories on all foreign affairs combined
you know everything it was like half the
stories of everything was drugs it's all
over television so none had its effect
people got scared of drug
so in fact the propaganda worked and
drugs became a big concern but a
manufactured concern concerned by the
doctrinal system and at least among
intellectuals the right message was
established namely the one that's the
opposite of the easily determined fact
which is not a nun typical feature of
the intellectual culture I should say
finally last comment and all its the
word the sources of Columbia's tragedy
and it is a tragedy are not completely
external though for us it's the external
causes that are most important they're
internal as well this century opened
with the civil war in Colombia in which
an estimated hundred thousand people or
so were killed there was a populist
leader and killed in 1948 replaced
shortly after by the first formal
fascist to take power after the Second
World War a supporter of Franco who we
supported but after got tons murder in
48 there was a huge upsurge of violence
in which hundreds of thousands of people
were killed the u.s. role begins really
primarily with the Kennedy
administration and since and it is in
highly significant and remained soaked
and there also are links to our own
society and there were thinking about to
better than I can express them they were
expressed to me in a letter that I got a
couple of days ago from a leading
activist Colombian activist a woman who
was mentioned earlier Cecilia azerath a
lone she and I'll just quote from her
letter
she's discussing a recent meeting of the
women's international aid for Peace and
Freedom one of the few groups in the
world that actually does something
we're people and suffering people and
people in trouble and so on and it has
an American branch they just proposed
came out with what they call the women's
peace and justice Treaty of the Americas
which is a very good document in my
opinion and worth reading I don't expect
to see a front-page article about it
soon but you can get hold of it and she
points out that others quote I firmly
believe that everything is interrelated
since the real culprit is the economic
system and it is very important that the
American people start connecting issues
abroad with their own reality starting
with its foreign policy since things do
not happen in a vacuum I will use an
example to make my point the drug issue
the children of poor women who in
Colombia have no opportunities because
the society has abandoned them and are
forced to be hitmen or to work in the
cocaine laboratories to make cocaine or
that are recruited to be members of a
death squad team they're in the same
situation as the children of poor women
in the United States who are forced to
sell cocaine on the corners of the
streets or to be lookouts for the
salesman and so on and for the same
reasons the only difference is that the
ones speak Spanish and the others speak
English the tragedy is the same I think
she's quite right and the tragedy is
being heightened in both countries by
quite self-conscious social policy this
is going on while we watch and well so
far we do nothing and if we choose to do
nothing it's not hard to imagine the
prospects
an important feature of maintaining a
favorable climate for business
operations an important feature of it is
creating a society that has formal
democracy with ample oppression and to
maintain formal democracy with
oppression does require plenty of
torture and killing and social cleansing
and other things and to maintain a an
economic system of extraordinary
injustice of the kind you just heard
describe where that's where half the
children are hungry for example and so
on
that that requires harsh measures and
that's what security forces are for well
all of this is completely familiar to
anybody who looks around the world in
the case of Colombia it was explained
quite clearly some time ago by the
president of the Colombian permanent
Committee on Human Rights afraid of
vasquez Sousa he pointed out I'll just
quote this description
he said that Colombia's Benna has a
wonderful is a wonderful democracy now I
since 1991 but you know I think 1886 or
something like that whenever the first
Constitution was really nice almost as
nice a democracy as the Soviet Union
under Stalin which also had quite a
beautiful Constitution the he says that
the behind the facade of a
constitutional regime we have a military
militarized society which has been under
a state of siege virtually constantly
there is for example land reform
legislation big plenty of land and in
soon I should say Columbia's quite a
rich Society
it's not that it's a poor impoverished
Society as an enormous wealth mineral
wealth oil resources agricultural
resources even had the beginnings of
industrial developed
and in fact it's not impossible that it
might have had an industrial revolution
if it hadn't been under the leadership
of business classes who are more or less
committed to free-market policies and
one of the sort of small secrets about
economic development very
well-established over several centuries
is that free-market papapapa
policies are a recipe for total disaster
part of the reason why the first world
is first world and the third world is
third world although they were more or
less alike back in the eighteenth
century is that the first world without
exception the United States does must
exert I don't think any statement we
published in that book has aroused so
much fury but I'm afraid it's true
the correlation was global but Herman
also did a second study which shed some
light on it
he compared US aid with the climate for
business operations in a country as
measured by ability to repatriate
profits and so on and he found that
foreign aid was very closely correlated
to the climate for business operations
the investment climate
now that correlation makes sense the
purpose of foreign aid afterall is for
the US taxpayer to pay off US
corporations via some other country and
therefore the which is what foreign aid
in fact amounts to overwhelmingly and
like most social policy and in and the
fact that foreign aid increases as the
climate for business operations include
increases of course is completely
natural almost automatic as people would
know if there was such a subject as
international relations or political
science or government where you study
the things that go on in the world in
fact it's almost a truism now why should
there be a correlation between US aid
and torture well that's a secondary
correlation there happens to be a very
good reason why improve
the climate for business operations is
associated with torture one of the best
ways of improving the climate for
business operations is to murder union
leaders torture priests and nuns who are
trying to organize peasants that kill
human rights activists and so on that
has a marvelous way of improving the
climate for business operations it's one
of the main things that contributes to
were called economic miracles and
another department down the street and
so naturally you have a cartlett so
that's a reasonable correlation to and
if you put those two reasonable
correlations together you just happen to
find by accident a secondary correlation
between US aid and torture so the proper
conclusion is not that US leaders kind
of enjoy torture it's that it's a matter
of total indifference what they care
about is profits for US investors and it
just happens that that's correlated with
torture a global phenomenon a perfectly
understandable one actually it's broader
than that in the case of Colombia
illustrates it it's
there are basically two facts about
Colombia that I think we should bear in
mind the rest is all footnotes the first
fact is what you've just been hearing it
has a horrendous human rights record
right now at wins first prize in the
hemisphere which is not an easy prize to
win the political killings as you heard
or somewhere variously estimated at five
to ten a day mostly state security
forces the second fact is that colombia
receives more than half of US military
aid for the hemisphere that when bill
clinton came in he was gonna change that
and he did he increased it by about
twelve percent and when the pentagon
budget was not ample to deal with the
increase he turned to emergency over
drawing facilities available to the
president pretty much as in the case of
the recent bailout of investors in
mexico the crimes in colombia have been
pre awful through the 80s they've been
increasing they got worse under the most
recent president says our Gaviria he was
a special friend of the united states in
particular bill clinton who liked him so
much that he rammed them through a
Secretary General of the OAS under a
with a power-play that was pretty much
resented in the hemisphere and the State
Department in affirming their support
for President Gaviria said praised him
particularly for his steps towards
extending democracy in Colombia under
very difficult conditions that the
conditions are difficult is not in doubt
thank you can ask the several thousand
murdered people of the one opposition
party they were they around would be
glad to tell you about it and president
Gaviria helped substantially in creating
and expanding these conditions so the
support for him made a lot of sense now
there's absolutely nothing new or or out
of the Jenna Freeman example but it's
true of everyone else followed extreme
protectionist policies and still does
whereas what we call the third-world
pretty much followed free-market
policies but it was rammed down the
throat and the difference is notable and
whatever possibilities there were for an
industrial revolution in Colombia which
were not slight given its resources and
its population and everything else they
were essentially aborted by the fact
that they follow the rules the rules
that they teach you about in the IMF and
the World Bank and so on the and it's
not the only case in fact it's
remarkably uniform also well-known to
economic historians agency the so
Colombia is a rich country but a very
poor one for most of the population it
had a land is a big problem not that
there's a shortage of it but it's owned
by you know very tiny number of people
and there is land reform legislation
it's been on the books since 1961 but it
simply isn't implemented the reason it
isn't implemented as the country is run
by the landowners and the army who
worked for them Hana were paid by you
and me we were taxpayer money us do that
is well-known as well in fact it this
present system was pretty well
established by the Kennedy
administration which among its
innumerable crimes which were quite from
and that's something that might interest
us around here since it was a Cambridge
based administration right from the
elite universities Harvard and MIT and
following all the right rules though
people design an invent and teach here
the Kennedy administration in 1962 Kara
instituted a change in hemispheric
policy which is one of the most
important things that ever happened in
the entire history the Hemisphere and
would be well known if we were to study
things like history and so on
in 1962 the Kennedy administration
shifted the policy of the Latin American
military and of course we're in a
position to do that
the they changed the mission of the
Latin American military from hemispheric
defense as it was called to internal
security well a hemispheric defense was
kind of a holdover from the Second World
War when you know I had to worry about
the Germans and stuff but in turn that
didn't mean anything
the only threat to any mineral pattern
in this correlation between the most
horrendous human rights record and the
mat on the largest US contribution in
this case literally more than half the
military aid for the hemisphere in fact
that's a standard correlation it's been
shown over and over there was an
important study of it by the leading
academic specialists on human rights in
Latin America very mainstream scholars
Lars Shultz University of North Carolina
did a study in an academic journal was
published in 1980 in which he simply
compared US foreign aid in Latin America
with torture in Latin America and found
that they were remarkably well
correlated as he put it you
aid flows primarily to the most to the
worst human right to countries that
torture their citizens to the most
egregious violators of human rights in
the hemisphere this continued right
through the Carter years no change it
included military aid and as he was
careful to point out it was uncorrelated
with need it was not that the countries
that torture happened to be the most
meat needy in fact there was no
correlation at all
well that might lead a superficial
observer to conclude that the United
States just likes torture but you're all
scientists and you know that you can't
deduce causality from a correlation and
in fact another study was done at the
same time that sheds further light on it
this was done by a economist at the
Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania a longtime colleague and
co-author and friend of mine Edward
Herrmann and we published it in a joint
book about the same time Herrmann did a
broader global study of the correlation
between human rights and between torture
and foreign aid and certainly the reason
why torture is picked is because Amnesty
International does an extensive survey
of torture they are an important
organization but they have a very
specific mandate that they keep - and
one of the things as torture says pretty
good record of torture and he found that
across the world the same correlation
held there's a very close correlation
between torture and US aid in fact he
concluded quite realistically that
Washington is the torture capital of the
world if you trace back torture - it
