first world war 2 period was around
around 25 years ago there was an
international economic order that was
established at the end of the Second
World War was called the Bretton Woods
system established by the United States
and Britain it it did call try to
liberalize trade they were hoping to get
trade had international trade had
dropped very sharply between the two
wars and they wanted to get it back to
roughly what it was before the First
World War what's pretty much what's
happened I mean what's called
globalization is actually in many ways a
return to the pre-world War one period
in terms of ratio of trade to global
economy investment flow relative the
global economy and so on there are
changes but by gross measures it's not
all that new in fact in many ways less
than before the Second World War so one
effort was to liberalize trade increase
trade to move toward some kind of what's
called free trade but a mother part of
Bretton Woods a crucial part of it was
to regulate capital flow to make sure
that capital flow is controlled so
countries were permitted in fact
encouraged to maintain controls on
export or import of capital and the
exchange rates were to be fixed so the
financial system was to be regulated and
controlled the trade system was to be
liberalised and those two things went
together on the theory which is
plausible the like most of economics
kind of guesswork but it was plausible
that the liberalisation of finance would
be your mind liberalization of trade
that was part of the reason there was a
general consensus on that the other
reason was it was a truism that was
understood by everyone and explicitly
articulated by the framers of Britain
woods and in fact the obvious on two
minutes thought that the liberalisation
of finance undermines democracy in the
welfare state almost automatically and
the reason is that the threat of capital
flight is sufficient to
des moines social program so if the
country undertakes say programs to
stimulate the economy or spend money on
education and welfare in fact doing
anything which is called irrational
namely helps the population not just
profits surrounding irrational like that
capital can flow out of the country well
capital flows out of the country
interest rates go up economic growth
drops you have to stop spending end up
in recession in fact that's exactly the
IMF prescriptions for every poor country
if you notice them and of course what
happens is what you expect the capital
flight is the possibility of capital
flight creates gives financial
institutions which are highly
concentrated gives them the power to
determine social policy everywhere you
know just by the threat of capital
flight therefore capital controls are
necessary and if you're going to
preserve some degree of democracy and
also social welfare well i was i'm
virtually paraphrasing what was said by
the framers of Bretton Woods quite
openly and it's kind of obvious I mean
the logic is straightforward and it
wasn't controversial than and it isn't
controversial now well capital flight
was liberalized in the early 1970s the
Bretton Woods system was dismantled in
the early 1970s them can only survive as
a cooperative system so when confined
malaysia is trying to control capital
that will never work because you have to
have cooperation at the other end if the
you know both sides have to be
participating and if any major financial
power pulls out of the system it quickly
arose well the united states pulled out
of it in the early seventies followed by
britain switzerland the other major
financial centers an assistant was gone
by the 1980s the rich countries had
dropped regulation of capital
others either joined or were forced to
join the East Asian countries like say
especially South Korea is a dramatic
case which it had a miraculous economic
growth paralleled in history was
compelled to drop capital controls in
1993 that led to huge inflow of
speculative capital and quick outflow of
speculative capital that's the East
Asian crisis particularly striking in
countries like South Korea which really
had a strong economy he might recover it
if they were some rational world order
reestablished and I had plenty of other
consequences too there was an
astronomical increase in speculative
capital I mean it just you know the
numbers are staggering right after the
decline of controls and it's mostly
speculative capital it's now estimated
at over a trillion dollars a day maybe
trillion and a half dollars a day most
of it extrana short term speculation so
you know money goes in and back in less
than a week for about eighty percent of
it a lot of its hours or minutes this
all is a very harmful to the real
economy and certainly not beneficial to
it and that's most of the foreign
exchange transactions in fact probably
about ninety-five percent of them by now
maybe five percent are related to trade
and investment you go back to the
Bretton Woods period pre-1970 about
ninety percent was of exchange
transactions were related to real
economy and maybe ten percent for
speculative and that's an enormous
change quite apart from the scale which
has exploded number plenty of other
effects exactly the ones you'd predict
it since 1970 growth rates have declined
productivity is declined throughout the
wealthy countries for third world it's
been
disaster incomes have stagnated or
declined in the United States for
example about eighty percent of the
population of the workforce is working
longer hours under worst conditions
either to maintain then yet recovered
their income level of 1973 not even 1989
in fact and the same as in England and
to a lesser extent but somewhat and the
other industrial countries there's been
a vast growth in inequality it's back to
the 1920s then a very sharp rise and
imprisonment is a superfluous population
you got to get rid of them somehow so
throwing them into prison mostly black
males that rate
