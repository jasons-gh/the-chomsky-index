and I - on behalf of all of you would
like to thank the organizers of this
debate of whom there were many I think
particularly note must go to Chris
Horton and the Graduate Student
Association and also to the Student
Government Association but there are
many many other people who worked hard
on this and we thank them now the topic
for tonight's this afternoon's debate is
the Gulf War with particular focus on
what are the implications of the war and
its outcome for the so-called New World
Order and what really happened and why
and we are of course very honored today
to have two such distinguished debaters
we flipped a coin and dr. Chomsky will
be going first
dr. Noam Chomsky is Institute professor
of linguistics and philosophy at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and he is known internationally for his
pioneering contributions to linguistic
theory but dr. Chomsky is also very
widely known for his outspoken dissent
from American policy in the Middle East
and he is the author of over a dozen
works on international relations and
politics including peace in the Middle
East W Scott Thompson has been a member
of both the Ford and Reagan
administration's he is adjunct professor
of international politics at Georgetown
University and he is on the faculty of
the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy
he's also president of strategic
research associates and he is the author
of numerous books and articles on
foreign policy the format of the debate
will give each participant approximately
15 minutes to make an initial
presentation there will be on the
assumption that some people new to the
debate will be coming in late there will
be a brief recapitulation of
approximately two to three minutes each
after that and then we will have
question
if either participant feels the need for
cross questioning there's an opportunity
before that but miss appeal that the
audience will probably wish to become
involved and so at that point we will
take questions from the audience we
would ask you if the question is
directed to one or the other of our
participants - so indicate you may ask a
question to both the microphone for
audience questions is located right
there
after the debate at the appropriate time
we would ask you to line up there for
your question and now without any
further ado let's begin the debate and
our first speaker is dr. Chomsky
well the New World Order is a large
topic and I'm not going to be able to
say much about it let me begin with a
few commonplace but important
observations first is that for the past
twenty years or so it's been quite
obvious that the world is moving towards
what's now conventionally called a
tri-polar economic system three major
economic powers the United States still
happens to be the largest economy but
it's facing serious social and economic
problems these became aggravated quite
severely during the reagan-bush years
meanwhile german-led continental Europe
and Japan and its environment are
continuing their economic growth the
general facts about this should be
pretty familiar so I won't elaborate the
second point about the emerging new
world order is that of the three the
United States is the only significant
military power and likely to remain so
with the collapse of the system of
Soviet tyranny there is no longer any
deterrent for the use of force by the
United States and that's surely an
important fact about the new world order
so what we have emerging is a world
that's tri-polar economically with a
huge but declining economic power that
holds a virtual virtual monopoly of
force with the system of deterrence
having collapsed now returning to the
Gulf War I think that helps understand
the interplay of these factors and what
they imply about the the emerging world
system begin with let's begin with the
first days of the Bush administration
every president calls for a national
security review by the CIA and the
Pentagon the Bush administration bid -
we usually
learn about it 30 40 years later in this
case one section was leaked and having
to do with what are called third-world
threats this remember is the early days
of the administration when Saddam
Hussein and George Bush were close
friends and the section had to do with
third-world threats and it says that
when the United States confronts what it
calls a much weaker enemy it is
necessary not merely to defeat it but to
defeat it decisively and rapidly the
reason is anything else would be too
embarrassing and would undercut
political support for the United States
which is recognized to be very thin now
several points first notice that there's
nothing about diplomacy and other
peaceful means which is quite natural
the United States is militarily strong
but politically weak in the conventional
formulation except that on all sides
that is pursuing goals in the third
world which are quite unlikely to gain
popular support and in fact they're
extremely unpopular so it is therefore
necessary to avoid diplomacy and
negotiations which are not a good idea
in those circumstances and to gain a
quick and decisive victory before
popular opposition has an opportunity to
develop abroad or for that matter at
home a second point is that much weaker
enemies which are of course the only
kind you want to fight much weaker
enemies have to be pulverized not merely
beaten if the right lessons are to be
learned and the lessons are clear enough
they are directed to various audiences
for the third world the lesson is don't
raise your heads or you'll be smashed
keep to your service function now the
United States will support the most
murderous tyrant as long as he plays
along it will crush third world
Democrats if they forget their service
function on this matter the we have a
rich documentary record of declassified
documents highest plan
levels and a very rich historical record
and they're quite clear and consistent
on this score a second lesson has to be
taught at home it's given the current
circumstances it's necessary to divert
the attention of the public from severe
and growing problems various the
weighted the standard way to do this in
the case of any state is to try to
create an atmosphere of fear and
periodic moments of jingoist hysteria
international terrorism was used for
this purpose the fraudulent drug war in
general Noriega a year ago but periodic
episodes of this kind are necessary for
the purpose and quick decisive victories
in which you smash much weaker enemies
are in fact the conventional way to
achieve that in there is also a lesson
for the third for the world at large
the lesson is that force is to be the
decisive element in running the world
and that again is natural that's our
comparative advantage in world affairs
it's not in the appeal popular appeal of
the policies designed for the third
world quite the contrary it is no longer
in economic power but in military power
we absolutely dominate now the events in
the Gulf actually followed this script
rather closely prior prior to summer to
say July 1990 Saddam Hussein was George
Bush's amiable friend and favored
trading partner of the Bush
administration with Bush Reagan
administration's had given enormous
support to Saddam Hussein from the time
in fact when written in the United
States the block Security Council
resolutions opposing Iraq's invasion of
Iran Iraq had become the unite the
leading United States become leading one
of the leading trading partners of Iraq
Iraq had been first or second depending
on the year in receiving credits from
the United States for a purchase of
goods when house when the House Foreign
Affairs Committee tried to censure
Saddam Hussein's atrocious human rights
record the Bush administration
intervened to block it last February
when the Iraqi Democratic opposition
approached the White House with an
appeal for parliamentary democracy in
Iraq they were rebuffed you'll notice
incidentally that the Iraqi Democratic
opposition did not appear publicly in
the press coverage from during the
period of this crisis from August
through February that's a very
courageous andy saddam hussein
opposition of course in exile given the
nature of that tyranny which had
regularly been rebuffed by the US
government but supported by the u.s.
peace movement the reason that was
excluded from the media is because of
its positions which in fact happened to
be right within the range of those of
the American and international peace
movements namely strong opposition to
Saddam Hussein strong opposition to the
quick resort to violence since that is
the position of the Iraqi democratic
movement they had to be barred from
discussion and yet if you want to read
their programs you have to turn to the
European press
well that's prior to July in the George
Bush of course was quite aware that
Saddam Hussein was a murderous gangster
but it was assumed that he was our
gangster and therefore he's okay
in July Saddam Hussein began making
intimidating moves against queit the
State Department had a few things to say
about that namely they basically
encouraged him the State Department made
it signal pretty clearly to Iraq that it
had no particular that had no particular
objection if Saddam Hussein rectified
border disputes with quake by force and
intimidated his neighbors to increase
the price of oil to maybe $25 a gallon
well Saddam Hussein apparently took that
as a green light was going on his mind I
don't know but in any event he took all
equate and active aggression on August
2nd and at that point he changed from a
murderous gangster which was quite okay
to an independent
list which is not okay at all and policy
changed there were two responses to the
aggression one was the conventional
response that the UN on the world
community attempts in just about every
case of aggression that is sanctioned
condemnation sanctions and diplomacy now
usually that doesn't work because it's
blocked by the great powers the United
States far in the lead incidentally but
this time it was possible to pursue it
because for once the United States
happened to be opposed to an act of
aggression the sanctions had an
unusually good prospects for success and
there's no real reason to debate it
because very likely that they had
already succeeded I'll come to that in a
moment
the second response which was quite
different was limited to the United
States and Britain with some marginal
and rather tepid support elsewhere and
that was to undercut diplomacy and to
reduce the options to force and that
began very quickly the by the Bush
administration announced at once
unambiguously that there will be no
negotiations by late August the State
Department had made it clear that it was
important to block what they called the
diplomatic track because that might
defuse the crisis peacefully and they
didn't want that and it was becoming a
real problem by then because there were
many possibilities on the table
including Iraqi offers which the state
to the State Department Middle East
experts called serious and negotiable
now there's no time to trace the record
so I'll just mention the last known
pre-war example released by hiatus
officials on January 2nd called for
total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait in
return for Security Council indication
of some kind of commitment unspecified
on two major issues that kept coming up
the issue of weapons of mass destruction
in the region and the israel-palestine
issue the u.s. immediately rejected that
again State Department officials
described it as a serious position that
indicated indicate intention to withdraw
the u.s. rejected it at once stating
there will be no negotiations the u.s.
opposition to this so-called linkage had
nothing to do with the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait as we know very well from the
fact that the u.s. had also opposed
diplomatic approaches to the same two
issues prior to the invasion now at that
time about two-thirds of the American
population supported that settlement
even without knowing that the
opportunity existed because it was kept
very quiet most of the world supported
to including again the Iraqi Democratic
opposition but it was contrary to policy
recall the security policy there can be
no diplomacy and a much weaker enemy
must be not just defeated but massacred
if the right lessons are to be taught
there were some official reasons given
for this posture but I won't insult your
intelligence by running through them now
the reasons for all of this have been
articulated pretty clearly I think
mainly in the business press the
international business press so for
example in the Wall Street Journal a
Reagan insider former Reagan Knight Navy
secretary James Webb had an interesting
article in late January January 31st in
which he described the Bush
administration as one committed to brute
force rather than other means which
these are all quotes which had
relentlessly maneuvered the country into
an unnecessary war and it did it because
they have a domestic very serious
domestic problems on their hands and
they have no idea what to do about them
except one namely to exploit US military
power and turn the country into a
country of Hessians as he put it that is
mercenaries who will carry out a kind of
a global enforcer role expecting others
to pay for it and prop up the economy
he's happens to be opposed to that
others who described it in the
International Business press are in
favor of it so for example the British
equivalent of The Wall Street Journal
the London Financial Times says that the
United States must become what they call
a mercenary state because somebody's got
to keep order in the third world and
we're the ones who can do it we no
longer have the economic base so others
will have to pay
for it in the Chicago Tribune the main
business conservative business daily in
the United States their financial editor
has been running a series of articles
about this all through the period his he
observes that the United States has lost
its ability to compete successfully
outside of what he calls the security
market that is means of violence and he
says we should exploit this ability we
should turn the United States again he
says into Hessian state mercenary state
and ensure that others pay we should
pound on plenty of tables in Japan and
Germany to ensure that they buy our
goods and buy Treasury securities and
keep the economy going
meanwhile there should be a flow of
profits the the prof huge profits from
Gulf oil production should continue to
flow through our economy and to where a
British lieutenant also severely
troubled as he puts it we should run a
protection racket Chicago remember so
people understand this we should run a
kind of an international protection
racket other countries should buy
protection from us he offers the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation as a model
banks sort of Buy in and if they get in
trouble it you know the government comes
across but the real model that he has in
mind as the wording indicates is the
Mafia if a storekeeper in the Chicago
doesn't think somebody's threatening him
you buy protection from the Mafia they
break his knees and of course if you
don't pay up they break your knees or
worse too but that's what we should be
we should be the international mafia and
he says that's the only way in which we
can keep our control of the world
economic system the if there's much more
to say about this I see my time's
running out but let me simply indicate
that these are some of the contours of
the new world order that we see rather
clearly when the veils of rhetoric are
lifted and we look accurately at what is
happening it's not a very pretty picture
it's not in ever
it's also not unlikely against
significant less significant counter
forces arise among the American
population
thank you dr. Chomsky and now dr.
Thompson
it's always nice to come after somebody
who who says such acceptable and
everyday things as professor Chomsky the
I want to take a different attitude
different approach to the New World
Order and to the war but I want to start
by saying describing a couple of
anecdotes that will give you where I'm
coming from give you a sense of where
I'm coming from and what in fact I
believe our comparative advantage is in
the third world which I have spent my
adult life studying in the field in
Africa and Asia
starting with the issue of human rights
for example last summer I had the
privilege of being in Moscow with
colleague dick shifter the Assistant
Secretary of State for Human Rights
affairs and we were calling on the
Soviet foreign minister mr. Shevardnadze
the then foreign minister who described
in great detail his absolute
exasperation he would pull his hair like
this and say how how dick shifter would
come at him and they wouldn't negotiate
until 5:00 in the morning over one case
and then another case on human rights
and then as soon as they finished the
second case and it'd be 2:00 in the
morning and they thought they had the
issue of settled so they could go to the
UN and be friendly shifter would say no
no there's two more we have to do or no
goodwill and they'd go to five o'clock
in the morning and after six months nine
months of this according to the Soviet
foreign minister he went to Gorbachev
and he said you know maybe it'd be just
easier to give in and have Human Rights
for everybody in the Soviet Union then
we don't have shifter kind of bugging us
all night long I'm proud of that last
year I was in the Philippines doing
research and I was standing on top of a
tall building and a coup d'etat was in
the works
it was succeeding there was absolutely
zero doubt in my mind that some Young
Turk majors and captain's and Colonels
were going to take power and that the
same current the same helicopters of the
United States Air Force which had got
Ferdinand Marcos out of the Philippines
four years earlier we're going to have
to come and rescue Corazon Cojuangco
Aquino from melech and young palace
while the Colonel's instituted their new
government there was in my mind as a
professional student of that situation
there was no doubt that
that was what was going to happen within
minutes at that moment there was a swoop
from the north which is where the US air
the 13th US Air Force has its seat Clark
Air Force Base about a hundred miles
north of Manila and four phantom jets
swept down over Manila for about 45
seconds and that was the end of the coup
they bombed nothing they touch nothing
they went back to Clark Air Force Base
the coup collapsed I'm proud of that too
I can also say I could give you lots
more examples the the role of President
Reagan's speech in before the British
Parliament which lit Democratic fires
all over the third world as well as in
the Soviet Union on June the 1st 1982
when I was in the Reagan administration
in which many of us fought hard to have
made I think that's our comparative
advantage in the third world it isn't
that we do everything right but once in
a while we do get something right and
the war that we just finished is one
that we did get right now I will tell
you that that I will agree that we got a
few things wrong I was just reading on
the plane this morning that detail of
what I had suspected had happened in
Monday last week when the Iraqi troops
were desperately trying to escape
northward out of Kuwait they had already
said they were going to leave and our
spokespeople were saying of course the
usual sort of thing well we're not sure
they're going to leave and all of this
was of course a set up so that we could
pummel them pound them blow them to
smithereens on the road outside of
Kuwait and further decimate the Iraqi
army clearly that is what happened in
that particular case all I'm admitting
here conceding suggesting is that is
that we did what Army's generally do in
warfare and that is when things are just
about over you want to make your enemy
whom you've tried to kill be as dead as
possible that's pretty standard military
stuff the only difference here is that
there's a new thing called public
diplomacy and you're supposed to be
honest in public and we weren't about
that one so let's concede that one I
think the rest is pretty much you know
you're getting what you read watch what
they said it was what you paid for and
everything else the fact that 22
countries were prepared to join
in some significant numbers is no small
deal you all know the story I assume
about what a nice guy this fellow this
fellow is Saddam Hussein in 1987 when
his army was about to lose against Iran
and he asked what he could do to his
cabinet and this is a known this is a
true story and one member of the cabinet
suggested that he simply step aside for
a few days to meet the Iran requirement
that he resigned before there be
negotiations and then he said you know
and then we could have the benefit of
Saddam Hussein's wisdom back in power as
soon as the negotiations begin that
particular ministers wife was a mistress
of Saddam Hussein and when her husband
did not obviously come home that night
asked to have him back and for once he
kept his word said I Mustaine sent the
body back in 13 parts as it happens
there we were dealing with a monster
somebody had to do it and this wasn't
just a marginal thing on the part of the
French or the Egyptians or a lot of
other forces that were there with us it
was him it was important it was not as
such a place where we were fighting for
democracy I wish we were I wish there
were a well-ordered democracy in Kuwait
and in Saudi Arabia
Olo in the case of Kuwait we had one of
the nicest of all Arab regimes going at
least one of the most open that there
has been the fact that Kuwait is already
declaring that it is going to move back
towards and further from its earlier
position a democratic system of some
sort is indicative of who's putting on
the pressure
after all they have about a hundred
billion dollars of funds in equities in
markets that we ultimately control and
I'm sure they are aware that our
leverage over their affairs is not
inconsiderable
if we wanted to use it so those are the
kinds of issues indications of the way
things are going of where we've put our
money if it feels good to you that we
won this war it's because it should feel
good because we put a lot into it and
there were very important issue
we stopped a monster who was going to
get control of all the major oil fields
of the Middle East for all intents and
purposes and occupy the high ground of
the Middle East and be in a position to
dominate to have a to have a unit veto
on aspects of the world economy if he
pulled it all off it was not
inconceivable so the question really was
we're we're going to have this war now
or we're going to have it later given
that we had it today the interesting
issue would be how did we pull it off so
successfully given that we don't usually
do these things so successfully
professor Chomsky and I were together in
opposing the Vietnam War I think that
unfortunately one of the problems is as
AJP Taylor said of one European power
they learn from their mistakes how to
make new ones a lot of old warriors on
the anti-vietnam front assumed this was
going to be another Vietnam well it
wasn't the issues were clear and they
remain clear there are a lot of
questions that do remain as a result of
the of the war how divided are the Arabs
going to remain the United Nations
Security Council has never had such as
such an upsurge in influence and real
power not the kind let's not confuse it
with a reality that the United States
leant it for a time nonetheless real
power of a sort as it has seldom had it
is not clear how long we're going to
have the kind of backing from the Soviet
Union for this kind of ventures in the
future given the direction of events in
the Soviet Union it is not clear how
willing the government in Washington is
going to be to put pressure on Israel to
continue to behave the way we wish it to
to take part in the settlement in direct
negotiations or in a an international
conference or something in between more
likely which can settle some of the at
least some of the issues that are there
outstanding between Israel and the other
and the other Arabs it may well be that
ultimately the most important issue that
comes out of this war in the Persian
Gulf is an arab-israeli settlement I
think it's premature to argue it either
way the fact is that the war has
unsettled everything everything is off
its foundation
and it remains to be seen but diplomacy
can do now to put it back together in
some important way the fact is that well
and then one other question did the
punishment fit the crime yes we and we
went in because of an invasion of a
friendly country there have been other
invasions of friendly countries that we
did not go in for yes there was oil
there yes it was because there was a a
combination of principles and economic
issues at stake that make us make me
satisfied with the the punishment that
was attached to the crime I wish we
could have gone in to every place that
somebody has done something bad
I suspect professor Chauncey and I would
also agree on that that would be a very
even more unpleasant America to him and
certainly less pleasant America to me if
we in fact did in fact go into all the
places where other powers had misbehaved
as had Saddam Hussein in Kuwait well
let's talk let's talk just a few more
minutes about the New World Order that
we hear so much about basically we
started hearing a lot about the New
World Order prior to this war prior even
to the invasion on August the second
last year in fact it's something that
goes back quite a while you could argue
in fact that there's no real
discontinuity between what the United
States has been doing since the time
that it set out to build the United
Nations and all the other organizations
of the post-war era that have been the
bedrock of international relations since
then but in fact the New World Order has
taken a change two things obviously the
war in the Persian Gulf puts everything
in motion in that part of the world the
other thing obviously that has changed
that affects both that as well as
everything else is the imminent breakup
of the Soviet Union I do note however as
a russian diplomat who's a student of
mine and co-author with me of a book
says if if in fact the Soviet Union
completely breaks up and all the
Constituent Republic's go off to the
side the rsfsr are the
Republic will remain will still be the
largest country on earth and will still
be the third most populous country on
earth and will still be the most nuclear
powerful country on earth none of that
will have change so so deterrence hasn't
collapsed it's just the will to the will
to play a role in this interregnum has
has collapsed and the United States does
have rather a free hand which it
obviously must use somebody's got to do
something to maintain some minimal
amount of order what happened with the
collapse of the of the Cold War was that
countries like Iraq felt that they were
free then to invade other countries
because there wasn't any longer a cold
war to double-check them in other words
in the past if Saddam Hussein had
contemplated such he would have presumed
that his ally which was not the United
States it was he not it was a Soviet
Union got all of his arms from the
Soviet Union except a few exercise from
France got all of his arms from the
Soviet Union and if he then invaded a
country the Soviet enemy which is to say
us would go after him that's common
historic deterrence diplomacy
international relations it's the way it
works that all collapsed when communism
that great system that we hear so much
about in a khadeem but nowhere else
anymore
was that when that collapsed in the
Soviet Union for all intents and
purposes okay
so that is why that worked that way what
do we have what do we see in the New
World Order
I see the following I would suggest the
following propositions very very briefly
one we need to encourage regionalism
with security apurate in the regions of
the world doing their thing to maintain
order secondly and obviously we need a
larger Japanese involvement not just out
of love of Japanese but partly out of
love of yen they're already doing that
playing a much larger role in AI dee'
Affairs and in in them in for example
South Asia I thirdly I think we need to
help in a variety of ways to minimize
the destabilizing effects of the breakup
of the Soviet empire as their boundary
shift
fourth we need to maintain a moving
coalition of states there will be a few
bedrock states like England but other
states in different parts of the world
for working with us as 22 did in in the
Persian Gulf as is necessary because if
we don't do it at least for the time
being and that means the next 10 years
probably no one else is going to do it
and we would have tiers of allies a
first here a second tier a third tier
and States would be would get obviously
would would be doing this because of
their interests because of their
alliance with us in depending on the
ideas that were at issue in the issues
that were being fought fifth and finally
and most importantly keep working on the
central principle issues that at least
as I see the world and in my travel in
60 70 countries in the third world and
around is always the important issue for
how people look at the United States
most of the time and that is keep
pushing democracy that's the big thing
it's what we started with it's what made
us relevant in the 19th century what
made us relevant in the 20th century we
had a new resurgence of it after
President Reagan's speech in June of
1982 a lot of countries will tell you
that they owe their democracy right now
to the good influences of the United
States in the 1980s under the Reagan
administration doesn't matter under the
United States let's just call it that
not make it partisan let's obviously
restore our economic health at home so
we can afford to do the kinds of things
that help all that I think obviously in
the Middle East there's a lot of money
that's going to be needed for the
reconstruction of the area there are a
lot of problems in the rest of the world
which need help
and unfortunately the country that goes
around acting like the number one in the
world which we do because we have to and
I guess because we like it is also going
to have to pay a disproportionate share
of the bills so those of you who are
students well all of you we've got our
work cut out ahead of us and it's going
to be a busy generation ahead
you very much thank you well we're going
to pause for one moment while our
technical staff attempts to end the
musical interlude which is going to come
test want to testing testing one two
Tess testing one two testing thing is
for us to pay attention to the ideas
that we stand for foremost amongst which
human rights and democracy and to
continue the pressure for these great
and important things throughout the
third world as well as everywhere else -
thank you dr. Chomsky oh look well
perhaps it'd be helpful if I indicated
some pleasure and noting a lot of common
ground between us so I agree with mr.
Thompson that the United States has
strongly supported human rights in the
Soviet Union as this first example
indicated we might add that the Soviet
Union also has strongly supported human
rights in the United States but the
issue is what was the relation of US
policy toward human rights in the third
world without talking about it I will
mention there's big literature on it
scholarly literature and it shows very
closely that for example it shows that
torture is highly correlated to US aid
and that the u.s. human rights role in
the third world is in fact horrendous
second place in which we agree is that
prior to 1990 Saddam Hussein was a
monster so to take mr. Thompson's
example in 1987 he carried out
absolutely barbaric acts and there were
plenty of others including the act of
aggression which we supported and we
supported him all through it not
everybody of course like I was writing
articles against it the Iraqi Democratic
opposition was opposing it and so on but
the US government supported
now from that we draw a conclusion if
we're logical the u.s. opposition to
Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with
this being a barbaric monster because of
the Bush administration enthusiastically
supported him right through the period
in which he was a barbaric monster there
were other reasons for those now the
issue that arose in August 19 1990 was
how to respond to an act of aggression
and there are several ways there are
basically three ways to respond to an
act of aggression and there are many in
the recent years Saddam Hussein's
aggression and queit which is bad enough
falls well within the range of others it
is nowhere near as horrifying as some to
mention one that took place while George
Bush was head of the CIA the involved an
oil power invading and occupying and
annexing a smaller oil producing power
the Indonesian invasion of East Timor
strongly supported by the United States
still strongly supported and still going
on that led to about 200,000 people
being killed in the first couple of
years so they're plenty and there's
three there's various ways to respond to
them one way to respond to aggression is
to support it or carry it out now in the
usual case say during the period when
Bush has been in high office last twenty
years in most cases of aggression the
United States has reacted that way by
supporting and supporting them
enthusiastically that's why the United
States during this period is far in the
lead far in the lead in vetoing Security
Council resolutions and blocking the
peacekeeping function of the United
Nations now the second way to respond to
aggression is not to support it but to
oppose it and then you have a choice two
options you support it by you oppose it
by sanctions and diplomacy or by bombing
so for exact own it's used sanctions and
diplomacy so in the case of years as a
result of South African actions but
nobody called for bombing to Cape Town a
third approach to
would be to mom and if anyone believed
in that no one in the world does
if anyone believed in that principle
there'd be a lot of capitals to bomb so
we could start by bombing Jakarta and
Ankara and Tel Aviv and Damascus and
Washington but of course we would bomb
in these cases only after we stopped
supporting the aggression as we do and
every one of the examples mentioned that
I'm sure you know the history as far as
the New World Order is concerned if it's
going to be a world order in which the
right way to respond to aggression and
human rights violations is to bomb the
US air force is going to have plenty of
business if it's starting right in
Washington as I said if on the other
hand there's to be a new world order
based on diplomatic and peaceful means
the United States is going to have to
radically reverse its traditional
policies and that can only happen if
there's a recognition of reality on the
part of the US population and a
commitment to creating counter forces
which will lead to a change in very
deep-seated and long-standing pursuits
Thank You dr. Thompson would like to
make a brief comment just that professor
Chomsky seems to confuse the situation
in which either the United States is or
the president United States is not
getting all of its advice from him on
how to do things with with total support
for the other side or in the case of
South Africa southern Africa where in
fact you know our diplomacy I think
arguably is what led to the break all
the key breakthroughs and all the key
pressure points on South Africa for what
has happened today and Czech Crocker did
an absolutely splendid job in eight
years of hard negotiations the in the
case of East Timor after the Portuguese
Revolution in 74 United States was in an
arguably ambiguous and difficult
position feasibly Indonesia its we never
supported the invasion by Indonesia of
East Timor
we didn't protest it that is not the
same as supporting it if there are two
hundred thousand victims it's not
because we supported it it's because we
were like Pontius Pilate and washed our
hands of it because there are a lot of
things going on in the world if you're a
great power which is simply can't do and
Indonesia was it was a close ally there
were not strategic interests involved
for us as that we're in Kuwait and we
can't go fighting every single war every
time so I think you can always get an
audience to laugh by saying we could go
bomb Washington East Timor etc or
Jakarta but it doesn't deal with reality
this without putting aside issues of
opinion notice we agree on South Africa
the right way to respond to South Africa
was not to bomb Cape Town even though in
the surrounding regions alone a million
and a half people were killed during
these years of of quiet diplomacy and
there's not to speak of the countries
themselves which it's not pretty
particularly pretty but as far as East
Timor is concerned the facts are clear
and I'm surprised at what mr. Thompson
said we did not wash our hands of it we
actively supported it the at the United
Nations the United States actively
blocked diplomacy
you want the record on that look at the
memoirs of our UN Ambassador Daniel
Moynihan who writes he said the State
Department wanted things to turn out as
they did it wanted the United Nations to
be rendered utterly ineffective in
anything it might do I was given the
task of ensuring this I succeeded I
carried it out with no inconsiderable
success 90% of Indonesia's arms were
u.s. arms given to them on condition
that they be used only for defense the
United States never invoked that on the
contrary
immediately after the invasion the
United States made new offers of arms
including counterinsurgency equipment
like Bronco helicopters and others as
Indonesia began to exhaust its armaments
in the war against this tiny country
which was near genocidal that was that
was the Ford administration this was now
the Carter Administration increased the
supply of arms in 1978 there was a new
flow of arms that's when the slaughter
reached its absolute peak from that and
it continues exactly that way other
countries we're getting in the act -
this is not washing our hands this is
active different crucial diplomatic and
material support without which the
aggression could not have continued and
could not continue today thank you now
we will have questions from the audience
if you have a question I'd ask you to
move over line up behind the microphone
I know that many of the political
science students will have intelligent
questions I would ask you to indicate to
whom your question is addressed it can
be either desperate to mr. Thompson I
just wonder if you could relate some of
the other examples of the Reagan
administration helping third world
countries achieve democracy sure
absolutely instrumental in the case of
the Philippines absolutely instrumental
in in fact the whole league of new
democracies that was set up that had
meeting in Manila in 1987 role the
United States and to such things as the
National Endowment for democracy which
was set up in the Reagan administration
in 83 it hasn't always gone smoothly
hiyee chief for example is having a lot
of problems look at look at all of Latin
America we put a lot of money into
through our aid programs the beginning
of the Reagan administration most of
Latin America was in one degree or
another in authoritarian military hands
by the end of it the virtually the
entire continent was in one form or the
other of democratic hands I could we
could both professor Chomsky and I
entered some caveats about the the the
the quality of some of those regimes and
their ability to survive
nonetheless this was this is the record
is stunning it's very impressive in
Latin America just beginning in Africa
but Tunisia has had some part has had
some regional elections parliamentary
elections as well where and we put in
some money there for it again in no case
you know are we the only fat force at
work except in such kin no even in the
Philippines we certainly were not the
only force at work but but we played a
very central role there but in all of
these cases we certainly played a
catalytic role of great importance
thank you dr. Chung could you ever
comment well just briefly let's say the
Philippines when the Reagan
administration came into office George
Bush was sent down to Manila and he made
a famous speech in which he praised the
murderous gangster Ferdinand Marcos who
was the tyrant who ruled the Philippines
as a great leader and he said we love
you mr. Marcos we particularly love your
commitment to democracy and so on Reagan
had the same view when the army and the
business class is turned against Marcos
the Reagan administration finally did
two very relatedly and that's quite
typical quite typically and the same is
true in Latin America with whether we
support a democracy in Latin America or
not depends very much on your definition
of democracy there is the Reagan
administration followed what has always
been US policy if you can ensure
that a regime is under the control firm
control of sectors of the population
which will be responsive to US interests
meaning business oligarchy in the
military if you can ensure that yeah
then we'll will support formal
parliamentary method methods if you
can't support that we won't you will
remember that we are the one country in
the world George Bush is the one world
leader who stands condemned before the
world court for aggression for the
unlawful use of force because of the
efforts to overthrow a government which
was in fact freely elected by the
standards of the countries of the world
outside the United States and in fact
even by Latin American scholars in the
United States and all independent
observers well that was because it
wasn't under the under the control of
the elements that we back in another
country like say I'll saw the door we
call it a democracy because it's run by
a terrorist military with a with with
the political facade after the political
opposition has been murdered opposition
newspapers were destroyed priests under
priests were killed the peasant leaders
were destroyed and so on then we're what
we'll call it a democracy one fairly
specific question for dr. Chomsky point
of clarification then much larger issue
I'd like to raise the specific question
to dr. Chomsky in your remarks you've
just made I take it you were referring
to Nicaragua as the country in which
those issues were being the u.s. was as
you were arguing violating international
law the bigger issue I'd like to bring
up has to do with what I understood dr.
Thompson to be sketching out as his
scenario for the New World Order and I
noticed in your presentation dr.
Thompson if I heard you correctly that
there was in fact an admission of what a
lot of people have felt are two really
important areas of concern as we move to
the end of this century and into the
next one what I'm referring to are first
of all the issue of north-south
relationships the enormous gulf in
wealth and poverty between the rich
countries of the so-called north which
of course includes the Soviet
Union most of it at least and the United
States West Germany East Germany as a
whole Japan etc just within the Middle
East my impression is that there are
enormous differences within that region
for example Saudi Arabia as far as I
know has a per capita income something
like five times the per capita income of
Egypt now it seems to me that there's a
major set of issues that what I can tell
are not addressed another set of issues
of course have to do with the
environment we are less than a year away
from Earth Day a lot of people were
saying that the environment together
with the north-south issues have created
a different sense of what a new world
order might be a new world order based
on what some people have called common
security where the threats to security
are primarily not military and I'd like
if both of the speakers could address
those questions well who is it addressed
to primarily well just clarify it's not
I don't argue that the world
International Court of Justice concluded
that it's a different arrogance the on
the case of the two issues that you
described the so-called north-south and
the environmental ones we have to make a
distinction we have to make a
distinction between we what whether we
are describing what the United States is
doing and presumably will continue to do
given its institutions and past behavior
or what we think it ought to do now
those are two quite separate things
I suspect we probably agree on what it
ought to do what carbon dioxide
emissions which might prevent the earth
from being destroyed by global warming
we can think of all kinds very nice
things but the United States ought to do
now will it do any of those things well
not unless very substantial popular
pressures developed inside the United
States to compel a change in
long-standing policies which happen to
go quite in the opposite direction
that's I think what we should bear in
mind on these issues I think we'd have
to get rid of mr.
from the White House before anything is
going to be done on global warming I did
say on north-south issues I thought I
did say really as I was wrapping up that
thrust of our policy in the third world
had to be based on a commitment to
democracy and then we had to revive our
economy at home which i think is in the
process of happening so that we could
afford the kinds of changes and changes
different programs that are needed and I
would have gone on to say had this been
part of our subject for today you know
to pay the bill of the north-south
negotiations that I think will be coming
due in due course this is something also
that has to be done regionally and you
were right to put your emphasis on the
intra regional disparities which they
have to do intra regionally we cannot
really do this from above obviously we
can't do from above anyway very limited
leverage in international fora for the
redistribution of wealth I think you
know try to get more than the 14 billion
then we're spending each year for a ID
is is going to be hard but the right
policies can go somewhere and in the
last ten years the the emphasis we put
on rewarding market economies market
economy principles in the third world
with a result that many of these
economies are now growing and growing in
real terms substantially is the most
important thing we could have done for
for these countries thank you the next
question please keep the questions as
brief as possible for your own reasons
this is for a professor Thompson with
the comment by Chomsky if he wants
professor Thompson you said that we
should feel good because we stopped a
monster and stopping Saddam Hussein and
we upheld principle in defeating Iraq
and driving them out just as a point of
logic this is something that Chomsky has
brought up principles aren't aren't
applied selectively if we do they don't
become a principle or they're not a
principle so I would like you to defend
which principles you think we applied in
driving Iraq out of
oh the principal is you don't they that
no one has the right to invade another
country and and the problem is that you
cannot you cannot always put force
behind in your policy on every principle
now I disagree with professor Chomsky on
the East Timor case I was in the
government at the time and I know of the
distaste we had there never was there
never never never never was a US
government policy of supporting
Indonesian the Indonesian invasion of
East Timor it was something that we
supported as an ally of theirs with the
most utmost regret and and that's just
at least that's the case in the Ford
administration which I was in in the
Defense Department
now the Carter Administration may have
been less squeamish and I've done
something differently the I'm just
saying that the principle a principle
can be a principle and not and be
applied selectively just in the nature
of things you know we cannot we are not
a world policeman we cannot go around
enforcing our principles everywhere we
have to choose to do it where we get the
biggest multiplier effect from doing so
and I can't think of a better case for
doing it then this one we just did which
not only had a multiplier effect in
sending a message all around the world
but it you know it might lead I hope it
might it will lead to the demise of the
monster himself
well the again there's a partial
agreement between us we both agree that
no one has the right to invade another
country so for example that's why George
Bush was condemned by the world court
for attacking another country there
would have been two UN Security Council
resolutions condemning the United States
for the invasion of Panama invasion of
another country except that the United
States veto them in the case of in the
case of say the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon that was invading another
country killing roughly 20,000 people it
went on because the United States vetoed
Security Council resolutions and
supported it in the case of the invasion
of East Timor
I wasn't inside the fort administration
so I don't know if people maybe people
did hold their nose
when they made new offers of
counterinsurgency equipment to Indonesia
immediately after the invasion and when
they told the UN ambassador as he has
said explicitly to block the UN and
rendered utterly ineffective in anything
it might do to talk about the United
States opposing move which which
invasions we should oppose is based on a
false presupposition about the world
most invasions we support it's not a
question of which ones we should oppose
what we should do is stop supporting
them we should have stopped supporting
and carrying out aggression all over the
world now then comes the second issue in
the if we can get to that point if we
can get to the point that we stopped
supporting aggression and we can then
raise the question how should we oppose
it then an issue arises do you suppose
it by bombing or do you oppose it by
peaceful means well in my opinion you
oppose it by peaceful means until the
Security Council goes through its it's
proscribed means which it never did in
this case because the United States
undercut them now here I in the case of
Iraq I agree with the Iraqi Democratic
opposition with two-thirds of the
American population before the attack
and with the rest of the world there
were sanctions that apparently already
worked negotiations were possible the
United States refused to enter into them
because it wanted force similarly in the
other cases in the world I do not
suggest that we bomb Tel Aviv Tel Aviv
is now it is the 13th year in which
Israel is in violation of UN Security
Council resolution 425 calling upon it
to withdraw immediately and
unconditionally from Lebanon during that
period it has terrorized southern
Lebanon which it still holds it has
carried out a war of aggression in which
20,000 people were killed mostly
civilians it bombs the rest of Lebanon I
don't think we oughta bomb Tel Aviv I
don't think we had a bomb Jakarta I
don't think we got a bomb Washington and
so on these that is not the way to
respond to aggression there are other
ways and we should pursue thank you
and next question please
I'm dr. Thompson I think one of the big
problems is the past incoherency of
American foreign policy I know that your
point was that there's a new world order
so I'll limit my question to events
since the thawing of the US USSR
relations which I believe that's what
you said was the new rise of a new world
order but I think their ample events
since then where is the coherency in the
US treatment of Iraq as opposed to the
u.s. treatment of Soviet Union's
crackdowns in the Baltic States where's
the coherency in the u.s. treatment of
Israel in their occupation of the West
Bank and El Salvador Salvadoran
government is there any coherency that
you see in and could you elaborate on it
I'd ask both gentlemen in responding in
the interest in the time constraints
which the panelists themselves have
imposed to be as brief as possible at
this point may I make a distinction
between coherence and consistency I
think you're asking for consistency it
is not possible it is never been
possible I I'm a political scientist I
wish there were a way I could convince
so distinguished it's a world famous a
linguist as professor Chomsky that in
the world of political science there
can't be consistency that does not mean
there isn't coherence I don't think
American foreign policy has been
incoherent I think it's been extremely
coherent and the reason why for example
the United States had to be at the
pussyfoot around the Soviet Union on the
Latvian issue on the Baltic States in
the last month was because we needed
their continued support on Iraq because
they're the northern flank and so that's
the way International Relations works I
would just say that US policy is both
coherent I quite agree with you and
consistent highly consistent its
consider graduate and that the United
States consistent US policy consistently
supports the interests of domestic power
that's and does it quite consistently so
there's no inconsistency in opposing the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and supporting
the Indonesian invasion
East Timor and a dozen other cases in
the case of Indonesia and East Timor mr.
Thomson it's quite correct Indonesia is
a valued ally it allows it allows free
investment by the West free extraction
of resources and so on
in fact Australia right now our ally is
making an agreement with Indonesia over
teamrees oil to rob the Murrays oil
after it's been occupied by Indonesia
well sure we're in favor of that so
therefore we support the Indonesian
invasion of East Timor the Iraqi
aggression of Quetta in contrast was
going to harm us interest so therefore
we oppose that completely consistent I
don't understand what anybody calls that
an inconsistent policy next question
please
the gentleman from Tufts Fletcher school
there's a comment a quick comment is
that we made and created Saddam was
saying he's our son we raised him we
nurtured him and he was wonderful we
were wonderful to him as long as he
opposed Iran the next question I'd like
to ask is that with seams of all these
foreign adventures that we seem to get
involved and around the world that we've
never seemed it I wanted to ask you
being informal in the government
Regan why we seem to never have any
money for the homeless the hungry or
public health access too many people
that don't have it and also isn't it the
fate of all empires that get involved in
endless foreign adventures that end up
getting bankrupt they just collapse well
that's the Paul Kennedy pieces third one
I don't think it's inevitable and and
his was a false analogy secondly I would
support I support aid for the homeless
that of course we have money for the
homeless you've got a support you've got
to support it more vigorously everyone
else has to if we're going to do this as
a matter of public policy and firstly
that's just rubbish about Saddam Hussein
look he got himself up on the shoulders
of the Baath Party by be fought as an
assassin he was he never worked for us
he was a Soviet he was a Soviet agent
for a long time one presumes they got 17
billion dollars worth of
arms from the Soviet Union over a 12 12
14 year period they Saddam Hussein had a
treaty of friendship with the Soviet
Union very very briefly we tilted about
for about four months we tilted in the
iran-iraq war because we were afraid
Iran was going to win too big and we
gave Iraq some very modest help if you
want to consider a little bit of
military intelligence and a few export
privileges with 14 years and 17 billion
dollars worth of Soviet aid then you
know your numbers and your sense of
equivalents are really pretty much off
the United States and Iraq are quite
different in 1980 the United States and
Britain prevented the UN from blocking
the Iran the invasion of Iran Iran the
United States supported it after the we
continued to support Iraq all the way
through the invasion of Iran so did our
allies Germany France UK all of which
helped build up his huge military
capacities after the invasion of Iran
was over the United States continued to
give massive support to Iraq we became
the leading purchaser of Iraqi oil as I
mentioned we became Hebrews became one
of the major recipients of US credits
that's what gave him the wherewithal to
purchase from France Germany the Soviet
Union and elsewhere the military
capacity which in fact had not as much
as was claimed but significant next
question please
my question is to dr. Thompson and dr.
Chomsky but before I have been living
here in the United States for 16 years
and I noticed that so-called social
Darwinism is still alive that is to say
that the American people or most of them
think that they are better race other
people to exploit people other people
third world countries or fourth more
countries whatever you call them and the
United Scarman does that through such
concepts like human rights democracy and
other things
and in the history I'm from Turkey the
Ottoman Empire does that for five
centuries saying that they are fighting
infidels and they are fighting for the
sake of God and they exploited to Europe
and other parts of the world four five
six centuries and now my question is if
you come to me as an individual and you
want to exploit me peacefully and I say
no what other choices do you have what
if United States wants to exploit third
world countries natural resources and
they go peaceful and the nations say no
what can you do what do you see as a
solution
besides being such an aggressive nation
thank you I don't really get what your
question is what other options do United
States have to establish a new order
without using force exploiting world
extensively well by and large we haven't
you know we do use force from time to
time we just used it massively when was
the last time okay a very small
expedition in Panama it's not it was
effective it was effective you know it
it's not as if we use force that off and
it's too often for professor Chomsky
it's not often enough for some people in
the last ten years 20 years it's been
about right for me
I don't want to change it I think that I
mean I'd like to eliminate it but I have
a sense of reality of how the world
works and there are a lot of bugs in the
world a lot of bullies and we're going
to have to spend some money keeping them
down if they keep trying to invade
countries but but I I what I heard you
say though it was much more interesting
your analogy with the Ottoman Empire and
I do and I realize that we do exactly
the same thing we have our metaphors of
bringing our commitments to to lesser
peoples and the results are you know
always the same
if we don't understand what we're doing
I mean we know that United States is not
really poor gonna have to I'm sorry in
the interest of town I'm gonna have to
agree that there are lots of thugs and
bullies in the world and a lot of them
are well within our reach couple hundred
two hundred miles from here and the
solution to the problems is for things
to happen among the American population
which will constrain the thugs and boys
thank you next question please
my question is addressed first to dr.
Thompson and then to dr. Tomsky my
question is dr. Thompson do you feel
that the management of American public
opinion is becoming more or less
difficult in the age that were coming
into and what I have in mind
specifically is say a sort of event like
Grenada perhaps shortly after the the
catastrophe in Lebanon are catastrophe
that is do you find that that management
of public opinion is becoming more
difficult or less difficult well in the
first place I'm not aware of any attempt
at management of public opinion
I'm sorry just-just-just I think a
skepticism no management management and
the attempt to influence I think are
quite different things if you knew if
you knew how meager were the resources
of the public affairs bureaus of the
State Department and of the United
States Information Agency where I served
for several years you'd have a more
modest attitude towards this the the we
put out a few pamphlets we're not in my
organization we weren't even allowed to
disseminate information domestically can
only go internationally and so the
domestic stuff had to all be done by the
State Department and they were
incompetent Chomsky and I would agree on
something for once the the I just don't
know what it is people are referring to
about about that I I was very much and
I'll give you an example I was very much
involved in the grenada thing but I
remember being involved in the
shoot-down of the oo7 by the Soviet
Union and we had a very big debate on
public opinion on it and what should be
there what should be the response by the
Reagan administration and I had been
told by an elder statesman that that the
real really influential jobs in America
we're going to be in the future the
precise opposite of what you people were
giggling about this is a highly informed
suggestion that that the influential
jobs were going to be in public affairs
so you could listen to what people were
saying and input back from public
opinion into the Secretary of State's
office that kind of influence and that
was where power was going to be in other
words not you giggling but you having
influenced by telling people in
Washington what it is you believed in
and what you supported and that's where
power would be and the guys that could
transmit that would be the powerful
people well we can we did convince
President Reagan not to do some of the
things he had contemplated doing in
consequence of the Soviet shoot down on
the Korean airliner the way we did it
actually was we went
mrs. Reagan and work through her view of
her husband's role as a peacemaker in
history and we got through them on on
that road but public opinion give me an
example of where it's being managed yeah
there's a long and again a long
scholarly record on management of public
opinion by the government the first
relevant major case is the Woodrow
Wilson administration which established
a creel Commission the first state
propaganda Commission as in an effort to
drive a very pessimistic public into a
supporting the u.s. involvement in the
First World War and within six months it
had turned a pacifist population into a
raging hysterical auntie German
population and that lesson was learned
by the public relations industry and by
governments and it's been intensified
since then in fact it's a large part of
the political science literature which
is devoted to exactly how to do this as
called manufacturing consent or
engineering consent the Reagan
administration took new leaps forward in
this it established an office of public
diplomacy which was a huge propaganda
operation it was illegal as Congress
later determined and when it was
revealed and conceded to be illegal one
of the high officials involved in it
described their operations as the kind
of operations you carry out in enemy
territory which gives you an indication
of how they regard the population now
klo 7 was a perfect example there was a
huge propaganda operation that went in
the into action there it it was an
enormous huge amount of falsification
there were lies about it and so on and
to see what it was like compare it with
another similar incident the u.s. shut
during the iran-iraq war the US carrier
Vincennes shot down a civilian Iranian
airliner in a in a commercial corridor
killing I think it was about 290 people
the response was quite different I mean
it was it was conceded to be an error
except in the u.s. Naval Academy during
we're the commander of a nearby vessel
David Carlson said that he watched in
disbelief as the Vincennes shot down an
obviously commercial airliner
according to Carlson command Carlson in
order to test their new Aegis high-tech
missile system the further result was
that that's not me that's commander
Carlson in the u.s. Naval Academy
Journal the the next step was that the
commander of the Vinson and the air of
the man in charge of fire control both
received the Legion of Merit for their
their extraordinary service during this
period and this is the only act they
carried out now look at the way that the
look at the response to that case as
compared with the klo seven case well
that shows you how a good propaganda
system works and there's example if you
want examples of this I have two Reese's
I have two Reese I have two recent books
which go through it in some detail one
called manufacturing consent and other
necessary allusions in manufacturing
consent my co-author and I in one part
run through just the Air Force
propaganda agencies just listing them
and they dwarf anything available - that
alone Dwarfs anything that you might
find in any of the dissident movements
in the United States and that's a small
piece of it anybody else
and if it was massive the handful of
people we struggle to borrow from one
agency or the other well I mean it
wasn't massive as compared say to the
effort to demonize the Sandinistas which
was the main concern of the office of
public diplomacy and what they were
finally declared illegal on that was
really massive this was a small
operation but remember there was only
one moment there in that one moment they
succeeded in with a long series of
fabrications and lies and charges it
succeeded to the point here's one
indication of the success the New York
time take a look at
ever looked in the New York Times index
not the times but the times index you
know densely printed and I got correctly
read it with a magnifying glass at my
age at least in the first month in
September alone it was number first that
first month seven full pages if I recall
of the times index are devoted to that
incident I mean that's I doubt if
there's a case and it and the response
was total outrage
quoting statements by the administration
you know about is the worst terrorist
act in history and on and on like this
that's a successful management of public
opinion it's true the government doesn't
do it alone the media joined in and
Susie aspect Lee as a state propaganda
agency which is primarily what they are
but there's plenty of government
influence
all right we have very limited time left
I again I would urge everyone asked a
question as quickly as possible and I
guess we should ask for his brief answer
as possible go ahead thank you
I was curious earlier when I was sitting
in the audience I was a little bit
disturbed by when dr. Thompson was
raising earlier about an article
apparently there was in today's paper
which I haven't seen so I'm responding
basically on what you said about
apparently there was some something said
about the retreating army the Iraqi
retreating army well there was some
mistake was made basically and people
were blown away as they were retreated
and that was sort of a concession on
ya'all patas are wrong what I'm curious
about and with dr. Chomsky in particular
is I think in linguistics my
understanding is having been a form of
veteran myself that when you have a
retreating enemy and basically people
have surrendered in her on their way out
and defeated that to shoot them is a war
crime and I'm wondering whether we're
getting into war crimes they're only
determined a war crimes only committed
by the losers on the matter you're right
I mean the Geneva Conventions are very
explicit that if an enemy is or to come
back you know if an enemy is not
fighting but the you know there are
ambiguous questions about that but on
the issue of war crimes it's an
interesting case question it would be
nice just as would be nice if the US
would support human rights and democracy
or any other country would we're not
different than anyone else in this
respect it would be nice if there was a
serious and honest notion of war crime
but unfortunately there isn't it's
exactly as you said war crimes are
invariably Victor's justice if you look
at the you look at take the Tokyo and
Nuremberg tribunals which sort of
established the modern war crimes
tribunals they were scandalous I mean
the people who were condemned deserve to
be condemned
not in that way that the Tokyo tribunal
was so scandalous that the one
independent Asian justice the one
justice who had any experience in
international law Rhoda dissented from
the whole things that it was just a
farce Rhoda long and very interesting
600-page dissent it's just the mollis
that I'm just give you in one case one
gender Japanese general general
Yamashita was can was hang because of
atrocities carried out by troops
technically under his command but with
whom he had lost any contact whatsoever
after the American conquest of the
Philippines in the case of the Nuremberg
trials if you look at the way in which
war crime was defined a war crime was
defined as some criminal act that the
Germans carried out that they couldn't
show the Americans or British had also
carried out so it was considered a
legitimate defense at Nuremberg to bring
on an American you know submarine
commander or something who would say
well I did the same thing you were
charged with and that was considered
okay here you're free well in other
words a war crime is a crime that the
enemy carries out and you can't you
can't show that we carried out dr.
Thompson any comment okay all right next
question please
dr. Thompson your your thesis is that
the United States is usually on the side
of democratically elected governments
I'd like to go back to the middle of the
century were three democratically
elected governments were overthrown with
us covert help Amala Chile Iran and ask
you whether you feel these were simply
momentary operations on the part of the
US government oh they're definitely we
definitely have aberrations without
going into the specifics I think the the
case of the three cases the Iranian one
is the most questionable that you
brought up and I would also say
a friend of mine a colleague of mine
Tony Smith writing a book about us
commitment to democracy you know we go
in spurts about it and we get revved up
about it
generationally and and then we backslide
in between it's hard to keep a any all
of you that have been in government know
that it's very hard to keep up a
commitment to principles in government
you you it's easy to inertia just to
lean back and do business as usual to do
something different to make make a
difference is is tough and that's why I
hope someday professor Chomsky has a
chance to run a government and Chomsky
you want to announce your candidacy but
I run a protest against me but the
that's as an old anarchist I'm speaking
though the on the question of democracy
you can't answer the question whether
the United States is for it or against
it it's a meaningless question you first
have to ask what you mean by democracy
if you mean by democracy business run
rule or rule by elements in a domestic
population which will be supportive the
US interests then yes we're in favor of
democracy if democracy's a fine
democracy that doesn't meet those
conditions will be against and that's
very consistent there's very little
deviation from that that I'm aware of
next question I want to ask how do you
think that a Muslim world will relate to
the New World Order after all all what
happened was predominantly in the
birthplace of Islam and probably
everybody has seen demonstrations on the
TV and other places I want to comment
from both well there's not one Muslim
world as you know very well in from if
you from Morocco to Indonesia there was
overwhelming popular opposition to the
war there was also opposition of the
aggression but there was also opposition
to the war and
respect the Iraqi Democratic opposition
was quite characteristic they were
opposed to Saddam Hussein also opposed
to the war there were huge protests in
Morocco Indonesia at the other end was
unable ever to condemn the war because
the the to support the u.s. because of
the opposition in Pakistan although the
gut the government was really caught
they tried to give some sort of nominal
support to the US UK it was just two
countries really US UK operation but the
population arose in huge protests
probably about 80% of them opposed it at
the back off on the other hand there was
also support for the war today you'll
read in the front page of The Times any
newspaper about the great the meeting of
the Arab allies of the United States
eight Arab allies you take a look at the
eight Arab allies and six of them are
family dictatorships families basically
that we're set up as what Lord Curzon
once called an Arab facade to manage
Gulf oil wealth for the British and the
Americans that's that's six of the eight
the seventh of the eight is a murderous
tyrant who's indistinguishable from
Saddam Hussein Hafez al-assad and the
8th of the aid is the only one that
deserves to be called the country that's
Egypt with a basket-case economy that
received tens of billions of dollars of
aid to try to keep it in line and that
was so afraid of its own population they
kept schools closed and didn't even
allow sporting events through most of
the period well you know the Arab world
is split like most worlds all right next
question quickly please yeah I don't
remember hearing about us giving a lot
of a to Egypt as much as I heard that we
essentially forgave debts that they
already owed us yeah and and they get
3.3 billion a year from us too
baby I didn't know that about 14 billion
dollars Wow all right yeah I all right
very quickly because I want to ask a
question Iran hostage situation 19 1979
know we all disliked the Iranians a lot
for that and forgive me I but I have to
ask you to ask your questions yeah yeah
why did we support the Shah of Iran and
what was person in supporting okay this
one I can predict I might say it
differently but we have the same view
but but I think professor Chomsky just
said in this case would be accurate
about our business interests the oil and
the strategic importance of the country
okay we gotta go yeah they have to go
you have a very quick question Susan all
right very quick no we don't want to
comment desta question it's a question
we spoke earlier about South Africa and
I wanted to know do you believe that we
would have sent US troops black and
white into support the South African
government in that's the system of
apartheid and asking our black troops to
live under separate conditions and
harsher conditions as we have asked the
female troops to do in Saudi Arabia all
right the final question a tough one
I had dinner last week with the with
Ambassador Perkins who was our first
black ambassador in South Africa and I
hope that's as symbolic of what we would
have done at other levels if it had got
to armed conflict we sent him into a
country that did not have a place for
him to live in appropriate place for him
to live you do not treat the ambassador
of the United States of America the
number one world power that way they had
to change their entire upper level
housing policy because the United States
sent a black diplomat that was our point
I'm sure you know if troops have gone in
no of course they wouldn't have been
segregated that's absurd well I it's a
little hard to answer the question
because you're asking would we have sent
troops in to support South Africa we
didn't and why white under what
conditions would we've sent troops into
sport South Africa south every was doing
fine and repressing its own population
they didn't need to add my assumption
was that the troops were in - to oppose
a party I assume that's what you meant
well we wouldn't have sent troops to
oppose a party if South Africa had been
invaded I suppose okay well I both our
gentlemen have pressing time commitments
both our panels but we do want to thank
them very much for taking the time to
come up here
