well no it's wonderful to be together
with you again in order to ensure that
the audience stays to the end do you
think we should save that to what we
practice for the end of area okay we'll
do that we're going to get to the book
and I think it's intimately related to
so much of what's happening in this
country in the world today but I wanted
to ask you about this comment that you
made that the Republican Party you said
is the most dangerous organization in
world history
can you explain I also said that it's a
extremely outrageous statement but the
question is whether it's true
I mean has there ever been an
organization in human history that is
dedicated with such commitment to the
destruction of organized human life on
earth not that I'm aware of is the
Republican organization I hesitate to
call it a party committed to that
overwhelmingly this isn't even any
question about it take a look at the
last primary campaign plenty of
publicity a very little comment on the
most significant fact every single
candidate either denied that what is
happening is happening namely serious
move towards environmental catastrophe
or there were a couple of moderates
so-called Jeb Bush who said maybe it's
happening we really don't know but it
doesn't matter because fracking is
working fine so we can get more fossil
fuels then there was the guy who was
called the adult in the room John Kasich
the one person who said yes it's true
global warming's going on but it doesn't
matter he's the governor of
in Ohio we're going to go on using coal
for energy and we're not going to
apologize for it so that's a hundred
percent commitment to racing towards
disaster then take a look at what's
happened since the November 8th was the
election there was as most of you know
I'm sure very important conference
underway in Morocco Marrakech Morocco
almost roughly 200 countries at the
United Nations sponsored conference
which was the goal of which was to put
some specific commitments into the
verbal agreements that were reached at
Paris in December 2015 the preceding
international conference on global
warming the Paris conference did intend
to reach a verifiable treaty but they
couldn't because of the most dangerous
organisation in human history the
Republican Congress would not accept any
commitments so therefore the world was
left with verbal promises but no
commitments well last November each they
were going to try to carry that forward
on November 8th in fact there was a
report by the World Meteorological
Organization very dire analysis of the
state of the environment and the likely
prospects also pointed out that we're
coming perilously close to the tipping
point where which was the goal of the
goal of the Paris negotiations was to
keep things below that coming very close
to it and other ominous predictions at
that point the conference pretty much
stopped because the news came in about
the election and it turns out that the
most powerful country in human history
the richest most
powerful most influential the leader of
the free world has just decided not only
not to support the efforts but actively
to undermine them so there's the whole
world on one side literally at least
trying to do something or other
not enough maybe although some places
are going pretty far like Denmark a
couple of others on the other side in
splendid isolation is the country led by
the most dangerous organisation in human
history which is saying we're not part
of this in fact we're going to try to
undermine it and we're going to maximize
the use of fossil fuels could carry us
past a tipping point
we're not going to provide funding for
as commited in Paris to developing
countries that are trying to do
something about the climate problems
we're going to dismantle regulations
that retard the impact the devastating
impact of production of carbon dioxide
and in fact other dangerous gases
methane and others okay so the
conference kind of pretty much came to a
halt of the question it continued but
the question was can we salvage
something from this wreckage and pretty
amazingly the countries of the world
were looking for salvation to a
different country China here we have a
world looking for salvation to China of
all places when the United States is the
wrecking machine that's threatening
destruction in with all three branches
of government in the hands of the most
dangerous organization in human history
and I don't have to go through what's
happened since but the in general the
cabinet appointments are designed to
assign to people whose commitment and
beliefs are that it's necessary to
destroy everything in their department
that could be of any use to human beings
and wouldn't just increase profits and
power and they're doing it very
systematically one after another
EPA Environmental Protection Agency has
been very sharply cut actually the main
department that's concerned with
environmental issues is the Department
of Energy which also had very sharp cuts
particularly in the environment related
programs in fact there's even a ban on
posting and publishing information and
material about this and this is not just
at the national level of the Republican
Party whatever you want to call it has
been doing this at every level so in
North Carolina a couple of years ago
where the legislature mostly thanks the
gerrymandering is in the hands the
Republicans there was a study they
called for a study on the effect of
sea-level rise on what sea-level rise
might be on the North Carolina coast and
there was a serious scientific study
which predicted not will forget how many
years not a long time about roughly a
meter rise in sea level which could be
devastating to Eastern North Carolina
and the legislature did react namely by
passing legislation to ban any actions
or even discussion that might have to do
with climate change actually the best
comment of this wish I could quoted
verbatim was by Stephen Colbert who said
if you have a serious problem the way to
deal with it is to legislate that it
doesn't exist problem solved you know
this is this is going on all over the
country and it's not just a it's not
simply climate change that's bad enough
but there's a another huge specter that
we're kind of trying to survive under
and that's nuclear war and it's a whole
other story here both the Obama
administration and increasingly Trump
are radically increasing that danger
this the threat of the particular of of
the new developments is captured very
effectively in the best simple monitor
of the state of the world established at
the beginning of the nuclear age by The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists I'm sure
you all know about this but the bulletin
of Atomic Scientists regularly brings
together a group of scientists political
analysts others very serious people to
try to give some kind of estimate of
what the situation of the world is the
question is how close are we to
termination of the species and they have
a clock the Doomsday Clock when it hits
midnight we're finished end of the human
species and much else and the question
every year is how far is the minute-hand
for midnight well in at the beginning in
1947 the beginning of the nuclear age it
was placed at 7 minutes to midnight it's
been moving up and back ever since the
closest it's come to midnight was 1953
1953 the United States and Russia both
exploded hydrogen bombs which are
extremely serious threat to survival
intercontinental ballistic missiles were
all being developed this in fact was the
first serious threat to the security of
the United States that
interesting story behind that but I'll
put it aside
unless there's time to talk about it but
then it came to two minutes to midnight
and it's been moving up and back since
two years ago 2014 I think it was the
analysts took into account for the first
time something that had been ignored the
fact that the nuclear age the beginning
of the nuclear age coincided with the
beginning of a new geological epoch the
so-called Anthropocene has been some
debate about the epoch in which human
activity is drastically affecting the
general environment there's been debate
about its inception but the world
geological organization has recently
determined that it's about the same time
as the beginning of the nuclear age so
we're in these two eras in which the
possibility of human survival is very
much at stake and with us everything
else - of course living all living most
living things which are already under
very severe threat well a couple years
ago I think was 2014 The Bulletin began
to take that into account and move the
minute hand up to three minutes to
midnight where it remained last year a
couple of - about a week into Trump's
term the clock was moved again to two
and a half minutes to midnight that's
the closest it's been since 1953 and
that means extermination of the species
is very much in very much an open
question I don't want to say it's solely
the impact of the Republican Party
obviously that's false but they
certainly are in the lead in openly
advocating and working for
destruction of the human species I agree
that's a very outrageous statement so I
therefore simply suggest that you take a
look at the facts and see if it has any
merit or if it just should be bitterly
condemned that's up to you
my view of the facts are pretty clear at
this point as president Trump nears his
100th day North Korea and Iran have been
a major focus are you concerned that
with the president at the lowest
popularity rating I think in any
presidents history at this point that he
will focus abroad as he has in the last
few weeks dropping the Moab the mother
of all bombs and Afghanistan bombing the
Syrian government and yet focusing
specifically on North Korean Iran and
North Korea McMaster general McMaster
the National Security Advisor saying
tensions with North Korea are coming to
a head do you think there is a
possibility that the US would attack
North Korea I mean the this
administration is extremely
unpredictable Trump probably has no idea
what he's going to do five minutes from
now so you can't literally so you can't
really make predictions with much
confidence but I doubt it very much the
reason is very simple an attack on North
Korea would unleash no matter what
attack it is even a nuclear attack would
unleash massive artillery bombardment of
sold which is biggest city in South
Korea right near the border which would
wipe it out including plenty of American
troops would that doesn't as far I mean
I know technical expert but as far as I
can as I read and concede there's no
defense against that furthermore North
Korea could retaliate
against American bases in the region
with there's plenty of American soldiers
and so on also in Japan they'd be
devastated North Korea would be finished
you know so would much of the region but
they but if attacked presumably they
would respond very likely in fact the
responses might be automatic McMaster at
least and mattis understand this how
much influence they have we don't know
so I think an attack is unlikely but the
real question is is there waivers of
dealing with the problem there are a lot
of proposals sanctions big a new missile
defense system which is a major threat
to China will increase tensions there
military threats of various kinds
sending an aircraft carrier the Vinson
to North Korea except by accident it
happened to be going in the opposite
direction but will forget that but these
are those are the proposals that kind of
proposals is how to solve it actually
there's one proposal that's ignored I
mean you see a mention of it now and
then it's pretty simple proposal
remember the goal is to get North Korea
to freeze its weapon systems weapons and
missile systems so one proposal is to
accept their offer to do that sounds
simple they've made a proposal China and
North Korea proposed to freeze the North
Korean missile and nuclear weapons
systems and the us instantly rejected it
and you can't blame that on Trump Obama
did the same thing a couple of years ago
same offer was presented I think was
2015 the Obama administration instantly
rejected it and the reason is that it
calls for a quid pro quo it says in
return the United States should put an
end to threatening military maneuvers on
North Korea
borders which happened to include under
Trump sending of nuclear capable b-52s
flying right near the border
maybe Americans don't remember very well
but North Koreans have a memory of not
too long ago when North Korea was
absolutely flattened literally by
American bombing that was pregnant there
was literally no targets left and I
really urge people who haven't done it
to read the official American military
histories the air quarterly review the
military histories describing this what
they describe it very vividly and
accurately they say there just weren't
any targets left so what do we do well
we decided to attack the bomb they dams
the huge dams a major war crime people
were hanged for it a number but put that
aside and then comes an ecstatic gleeful
description of the bombing of the dams
and the huge flow of water which was
wiping out valleys and destroying the
rice crop on which Asians depend for
survival lots of racist common but all
with exultation and Glee you really have
to read it to appreciate it
the North Koreans don't have to bother
reading it they lived it
so when nuclear capable b-52s are flying
on their border along with other
threatening military maneuvers they're
kind of upset about it strange people
and they continue to develop what they
see as a potential deterrent that might
protect the regime from on the contrary
in fact from destruction
this has nothing at all to do with what
you think about the government so maybe
it's the worst government in human
history okay but these are still the
facts that exist so why is the United
States unwilling to
an agreement which would end the
immediate threats of destruction against
North Korea and in return freeze the
weapons and missile systems well I leave
that to you and remember that's
bipartisan in this case could could
negotiations go the usual argument as
well you can't trust them and so on and
so forth but there is a history and I
the time to run through the history it's
quite interesting begins in 1993 when
Clinton under Clinton the North Koreans
made a deal with Israel to terminate
North Korean missile shipments to the
Middle East which is great a serious
threat to Israel in the world and in
return Israel would recognize North
Korea the Clinton administration
wouldn't accept that they pressured
Israel which has to do what they're told
to withdraw from it and North Korea
responded by ascending by firing their
first intermediate-range missiles I
won't go on with the rest it's a very
interesting story
but there was actually an agreement in
2005 that North Korea would completely
dismantle its nuclear weapons and
missile systems and the finish
dismantled them in return for a
non-aggression pact from the United
States an end to threats provision but
by the West that means by the United
States of a a light water reactor which
can't produce nuclear weapons but could
produce be used for peaceful purposes
research medical other purposes and that
was basically the agreement 2005 didn't
last very long the Bush administration
instantly undermined it it dismantled
the consortium that was supposed to
provide the reactor and it immediately
imposed
pressured and it when the US pressures
it means it happens banks to block North
Korean financial transactions including
perfectly legitimate trade so the crazy
North Korean started producing missiles
and nuclear weapons again and that's
been the kind of record all the way
through so yeah maybe the most horrible
regime in human history but the fact of
the matter is the regime does want to
survive and it even wants to carry out
economic development there's pretty
general agreement about this which it
cannot do at any significant way when
it's pouring resources very scarce
resources into weapons and missile
production so they have considerable
incentive including survival
- perhaps continue this process of
reacting in a kind of tit-for-tat
fashion to US actions when the u.s.
lowers tensions they do when we raise
tensions they go on with these plans how
about that as a possibility I mean it is
if you look at the press casually
mentioned that it was not a bad article
in The Washington Post about it recently
by US professor teachers in South Korea
so occasionally it's this strange
possibility of letting the North Koreans
do exactly what we want them to do
sometimes this is mentioned but it's
pretty much dismissed we can't do that
sort of thing there are similar
questions to raised about Iran so Iran
is you know the again the adults in the
room like mattis and so on say it's the
greatest threat to peace you know the
greatest sponsor of terrorism on and on
how is it a sponsor of terrorism we'll
go through that so for example in Yemen
that's claimed that they are providing
some aid to rebel tribesmen hooda
tribesmen in Yemen okay maybe they are
what is the United States doing in Yemen
it's providing a huge flood of arms to
its Saudi Arabian ally who are
destroying the country who have created
a huge humanitarian crisis huge numbers
of people killed massive starvation the
threatening out the Obama port which is
the only source of aid for surviving
people but Iran is the major source of
terrorism and if you look around the
world there's many questions like this I
don't want to go on too long but very
strikingly and this there's one lesson
that you discover when you carefully
look at the historical record and what I
just described about North Korea is
pretty typical over and over again there
are possibilities of diplomacy and
negotiation which might not succeed
can't be sure if you don't try them but
which look pretty promising which are
abandoned dismissed literally without
comment in favor of increased force and
violence in fact that's also the
background for the 1953 moment when the
clock moved to two minutes to midnight
and the u.s. faced the first serious
threat to its security that in fact you
know since probably the war of 1812
could have been avoided there's pretty
good evidence that it could have been
avoided but it was the possibility was
literally not even considered and case
after cases like this it's worth looking
at the historical record from that
perspective to ask whether that general
comment has some validity I think if you
do you'll find that it has considerable
merit I last interviewed you on April
4th
just a few weeks ago on Democracy Now it
was the 50th anniversary of dr. King
giving his beyond Vietnam speech why he
opposed the war in Vietnam where he
called the u.s. the greatest purveyor of
violence in the world and I wanted to
turn from North Korean Iran to Syria it
was the day of the gas attack in Syria
so he didn't get to talk about it very
much and I'm wondering your thoughts on
what you think happened
and then the ensuing u.s. bombing that
President Trump would later talk about
saying he was having chocolate cake with
the Chinese President very very good
chocolate cake and when they launched
the Tomahawk missiles into Iraq he said
and he was corrected by the interviewer
right who said it was actually sentry
ragheads
saw about the same but well there are
some things we know for sure there was a
serious chemical weapons attack nobody
doubts that it's plausible that it was
the Syrian government which does raise
some questions it's not so obvious why
the Assad regime would have carried out
a chemical warfare attack at a moment
when it's pretty much winning the war
and the worst dangerous phases is that a
counter force will enter to undermine
its progress so it does raise some
questions it also even though maybe the
you can think of some reason why the
Assad regime which is a murderous brutal
regime might have done it it's eat
there's even another question as to why
the Russians would have allowed it
remember this is a the airbase as a
joint Russian Syrian base Russia has
plenty of clout in Syria and for them
it's a total disaster they have global
concerns not just local concerns in
Syria so there are some concerns and
there are further concern
other husband the White House did put
out a careful analogous case in an
intelligence report to explain an
account showing why they had absolute
confidence there was Syrian government
attack this was analyzed closely by a
very serious and credible analyst
Theodore postal president MIT who has a
long record of highly-successful
credible analysis as a highly regarded
strategic analyst and intelligence
analyst and he gave a pretty devastating
critique of the White House report you
might you can pick it up online and take
a look at it so there certainly are some
questions that there's that Syria is
capable of a monstrous act like that the
Syrian government that much is not in
doubt but one question that arises is
before doing something could you find
out what happened okay I mean let's have
an inquiry take a look and see what in
fact actually happened there are plenty
of cases where things where look that
thing as though things happen but they
didn't and remember that report
reporting from Syria is extremely
difficult if reporters go into the
rebel-held areas and don't do what
they're told can get your head cut off
Patrick Coburn and others have written
about this just can't seriously report
from those areas there are obvious
questions when you're reporting from the
government side so the reporters are
there are very good reporters doing a
serious courageous job but there's not
much you can do so we just don't know a
lot well those are the circumstances in
which the 59 Tomahawk missiles were
launched that's pretty easy it's easy to
sit in Washington and push a button and
say go kill somebody
that's considered courage you know men
macho showing how strong we are what did
they actually do well apparently the
Tomahawk missiles were targeting a part
of the airfield that doesn't seem to be
used and in fact the next day that
planes were taking off and affect the
village that was attacked by the
chemical weapons has been even more
heavily attacked by straight bombing
from the Assad government after the 59
Tomahawk missiles so whatever they were
intended to do it doesn't seem to have
anything to do with Syria I suspect that
what they were intended to do was pretty
much what you described to shore up
Trump's image as I think was nikki Haley
at the UN said there's a new sheriff in
town so now we've got Wyatt Earp
you know I'm pulling out his gun and
getting rid of the bad guys but no more
of the soft stuff so it was probably an
attempt to shore up that image pretty
much like the bomb in Afghanistan nobody
knows what it was for or what it had to
do with probably destroy a large part of
Afghanistan shortly after that there was
a massive incredibly brutal and
successful Taliban attack which killed a
couple hundred recruits most of them
unarmed the young draftees didn't know
what they were doing they was so bad
that defense minister resigned doesn't
seem to have any effect on who
supposedly aimed at Isis maybe it was
maybe it wasn't they don't seem to be
affected by it so these look like that
doesn't seem to be any strategic
analysis behind any of these actions as
far as anyone can tell they seem like
kind of about at the level of the
twitters that keep coming out and
something that kind of occurs to me so
why not do it it's cheap may kill a lot
of people makes me look good you know
makes it seem as if I'm defending the
country so on
it's hard to see it as anything but that
that these things help the people of
Syria and Iraq is very hard to imagine
what do you think has to be done to
solve the crisis the humanitarian
catastrophe in Syria
it's a terrible catastrophe and you know
unfortunately there isn't a lot that can
be done about it there are some things
that can be done I mean the idea that
you can send in the Marines and bomb and
so on that has a small problem if you do
you probably set off a nuclear war and
not only a Syria destroy the rest of
Syria but the rest of the world too so
there's a little difficulty in that
scenario whatever one thinks about the
justification for it so what can be done
well one thing that can be done which is
really easy very easy is to take care of
the people fleeing from this disaster
there are huge numbers of people fleeing
from the disaster what do we do about
them make sure they don't come here you
know kind of like people fleeing from my
relatives in fact fleeing trying to flee
from Eastern Europe and under the nots
before when the Nazis were coming along
not we don't want to not here you know
so the Syrians don't come maybe a tiny
trickle but very few come here Europe's
not that much better in fact pretty
horrible too so one thing you could do
is just take care of the people who are
fleeing the disaster another thing you
can do is provide humanitarian aid for
those in the region there are countries
who are absorbing refugees remember like
take Lebanon it's not a rich country
like us poor country about 40 percent of
the population are refugees that many of
them fleeing from the Israeli wars as
far back as 48 and many a huge number of
Syrians Jordan another poor countries
absorbed
huge number of refugees that Turkey has
a couple of million Iran has accepted
refugees so there are very there are
poor countries that are accommodating
refugees but not the rich countries the
rich countries it's not our business
certainly not us it's even more serious
problem with regard from wither for us
moral problem with regard to Central
America but let's keep the Syrian so
another thing you do is provide badly
needed aid and assistance for those who
have succeeded in fleeing the disaster
or who remain in parts of Syria where
survival is possible
but are living under horrible conditions
that's all cheap and easy frack tiny
fraction of increasing the military
budget to cause more destruction the
other thing that can be done and is
being done is to try to support local
efforts throughout Syria at local
ceasefires just to lower the level of
violence that's happening in different
places maybe the people don't like each
other but people sometimes like to
survive and there are accommodations
worked out and they could be helped a
broader possibility is to try to pursue
the negotiations that will lead to some
kind of diplomatic settlement now there
have been efforts but there they're
mixed and there probably can't be
certain but there seemed to be
possibilities that were meant but
dismissed so for example in 2012 there
were reports from former Finnish
minister octa sari has a very credible
record of involvement in international
peacekeeping who claimed that the one of
the Republic that our Russian diplomat
had proposed a settlement in which Assad
would be eased out in the course of the
new
she asians and some settlement would be
reached in which the assad regime would
be ended that was apparently dismissed
without comment the US and Britain and
France just assumed at that point that
they could overthrow the Assad regime
they didn't want have anything to do
with it that's the report the report
appeared in England as far as I know it
was never in reported here by good
reporters is it true who knows got to
look into it to find out a whether it's
true you have to inquire you have to
pursue the options if they exist and
they weren't but there are things that
could be done not what we would like to
see you know it'd be nice to see here
solutions will make everybody happy and
in the destruction but those just don't
seem on the on the possible agenda
because for all kind of reasons
including the threat of very serious war
if Russia and the United States don't
act in a high level of concert in in
pursuing whatever they may be doing no I
wanted to before we get to your book
your latest book ask you about this
latest development in the United States
the director of the Central Intelligence
Agency gave his first major address and
he focused on WikiLeaks and it looks
like now the u.s. is preparing an arrest
warrant for Julian Assange who's been
holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in
London for almost five years now
Pompeyo calling WikiLeaks a hostile
non-state intelligence service calling
Julian Assange himself a demon and said
he's not protected by the First
Amendment
your thoughts well I think speaks for
itself
WikiLeaks has released
lots of information that governments
don't like it's overwhelmingly
information that citizens should have
it's information about what their
governments are doing and perfectly
natural that systems of power don't want
to be exposed so they'll do what they
can to prevent exposure the I think it's
a disgraceful act in fact I think it's
disgraceful even to keep Julian Assange
holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy he's
I did visit him there once but you can
guess yourself it's in many ways worse
than imprisonment at least if you're in
prison you can see other prisoners and
you can get out and look at the sunshine
now and then he's in a small apartment
where you can't go out you know go to
the balcony but that's about it
the smaller particle couple of rooms
inside a small apartments not a big
embassy the embassy is like a kind of an
apartment in London surrounded by police
and so on
there's been no credible basis for any
of this and to go on to try to cara to
raise it to the level of the criminal
prosecutions i think is again one of
these efforts to look tough at home and
the kind of effort that a government
would carry out that is dedicated to
trying to protect itself from exposure
of facts that citizens should have but
systems of power don't want them to have
i think that's the crucial issue the
suggestions are it has to do with his
aiding and abetting perhaps chelsea
manning and also edward snowden doing
that with edward snowden which he openly
admits while he's trapped in the
Ecuadorian embassy if if the
charge is true he should be honored for
Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden or
carried out heroic courageous acts they
fulfilled the responsibilities of
somebody who takes citizenship seriously
that is who believes that the people of
a country or to know something about
what their governments up to okay like
if their government is carrying out
murderous brutal attacks in Iraq people
should know about it takes us back to
Martin Luther King's talk in 1967 if the
government is and corporations to
incidentally are listening into your
telephone conversations and what you're
doing you know tapping this discussion
so on we should know about it
governments have no right to do things
like that and people should know about
it and if they think it's okay fine let
them decide not do it in secret
I think people wouldn't agree to it
that's why it's kept secret why else
keep it secret you know and these are
people who exposed it at great risk to
themselves so those are heroic
courageous acts if WikiLeaks was
abetting them more power to them that's
what they should be doing I mean
President Trump endorsed WikiLeaks right
he said I love WikiLeaks to campaign
when it was releasing things that he
liked you know any system of power will
do that you release information that I
like it's great but I don't want to be
exposed
speaking of entities that President
Trump doesn't like he calls the press
the enemy of the American people the
enemy of the people can you assess as
the media assesses President Trump in
his first 100 days the media's behavior
well I think the media has fallen over
backwards to try to give him some
protection and leeway I mean you know
there are things that are so ludicrous
and outrageous that up
a reporter simply can't keep from saying
something about them like there's one
ridiculous claim after another that
comes out of the tweets you know three
million illegal undocumented refugees
voted for Clinton Obama the wiretapped
the Trump Tower you know one after
another
my sense is this is just a guess that
this is a media strategy that it's the
Bannen Trump
spicer strategy to try to keep attention
focused on the one or another form of
lunacy but not look at what's actually
happening at what's actually happening
is that Paul Ryan and his associates
behind the scenes are systematically and
carefully dismantling every element of
government that is of any benefit to
people and that doesn't maximize
corporate power and profit I mean the
dedication of the Republican leadership
especially the Ryan type leadership
their dedication to slavish servility to
corporate power and wealth is just
phenomenal I mean read this morning's
business pages their latest step is to
try to prevent exposure of complaints
against banks that carry out improper
activities it is possible now thanks to
consumer protection act for people to
criticize when they think a bank has
carried out some improper activity but
we got to keep that silent you know
because we have to protect corporations
from any exposure of criminal activities
that might carry out I mean down to that
level if everywhere you look
I mean the healthcare proposal is so
shocking that I was a proposal basically
to cut taxes for the rich and to ensure
that poor and middle class people people
voted for Trump in fact don't get
medical aid as you saw of course
Congressional Budget Office estimated
twenty four million additional people
uninsured it was an analysis of that by
Stephie wool handler David Hamel Stein
two health specialists just studying the
relationship between lack of insurance
and deaths there's plenty of evidence
about that and it turns out that would
have meant about the forty five thousand
in additional deaths a year but that's
okay as long as you cut taxes for the
rich and step-by-step that's what's
happening behind the facade of Trump
isms and you know speiser addicts before
the press and the press is pretty much
falling for it that's what they focus on
not what's being carried out there is of
course a criticism mild criticism of
outrageous lies but I think that just
plays the game that's what the lies are
for then you can yell about the liberal
press that is right under my nose so all
the kind of a desperate effort to keep a
con game going a Trump does have a base
voter base he's kicking them in the face
with abandon and the idea is how do you
hold on to them while you're doing this
not an easy trick and this I think is
part of the con and there are people in
the press who are pointing it out to
Paul Krugman for one but nothing like it
it should be which takes us to your
latest book requiem for the American
dream where you talk about the ten
principles of the concentration of power
and wealth how it's happening what to
watch out for
well credit for the ten principles those
should go to the producers of the film
what they did was take a lot of
interviews and discussions about all
sorts of things and put them in a
coherent and I think pretty effective
form including formulating ten
principles that's their contribution and
including material that discusses them
and you can look at the film and see or
the book but my feeling is they did a
really good job service book is
accompanying this film that is now out
on Netflix but you talk about for
example principle one reducing democracy
principle to shaping ideology and
principle three redesigning the economy
well all of those fall together and
they're part of a pretty remarkable
development that's taking place in
actually in human history humans in the
last 60 or 70 years have succeeded in
creating a kind of a perfect storm
literally - there's a kind of a pincers
movement that we've created two major
attacks on the prospects for survival
global global warming nuclear weapons of
the Anthropocene the nuclear age and the
third is a set of socio-economic
policies designed to undermine the
possibility of dealing with the problems
the problems could be dealt with only in
a functioning democracy of engaged
[Music]
informed people who could make decisions
it would be informed and could make
decisions to deal with the crisis but
the so called neoliberal programs
of the past generation a sort of
somewhat market oriented programs
designed to undermine the institution's
the governmental and popular
institutions that might deal with these
issues all a unit one result is a very
significant decline and democracy you
can see it in the its which is almost
built into the policies it's perfectly
built you can't carry out economic
policies of the type that have been
there that have been implemented in the
past generation in a functioning
democracy that's impossible let me just
take a look at the numbers so the
neoliberal programs were basically
taking off right around 1980 escalated
started little with the late corridor
escalated under Reagan went on more
under Clinton and so on 2007 was the
peak of supposed success this is right
before the crash a lot of euphoria among
economists political analysts about the
great achievements of neoclassical
economics of the Great Moderation the
you know the the deal liberal programs
dismantling of regulations all these
great successes 2007 what was happening
to American working people at that time
in 2007 wages real wages were lower than
they had been in 1979 when the
experiment took off in fact for the
majority of the population it's a period
of stagnation or decline the benefits
have declined people had been some of
the reasons were explained by Alan
Greenspan head of the Federal Reserve
who was charged pretty much of managing
the economy he testified to Congress
that part of the success of the
economy the low inflation so on was due
to what he called growing worker
insecurity people working people were
insecure they were intimidated they knew
they that they were in a dangerous
situation for Carrie situation as a
result they didn't press for increase in
wages invent for decent wages and
benefits they were willing to accept in
fact it effective decline in their
living standards and greenspan who was a
close observer of the economy pointed
out that this continued even when jobs
were increasing in the late clinton
period it was deeply embedded in the
nature of the policies being carried out
that working people are intimidated the
living precarious lives
many of them are part-time they're
losing security their unions are being
destroyed and their wages are declining
so it's all great the economy's
wonderfully healthy
can you carry out policies like that in
a democracy I'm going to people going to
vote for it salmon Europe even worse in
many ways the so-called austerity
programs even the economists of the
International the IMF International
Monetary Fund their own economists say
report that these policies make no
economic sense but the IMF bureaucrats
the ones who are part of the
decision-making apparatus they vote for
them how do you and the effect on Europe
is the same thing as far as democracy is
concerned just like in the United States
there's anger contempt for major
Institute for centrist for you know for
the major governing institutions here is
Congress there it's as the political
parties you just saw in France yesterday
the two major parties were barely
visible in the election and it's
happening all over Europe same kind of
thing that's happening here I mean here
it's happening in a way which is almost
far
because of the you know the kind of
actions carried out by the leadership in
Europe it's being it's being pursued in
a way which is really ominous I mean you
don't look for Auerbach to find a time
when fascist parties actually had power
in Europe and we know what happened and
now there are neo-fascist parties with
fascist roots often which are pretty
close to power even in places like
Austria and Germany which have some
memories of France as well was under the
Nazis was extreme very Pro Nazi country
the Vichy government was rounding up
Jews faster than the Germans one of them
really ugly record and seeing these
things come back or just seeing a
situation in which according to recent
polls a majority of Europeans think
there should be no more Muslims in
Europe I mean that evokes some memories
about nice ones and a lot of they can't
attributed all to the neoliberal
economic policies but a lot of it does
follow from that when you impose on
people circumstances of this kind you
have to make sure that they have no no
way of responding politically in Europe
it's done pretty straightforwardly the
main decisions about socio economic
policies are made by the so-called
troika IMF European Central Bank and the
European Commission which is unelected
so three unelected bodies they make the
decisions they do listen to voices the
voices of the northern banks mostly
German banks and the people suffer and
they get their angry frightened often
reacting in dangerous ways we see
similar phenomena here so to go back to
the pincers movement what's happened is
we've created two
huge threats to survival we have
systematically not you and me but the
leadership has systematically created
socio-economic policies which have as a
consequence almost immediate consequence
the undermining of functioning democracy
the one thing that might deal with the
disasters like I said it's kind of
perfect storm real credit to the human
species to have contrived something like
this principle four is shift the burden
onto the poor in the middle classes
principle five attacked the Solidarity
of the people six let's special
interests run the Euler regulators seven
engineer election results eight use fear
and power of the state to keep the
rabble in line is it necessary to
comment I think you're all familiar with
it nine is manufacture consent and
principle 10 is marginalize the
population in fact that's exactly what's
happening and it's the and there's a
reason for it you cannot carry out the
kinds of policies that have been
developed in the last generation and
have the population function
democratically in Europe you can't get
people to vote for policies which are
undermining their lives which are a
limit which are leaving especially the
younger people without any hopes of
decent employment which are driving
people to precarious existences which
are undermining wages reducing benefits
in England right now undermining
threatening what had been the world's
most by far the world's most effective
and efficient national health system you
can't get people to vote for things like
this so what you have to do is
marginalize them and when we're
rather turn them against each other aim
turn their anger against vulnerable
people that's standard technique get
people that don't look at the people who
are really doing this to you look at the
ones who are more vulnerable immigrants
the poor you know Muslims blacks anybody
we're familiar with that too there's not
a slight history about it so sure that
just it's like a it's like an almost
logical consequence of the
socio-economic policies which have been
imposed and lauded in fact by elites
including liberal elites a lot of this
was done but say by the Clinton
administration
it was held the deregulation for example
which immediate very quickly led to one
or after another financial crisis that
was initiated by liberal economists who
were telling us how wonderful it is and
there's actually a you know a theory on
the Oakland neoclassical economic theory
which says yeah it's fine actually there
were people who warned against it there
were people who knew a lot of left
independent economists
like Joseph Stiglitz Nobel laureate back
around 1995 or so that he wrote an
article actually in a World Bank
research journal in which he warned
against what he called the religion that
the market knows best
he says that's the religion as he put it
that's being followed by economists and
he says you got to take a look at that
religion like a lot of religions just
doesn't work the economic history and
even logic show us lots of things that
are wrong about it but that was pursued
with abandon on the basis of theories of
the efficient markets rational behavior
rational expectations and so on none of
which had any empirical basis our
founding but they were the the doctrines
were accepted for the very simple reason
that they were highly beneficial to
wealth and power that makes them
acceptable and you get the results that
you have the undermining of the only
means possible to try to deal with the
existential crises that we have created
so again it's a kind of perfect storm
part all sorts of sources including just
socio economic policies of a bipartisan
nature you talk about a perfect storm do
you think fascism is rising in the
United States I think there's a danger
of fascism in Europe but I don't think
that it's for one that you have to be a
little bit careful about that I mean if
you're a black kid in the ghetto yeah
you can say it kind of looks like
fascism but for most of the country most
of us Pete like people like us there
aren't stormtroopers in the streets
there's no fascist political party
there's no ideology of fascism the Trump
ideology reduces to pretty much
me you know that's not fascism whatever
you think it is so there's there are
serious dangers but but I think fascism
in a way gives it too much credit it
makes it look like more of a
well-formulated ideology than it
actually is I think what we're seeing
are the desperate efforts to try to hold
together rising disasters that for which
the means have been undermined in the
resistance from the women's protests
massively larger than president Trump's
inaugural crowd just the day after you
have to look at the tweet to the protest
just this week from the March for
science on Earth Day on Saturday - the
one that's coming up next Saturday April
29th another people's climate March the
March for science took place on every
continent in the world
the people's climate March promises to
be much larger does this give you hope
oh there's a lot of reasons for hope
first of all there is enormous
resistance the kind of thing that's
happened sometimes before like in the
early 80s when there was huge public
opposition enormous public opposition to
the dangerous increase in nuclear
weapons development and it had an effect
like I mentioned that the bulla of
atomic scientists couple years ago
Doomsday Clock went to three minutes to
midnight that's the closest it had been
since 1984 when there was a major war
threat with the increase in nuclear
weapons threats and it was significantly
attenuated by popular action and then of
course there was the activism of the 60s
and the 70s it didn't end in the 60s by
any means so some of the most effective
popular movements with the biggest
impact on the society
are really developed in the 70s like the
women's movement the environmental
movements and so on the seeds were in
the 60s but they weren't there yet they
were just barely beginning all of that
has really civilized the society had
lots of positive effects and it goes on
right to the present so the most I think
the most significant fact about the last
election it was not Trump's victory
which was very serious for the country
in the world but the astonishing success
of Bernie Sanders campaign it's worth
remembering that that broke with over a
hundred years of US political history
u.s. elections are pretty much bought
you can predict with remarkable
precision electoral outcomes by looking
at simple measures like campaign funding
there's very serious work on this the
main person many of you know is Tom
Ferguson political scientist at UMass
done really good work on this and it's
very impressive work you can almost
predict the outcome of an electoral
campaign president House Senate just by
looking at campaign funding and of
course that's a predictor of policy as
well and that's been well known you know
from way back among a people who run
campaigns and up by now the evidence is
overwhelming so what it Sanders do had
no corporate support no support from the
wealthy no support from the media which
mostly either dismissed or denigrated
him the unknown person nobody had ever
heard of him he was proposing what about
to New Deal policies by contemporary US
standards that's what he called with
some justice of political revolution
actually the policies he proposed it
wouldn't have surprised Dwight
Eisenhower
he favored similar policies by and large
in fact even said that anyone who
doesn't accept the New Deal programs
just doesn't belong in our political
system every strong supporter of unions
and so on we've come quite a ways since
then but Sanders was a voice going back
to the period when there was very rapid
growth the Galit aryan growth the
serious beginnings of an attack on some
of the deep crimes of the country that
go way back
like the racist crimes and others then
came the 60s the civilizing effect their
consequences then a regression the
regression of the last 30 40 years the
neoliberal programs and all their
consequences and then saying that
without but not ending activism by any
means was plenty of activism and central
market solidarity movements for example
which was quite effective but Sanders
broke with over a century of history
that's pretty serious and it's having an
effect Fox News informed us should thank
them for that they did a poll of
popularity of political figures how much
do you like various political figures
one person was way in the lead Bernie
Sanders far above anyone else they even
higher among young people those are
pretty serious achievements and there's
a lot to build on there and in fact out
of the Sanders popular movement there
are developments growing which I think
are quite constructive and are
coalescing and integrating with many
other things that are happening so there
plenty of grounds for hope but the we
are in an extremely dangerous situation
it's not as some of it let me know if
there's a little time just go on with
something that isn't reported and is
extremely serious
last January a couple of weeks into the
a week or so into the Trump term the
minute-hand was moved at two and a half
minutes to midnight but since then we
have learned things which I suspect
would lead the same group of analysts to
push it even closer to midnight what did
we learn not that you read about in the
press but what did you learn if you
looked at what's happening well there
was an extremely important article that
appeared in The Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists which is the main scientific
journal that deals with nuclear and
other strategic issues what it discussed
was the nuclear modernization programs
that were initiated by Obama and are
being carried forward and explore under
Trump and it pointed out it's a
technical article but basically what it
pointed out is that these modernization
programs had already increased the kill
capacity the destructive capacity of the
US nuclear weapon systems by a large
factor by maybe a factor of three enough
they said to completely wipe out the
Russian deterrent okay it's not that the
Russians don't know this Russia does not
have our sophisticated early warning
system satellite warning systems they're
much more primitive ones they don't get
much advanced warning of a alleged
attack there have been many close calls
in the past because of this well now
they're aware that the u.s.
modernization programs are able to
completely wipe out their deterrent
because we so expanded already our
destructive capacity by a huge factor
that would and as they point out in the
article this means that the system of
stability by which the world has been
kind of hanging by a thread a pretty
slender thread it's being seriously
threatened
means that in the event of some rising
tension there's plenty of tensions at
the Russian border not at the Mexican
border at the Russian border plenty of
them plenty of provocations they might
just out of desperation decide well we
better launch a preemptive strike or
were gone we don't have a deterrent
that's what's being developed it's
another great contribution of human
intelligence to develop means to make
our own destruction far more likely
that's what's been that's what we've
learned in the last couple months these
should be screaming headlines all over
the place just like the there should be
headlines about the Republican Party
trying to destroy the prospects for
organized human life that's what
journalism would be if it were concerned
with bringing to people the things that
are significant for people who live in a
democratic society who can make
decisions about how to deal with the
problems they face in their lives almost
nothing about it it's not a secret you
know it's not classified you can find
out about it it's free country in that
respect and important respect should
respect and honor that but these are the
things that are happening right now and
it means that the sledgehammers that
we've constructed in our brilliance to
threaten our survival are getting far
more dangerous while the political
mechanisms that might lead to a sensible
reaction are being destroyed and we see
the impact in the rise of
anger contempt for institutions
irrational reactions of kinds of things
at scapegoating you know things that are
pretty dangerous we've again constructed
a remarkable perfect storm well and we
have time for a few questions maybe five
or at the most six questions and if you
can keep them very brief actually is
coming to the mic to organize we have
more limited time than we thought so
we're going to take about one or two
questions if that's okay with everyone
thank you
hi um I was wondering as an aspiring
linguist do you believe that linguistics
can provide context to contemporary
political occurrences and if so how I
think
linguistics can make a great many
contributions but in another domain it
can help us understand the unique human
capacity that is the fundamental
property that separates us from the rest
of the animal world our ability to do
things like we're doing right now where
does that come from they were the only
animal that can do anything remotely
like this and it's the source of
creative activities if you look at the
evolutionary record the real outburst of
creative activity appears to be
associated with the emergence of
language and you can learn a lot about
these aspects of human nature and human
creativity and so on but as far as
analysis of the world political
situation is concerned and frankly I
don't think anything is required but
common sense and a little bit of work
common sense
open mind some work it's not hidden it's
all pretty much on the surface what we
understand is pretty much apparent to us
if we take the trouble to find out and I
don't think any specialized fields
whether it's linguistics or political
science or economics they can tell you
something but almost everything that's
happening of significance is pretty easy
to ascertain by a person who looks at
the world with an open critical mind and
is willing to search for things that are
not right in the front of you and that
are hidden on the sides but are
available and final question I
I actually was just wondering if you
felt that Abraham Lincoln was justified
in the suspension of habeas corpus
during the Civil War it's a it's not a
trivial question a lot was at stake but
my own feeling is that it was an act of
state that was not justified well no
thank you not only for this evening but
for your decades of commitment to
improving the human condition
[Applause]
[Music]
thank you everyone
[Music]
thank you all for coming once again the
signing line will form down this far oh
I'll to my right and wrap around the
back of the church so if you'd like to
join the signing line from the center
aisle or the aisle to my left you should
make your way toward the back of the
church thank you so much
