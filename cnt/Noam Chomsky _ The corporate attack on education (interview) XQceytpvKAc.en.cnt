welcome all NYU students and students
around the world
my name is Eddie rods of Alaska Deputy
opinion editor at Washington Square News
on behalf of wsn Thank You professor
Chomsky for doing this interview I also
want to extend a special thanks to the
Liberal Studies Program for their
support and to my fellow student
Alessandro Douglas for her collaboration
in the project and technical assistance
today despite the impending blizzard and
a cold professor Chomsky has generously
obliged to readjust the schedule for
this interview for which we are
incredibly indescribable feeling
grateful
before I begin with the questions I just
want to note for the viewers that
Professor Chomsky is the eighth most
cited scholar of all time joining the
ranks of Plato Aristotle Shakespeare and
Freud so on to my first question and
this is a topic that specifically
concerns me as a student since the start
of the Occupy movement many protesters
have put matters concerning rising
tuition costs and student loans among
the top of their demands during her
campaign Jill Stein provocatively
compared student debt to a modern form
of indenture and you have expressed a
similar view arguing that student
indebtedness is a technique of
indoctrination and control could you
please elaborate on that or the first
question that arises is whether there's
an economic necessity for student debt I
mean I don't have to tell students what
the numbers are right it's over trillion
dollars it's beyond credit card did so
is it is there an economic just
okay well there are number of ways of
testing that so for example we happen to
be right next door to a poor country
Mexico quite good university system it's
not doesn't have all the things we have
support country but very high quality
high level of instruction I've taught
there have been there it's free
the that was an attempt by the
government some years ago 10-15 years
ago to raise cost slightly led to a
national student strike the country was
practically closed down and they backed
off in fact last time I was there about
two years ago there was an
administration building that was still
occupied but students from the student
strike long before it been turned into a
community center that's Mexico poor
country just in the West in our northern
border in Quebec where tuition is higher
the mechanism and there is tuition but
it's not at our level
there wasn't attempt by the government a
couple of months ago to raise the
tuition there was a student strike in
Quebec joined by much of the population
that it led not only to backing off on
that proposal but actually the change in
the government a lot of changes and
protests against neoliberal policies and
much more
there are rich countries that have a
very high-level educational systems
among the highest are Finland and
Germany both free if you go back in
American history you go back to the
nineteen fifties as a much poorer
country did than it is now but my
tuition wasn't exactly free but was
pretty close to it under the GI Bill a
huge number of people the width the
school would government expense meaning
low tuition essentially very low fees I
mean I was a student back in that
40s at an Ivy League college and two
weeks there's about a hundred dollars
maybe equivalent of eight hundred today
or something these comparisons suggest
very strongly that there's no real
economic reason for a high student debt
so we have to ask what it's doing well
it is part of a much more general
process over the past generation
essentially 30 odd years there's been a
major assault on the population
basically the neoliberal Europe that's
one of the reasons why there's no a
slogan the one-percent
ninety nine percent we're back to levels
of inequality that malaya stand history
before the first imprisonment what the
Great Depression there's been economic
growth during these years but it's
overwhelmingly gone into very few
pockets that's by now latest figures I
saw there are 400 people in the United
States that as much wealth more wealth
and say than the lowest under eighty
minion wages have pretty much groom very
slowly more or less speculative for most
of the population and sometimes declawed
well meanwhile there's been enormous
wealth going to a tiny percentage of the
population from the one percent 99
percent imagery is not really right it's
more like 1/10 of 1% if you look at the
way that graphs actually work and that
split to lots of constants it's not a
economic necessity like it's not
happening in comparable countries that
it's having there are a lot of other
effects so for example the OECD the
organization of the affluent countries
the developed all developed countries
and they just did a study of social
justice in 31 of accd countries the u.s.
was too
vii right above Mexico you have to
remember this is say the richest country
in the world with enormous advantages
that no one else says there are other
studies of infant mortality maternal
health lots of measures and the United
States is way down at the bottom of the
rich countries wrong 20th 21st doesn't
than which is just totally scandalous in
fact a health care is a remarkable case
we have about twice the per capita costs
of other rich countries and relatively
poor outcomes in addition to tens of
millions of people dying every year
because they don't have insurance the
new program will the end to that a
little but lower near where it should
for people who are worried about the
deficit which they shouldn't be it's
declining it's not that serious the
deficit would be erased if we had health
care system like comparable countries
and the reasons they're not terribly
obscures it's the only private virtual
privatized the lightly regulated system
in the world so it's highly inefficient
with the huge administrative costs
advertising profit for the private
companies huge salaries a lot of waste
cherry-picking all kinds of things
the in fact there are a couple of parts
of the US system which are going run
that one is the VA system there's an
expiration and that's kind of like your
four countries about the same level of
costs and fishing see Medicare which is
government-run it is a much more
efficient than the privatized system the
courses are going out it was a lot of
talk about that burden on Medicare but
that's because it has to work through
the privatized insurance system
it's on administrative costs and others
are quite low on comparison and it's
kind of interesting to look at the
proposals that are now being discussed
so one of the proposals are dealing with
the deficit problem which again is not I
may have broadens the banks care about
it the population doesn't and they're
right but if you one of the proposals
that's being routed around is that the
age for Medicare eligibility should be
increased that's quite an interesting
proposal for one thing it's kind of
class spaces professionals white-collar
workers and so on then to live longer
then truck drivers and construction
workers and people between the hard
manual labor so as you move up the level
which Medicare eligibility comes you
essentially arming the poor working
people and benefiting the more wealthy
educated specter but even more
interesting than that is the fact that
raising the age is a move from a more
efficient system to a less efficiency so
it's actually more costly but the way
cost is measuring and that's just
ideological modern economic necessity if
costs are transferred to individuals
they're not considered cost it's only if
it's a business then it's a cost if it's
the government it's a cost because the
rich don't pay taxes and the business of
course must have profit so if you can
find a way that transfer cost
individuals that's called savings but
you came up here today on the train the
train from New York Boston it takes
about the same amount of time as when my
wife and I took it sixty years ago if
you were an enemy European country or
almost any country we've taken a third
the time probably and that's a cost but
it's a cost to you not a cost to an
tractor to the go and it's the same I
had to fly yesterday for some talks I
floated an airplane in order to save
money for the private carriers they
don't circulate air well the cost of
that - like what you're hearing what the
costs of not circulating errors in
circulation is easy so if somebody at
the point I was gold everything's up the
cold the flu overs month but that's a
cost that's transferred to individuals
and therefore it doesn't count you don't
count it and when you measure efficiency
it's in Italy this is happening at the
universities - as the universities get
more corporate dies there's been a
during this period of sharp rise in
tuition is not for economic reasons I
think there's also been an enormous
increase in ratio of administrators to
the faculty a couple of studies it was
Benjamin Ginsberg well-known sociologist
has a book on it called the fall of the
faculty it discusses the sharp rise in
number of administrators on bed tendons
need to have professional administrators
the universities used to have
administrators from the faculty it took
off for a couple years and went back but
a lot of the administrators are not
professionals people come from business
schools you know they have a business
school mentality and you have to keep
the you have to look at the bottom line
we have to save money you have to get
what's going fishin see and they use the
corporate economic model of efficiency
so if the costs are less for the
institution it's more efficient for
example if you can reduce the proportion
of faculty to teaching but getting temps
you know low paying teachers like say
graduate students who have loose a lot
of low salaries no benefits if they can
take over the work
I paid faculty that's efficient it's not
efficient for the students they're not
getting the same level of education
surely that's not good for the graduate
students either but that's called
efficiency well all of these things
there's a lot more like this that all of
this going on in parallel as part of
them the whole deal liberal Onslow which
is it's very harmful to the population
very beneficial to the to the masters
the super-rich they're doing from it
like after they cost the latest
financial crisis that the big banks the
perpetrators of Richard never bigger
never the corporate profits earned the
reaching records of bonuses argue - and
so on the population suffers but not
them
this relates intimately some things that
occupy is doing mm-hmm so among the I
don't want to go on too long should
continue well among the occupy concerns
or the things like going to in fact one
of the projects that's coming up is
called occupy the economy deal with the
tremendous concentration of wealth which
carries along with it the concentration
of political power
that's almost reflexive cost of election
skyrockets if to depend on rich donors
corporate donors ends up kind of
controlling the political system which
is shredded you know you can see it's
very clear late go through some of the
details and going after that is a
critical important yes so what kind of
actions should we students for example
at NYU pursue obviously we need to
organize and create student groups
addressing these issues that you have
outlined but what other more specific
tactics would you suggest
so that we can go beyond merely
communicating this message about death
as a form of entrapment and
indoctrination and move to demanding
substance of change of some sort look at
the model of other countries mm-hmm for
example the ones are worse the Mexico
and Quebec the protests Mexico remember
was a protest against a small increase
in essentially free education but it
swept a large part of the country didn't
Quebec drew and a large part of the
population it was tied to concerns of
many other people it's not just the
students who are suffering through this
this attacker in the population is much
broader that's why you have a situation
in which and like what I described what
you all know the kind of stagnation
there's something like it for large
party for the majority of the population
while there is growth especially for the
poor people it's much worse for the
black population the wealth was almost
wiped out by the last recession and if
the if the student movement and in many
places when I'm supposed to do
historically the student movements have
been kind of in the forefront of
large-scale social change so frequently
the changes in this country that we've
done a lot of progress in the country in
the last 40 years or so a lot of it came
from student initiative the tech the
civil rights movement there's been a
civil rights of efforts for a long time
but one major spur to it was from 1960
when small group of black students sat
in a lunch counter kicked out arrested
brutalized others came pretty soon you
had Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee
you get free buses
students from the north coming down it
wasn't all story but it was the cutting
edge of what became a mass movement that
achieved some goals not all but some
goals the women's movement a lot of it
came from young women organizing
consciousness-raising groups pressing
demands on it spread the environmental
movement has a lot of it has come from
student activism or Andhra person but
they had even word movement it was very
clear with mostly students and this is
true of many other cases in this country
and elsewhere so the students can become
kind of a galvanizing force not just for
their own personal concerns of you know
I don't want to be in debt for the rest
of my life but because it's part of the
general social problem it's part of a
general attack really is an attack on
the population and it should be possible
and link up with other sectors that are
suffering under the same attack in
different ways like say people working
for the minimum wage at the minimum at
there was a time during the period of
growth significant growth in the country
50s and 60s when the minimum wage pretty
much tracked productivity that started
to separate about you know 30 plus years
ago if the minimum wage had kept up with
productivity would probably two or three
times as high as it is now well that
means people working at the minimum wage
are paying the costs of the wealth of
the one tenth of one percent and when
you pull down the minimum wage you pull
down always these are all broad issues
that the student movement can help
galvanize look for redeemeth what do you
make of the increased
professionalization and specialization
among
undergraduate departments in
universities by professionalization I
mean that the curriculums are under more
and more pressure to respond to the
demands of the market such as getting a
job etc in addition and in in tandem
with this in some respects it seems that
there's a great push to make some fields
seem as much as exact Sciences Sciences
as possible for instance the humanities
seem to be under great attack because
they do not produce tangible outcomes
and assessments that can be fit onto a
balance sheet determined by market logic
what should happen to traditional
humanities disciplines from your
perspective given these pressures
depends whether we won't live in a
civilized world human I mean the wealth
and the richness of life doesn't come
from having more gadgets in your hand
it comes from literature arts decent
society decent human relations many
other things that don't have you can't
put a number on marketization of life is
another form of destroying it I think
this was well understood by the working
classes in the early ages of the
Industrial Revolution in fact all
through their modern history you go back
to the 19th century this is quite good
scholarly studies of it the British
working classes you know in Dickensian
England wasn't very pretty I had a very
high level of culture but they were
reading contemporary literature what we
call classics now and the studies
compared the proletarian culture with
the Philistine ISM of the aristocratic
culture the same unites expect
back to the early industrial towns right
around here in fact eastern
Massachusetts the young women from the
farms who were coming into the mills
were bitterly condemned the fact that
their culture was being destroyed they
returned it the tools of production term
independent women an Irish artisan and
say a blacksmith in Boston to get a
little money would hire a young boy to
read them while he's working American
remember it went on into the 1930s my
you know as a kid my family mostly
unemployed working-class mostly in New
York and that's something to love and
I'd never really had much formal school
in a couple of years maybe but they were
going to Shakespeare plays and they you
know talking about the best string
quartet
discussing the latest debates and
psychoanalysis in human form every
possible political movement it's other
words working-class education and which
incidentally a lot of quick-turn
scientists and mathematicians
participated that was work written for
workers education that were workers
education programs lot of it run by the
unions and so on but much LaMotta that's
been beaten out of people's heads but
could be restored now and that's a
decent Society if you go back to the
19th century labor press which is very
interesting it barely condemned
industrial society as turning people
into taking away their freedom their
independence their integrity as human
beings in fact wage labor in the mid
19th century was considered basically
the same as slaver
the only difference was it was temporary
in fact that was such a popular position
that was a program of the Republican
Party in the mid 19th century it was a
program of the Knights of Labor the huge
never movement that was forming
it was an interesting slogan that was
emphasized by a lot of working people
the slogan they described what they
called the new spirit of the age that
they're trying to ram down our throat
the new spirit of the ages gained wealth
for getting all but self 150 years of
massive efforts to try to indoctrinate
people to that belief that it's only
human and silage that just doesn't work
at the periphery but that's an
marketization of every aspect of life is
part of it it's affected if you look at
the colleges the state colleges in the
country a lot of them are actually
producing in order to preserve the
profit profitability now look at the
bottom line are actually reducing
expensive programs with our jobs like
they're reducing engineering computer
science in nursing because they're
expensive but they happen to be the
programs with jobs and turning to
cheaper programs and as you say the
humanities are kind of marginalized you
can't put a number on developing that
creative writers are individuals who
could enjoy that can appreciate and
contribute to the arts of the general
culture and then that's a very harmful
effect on the society altogether this is
inside what kind of society do you live
in I think these are among the reasons
why the u.s. ranks ovo it's a general
social justice and in a recent public
forum with Angela Davis a veteran
activist as well you reiterated one of
Martin Luther King's juniors most famous
statements that the arc of history is
long but it bends towards justice and of
course it takes a lot of people to
that arctan as well but my question is
what role do universities serve in a
just or democratic society universities
ought to be the place where as many
people as possible let's say the GI Bill
we have the opportunity to develop their
creative capacities their independence
their joy of discovery and their ability
to work with each other to achieve
socially desirable social ends that they
can figure out a student's our
University they're really the freest
time of their lives they're out of
parental control we don't yet have to
devote themselves to putting bread on
the table but a lot of freedom and
opportunity and that's the point of the
university actually going back to Mexico
for country a couple of years ago there
was a leftist mayor and Mexico City
Pablo is called the he actually opened
the University in Mexico City which is
not a free that has open admissions with
support for students who aren't quite up
the academic standard and it's pretty
impressive I was there as usual students
talked to faculty that's just what a
university ought to be used to be or be
open to evacuate are they open to the
community drawing people interest like
workers education programs do but these
opportunities ought to be available to
everyone but they're at the forefront of
creating the opportunities for a decent
society in which the same person won't
want to live and I'd like to shift to a
different topic in the in light of
Barack Obama's second inauguration that
is your opinion about
the role on the left in the United
States it seems to me that there is an
effort among the Democrats specifically
to depict the president as a victim of
capitalist nation Asians is this effort
and mistake should the left in the
United States Barack Obama
more accountable accountable to what
there's no indication that he has any
intention or ever had any intention or
interest in the bringing about
progressive change is basically a
moderate Republican mm-hmm in fact you
know it's it's commonly said now that
the moderate Republicans have
disappearing the Republican Party is a
party in fact it's what the governor
bobby Jindal called them couple weeks
ago he said we're becoming the stupid
party so off the spectrum but what
happened to the moderate Republicans
they're now mainstream Democrats the
Democrats Obama fits pretty well within
that spectrum he came into office 2008
with a huge popular support and the
country was going into an economic
tailspin at noon on this is the first
thing we had to do of course was like an
economic to deal with the problems well
take a look at who we picked he picked
people who had created the problems we
of the Reuben voice and of the ones who
were at the forefront of deregulation of
you know building the big banks of
providing the government insurance
policy which encourages risk no more too
big to fail policy and so on these are
the people who were picked and there are
other highly competent Economist's
including them Nobel laureate know
people like C Stiglitz our equipment and
many others that they weren't they were
never invited we in fact the business
bris
Bloomberg News Business Journal actually
reviewed the appointments when they were
made an interesting article about them
went through each person who was a
but ended up concluding that half of
these people shouldn't be on an economic
team they should be getting subpoenas
you know they're the ones who are the
perpetrators of the crisis that were now
in that gave it away pretty quickly I
mean he came in Obama with huge labor
support and the labor movement had a few
serious requests good right was one of
them was you know carjacked ability to
who has been a big huge attack on unions
and they wanted to go back to a rational
way of organizing which much workers
want to mentally Obama promised it
forgot about it right away
Sam on health care because a majority of
the population favorite some kind of
rational national health care system it
was one residue of that left in Obama's
program public option which gave away
about two-thirds of the population
supporting in the United States is I
guess the only country where there's
legislation that bans the government
from the goji and drug prices so drug
prices are way higher than elsewhere
what I found already one poll on that
which I've been about 85% of the
population was opposed made no effort to
deal with him I mean the claim was well
I can't get it through Congress and so
on but the prison has a lot of power
people the population would be a leader
there have been presidents it did do
that but you have to want to do it or be
pressured to do it by large-scale
thought their movements and you you
often associate that justice with
democracy or democracy with justice
working in conjunction together however
some may argue that the concept of
justice and the concept of democracy are
the antithesis of each other in other
words the protections
of personal liberties and majority rule
are not compatible
anyway you professor of politics Pascal
de pastino argues that by using the word
democracy to encompass a broad range of
things the word loses any real value and
this can have a detrimental effect when
we want to make substantive change
happen how do we resolve this paradox I
think we resolve it the way Aristotle
didn't hmm to go back to the first major
book on political theory Aristotle's
politics he dealt with famous or dealing
with Athens estate and he was talking
about freemen you know I'm not people so
not slaves not women but he discussed
various kinds of political systems
decided that democracy was maybe the
least bad so that's what we should
prefer but he pointed out there's a real
problem with democracy the problem is
that if the voters if all of everyone's
free to vote the ones were enfranchised
the poor will use their voting power to
redistribute the property the rich in
other words to achieve justice and of
course we don't want that he had a
solution but first if you'd notice that
Madison raised it's a problem in the
Constitutional Convention he was talking
about England model they're thinking
though
and in the Constitution convention he
discussed the fact that in England if
everyone had to vote in excluding the
people were not allowed to vote like
women literally everyone had to put a we
the poor would use their voting power to
carry out what we call man drew from
these are mostly agricultural societies
and that's unjust so Aristotle and
Madison faced the same problem as the
professor you're mentioning conflict
between hypocracy injustice and that
opposites delicious our style solution
was to
Douce inequality mmm and he proposed
what amount to welfare state measures
now on a city scale our still communal
meal you know things like that that
would reduce the level of inequality and
then he wouldn't have the poor the mass
of the poor the take away the property
the bridge and Madison's solution was
the opposite we should reduce democracy
hmm and that's the way our system is
constructed you look back at the
Madisonian system the constitutional
system power was to be in the Senate
Senate of course was not elected
remember powers in the Senate which is
Madison explained constitutes the wealth
of the nation the more responsible set
of men those who sympathize with
property owners of their right the
executive was mostly an executive not so
powers in the hands of the wealthy there
is a house of representatives of and
that's more democratic it was then isn't
now but for all sorts of reasons but and
that had much less authority in power
because it was democratic also weed and
there were their devices to
factionalized the population and so on
now the population didn't really accept
that it was a radical population
movement on and as long struggles
through American history to try to
achieve justice within a democratic
system and it's a bitter class war that
goes on all the time we're now on a fury
of less roughly generation where the
class horse turned sharply and favor of
extreme wealth so you normally have the
distribution of wealth that I described
but it also has immediate consequences
for effort democracy and their num good
work in the political science and
professional political science studying
attitudes and policy and the correlation
between them we have a lot of
information about public
snaps at polling you know quite good
polls the basic result that comes out of
the kind of gold standard work the
Martin gilens Larry cartels and others
is about seventy percent of the
population is essentially
disenfranchised the lower seventy
percent and will often income but their
attitudes have no influence on policy
and as you go up the income level you
get slowly more influence when you get
to the very top since we get what they
want well it's a kind of democracy you
know everyone's a lot of the push a
button or something it's this is nothing
like a functional democracy and that's
probably one of the main reasons why
yeah a lot of the population just
doesn't bother voting and it tends to be
the quarter part nobody's really
investigated it but probably it's just
an intuitive understanding it doesn't
make any difference why should I bother
and when you get to the House of
Representatives it's quite interesting
but that began in the constitutional
system is a word democratic part of the
government now it's the opposite of the
last election 2012 the Democrats got a
considerable majority but a small a
small minority of the seats for all
kinds of reasons including legislative
gerrymandering the role of money in the
public politics was very good study but
Thomas Ferguson remain a political
scientist who studied the role of money
in elections and he's found that in the
last congressional elections there's
almost a perfect correlation between the
percentage of the funding that candidate
receives and the probability of the
candidates being elected so the stripe
of the Republicans you look at the
proportion of funding they received as
it goes up more are elected almost in a
straight line and
presidential election it was over two
billion dollars this time now there's a
lot of talk about how money didn't work
because you know Sheldon Adelson spent a
hundred million dollars and didn't get
what you want that's not true everyone
got the funded got what they want the
candidates who were in office thanks to
the huge funding are beholding to the
funders they never won who what their
positions effectively and if they want
to stay in office they want to go back
to them so that means they have to do
what they want wasn't a big surprise
that Obama when he came in 2008 a huge
support for the financial institutions
not turning to shining their shoes doing
what they want thank you so let's
absolutely democratic nor just and the
point you made about board apathy I
think what are apathy the point you made
about that I think it resonates a lot
especially with students in university
such as on what you there's not only
voter apathy and why you to vote in
general elections I think there's just
apathy about what students can do within
their schools to demand some kind of
change for example NYU is considering
its next huge massive expansion plan
it's called 2031 and of course tuition
is going to keep on rising but virtually
students are completely not involved in
the decision-making process faculty as
well are not are not involved very much
so the administration is making moves
and it is expanding and the student sort
of feeling well there's nothing I can do
about it I don't have a voice therefore
there's nothing I can do it's kind of
drilled into her headed from childhood
denied we can do but it's all too big no
I think that's one of the reasons for
the crazy gun culture in the country a
lot of people feel look I got to defend
myself from that right from the
government from power or something so
hit a gun here it's not my government
like I can't organize with other people
and vote
right actually an interesting reflection
of this is the attitude thirds taxes
only thinking the kind of a thought
experiment and imagine a functioning
democracy mm-hmm
what would people feel about taxes well
April 15th would be this celebration
we're getting together to fund the
projects that we decided on who what's
better than that but here it's a it's a
good morning because some Andean entity
you don't think that out there is
hovering over us and it's going to steal
our money from us that's an indication
of how low the conception of demography
mm-hmm
and it's substantially because it
doesn't bring about justice if you want
people to feel the function in a
democracies but have to lead to test out
yes and professor Chomsky thank you very
much
