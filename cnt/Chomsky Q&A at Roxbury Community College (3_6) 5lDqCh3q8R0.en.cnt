I
I'm giving a presentation next my name's
cards & Wesson ops was founded at the
time of the raid era and recently in the
media this so this item out of the past
has risen again and he's wanted to buy
the Republicans who pulled the basin
right in library as well as the
Democrats and remaking of this ethical
insertive is really important to me and
I wish you can comment on this and give
us a little historical background of was
they set up a written up cracka flew
with my phones are headed every goes
north my finger got my question or my
request is freaking my request is that
you elaborate on remaking of the image
of Ronald Reagan attention and the
history coming forward today my son Bob
SAR born in this time of great luck yeah
but sometimes i think is my music for my
beautiful yes the 1984 the 984 was in
per year they grow
the head and radically free and credit
legend very carefully monitor
international monitors of British
parliamentary rights inquiry irish
government bro entry and greedy at dutch
government which is very hostile the
sense and anissa's had an official
inquiry a Latin American Studies
Association special group of American
scholar that not a manometer the
election
that they sent specialists done field
work when they grew up there for several
weeks before him they all reach the same
conclusion was very free and fair
election so there's money left okay
there are many people so position of the
US government was elected to take place
preferably one hundred percent immediate
the same position in fact they staged a
way of trying to drag the election off
the front pages they staged a delivery
and latest delivery of mates Russian
maids to interrupt credit that time the
election and the front pages are
Russians delivering base Nicaragua
threat to the United States long after
rain and cold declared a national
emergency because of the threat of
security the United States both
government acabo which will remember
crying accessing just about the
destroyed by these words and being along
and commentary went along on some
skeptical is it book by hair Senator
Paul Thomas with the senator said well
you know maybe they regard to the Senate
dates because they are about Obama
because i was in can't allow mates to be
in country lighten her up to destroy us
if a truck early election incidentally
why then before everyone meet the person
four foot why might they have wanted
things this really shows us something
about the Imperial meant God intended
see the whole reason I never had
requested jet planes from France but the
u.s. part of it they did not want never
up would have plans from the West round
I didn't want to leave for Russia as an
old trick that's the way they
firstman threaten him with an attack
trying to defend themselves block any
dog from your allies compel on to go to
your enemies then in preventive the
threat we're a business person is
watching us from Mars they think it can
use its it was beat two days from
running tests but cells here one polish
kid be and when I begin me meet
airplanes maybe protect their airspace
the usf for controller airspace that I
was using it to best support the
conference mercenary forces the reason
to carry out terror in agriculture must
not like ordinary Gorillaz I mean had
computers claims of that CIA claims and
presenting signals telling them where
the army was
favorite attack soft targets unfitness
Witten TARDIS a judicial policy say that
they wanted to affect their airspace
that they knew that they better not hit
yet plans of the United States of the
research anyway that did not the
election off the front page everything
reads is the first election was in
nineteen ninety what happens okay he
could have battering the country and
dust people and threatening with worse
Louis gave up and loaded for the
expanded that is ok if real election
it's another illustration of the real
hatred of democracy in circles extra
Lydia your post passion and it takes
genes to pursue so that's about nineteen
eighty-four what about Reagan Reagan was
a brutal thug in shower
grace I'm going out both snowing out
this Authority really who's going on the
job they understand that by saying that
he knew what was going on and so the
worst combination even make I mean he
could serve say okay it is nice bedroom
with examining so it's not awful but he
hasn't knew what was going on had any
role play
major criminal and in fact he was not a
popular president if they look back at
the polls for me a diploma cover letter
and nothing special after he was at our
office not especially there was a huge
propaganda campaign developed indeed
affect you remember i'm sure the when he
died that performance in Washington it
was like kim il-sung he's an
embarrassment but it's turned into it
and some kind of great deal of the great
genius Stalin Constance's was example of
Kim il-sung ism and yet was made in the
kind of I found probably a forgotten
weight was or how much you know
perpetual attitudes were tortured so yes
he's awesome pantheon and every
Republican candidate has to say all
great at the Barack Obama today praised
Reagan as somebody who brought about
change change people with the corpses
represent
passions the President and post-war
American business the whole country but
isn't broke what I by Japan those year
the yeah that's robbery and the creation
of the deed his assumption way is what
they did with the trade since never let
his divine creature cancer very insolent
this from the pr industry but relations
is very sophisticated and in fact that
it was for history was found on First
World War I was inundated by hedley over
public they said we're gonna use the
techniques of American commercial
advertising to turn this country and
they did the uttermost civilized country
world's worst barbarians in history
using the kinds of commercial
advertising
