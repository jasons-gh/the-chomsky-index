our government is the most powerful
government in the world right now how
could we best utilize that power to
affect change both in terms of like
burning issues like nuclear
proliferation and in terms of changing
human rights and I guess most
immediately I'm thinking about where do
we go from where we are now with North
Korea given that we've already made the
mistakes that we have in the past well
first of all I think the way to deal
with the overwhelming military power of
the United States is to dismantle it
nothing use it it's a threat so takes a
nuclear proliferation okay that's
dangerous in fact nuclear weapons are
among the most likely things that will
do us in it's pretty close came very
close in 62 and that's not the only time
what do you do about nuclear
proliferation well there is a treaty
it's called a non-proliferation treaty
which obligates the nuclear states that
includes us to carry out good faith
efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons
okay and nobody follows that nobody's
going to follow it unless the United
States takes the lead the United States
is one of the main violators of the
treaty it's right through Clinton
incidentally and one way to reduce the
threat of nuclear weapons is to observe
the provisions of the non-proliferation
treaty another way to do it is to pay
attention to the Security Council
declarations that are selectively used
to justify the war on Iraq they don't
only call for disarmament of Iraq they
call for there's a paragraph which is
very rarely quoted which calls for
disarmament of Iraq as a step towards
elimination of weapons of mass
destruction and delivery systems in the
region okay that's specifically
referring to the u.s. offshore
Terry base in Israel which has
overwhelming has hundreds of nuclear
weapons and totally overwhelms anyone in
the region and military force that's
what they're talking about that's
another step another way to do it is to
follow the recommendations of the
high-level congressional and other
committees which have pointed out that
the major threat of nuclear weapons
right now at least is what they call
loose nukes no Russia or Pakistan or
somebody with nuclear weapons tens of
thousands of them in fact that are kind
of getting out of control well you know
there are small programs to try to do
something about that and their work but
they ought to be huge programs so there
are many problems about nuclear weapons
and another thing to do is to stop
encouraging countries to develop a power
which is what they're going to do all
right let's get to North Korea I don't
calling mistakes exactly but the right
the the countries of the region have a
an approach that they want to follow
they want and we should be following
their lead I think South Korea in the
lead and Japan and China basically agree
with them that this is a serious problem
very serious problem and has to be dealt
with through diplomacy and through moves
to somehow integrate North Korea back
into the system which is not a trivial
matter on the framework agreement this
is one thing that Clinton did which was
right of 1994 if it had been implemented
would have taken steps it was taking
steps towards that well it's been
reversed I'm going to go back and we
will follow the lead of the South
Koreans on this it's dangerous right now
the danger of North Korea is not nuclear
weapons the danger is the reason why the
US isn't attacking North Korea is
because they have a deterrent the
deterrent is conventional weapons massed
artillery which can destroy soul in five
minutes
i'm sure that at the Pentagon they're
working on techniques for precision
guided the weapons that can somehow
maybe tactical nuclear weapons that can
somehow take out that artillery but
until I can do that they can't attack
North Korea because has a deterrent and
in fact the u.s. is teaching the world a
very ugly lesson now it's telling the
world if you want to prevent us from
attacking you you better have a
deterrent if you're defenseless like
Iraq will go after you if you're North
Korea which is a much worse terror in a
and a much greater threat but you have a
deterrent we're not going to go after
you you know may not be the headlines
here but everyone in the world
understands it it's very evident that's
really bad behind that there are other
things going on so the you take a look
at that region Siberia China Japan Korea
it's it's it's an integrated region it
has tremendous resources mostly in
Siberia like energy resources it has
countries that need those resources
Japan China South Korea the natural
development and one that's beginning to
take place is some kind of integration
in which the energy reasor and other
material resources of Siberia are going
to be used by the surrounding countries
which are carrying out industrial
development the u.s. is very much
opposed to that does not want an
integrated region to develop that will
be out of control of us global power
that's part of the background for what's
going on in the Gulf and thing so yeah
that's in the works there's a lot to be
concerned about if you're really
thinking about the future North Korea is
a threat and the way to deal with it is
by following the lead of the people who
are right there like South Korea and the
cert other countries and we can do a lot
to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons
by following our own treaty obligations
that be a good story
even radical extreme status such as
bushing company must share a basic sense
of self-preservation along with the rest
of us but it seems to me that they too
at a very personal level will suffer the
likely consequences of their own actions
a dangerous course that they've
initiated do these people believe that
they'll escape by magic or by divine
intervention or does their extreme
devotion to ideology prevent ordinary
logical thinking and it's logic and
finally is it important for us or not to
understand what's going on in their
minds if we want to change the world no
I don't think up some minor importance
the reason it's of minor importance is
that this is close to a historical
universal now it happens that by now the
stakes are much greater because the
means of violence are so much greater
you take a look at history it's been
like this forever they take a look at
the history of war I mean very often
maybe like half the time wars were
started by countries who got destroyed
they're willing that the leadership was
willing to take the chance no I mean
it's not just reason you know people
talk about the 20th century is the most
horrible century ever and in some ways
it was but you look at the wars in
Europe the Thirty Years War in the 17th
century wiped out about forty percent of
the population in Germany they kept at
it the leader for the leadership was
just more important or take a look at
take more recent times it go back to
nineteen fifty okay there was one
potential threat to us security no near
the US had enormous security controlled
the Western Hemisphere controlled both
oceans control the other sides of both
oceans never
secure a country but there was a
potential threat the potential threat
was was the only potential then was
intercontinental missiles with
thermonuclear warheads okay if anybody
had been concerned with the security of
the United States they would have tried
to avert the development of those of
that technology and very likely the
Russians would have agreed and not
because they're nice guys because they
were so far behind they didn't want the
technology developed mcgeorge bundy who
was kennedy's national security advisor
who wrote the authoritative history of
all of this and had access to all the
internal documents and so on he points
out in his history that he cannot find
any document which suggests that anybody
even thought about it you know that they
even had a plant or a thought about
trying to avert the threat that the only
serious threat to the survival of the
United States and the reason is you just
don't think about that you're interested
in short-term power profit and gain and
the fact that it might destroy your
country is kind of secondary and that
goes right through history you know
except the only the main difference now
is that the stakes are much higher much
higher but the reasoning is pretty
constant so is it important to think
what's in the minds of these particular
guys yeah maybe at some level but it's
more important to recognize that you
know within a lunatic framework
decisions are made which are pretty
rational it's the framework that's
lunatic I'm you could say the same about
environmental destruction you know it's
a it's you don't know how far off it is
and nobody knows exactly what'll happen
but and now it's universally recognized
that it's extremely dangerous and that
the system in fact is kind of nonlinear
that as a small change might lead to a
huge effect so on it could happen
anytime
that's known they by doing anything
about it no because it's much more
important to have short-term profit well
within us and in fact if you think about
what you're taught in your economics
courses that's right you know it's
rational within a framework of thinking
that's pretty much accepted people are
supposed to be rational wealth
maximizers right you're trying to
maximize your own wealth okay that's
what you're supposed to be if you're
rational well and the market if it works
perfectly in theory is supposed to
respond to the inputs from the
participants so your votes are your
dollars and your goal is maximizing your
wealth okay here's a simple question how
many votes do your grandchildren have in
the market none you know they don't vote
in the market now therefore their
interests are valued at zero in what's
called rational behavior so therefore
it's entirely rational to destroy the
possibility that they'll of a world in
which they can survive if you can have
more shoes it's essentially what it
comes down to it it's a kind of a
rational decision with it a framework of
complete lunacy you know and there's a
lot in history that's likely we should
be concerned with those lunatic
frameworks much more than what's in the
mind of some person who's making
decisions within them it may be pretty
rational within a accepted framework
that's really important i think mr.
Chomsky is there somebody up there I
can't see thank you if you had to read
or excuse me well if people could you
wait an arm or something I can't see
if you had to recommend four or five
publications that you think provide
unbiased and accurate reporting what
would you recommend outside of kgn you I
don't want to sound dismissive but I
really think it's the wrong question
nothing is unbiased you know everything
is presented from a certain point of
view if you're honest you make your
point of view clear if you're dishonest
you pretend your objective and so on and
so forth all right and then it's really
it's really up to you to decide what you
think is telling something that sounds
reasonable to you and you really ought
to be triangulating you know you look at
different things and see how the world
looks from different points of view and
then you make your own decisions it's
just as if you're us you know your
chemist working and some problem in
chemistry there is nothing that gives
you an unbiased point of view that takes
work and it's a lot harder when you are
trying to deal with human affairs so I
mean I know what I think is important
but it's really up to you to decide what
you think is important I mean for
example I learn a lot by reading The
Wall Street Journal so I was quoting it
imac can't stand with you know we
disagree on every imaginable topic but
if you read it you can learn a lot about
the first of all what's happening
because they have pretty honest
reporting remember they're reporting for
the business world which has to have a
semi-realistic picture of what the world
is like and you also learn what's being
thought about and centers of power
that's important I don't say that's the
only thing you should read and I think
you to read zeemagazine too but from
then on you've got to decide yourself
you you are next you're next okay
right and I'm not going to miss this
opportunity it's I've been waiting for a
long time you mentioned that the next
region that it's going to be in the eyes
of the United States are you didn't hear
you mentioned that the next region could
be the engine region that you know the
United States is going to go propagate
the young democracy and freedom that
tween like we've done in Latin America
yeah a century yeah I would like you two
to give us a Bolivian the last five
years in our bulleted i was born in
bulova but I'm a US citizen now I
believe in the last five years has
discovered quite a bit of natural gas
and it said probably the next five years
we will or get close to the to the US
and reserves in the American continent
in there is a quite a bit of opposition
about a project that has been taking
place the government's trying to
implement the project that it's called
pacific lng liquefied bolivian natural
gas and exporting it to southern
california there's quite a bit of a
position about that project from local
people because it doesn't benefit is not
going to benefit bolivia in any way if
you know anything about that of if you
could give us a little bit more details
and also i have a request from a lot of
civic and organizations and believe it
to invite you down there to give us an
idea about the devastating consequences
of the american free trade that the u.s.
government is trying to propagate all
over South America
well III mean you probably know more
about Bolivian resources and I do so I
won't answer but I doubt that the
resources are on that scale I think
they're significant but I doubt that
they're on the North American scale
however it is true that if you there are
intelligence projections a document you
ought to read its public it's called the
the name global get one it's the year
2000 the national intelligence community
that's the CIA and the rest of them
published a projection for the next 15
years that if you want a reference to it
send me an email it's got a website or
you can get it under the CIA website if
you look and it's a long detailed
projection of what they expect the next
15 years and it's pretty interesting
parts of it have to do with this they
described the Andean region they don't
mention Bolivia well except that insofar
as it's part of this region at the
periphery but the Andean region they say
they expect to be one of the main
sources on which the US will rely for
its energy requirements not the only one
but one and it's that's why I mentioned
that it's a possible target aside from
the fact that it's out of control
Bolivia as you know is almost out of
control came very close to elective
populists president main would have if
it hadn't been for violence there's a
lot of opposition in Bolivia to the
so-called drug war it's been a lot to do
with drugs but it has a lot to do with
driving people off the land and things
like that and it's been a disaster in
Bolivia for the population for almost 20
years now alternative development
programs that have been talked about
having been realized as they haven't
been anywhere else and it's pretty bad
news and you know a lot of a lot of
tension and violence the US as I
mentioned his military bases all over
the region and
undoubtedly is looking for their plans
to go further including Bolivia as to
the free trade agreements well you know
there's one region where they've been
implemented North America Canada United
States and Mexico and that's NAFTA it's
opposed by the populations in all three
countries was implemented over the
objections of the populations of all
three countries it's one of Clinton's
other achievements it required a
tremendous media campaign to prevent
people from knowing about what was
happening I mean to this day ten years
later the official position of the labor
movement has not been allowed expression
a lot of denunciation of the labor
movement but their own position which
was pretty reasonable wasn't allowed
expression still isn't but the
population still opposed back in at the
hemispheric summit and what was it april
two thousand and one in quebec the that
was supposed to be the summit that was
going to establish the free trade
agreement for the americas okay and they
were going to end NAFTA was the model
everyone read the headlines so about how
magnificent NAFTA was now I have to
extend the benefits to the hemisphere
well here's another propaganda
achievement for you the two major
organizations pretty well known
organizations the leading human rights
group in the world Human Rights Watch
and the Economic Policy Institute in
Washington was one of the major think
tanks that does regular economic
analysis both of them published major
documents on NAFTA timed for release at
the summit Human Rights Watch dealt
their document dealt with effects of
NAFTA on labor rights in the three
countries economic policy institute
document had experts from the three
countries describing discussing in
detail the effects on working people of
NAFTA in the three countries
had a friend through a database search
on that I wasn't mentioned in the United
States except for one op-ed in a small
town newspaper well why because Human
Rights Watch concluded that NAFTA had
been harmful to labor rights in all
three countries mostly Mexico which is
the most vulnerable and the economic
policy institute give a detailed
analysis in which they concluded that
it's one of those rare agreements which
had been harmful to working people which
means the majority of the population in
all three countries most harmful in
Mexico which is the most vulnerable and
you don't want people to know that when
the headlines are talking about how
marvelous NAFTA is and how we have to
extend it to the hemisphere but if you
read those reports you get a pretty good
assessment of what the effect of
so-called free trade is and it's not
free trade that's propaganda it's a very
special form of an international
integration which gives rights to
investors not the people so under say
NAFTA one of the provisions of NAFTA
like the World Trade Organization is
that corporations are permitted to claim
national rights so GM can go to Mexico
and claim the rights of a mix of Mexican
businesses what happens if a Mexican of
flesh and blood that tries to go to New
York and claim the rights of an
Americans at the person of flesh and
blood you know don't have to bother
asking these are that's just only one
example of special rights that are given
to private Pyrenees that people don't
have when NAFTA was passed you know it's
implemented in 1994 there was another
legislation implemented in 1994 by the
Clinton
eration was called Operation gatekeeper
it militarized the us-mexican border
that's an artificial border like most
borders established by conquest the
United States conquered half of Mexico
and the border has been pretty porous in
both directions same people live on both
sides they've been moving up and back
Clinton understood that when NAFTA is
passed you have to block the movement of
people okay free trade if you go back to
Adam Smith is based on free movement of
people you have to stop that and the
reason is because they anticipated an
economic disaster in Mexico they were
going to call an economic miracle and it
was going to mean there would be a flood
of people from Mexico fleeing to the
United States and he got to block that
so they militarized the border and
hundreds of Mexicans have been killed
since then trying to cross the border
it's one of the effects of NAFTA now
these are not free trade agreements
their agreements which provide which are
carefully calibrated to be a mixture of
protectionism and liberalisation
designed for the interests of those who
are designing them that's not very
surprising the people are designing the
maze mainly corporate sector or
designing them in their interest it
includes very highly protectionist
measures and a lot of and the kind of
liberalisation will benefit them but
they're not free trade agreements and
NAFTA at least here's to have been
harmful to the majority of the
population in all three countries this
nope take it a reason to think that if
he extended the hemisphere it's going to
be any different before I before I leave
I have to convey the message of some of
the people that want to invite you there
and I know you're booked for the next
two years or three years but can I
contact you somehow and I maybe we can
discuss if you could do something no
because they want to have you there in
the one there when Olivia in Bolivia
yeah I have a one of my many thick files
of invitations is from friends in
Bolivia oh and I got that like you can
just email me but all I can do is add it
to the phone how do I get your email
underwear it's the obvious one just my
name chomsky at mit.edu educational
institutions so just would you just
thank you i'll do that thanks okay what
what stupid rat but i have to tell you
that i probably have to send the form
response i mean i get hundreds a day and
even spending four or five hours a night
i can't really reach me about it but I
saw it so a lot of them have to say if
it's an invitation you know just I
playing to his file what's to prevent
mr. Bush from carrying out a plan which
i believe is part of his national
emergency policy and that is to cancel
the 2004 elections I don't yeah I think
I mean you know these guys are pretty
bad but I don't think that's in the
cards I mean I think that probably would
lead to a rebellion in the country
unless you know with an exception if
some major terrorist action takes place
all bets are off you know and I don't
say that they're trying to stimulate one
but the policies that they are pursuing
are increasing the likelihood of
terrorist operations and they know it
you know they I mean they read their own
intelligence reports they read CIA
reports they read what strategic
analysts are saying and they're almost
uniform and saying that the policies
that are being pursued are likely to
increase the threat of terrorism and the
threat is of the year you want to know
how severe it is i recommend some
reading there's a high level task force
heart Redmond task force organized by
the Council on Foreign Relations which
just came out with its report a couple
of months ago on some title like
terrorist threats to the United States
like everyone else they said the threats
are going to be increased by the attack
on
back everybody says that and but the
threat then they run through a it's kind
of a cookbook for terrorists I mean it
has a series of threats which I hadn't
even thought of never but in there and
they're very extreme so for example they
point out and they apparently
unstoppable so they forget the numbers
but they point out that a huge number of
containers but most of what comes into
the country is in containers you know
container ships I think it's tens of
millions a year some extremely high
number and those containers are
uninspected okay anything could be in
them you know furthermore there's no way
to inspect them they come from three or
four places around the world singapore
Amsterdam or maybe Rotter down and some
other place and if you try to inspect
them you would back up commerce you know
for months if trucks clogging all of
Europe you know waiting to be inspected
I mean the whole economic system would
collapse especially if it's based on on
time production so this has to be any
feasible way to inspect them any one of
them could have a nuclear weapon in it
we put together in some you know New
York hotel room and it goes on and on
with threats like this and if you're
going to try to create a world where
people want to destroy you make a lot of
ways of doing and if a terrorist attack
takes place I think all bets are off
this is a very frightened country anyway
and if anything happens it could go
berserk do you consider I don't tax
resistance by Americans to be a an
appropriate means of expressing dissent
and possibly affecting transformation in
the government well I mean I was a tax
resistor myself for a long time in fact
I
organised tried didn't work tried to
organize national tax resistance back in
nineteen sixty-five with a couple of
friends we really tried hard didn't get
very far and I myself kept after at it
for about ten years until I realized you
know just not an effective tactic at
that point these are tactical questions
you have to judge try to judge is it
going to reach people if you carry out
any form of civil disobedience whether
its tax resistance or something else you
have to ask you know what are the likely
consequences you I mean you're not
making a pact with god you're trying to
have an effect you know say well what
are the consequence is going to be is it
going to encourage other people to do
something say because they'll see you're
doing this and right now my own you know
I don't have any faith in my tactical
judgment yours is better than mine i'm
sure but if you want mine it's that it's
probably not an effective device now
frankly i think the most important thing
now is to change is to do something
about the fact that this country is so
terrified that an unscrupulous leader
can impose lunatic ideas by a propaganda
campaign that lead the real dangers it
seems to me that's what we ought to be
dealing with we are we ought to also be
dealing with the fact that really
critical and important things are just
not reaching people like what happened
last october's say that have
extraordinary importance just one
example unless that stuff is known to
people we you're not going to be able to
organize and have an effect and that
means fake breaking through media
monopolies information control and
doctrine ation all sorts of things those
dealing with that seems to me a lot more
important than things like tax
resistance right now but it's your
guests thanks i really appreciate your
coming and i hope to see you back in the
area soon but my question was very
similar to hers actually but I wanted to
know your opinion given all the recent
events of the past few years worldwide
the opposition to some of the decisions
but the bush administration has made the
WTO violations if this invasion in Iraq
continues and becomes drawn out and you
know you can just go on to imagine what
could happen next you don't think
there's any chance for an international
crimes court to bring charges against
officials under the Bush administration
at this point in virtually none Castillo
is just too powerful and there isn't
enough internal opposition frankly I'm
amazed that the war is going on this
long I thought it would be over in two
days if you look at the relations of
violent means of violence and I'd still
suspect it's going to end very quickly
and but you know if it does drag on
there's going to be enormous protest and
it could be all sorts of things
happening I mean right now there's
tremendous anger and hatred all over the
world and it's probably going to
manifest itself in action but I don't
think an international criminal court is
in the cards and it doesn't seem to me
it's our concern really our concern is
to change this country no not to
speculate about what somebody else is
going
I'm afraid this has got to be the last
question I'm afraid yeah thank you
really thank you okay all right I'm Troy
Barrett and I'm from Boulder and what
brought you here this evening to hear no
I'm casa because I've been a fan of Noam
Chomsky's for the 20 or so years I've
been paying attention to the
international event
inspired and also a generate over again
in these troubled times surrounded by
people to care about these issues
and what was the night for you
information is there anything
surprise you or struck you about the
evening
we can add to that information wise
community wise
I were to skate jam you for very long
time for most
I
a lot of surprises some of the facts
that that professor Chomsky stated new
to me
and also some of the questions
like us go connection
chris has to decide it would invade the
Netherlands give the International
Criminal Court every time to try someone
from the US that just shows
the extent that these guys are out of
touch with reality
issues that CRP that was the star
welcome professor Chomsky reinforced my
fears that I had back throughout the 80s
and seven
is that ultimately we may all end in
nuclear annihilation that is so real
where to go with that is just to work
even harder to try and he said what
happens his main message tonight to me
was strange has happened a year
we have to become a true democracy and
active democracy and educated and
informed populace and so as I said
earlier today in a rally where I gave a
talk our task is huge it's to educate
people with the truth they're good
people in this country but they have
information that's that's what our job
so I came here to get some tools to go
out and educate people and
make better decisions
thank you so much
you learn about this evening that
particularly struck you
I'm always
taken by the clarity
boy Chomsky has
it makes things very understandable and
in such a way that it's not as heck
mystic
throw it at you he just gives it to you
in a way that you can digest them and
there anything in particular that you
see yourself inspired to do that you
have you been doing as a result of
finger
be honest yeah well I'm always inspired
to try to do more
you know I've written letters and I you
know
it's confusing I mean
it's really hard
the problem is so overwhelming
it's hard to know which works in return
with you guys
is a big plus
I always kind of gravitate towards
the fact that we're not going to make
I'm not getting it on the media we're
not getting on the radio on
I really think that if you can break
that barrier you can get venues out
nine people
what would happen we'll see
we were told a public opinion exchange
they would take matters into their own
sleeping inspired
yeah I'm always inspired it's the
and what brought you here this evening
tonight I came to see no attempt to
speak to citizens with Boulder because I
think that who shares my ideal home
values and lately I've been feeling
demoralized and hearing strong points of
Noam Chomsky but it makes me to feel
like there are people in the world or
believe in peace just like I do and
facts to back that up and that makes me
feel comforted in this difficult time
and as if that's enough is there
anything in particular that you feel
you're going to
well just being surrounded by about
2,000 people who live
my kids that don't sound smart
it was really wonderful to me
community
recorded with information that will
never be reporting on the mainstream
the common listener supported I know if
we comin up
