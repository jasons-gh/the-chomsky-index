and it's kind of interesting to see how
this happened
know a lot about it if you feel back 10
years 2008 out of the Republican Party
was beginning to move towards steps to
try to deal somehow with global warming
they were toying with the carbon tax cap
and trade so on John McCain ran for the
presidency on the Republican ticket in
2008 with a part of his platform was
efforts to deal with the threat of
global warming what happened the Koch
brothers huge Energy Corporation had
been working very hard to try to get the
Republican Party to be denialist to deny
the little ones Avenue went into high
gear they launched Duggar juggernaut
under the leadership of David Koch
bribing senators intimidating them
developing fake grassroots organizations
which would huge lobbying campaign they
turned the party around that wasn't
enough to turn the entire party into
basically denialists it was interesting
to look at the 2016 the last 2016
primary during the primary which was the
cream of the crop of the Republican
Party every single proposed candidate
either denied that what is happening is
happening there it doesn't matter the
moderates Jeb Bush establishment he said
well maybe global
mornings happening but we don't think we
should do anything about it
one of the most remarkable was on Kasich
the Governor of Ohio who was regarded as
the adult in the room the sensible
person to moderate to be possibly
elected he said global warming is
definitely happening serious but we in
Ohio are gonna keep producing coal and
we're not gonna apologize for that's the
worst of all it's likely the labor
minister in Australia opposition party
who's right in the middle of what's
happening with the continent burning
down the visiting the coal mines to
explain that we have to increase our
production and export of coal and that's
quite consistent with our policies is
preserving the environment hard to find
words to describe behavior of this kind
of course Trump is awesome you know he
just way out on the extremist end of all
of this but notice it's the whole forty
forty which people I know opens lock
stock and barrel no one else dares
daring to say a word and criticism of
him because they don't bridge the
adoring face I'm sorry
majority record Trump is the greatest
president in American history
Lincoln was the favorite and he goes
beyond this Mike Pompeo
the Secretary of State alleged to be the
series person in the administration but
he suggested that God sent Trump to the
United States to protect Israel from the
rent we're living
world of raving lunatics with enormous
power our two destroyers which they're
using
