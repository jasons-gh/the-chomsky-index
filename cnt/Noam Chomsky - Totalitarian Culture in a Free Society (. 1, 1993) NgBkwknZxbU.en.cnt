I'm dr. William Worrell on behalf the
University and the Department of
Psychology I'd like to welcome you here
on this very special occasion our guest
speaker today Noam Chomsky is the
best-known and most widely widely
recognized scholar intellectual in the
world today not only has he made
monumental contributions to the field of
linguistics but he has contributed much
to the thinking and research of many
other disciplines for example his work
in psycholinguistics has become the
foundation of psycholinguistics a branch
of psychology additionally he opposed
the strict environmental position of
American behaviorism specifically the
views of JB Watson and BF Skinner
professor Chomsky also ushered in the
doctrine of nativism and made it
respectable and viable in the
interpretation and understanding human
behavior particularly how children learn
to talk at this point I want to
introduce to you the person who is
primarily responsible for our guests
appearance today mr. Eric Epstein an
undergraduate psychology major ask our
guest to speak here and if it weren't
for him probably wouldn't be assembled
together here today so I think that it
is proper and fitting that
mr. Epson Stein make the formal
introduction of our guests
[Applause]
thank you dr. wall when the plans were
finalized for professor chomps his
lecture and we started to let people
know about his talk I heard some
interesting reactions how did you get
according to the New York Times arguably
the most important intellectual alive
America's leading social critic author
of over 70 books to agree to speak at
Kutztown University my response was very
simple we just called him up and asked
him in fact professor Chomsky will talk
to anyone who's willing to listen Noam
Chomsky has spoken to more college
students than any other speaker in the
world presenting his thesis and
motivating us to critically think I also
heard other reactions such as who is
Noam Chomsky I'm a political science and
journalism major a senior I'm sure I
would have heard of him if he was all
about although professor Chomsky is
quite well-known in many circles his
dissenting views and numerous books are
seldom discussed in political science or
journalism courses because I believe
they reveal too much about our society
and how it really functions
professor Chomsky's undergraduate and
graduate years were spent at the
University of Pennsylvania where he
received his PhD in linguistics in 1955
during the years 1951 to 1955 he was a
junior fellow of the Harvard University
Society of fellows he is an institute
professor at MIT where he's been since
1955 over the last 40 years he has
revolutionized the field of linguistics
from 1966 to 1976 Professor Shawn
Chomsky held the Ferrari P Ward
professor
of Modern Languages and linguistics
during the years 1958 to 1959 professor
Chomsky was in residence at the
Institute for Advanced Study at
Princeton New Jersey in the spring of
1969 he delivered the John Locke
lectures at Oxford in January 1970 he
delivered the Bertrand Russell memorial
lecture at Cambridge University in 1972
the Nehru Memorial Lecture in New Delhi
and in 1977 through his Ingo lecture in
Leiden professor Chomsky has received
honorary degrees from the University of
London the University of Massachusetts
and the University of Pennsylvania to
mention a few he is a recipient of the
distinguished scientific contribution
award of the American Psychological
Association and the Kyoto prize from
Japan in addition to his widely
recognized academic contributions
professor Chomsky is America's leading
dissident intellectual and again
according to The Times perhaps the
clearest voice of dissent in American
history professor Chomsky challenges us
to recognize the sickening hypocrisy in
our establishments claims supposedly in
the support of freedom and democracy at
home and abroad as well as to recognize
the flood of lies and distortions
present in every area of mainstream
political discourse he inspires us to
question authority and conventional
wisdom in all aspects of life personal
political and academic as well as to
think about our responsibility to act on
our decent human instincts
professor Chomsky will speak on some
comments on the academic and political
world totalitarian values in a free
society norm Thompson
[Applause]
before I speak about anything are you
getting the same echo that I'm getting
up here no okay
what afraid of somehow these two mics
were interacting in a unpleasant fashion
so I'll just suffer with it as long as
you don't have to the the topic that was
suggested to me totalitarian values in a
free society
it sounds like contradiction at first
but it actually isn't in fact it's a
rather traditional theme though it's not
usually put in those words it has to the
the issue arises from a basic problem in
the area government if you like that was
discussed among others by David Hume a
couple hundred years ago and his
fundamental work in political philosophy
Hume was puzzled by the fact that people
submit to Authority he wondered why that
is true and he posed a kind of paradox
of government the paradox is that power
lies in the hands of the governed
people are being governed so why don't
they use it why do they listen to their
rulers and his conclusion was that the
way that that happens is through control
over opinion if you can't control the
opinion of the those who are ruled they
would simply rise up and take power for
themselves and he concluded that this is
true of all societies from the most
despotic to the most free and I think
there's a lot of truth
to that doctor and although it doesn't
require two comments I think one is that
human der estimated the degree of
violence that is in the hands of
powerful states and that can control
people even if they no matter what their
opinions are that was true in his day
and it's even more dramatically true in
our day so if you were a dissident and
say pre Gorbachev Russia the life could
be pretty unpleasant in the days of
Stalin terribly unpleasant in the
post-war period it could mean exile or
punishment the once order and other than
varying degrees of unpleasantness if
you're a dissident in a typical US
dependency like say El Salvador
Guatemala you're likely to end up by a
roadside cut into shreds with machete
after being tortured if you're a
dissident in other US dependencies today
like say Haiti you're again likely to be
tortured or say murdered as one of the
president our Steve's leading backers
was the other day and if you're still
alive you can listen to you can read
this morning's New York Times and
discover that the United States isn't
going to do anything about it
they'll send down observers but they'll
only observe the torture and the terror
they won't be authorized
interfere with it well there various
ways in charge of controlling dissidents
by extreme violence and we should know
all about them since we run some of the
worst that's one problem in humans
account it's not the case that in the
most despotic societies control of
opinion is really necessary there are
other means but he's right about the
societies that are more free when the
government loses the capacity when state
power or other domestic power loses the
capacity to control people by violence
it naturally turns to control of opinion
and seeks to install totalitarian values
in one or another form in fact I think a
proper emendation of humans peridot
doctrine would be that control of
thought is much more significant and
much more important as societies become
more free for the obvious reason that if
you can't control people by the bludgeon
but you're committed to controlling them
that is it is in any community a
latarian society with power with power
highly concentrated as is every existing
society past present then you must turn
to other means of control and control of
opinion is about the only one left as
far as human recognition furthermore
that conclusion has been pretty widely
understood in the West in fact it's a
leading doctrine of modern political
science and modern political leadership
uncertainly of the corporate community
often articulated quite explicitly
throughout this century and in fact we
can trace it back hundreds of years in
the modern period to say take world war
ii the what i've proposed as an even
world war one the inundation that i
proposed to humans doctrine namely that
you need control of opinion
or in the more free societies that was
pretty clear in World War one the more
free societies where the anglo-american
ones the more autocratic society was
German and in fact written in the United
States far had by far the greatest
achievements in propaganda and flood
control during World War one fact which
was noticed and has been quite
influential for the period that followed
Woodrow Wilson had a problem when he was
elected president in 1916 the problem
was that he was elected on the program
of peace without victory but he was
committed to victory without peace so
something had have done about that and
in fact the country had to be somehow
turned from a pacifist country into a
country of the raving jingoist
war mongers well that took about six
months after under a huge propaganda
campaign of a kind which was quite
unprecedented with the leadership of
progressive intellectuals I should say
people in John Dewey circle who later
took great pride in this achievement
they described this as the first time
that a country had been driven to war
not by generals and kings and so on but
by the more intelligent members of the
community namely ourselves anybody who
speaks is one of the more intelligent
members of the community and the more
intelligent members of the community had
succeeded in bringing the population
why we must go to war using materials
provided for them by British
intelligence which had committed itself
as they put it to controlling the
thought of the world I was quite happy
to provide fabricated horror stories
about Belgium children with their arms
torn off and all sorts of other stuff
which in fact off I'm still read about
in history books but which was mostly
fabricated by British intelligence and
the whole pile of other stuff and the
rate of the Wilson administration
liberal Wilson administration
progressives in order to facilitate this
set up the first government propaganda
agency creel Commission which was
specifically committed to controlling
thoughts major task was to build up
support for an extremely unpopular war
and it's later tasks were to come to the
know and it was very successful one of
the founders of modern American
political science Harold Lasswell who is
in particular the founder of the field
that's called communications and so on
which basically means propaganda he
began his career with the study of
propaganda during the first world war he
described Woodrow Wilson as the
Generalissimo of propaganda and he was
much impressed by the achievements of
the creel Commission in bringing the
population into hysterical support for a
war that they opposed and all sorts of
jingoist fanaticism a hatred of all
things German and this and that and the
other thing simply by propaganda most
fabricated a lot of it provided by
British intelligence services well as I
say a lot of people notice this one of
the people who noticed it was Harold
Lasswell and it fed into a major part of
contemporary political science those
undergraduates and political science who
you were talking about certainly I've
heard of Harold Lasswell but I doubt
very much that they have read his work
on crop again which is quite interesting
another person who noticed this and was
influenced by it was Adolf Hitler if you
read mine com
you'll find that a large part of it is
devoted to his recognition of the great
achievements of anglo-american
propaganda and the inability of much
more authoritarian Germany to counter it
under the Germans tried to answer the
arguments but they were just wiped out
in the country and the competition of
British and American propaganda systems
were far superior and more effective and
they essentially massacred and Hitler
noticed that and determined that next
time around the German side would have
an efficient propaganda system which in
fact he went on to develop under Nazism
although if we were to really do a
comparative analysis it's not at all
clear that he ever came close to the
achievements of British and American
propaganda even in that period this
a-another I should say this went right
on into the Second World War so for
example when Franklin Roosevelt this is
quite independent of whether you think
it's right to get into the war wrong to
get into it I'm just describing what
happened a couple of months before Pearl
Harbor when President Roosevelt who was
trying to build up support for war for
the
and you know in the United States it was
pretty pacifist country at that time
it's any point in getting involved in
European conflict the one of his major
speeches
demet showed at Big Mac of the Western
Hemisphere which he said was a German
man and described the plans of Germany
to conquer the entire western hemisphere
babies and the map was in fact real it
had been provided by British
intelligence who had fabricated it again
and who were very eager to get the u.s.
into war and such efforts went on and
they were very intensive anybody my age
and remember from the Second World War
they were quite something to see
well political scientists and Adolf
Hitler recognise the achievements of the
propaganda of the Generalissimo of
propaganda Woodrow Wilson but probably
more significant and for the long term
was that the American business community
was very much impressed by this one of
the members of the Creole Commission the
Woodrow Wilson propaganda Commission was
Edward Bernays just at his 101st
birthday there to ago who is sort of the
grand old man of the American public
relations industry so it's one of great
founders of the PR industry he was in
the creel Commission and he recognized
that you really can do a lot to control
people's minds through propaganda and
we put to use and there are people
around pay for that sort of thing so you
put it to use for the people are going
to pay for it which means the business
community now that didn't initiate the
use of the product the PR industry the
public relations industry is a huge
industry it's an American invention
nobody knows quite how big it is because
private corporations are immune to
public inspection you know government
sometimes leaked documents but
corporations don't so that's real
totalitarian private power you can't get
into it but occasionally some material
comes out and you know Senate inquiries
or something
the last time I saw it was about late
70s when it was estimated that the PR
industry spends about a million dollars
a year in grassroots propaganda and
unknown further amounts and what is
sometimes called treetop propaganda that
is trying to get after smart guys you
know universities and academic
institutions and educated people folks
like us in other words and there's
unknown amount spent in that and maybe a
billion dollars for grassroots
propaganda at that time undoubtedly far
higher since the PR industry took off in
the early part of this century that was
a period when American capitalism was
undergoing a change from the more or
less I mean some degree of proprietary
competitive capitalism to highly
administered centralized capitalism
under big and corporate control it was
the period when people were worried
about trusts and things like that it was
we always had a very intervention a
state nobody ever believed that
capitalism could function but it used to
be more more competitive and more
proprietary in the 19th century there's
a big change taking place and there was
a lot of concern about it people didn't
like the Trust's for one thing because
they were so corrupt and for another
thing because they were so violent it
was a period of they had power over they
had state power at their hands people
who lived around here back in that
period know that very well
violent strike breaking and terror and
Pennsylvania was notorious in fact for
the use of state terror to violently
suppress labor organization and that
sort of thing homestead being the major
example the there was a lot of concern
in the country about this shift and the
there's a lot of hatred of the new
magnates John Rockefeller and those guys
and the PR industry was in fact
developed as an attempt to deal with
this to bring people to accept these
folks as sort of nice friendly people
who are trying to help us all out and
took off at that period it was pretty
successful in fact had remarkable
success with the first world war and
this new insight into the importance and
the ability to control people's thought
by propaganda it really took off and
immediately the latter stage of the
Second World War and afterwards there
was an extraordinarily successful state
business state corporate propaganda
campaign went well beyond propaganda
brief violent - in order to try to
destroy the incipient labor movement to
smash up strikes to destroy it to
demolish independent thought to stop
independent politics to me to place the
country under really total business
control Wilson's Red Scare was a large
part of this thousands of people exiled
and so on and I was very successful in
the 1920s the country was very passive
it was strictly under business control
and in fact the business community
thought that this achievement had
everyone thought pretty much that this
achievement had succeeded in beating
back the threat of democracy in the
United States probably permanently
threat of democracy and the labor
organizing well that that belief
collapsed and the and it's at that point
that the PR industry really took off
with programming with quite quite
frankly incidentally you look at
written at that time they're all about
propaganda and the need for propaganda
in a free society and I have to control
the people and so on and so forth the
[Music]
the the phrases that were used were
things like you know you have to control
the public mind because the public mind
is the greatest threat to corporations
pretty much humans doctrine but now
applied to private power not just food
government about the in the 1930s the
with the depression the passivity of the
population was broken there was a new
democratic thrust American workers began
to organize they finally got the rights
that had been achieved in Europe decades
earlier and this rising threat of
democracy and social justice really sent
fear into the business community again
the National Association of
Manufacturers at that time was writing
about what they call the hazard facing
industrialists in the rising political
power of the masses you'll notice it
kind of vulgar Marxist tinge to that but
that's common in the business literature
and also in government documents it
reads like older Marxist texts usually
it's just that all the values are
inverted the terminologies are saying
highlight class conscious group so they
were very much worried about the rising
political power of the masses which is a
had the greatest hazard facing
industrialists and I'm just quoting from
an AM literature they said that they're
thinking the thinking of the masses must
be directed to more proper channels or
we
definitely hitted for adversity well
again a big campaign start in the latter
part of the 1930s the latter part of the
Roosevelt administration in part it used
the traditional methods a resort to
state violence to murder strikers and so
on that was going on right around here
incidentally the little steel strikes in
the late 30s but more on where they
began to rely on flood control as a more
efficacious device of controlling people
than violence and also one more
available in a much in a society that
was really becoming more free when the
government didn't have the power was
losing the power to control people by
the bludgeon the so you began the that's
at the time when right in Pennsylvania
in fact you found the they experimented
with what we're called scientific
methods of strikebreaking meaning ways
of formulas for moving into a community
with massive public relations campaigns
to try to convince the population that
there's a split between us and them you
know us we guys are the sober working
man the housewife taking care of her
children you know the storekeeper
tending take care of his store or the
executive and the local corporation
laboring day and night for the benefit
of the entire population and so on
that's us and them are foreigners who
are trying to come in and break up our
harmony and attack them there
destroy our values and disrupt their
lives and so on like the ones were
trying to organize the CIO that's it
these campaigns had an enormous amount
of this also involved with lots of other
things but that was the basic story try
to set up a picture of harmony and
Americanism on the one side which is
classless of course and disruption and
you know anarchism and also visit my and
you pick it on the other side which was
going to disrupt all of this nice stuff
that presents a particular vision of
what America is America is a class
dictatorship run by the business
community the way it was in the 1920s
with everybody else passes and
marginalized that's Americanism and the
people who disrupt that are
anti-american and against their lives
and against our communities and we got
to stop well that was the main theme and
it turned out to be pretty successful in
fact business was quite impressed by
these scientific methods of
strikebreaking as they were called the
project was put on hold during the
Second World War you know there was
another thing to worry about but it was
picked up very quickly right afterwards
and immediately after the Second World
War a huge campaign developed to try to
beat back the threat of democracy and
social movements and so on that had
developed in fact during the 1930s and
it was extremely successful that's one
of the reasons why the United States is
off the international spectrum on most
issues like say workers rights or health
or even I was Larry always talking about
health now and as everyone knows this is
the only industrial country that doesn't
have some form of national health care
everybody else has it and has had it
forever it's much more efficient it's
much cheaper reaches a lot more people
doesn't have all the problems of the
highly bureaucratized and
private-like basic systems but we can't
happen and in fact it was proposed that
was proposed by Harry Truman in fact
back in the mid 40s and beaten back by a
huge lobbying campaign of business
precisely on the basis that I described
anti-american hosts the harmony
attacking our fundamental rights
pointy-headed bureaucrats Bolsheviks I'm
in usual business and it was successful
remember there's no counterpart the
corporate propaganda they own the place
so when there's a propaganda campaigns
like 99% on one side maybe 1% on the
other and in fact Truman later objected
look at his own writings embark B he
describes this as the biggest business
campaign in history which had simply
eliminated the possibility of elementary
social justice the kind that you have in
every other country let alone
efficiencies much more efficient these
other systems the in the United States
have a major achievement we're going
through them another phase of it right
now that's worth looking at another
example was the office of Price
Administration there were huge wartime
profits but prices were kept down wages
were kept down and the office of Price
Administration had some effect on
lowering prices so that people could buy
things business was naturally strongly
opposed to that the public was strongly
in favor continuing it so if you look at
polls around 1945 it's like you know 80
percent in favor of continuing it
business again launched a huge public
relations campaign
which within about six months had turned
the figures around about eight figures
like 75% opposition and so on and
Congress smashed
well these again are great achievements
of propaganda they were noticed I mean
it was the the next thing that came
along was the taft-hartley bill which
essentially terminated the possibility
of labor organizing and it was followed
by various other things one of the
reasons why the United States has is now
has now one of the weakest labor
movements in the world in the industrial
world you know I'm like not as bad as
some fascist country but in the sort of
advanced industrial world the United
States is again off the spectrum on
labor rights in fact astonishingly the
United States was condemned last year by
the International Labor Organization
which never condemns any of its rich
sponsors because the United States was
the only industrial country that wasn't
permitting the right to strike meaning
it was allowing what are called
permanent replacement workers meaning
you go on strike we hire scabs and
you're out and that's a rat gross
violation of international labor
standards but has been building up in
the United States and finally succeeded
Reagan pushed it through with the flight
yeah yeah guys who went to control
towers
get the name for him and it really ran
through with the caterpillar strike in
1992 which is a major event which caused
in fact the condemnation so the United
States is well off the international
spectrum on that one again and remember
this is the most free society in the
world
I mean this as it is in fact this is
there's no other country which none that
I know of where the government is so
constrained in its capacity to interfere
and control you know sort of stop free
speech or you know break into the
newspapers or whatever very comparable
speaking very free country consequently
I think much more committed that the
tellurian values because they're
necessary you have to control people
somehow it's better not to have things
like labor movements and organized
populations and so on and so forth
because they might do something with
their freedom can't really control on
that force
well that's there's all sorts of methods
of doing this kind of thing let's go
back to some of the thinking behind it
the going back to say Howard like Harold
Lasswell who was one of the original
pioneers of this he in back in the 20s
and 30s people used to be pretty frank
kind of less Orwellian society today so
when they were involved in propaganda
they called the propaganda so if you
look at say the encyclopedia of social
sciences in 1933 there in fact
seong propaganda written by Harold
Lasswell and he describes how important
it is particularly free societies like
other curious analysts he recognized
that propaganda becomes more important
as you move away from more authoritarian
society is what nowadays we would call
totalitarian societies that use
determinant so as you move away from
these you gotta have a greater reliance
on propaganda and you know which he said
is it propaganda he said is as neutral
as a pump handle you use it for good you
can use it for bad I didn't raise the
question of who's gonna be pushing the
pump that's somebody else's domain but
propaganda is neutral you don't good or
bad and the and if you look at the
distribution of power in the society you
can answer the unasked question the real
so said for up again it's necessary
because he said we should because of the
ignorance and stupidity of the masses
he said we should not succumb to what he
called democratic dogmatism about people
being the best judges of their own
interests they're not we smart guys are
the best judges of their own interests
and therefore we got to make sure that
these ignorant and stupid masses don't
enter the public arena or every they'll
suffer too I mean they're much better
off if we run the affairs for them but
unfortunately you know we can't tend to
the Gulag and put them in gas chambers
think so therefore we have to control
their thinking that's the they didn't
say that I'm adding that but that's the
kind of logic that lies behind it to put
it in sort of crass they're not in
accurate terms the these views that he
was developing then had in fact been
articulated much more clearly and and in
a way more influential about decade
earlier by walter Lippmann who was a
major commentator on public affairs or
the Dean of American journalism and the
leading progressive intellectual came
out of there Wilson Dewey and who's who
had a background in the propaganda
agencies of the First World War as well
during the 1920s he wrote extensively on
these topics and what are called if you
pick up his essays in the bookstore
you'll notice they're called progressive
essays on democracy and they did
represent the progressive view the
progressive view of democracy as Wilson
developed it and as is constantly
assumed is that there are two categories
of people there are what he called the
responsible men that's a smart guys
again there's the responsible men who
were a small group and then there are
those who we call the ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders that's the
population so there's a problem here we
got to make sure it's humans problem how
do we make sure that the ignorant and
meddlesome Outsiders don't meddle and
what is
none of their business namely public
affairs and leave it to the responsible
men is that the main problem is he said
to protect ourselves from the trampling
and the rage of the bewildered herd
that's this huge mass of people out
there and if we and this is fall out of
pure benevolence and it's just because
we want to do that help them you know we
want to help them and if this bewildered
her and starts meddling and stuff that's
none of their business though all kind
of problems so we have to do something
and it's obvious what we have to do we
don't control them by force we control
them by propaganda and we try to reach a
state which he described he said look
it's not a it's not a what we would
nowadays call it the italic Aryan
Society it's a free society and in a
free democratic society he said the
ignorant the meddlesome Outsiders do
have a function because it's democratic
their function is to be spectators of
action not participants and they're
allowed to look in other words say on
treatment total ignorance the
furthermore they're allowed to
participate in a very special fashion
periodically they're to be given an
opportunity to lend their weight to one
or another representative of the
responsible manner
that's called an election and after that
they're supposed to go home and be
spectators again that's the role of the
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders in a
free society and and
that that's I'm now giving the
progressive view there's a spectrum of
views on this this is the sort of
liberal progressive side it goes over to
the reactionary side when you get to the
more reactionary side like say the
Reagan administration their view is that
the population shouldn't even be
spectators so even the spectator role is
to be excluded and you can see it very
clearly in their politics I mean they
call themselves conservatives that's a
joke they were Radical status as
believers in an extremely powerful state
which furthermore has to be which grew
enormously under the Reagan years I
should say and has to be vast be a
welfare state for the rich that's the
point
that's so it's a big welfare state look
at the change in income distribution and
so on you can see it in fact you look at
polls you can see it there's a reason
why Reagan is the most disliked ex
living ex-president today ranking right
alongside Richard Nixon percentage
points pardons particularly among
working people and so-called Reagan
Democrats and one of the most despised
people in public life there's a reason
for that and the reason is exactly the
system not that he had anything to do
with it you know he was just like
reading his lines but the people behind
it and I sort of put him up there to
read the lines they had a lot to do with
it and they were they believes been a
very powerful interventionist state and
which defied the ignorant and meddlesome
Outsiders aren't even supposed to be
spectators so the Reagan administration
introduced very high levels of
censorship and secrecy unprecedented in
fact to prevent the public from knowing
what was going on one of the reasons why
clandestine operations shot up to such a
peak historically unprecedented peak in
the Reagan administration was that the
purpose of clandestine you know when a
government resorts to clandestine
operations that's a weapon against its
own population on everybody else
you know like they run a clandestine
terror war in Central America the guys
are getting tortured and killed know all
about it and the dozens of other
countries that are participating in it
you know providing advice advisors for
the state terrorists and funding and so
on they know all about it in fact the
only people aren't supposed to know
anything about it or the domestic
population that's what's called a
clandestine operation and the purpose of
them is to keep the ignorant meddlesome
outsiders away from even the spectator
rule the Reagan administration also
instituted a propaganda state propaganda
agency illegal was they later conceded
when I was exposed which was running
something called operation truth
operation truth was about what you'd
expect if you read in 1984 the idea was
to try to propaganda as the population
into accepting you know the various
things they were up to like demonizing
the Sandinistas and whatever else that
were up to and when it was finally
exposed actually one of the Reagan
officials described it as honestly as
the kind of operation you would carry
out an enemy territories meaning we were
carrying this operation out among the
enemy namely the population of the
United States and they had to be kept
from even seeing what was going on so
that's the reactionary end of the
spectrum and there is a choice you know
democracies don't correct theories or a
falls between those linens well the the
the the post going back to the Second
World War the post Second World War
propaganda campaign had very much the
effects of the post first world war
propaganda campaign it created a period
of passivity passivity and apathy that's
what's called the apathetic 50s and it
was real very and with a lot of
repression and elimination of
independent thought and so on and so
forth
that broke down - in this case not from
a depression but from the ferment of the
1960's which sort of somehow broke
through all this interesting how it
happened but anyway did happen and that
again caused tremendous fear and anger
on the part of a league in fact there
was a name for what happened it was
called a crisis of democracy and in fact
it's a major study which everyone should
read I always recommend that called the
crisis of democracy
library probably has it published in
1975 it was the first major publication
of the trilateral commission trilateral
commission is a internet it's trilateral
because it's based in your Japan in the
United States it's sort of a Leeds and
in fact liberal elites liberal
internationalists League or Ann today
leads from the three major power centers
and their first major publication in
1975 and really the only major
publication in fact about the only
interesting thing they've done was -
this is a group out of which Carter came
and in fact his entire cabinet came from
there that sort of identifies them in
the political spectrum the their first
the only major publication was the
crisis of democracy and they were
referring to the problems that arose in
all the three trilateral areas in the
1960s and what happened was well you
this threat of democracy was arising
again people normally marginalized and
pathetic people were becoming we're
entering into the public arena they were
going to organize they were beginning
things they were asking questions they
were pressing their demands public you
know they were trying to take part in
the public process to be something other
than spectators naive people could say
that's democracy but you know you're
sophisticated one of the responsible may
be had a good education like you get
here I guess you know that that's a
crisis of democracy that has to be
beaten back and that's the way they
describe the the American spokesperson
that this professor at Harvard he's now
a professor of the science of Government
at Harvard I love that title so the
professor of the science of Government
at Harvard and the Huntington who was
the American reporter at this thing he
looked back kind of nostalgic to the
days of the Truman administration when
he said Truman was able to run the
country with the help of a small group
of Wall Street lawyers and financiers
and that was democracy crisis then but
now we've got this business of the 1960s
with minorities and women and young
people and all sorts of normally
marginalised and passive groups somehow
trying to enter this system and that's
and that makes the society uncover nobly
said it's a problem governability and
the answer is obvious you have to beat
them back to passivity and obedience and
since this is a free society you can't
do it by force so you have to go back to
the methods of propaganda and in fact
it's been a huge ideological campaign
ever since then trying to beat back the
heresy you're living through it I
presume I don't have to talk about it a
lot well in in this case I don't think
it's been beaten back it's interesting
that's been much less successful than it
was in the 20s and the 50s but
an effective rate live issue right now
the so just to summarize what I'm saying
so far the there is absolutely nothing
surprising about the fact that indeed it
is a fact that there are huge efforts to
install the pellet Aryan values in an
intellectual culture in a society that
it's more free in fact it's exactly what
you ought to expect and it's exactly
what we find in the country where they
stood Stalinist Russia you didn't really
care that much about what people thought
because there were a lot of other ways
to control and in fact they turned out
had a lot more access to information and
alternative views and so on it wasn't a
big problem because nothing they could
do about it anyway they thought so there
were some studies done here by
government-funded Russian research
centers and so on in the late 1970s
trying to give some estimate of you know
where Russians
this isn't the worst period of Russian
repression you know this oppression a
few days trying to find but still
totalitarian trying to see you know what
people read and what they listened to
and where they're getting information
from and so on and you know you couldn't
go in there and carry out holes the
numbers yet take with sometimes meant to
be precise estimates but the estimates
are quite intriguing it turned out that
about three-quarters of the population
was listening to foreign broadcasts
meaning getting Western news regularly
and about 95 percent of the more
educated sectors white color you know
that sort of thing we're listening to
foreign broadcast with regard to summon
stuff you know
he leads a technically illegal
underground this isn't literature
pamphlet
and a street corner about 50 close to
50% of the sort of white-collar or semi
educated people were reading them and
about 15% of blue-collar workers were
reading them well you know in the United
States the equivalent of some has got
some of this isn't Journal you know if
it could reach 0 0.01 percent of the
population you know everybody would be
having parties at the nearest local bar
or something but in a country that's
discipline person nobody listens to
foreign broadcast you did a study here
of who listens to the foreign broadcast
it would be statistically undetectable
the well that's important you know it's
much more important in a free society to
constrain the forms of information that
reach people if we were to look at the
educational system we would find similar
things and it must of course have an
appearance of it's got to be credible so
it's extremely important to have inside
the media for example people who are
considered to be critics you know
critics courageous critics of the system
you know does that sort of thing but
they play a very crude their role is to
give the system credibility but in order
but nevertheless not to undermine it so
there's a very narrow definition of that
rule it's somebody who accepts all the
doctrines but gives us slightly what
soft slant to them so for example if you
there's been a there's a ton of
documentation on this if you're
interested there's thousands of pages of
the
but just to take one example of how it
works I was just well studied if you
take say the 1980s the biggest foreign
policy issue was how to destroy the
garage I mean that was the major
propaganda issue you know we've got to
run this terrorist war against Nicaragua
which drives it down to what it now is
namely about the level of Haiti with
tens of thousands of people starving
kids starving in the streets being kept
alive by women but the soup kitchens and
political system destroyed and
everything else that is the goal bring
it back to what was called the Central
American mode by the liberal press by
The Washington Post and so on so and
there was a debate about this I mean you
all remember this huge issue in the
1980s in fact it was the major foreign
policy issue now if you look at the an
interesting indication of the range of
opinion and the role of liberal doves
and critics is given by a study of the
opinion that was permitted in the
liberal press that with two major
national journals in the United States
the New York Times in the Washington
Post both of which are considered
liberal so the New York Times for
example is described in a foreign policy
literature as the establishment
that's what it's called in fact so we we
just look at the establishment left and
the Washington Post which is even more
liberal which happen to be the most
important because of the two big
national papers they set the framework
within which most other papers and even
television follows they kind of give an
agenda if we look at the opinion pieces
you know iPads editorials and so on in
that over over that period what are we
fine well actually did a study of that
for the to picking two periods when
there was absolute peak intensity you
know hundreds of kids coming out in a
few months it's extremely unusual and
they were very revealing they there was
first of all close to a hundred percent
agreement that the governor Nicaragua
had to be overthrown the only reason it
wasn't a hundred percent was that once
in a while they'd allow a small
statement by the ambassador of Nicaragua
and once in the entire period I looked
at they allowed an op-ed by somebody who
actually knew something about the region
a doctor is the only person who ever
didn't do anything about it was a
medical person who was involved in
medicine and Caribbean region who simply
described the differences between the
health programs that were going on in
the garage which he'd taken farted and
observed and those that were going on in
other programs and it was very probe
Sunday's to article so that was the one
exception apart
the Nicaragua wasn't a hundred percent
it was like you know I'm ninety-nine
percent agreement that you got overthrow
the government on the only and there was
a division on how you do it and that
division was roughly 50/50 the about
half the writers said you'd do it by
violence you run on terrorists or you
know you kill people torturing them and
so on and so forth they use those words
but that's what it comes down to you're
on the contra war and that will get rid
of the you know the cancer that's George
Schultz called it that'll excise the
cancer the other fifty percent
approximately said we should do it by
more cost-effective means like after all
it's a very weak tiny country and we're
this huge powerful monster so we can
just strangle by economic strangulation
and by diplomatic isolation and so on
that'll work and it's much more
cost-effective so ugly is torture your
children and that sort of thing
and it's gonna work anyway those were
called that does okay now it's not that
the no it's kind of interesting to
compare this with the attitude of the
business community which is a dominant
force in the United States well if you
really believe you know that the
business community just controls the
media you'd predict that in among
corporate executives say they'd also be
50/50 split on how to get rid of the
cancer but turns out that's not quite
true it was about an 80/20 split meaning
about eighty percent of corporate
executives were were called does they
thought you ought to strangle them by
economic illegal of course economic
warfare and political isolation and so
on and only about twenty percent thought
you ought to do it by terror so in fact
the media we're not
swaye reflecting the attitudes of the
business community they were far more
hawkish that as they went over and where
to the government side which said in
this state corporate Nexus there's a
power there are some divisions and the
media tended to be more on the state
side than just on the corporate side
that's the basic conclusion that comes
out that the media you know are always
criticized for being too liberal and
this and that this is what you find over
and over again and the crucial role of
the Liberals has to be understood if you
look at the extreme does you know feel
like say Tom wicker in the New York
Times he was very much opposed to the
Contra war he says I'm going to work
costs too much and so on he said we have
to find other methods to restore the
Sandinistas to regional standards I
understand what regional standards are
regional standards for example of the
standards of sale Salvador in Guatemala
which we're at that point terrorist
states that we were supplying and
training were killing killing maybe
200,000 people in those years and not
just killing I mean mutilating torturing
you know and so on that's the regional
standards and from the double point of
view that's where the movement on
television there's also a spectrum you
know there's talk shows and there's
there's a representative the left if you
watch television is called name Michael
Kinsley
he kind of represents the left view of
things and he wrote about this too we go
to the W namely that you shouldn't it
was against the Contra war sure and but
he have very interesting attitude I mean
around this period it was revealed that
the Southtown the American command and
Panama that runs this whole show the
chief General testified in Congress and
he said we're training the Contra forces
to attack what are called soft targets
not to duke it out with us and
initiatives as he put it so the ideas
were training our terrorist forces to
avoid the military in Nicaragua because
way down and to go after soft targets
meaning that means civilian targets
things like health clinics and
agricultural cooperatives and so on well
you know that aroused some questions
this state department was then asked
about that and they said yes their
spokesman Charles Redmond stated
officially that yes we authorized a tax
on coal agricultural cooperatives and so
on and that's legitimate because of the
people there carry arms so therefore
they're authentic military targets well
America's watch which is the leading
human rights group challenged this
they're the only people who challenge
that as far as I know the president
nothing wrong with it they challenged it
and said well they asked him do you mean
for example that it's legitimate for say
I've needed all terrorists to attack an
Israeli kibbutz and murder children
because people are armed there as they
obviously are didn't answers but Michael
Kinsley picked it up and wrote an
article in which he said we should not
be too quick he was critical of
America's watch and he said we should
not be too quick to condemn the resort
to terrorist violence I have to think
about it first we have to ask whether it
is cost-effective and the way we
determine
is by measuring what he called the
amount of blood that is poured in
against what comes out of the weather
democracy comes out of the other side of
course what we call democracy and we
make that decision so we have to measure
you know the blood and gore that's
poured in by the terrorism against the
output and if it turns out to be cost
effective then we shouldn't really
condemn the attacks on soft targets in
fact we should approve of them well I'm
now off at the far liberal end you know
and the people in that position play a
very significant role in a free society
they set the limits of debate it's very
important that denounced them as being
anti-american and to call the New York
Times the establishment left and to rage
about how the press is under the control
of liberals and so on and in fact it's
not untrue
like when Limbaugh and these guys say
that they're sort of right and the
reason is that in a well-run propaganda
system that's exactly what you'd do if
dictators have any brains that's exactly
what they would do they would let their
ideological institutions be run by
people who define themselves as critics
and in fact are sometimes kind of
soft-hearted and you know raise
questions about the amount of blood and
gore that support in that sort of
business but who basically understand
except all the underlying premises they
would be the liberal critics you could
then denounce them as being entity
whatever country it is I might mention
in this connection that there's only two
countries in the world that I know of
where the concept of end
xxxx being the name of the country is
taken seriously
one is Stalinist Russia where anti
Soviet ISM was absolutely the worst
crime you know the biggest charge
against anybody is anti Soviet ISM the
others the United States where you have
respected books written by you know
scholars called anti-americanism which
are respectfully reviewed in the press
and they talk about people who are
undermining the American Way in a
country that had even a minimal
democratic tradition say Italy if
somebody were to publish a book in Italy
on antagonism people just laugh you know
I mean try to sell that in Milan or
wrong and so on things that Jovie
yeah sure all antia because we're seen
no but the but in countries with a real
totalitarian culture like say Stalinist
Russia or the United States the notion
anti-americanism are anti Soviet ISM has
taken very seriously and in fact this
goes right back to these extraordinary
propaganda campaigns about selling the
American Way and you know on American
activities and so on and so forth and
again these are it's very striking that
this should show up in a free society
and I think entirely natural well what I
just mentioned about the Nicaragua case
let go I mean that's standard in fact
it's hard to find that you know lots and
lots of cases and looked at hard to find
any exception to this I mean you
sometimes find that the media are not
strictly following say the positions of
Corporate America and it's typically
like the one I just described they're
even harsher weather is it was a break
between state power and corporate power
the media often tend to move more
towards state power that incidentally
goes on right now so after ten years of
destroying Nicaragua through a terrorist
war actually that's not my judgment
remember the United States was condemned
by the World Court with International
Court of Justice for the unlawful use of
force in its war against Nicaragua
actually the media response to that was
quite interesting almost a hundred
percent of the media everyone dismissed
it of course and almost 100 percent of
the media condemned the World Court for
discrediting itself by accusing the
United States of being the league
world's leading terrorist after a court
hearing and demanding that the United
States offer what would amount to
billions of dollars of reparations the
the the World Court was a hostile forum
as the New York Times put it so
therefore its decision didn't matter
thorough there any American tools you
can tell by the fact that they didn't
like our terrorist activities so after
ten years of course that they totally
rejected it and we forced Nicaragua to
abandon its clans we forced the
Nicaraguan government to abandon its
claims to which they were entitled but
claims for reparations on a threat of
even worse if they didn't give it up and
there was actually an agreement made I
don't think it's ever been published and
so far the New York Times
you know how letters to the editor by
international lawyer is referring to it
but the in fact if you look at the world
that the World Court records there was
an agreement that Nicaragua said okay
they demanded the claims because they
had made an arrangement that the United
States would provide aid instead that
was the condition for abandoning the
claims to which they were entitled last
June or July I forget a couple months
ago the Senate voted near unanimously to
curtail all aid to Nicaragua until
Nicaragua demonstrated that it was not
involved in terrorist activities and
allowed the FBI in to investigate to
make sure that was true that's after we
have carried out a 10-year terrorist
campaign which destroyed the country
which killed maybe thirty or forty
thousand people which left it at the
level roughly of Haiti which was
condemned by the World Court now we
demand that they prove that they are not
involved in terrorism and that sales
through the Senate without a vote and of
course without a comment in the press a
couple of days later a couple of days
ago they've got even more current
testing the Senate passed a vote ninety
four to four which was my name's see it
mentioned in the press it was on the
wires the maybe was reported around here
the who voted which way because they can
get much information so there were four
people with it it said we will cut off
all aid to Nicaragua that's permanent
until it returns or properly compensates
we judge propriety not like the world
court properly compensates for
properties confiscated from Americans
was
it's confiscated by Americans mean that
means Somoza properties that means
properties owned by North American
Americans under the Somoza period under
the period of this monstrous gangster
who was torturing the population and and
of his rule killed maybe forty fifty
thousand people with our support and was
finally driven out people who had
property under that tyranny were people
who are participating in and that they
had property because they were part of
that system of tyranny and robbery and
unless their properties are returned
we're going to cancel at the fact that
we had an agreement with them that had
them you know cancel their claims
against us at the World Court on
condition we provide aid of course now
even looks at the Fed know he knows
about it nor they will they know about
it as press isn't going to allow it to
be mentioned even in letters well you
know these are levels of chimeric
Imperial and arrogance that are
extremely hard to achieve in
totalitarian society it's very hard to
find counterparts to that but you can do
it when you have deeply instilled
totalitarian values so it doesn't occur
to anybody to ask the obvious questions
but such matters raised and there's
plenty of them
I don't I could go on and on with more
and more examples as I say there's a
huge literature on this but it's
extremely systematic if somebody can
find an exception to this it would be
interesting to find nobody's found one
yet and the critique of it also it
doesn't matter since that doesn't
public discourse in fact you could prove
all of this with the certainty of
physics and it wouldn't matter because
in a properly controlled ideological
system the wrong thoughts are never
spoken okay so you just keep them out
and then corporate media richard lee
with the state and corporate power
that's not very hard they're kept out of
the academic institutions - with except
for the most marginal exceptions so you
know people it's a free country
so people are allowed to go around the
country talking about these things and
some small publisher somewhere can
publish it which if you can never hear
about it you can buy and there's a
couple of journals around so maybe you
know like 1% of the population or
something knows something about these
things but and since it's a free society
you don't do anything - I can't stick
them in jail and that sort of business
but it's very important that the
responsible man you know the people in
the mainstream they've got to be deeply
indoctrinated now I should finally add I
mean last comment on the stuff it's not
in the least clear that this propaganda
works for the general population in fact
there's a pretty strong evidence that it
doesn't so it certainly works very well
among the educated classes I mean there
it's just overwhelming but if you look
at the general population it doesn't
seem to work well at all in fact on
issue after issue the general puppy
we're a heavily polled society there's a
very good reason for that
polls are mostly run by business they
want to keep their finger on the public
pulse if you're running huge propaganda
and to control the public mind you've
got to know what people think
so the extensive polling which you know
occasionally makes the newspapers but
mostly it goes to the business community
and we know a lot about public attitudes
on all sorts of things and pretty
dramatically they're off the political
spectrum on almost every issue so you
take say health care which I mentioned
before there's been polls on health ever
since the mid 40s and while the
establishment you know what the press
say it's like a hundred percent against
allowing the United States to join the
modern world and to have the kind of
health system everybody else has the
public has always been for either
majorities or considerable plurality is
you know depending on the questions are
asked have been in favor of some version
of national health care the term that's
used for that in the United States now
is a Canadian style system the reason
for the term is that people know that
Canada exists you know it's close enough
so you sort of see it right there but in
fact the Canadian style systems just
system everybody has you know except for
us and in fact Canada has one of the
least efficient of them but most of the
considerable majority and that remains
the case like if you read the big is a
huge media campaign now going on to try
to ram through Clinton's new version of
this insurance company based highly
bureaucratic very inefficient system and
the media are again about a hundred
percent in favor of it but if you read
the big articles like you know these
front page articles in the New York
Times and so on if you get down to
second page you know the continuation
page at the bottom of the column there
will be a comment that says
59% of the population are in favor of a
canadian-style
system but that's not in the cards it's
not of course because it's called
politically impossible politically
impossible means big corporations are in
favor of it and the wealthy are in favor
of it so it's politically impossible the
men are from 99 percent of the
population 1 the fact that 59% monitor
you know whatever the number is
depending on how asked the question is a
pretty remarkable fact because they
never heard that anybody is in favor of
it you know each person who says I'm in
favor of things I'm the only person of
world is in favor of it because they've
never seen anywhere else No
so those numbers are you know extremely
unusual I mean if the issues were ever
allowed to appear it wouldn't be 59
percent or whatever the number is it
with the overwhelming and that's been
true since the 1940s there are studies
of polls since nineteen forties are
quite consistently like that and it just
it doesn't matter as long as the public
remain spectators and not participants
it doesn't matter and if you look at
other issues it's quite the same so
let's say take the Vietnam War in among
educated people the spectrum is
extremely narrow the Vietnam War was is
considered if you're a liberal it was a
mistake
our I'm quoting now from the extreme
liberals our blundering efforts to do
good turned into a disaster that's
Anthony Lewis the New York Times or it
was an excess of disinterested
benevolence and righteousness the
leading academic and critical john king
Fairbank and so on that's the kind of
liberal extreme they were from there but
it was a noble cause in which we
defended South Vietnam and maybe we made
a mistake and maybe was too costly to us
that we should have gotten out or not
gotten in that's the general educated
attitude on the other hand if you look
at the population it's astonishing
although they never heard any
like this up until the most recent polls
you know running from 1970 up till the
present about 70% of the population plus
or minus a few percentages have held in
the position that the war was not a
mistake it was fundamentally wrong and a
moron
not on say well you know that's not you
know that's a radical difference between
the general population and the educated
population it's as a name that's called
the Vietnam syndrome you know it's kind
of disease that one of the rate and I
did electoral is called it sickly
inhibitions against the use of military
force phrase right out of the Nazi base
Norman but word but they can't eradicate
the disease from the general population
all those been an enormous effort to do
it and if you go through issue after
issue you find something kind of similar
which is sort of striking and raises
some questions about whether the
propaganda campaign is actually working
among the public but it's working in one
important sense it's got the public
marginalised there in the spectator role
they're isolated atomized they may not
like things and so on but they have the
feeling they can't do anything about it
power of somewhere else which is not
wrong but of course doesn't have to be
true it's not a law of nature the there
have been attempts throughout our
history to keep the wildered heard
bewildered and you know not meddling in
stuff that's not their affairs
repeatedly the public is broken through
and done something about that and it can
certainly do it again but the beginnings
of wisdom on this
to understand that least the way the
indoctrination system works
[Applause]
we hit backward
okay we have time for you guys for the
ignorant meddlesome outsiders the middle
if you feel so inclined so please be as
meddlesome as you like
are there some microphones or no no
microphones down okay
20 years ago when we were still
as a child of that period in the sense
it does seem to me that you yourself
have become almost cynical
while their community war effort
military-industrial complex early
we're very real things during the Civil
Rights Vietnam women
Roger
workers out for mothers of dead soldiers
were not at home to be seen just as
bewildered spectators although it might
be nice there
we did some stuff
yeah
but don't succeed no I agree I agree and
I greatly completely I had mentioned
that Fischer said it more but I
mentioned I mentioned that there have
been two recent periods three reason
periods actually of massive propaganda
efforts to try to drive the population
back into passivity
the first was Woodrow Wilson's the
second was around late thirties through
you know right after the Second World
War both of which succeeded first one
was broken by the depression the second
was broken by what we call the sixties
you know and as I said the second one
the third one hasn't succeeded in fact
if you look I think what you said is
exactly correct I mean what are the what
I mentioned about the you know Vietnam
so in droves an example but the 80s were
much more active than the sixties
sure yeah now of course we have if
potentials always there you know I mean
in the sense of potential is always
there we don't live under slavery and we
do have the franchise and you know so on
if you look at the last thirty years
it's been dramatic I mean I constantly
talk about this and write about it and
maybe I should have been more clear
about it here but I absolutely agree
with you I'm in the 80s where the most
active period probably in American
history you know in recent recent
American history much more than the 60s
I mean the sixties there was a lot of
proteins enacted
you know people of your age of my age
remember very well but it was pretty
narrowly focused I mean it was young
people and quite often in elite
universities and very narrow even their
fact of the matter is if you look to the
war was greater as education declined so
it's not the case of more educated you
where the more you opposed it on the
contrary but in a society that still had
not escaped what I wouldn't continue to
call the totalitarian values and the
term is correct of the fifties people
who were opposed and do much about it it
was the people who were more privileged
who were in a position to do something
about it you got more leeway you know so
the focus of protest was among young
people and very much university based
which was extremely important that he
was tremendously important and a lot of
things came out of it but take a look at
the 80s the 80s was quite different this
all its it take just internet and freak
communism come back to the cases you
mentioned when he mentioned another one
the Solidarity movements of the 80s
solidarity with Central America which
are the nearest counterpart to the
anti-vietnam war movement in the
eighties they were much broader than
anything that existed in the 60s and
further where they were much more
solidly rooted in mainstream society you
found more solidarity work in a church
in Kansas than you found in Harvard you
know I mean these this core of these
movements was right throughout the
Midwest in the southwest and you know
people of any age and the wage business
particularly a lot of it was church
based on this very mainstream America
and it involved it was a huge effort
they went way beyond anything in the 60s
so in the 1960s people were protesting
but nobody thought I'll go live in a
Vietnamese village because maybe a white
face all fend off state terrorists they
did it in the eighties people who we
would regard as politically conservative
incidentally and so what I went down and
lived in villages witnesses for peace
for example precisely for that purpose
there was a lot of solidarity work was
people-to-people contact direct
involvement probably about 80,000
Americans went down to one or another
part of Central America and really
involved themselves and things I haven't
thought are living down there right now
who comes out of it and the it was a
major affect you know how much good it
did to Central America can argue it was
very good for the United States it's
kind of like the Peace Corps with the
Peace Corps ever helping anybody in the
third world you can debate but it
certainly helped the United States
because a lot of people came back and
understood that the world is not the way
it had been presented to them
it's a different way and that's very
educational for us here in our highly
indoctrinated society and the Solidarity
work was the same I never had an
enormous effect you know in fact it
continues I mean that's one of the
reasons why and the government's aware
so for example one of the early write in
the peak of the Gulf War know just when
they were beginning the ground attack
and the Gulf War there was an
interesting leak back pages of the paper
of a early Bush administration planning
document on intervention of
world and it said it said that in the
case of a conflict in the case of a
confrontation with a much weaker enemy
meaning the only kind we'll ever fight
obviously in the case of a confrontation
with a much weaker enemy we must not
only defeat them but we must defeat them
rapidly and decisively because of
anything else will undercut political
support which is understood to be
extremely thin you know there is very
little went when John F Kennedy sent the
US Air Force the bomb South Vietnam and
he is napalm and so on there was no
proof that nobody batted an eyelash want
to bomb another country your business
and nowadays there's much too much
public birthdays so that's all big
change and I think it's the one of the
effects of the 60s and the other things
you mentioned are equally the case the
environmental movements of take say the
feminist movement which came kind of
like post 60s was just beginning then
that's an enormous effect on American
life the there's all this huge fury
these days about multiculturalism well
you know any mass movement is not have a
lot of things around the periphery but
basically what it reflects is the sense
that you should have sympathy and
concern and respect for other cultures
that's something new you know and that
again grew out of this or taking what in
many ways is the most dramatic example
of all attitudes toward the Native
American population now you know the
founding fathers were very well aware
that they were as they put in
exterminating the native population in
standard phrase because they are lesser
breeds who you know world won't be any
will worse off if they're gone and that
sort of business we went for hundreds of
years without questioning that till the
1960s nobody virtually I mean like you
could find five people
then who raised some question about
whether it was appropriate to
exterminate the lesser breeds
exterminate no that's what happened
that's the way they described and this
includes all the guys who we think it
was you know good guys the in the 1960s
for the first of the academic profession
was lying through its teeth about it I
mean they had all the evident ill the
1960s that the native population was
sort of hunter-gatherers you know
scattered around in the forests they
have plenty of evidence that they was a
densely you know that the place was
densely populated that they had advanced
civilizations in many ways more advanced
than the colonists and the agriculture
all sorts of things but they were
pretending it wasn't there there's kind
of a reason for that if they were
hunter-gatherers than according to
English common law they didn't own the
land
they's kinda like wandering around and
if they didn't own the land and you know
nothing wrong with their taking but that
went on right into the 60s in
anthropology of so many studied
anthropology and the big universities in
the 50s and 60s what you learn if you
grew up when I did you played cowboys
and Indians like as a kid we played
cowboys and Indians you know you go out
in the woods we're the Cowboys kill the
Indians and that sort of thing in the
60s that changed and for the first time
it became possible at least to face the
original sin you know even before
slavery what happened to the 10 or 12
million people who live here you know
and how come they're not here you know
that's you know that's a serious
question and
took a couple of centuries to even open
the question and by now it's a major
question not that anything's being done
for them but at least it's a question
you know people among I'm sure all of
you it's it's not just something you
laugh about night you don't go out to
play cowboys and Indians and that's a
tremendous cultural change and in fact
across the whole it's a much more
civilized society than it was thirty
years ago that's precisely what strikes
fear into the hands of a leads that's
why they're so terrorized about what
they call political correctness or you
know the Vietnam syndrome or any of
these other horrible things people are
not just accepting orders and they're
beginning their asking questions they
are in fact off the spectrum on most
issues and it's and sometimes they do
something about it so I not only accept
the criticism but radically endorse it I
think it's exactly to the point and it
tells you where you want to go
noriega you mean in Panama now Noriega
was put in Panama yeah well that's an
interesting case Noriega was you know
that's kind of gone a month I mean now
he's demonized then he's you know forty
years in jail and so on but in fact he
was a kind of a minor so he was a thug
in a killer and a narco-trafficker and
so on
but by the standards of the guys we
support he's you know not particularly
noticeable and the in fact it was just a
trial he was just tried in Panama for
one of his worst crime alleged worst
crimes killing a few ghost about us it's
about a four there's one you know guy
was decapitated that this isn't he found
body somewhere everybody Noriega did it
and there he was just tried for that and
every was amazement they didn't convict
him in Panama which caused the big furor
and in fact though you won't read it the
American press if you read the
conservative business press in Central
America you'll discover that the federal
prosecutor had a theory which he was
sort of the theory of the prosecution
that in fact Noriega was involved but he
was involved as a CIA agent who was
trying to get rid of this guy because he
was questioning the you know war in
Nicaragua so uh to get back to Noriega
he was on the American payroll as a
gonna murder a narco traffic or the
minor type until about the early 80s in
1984 in fact there was an election in
Nicaragua which Noriega just stole by
violence quite a lot of violence in fact
the wrong guy was going to win
the guy who was going to win is somebody
called and that he was a conservative
nationalist but somewhat independent
than the United States didn't like him
and wanted some other guy to get in who
in fact was a former student of George
Shultz's his name is Barletta I think
his name was for anyway he was the guy
who was supposed to win and the thing
was arranged so that he did win the
Reagan administration which secretly
subsidized his campaign sent him
congratulations seven hours before the
election results were announced George
Shultz then flew down to authorize the
the great achievement you know
challenging the Sandinistas to meet our
high standards of democracy that was
1984 you know we're still not I
supporting Noriega but cheering him on
you know any destroys elections by
violence and kills people and so on and
so forth well around a year or two later
the attitude began to shift the problem
was that the thug who was getting a
little too independent
you know subs are fine I mean it doesn't
matter whether it's a minor one like
Noriega or a major major one like Saddam
Hussein if that matter Hitler who we
also supported for a ton they're fine
you know as long as they follow orders
but if they become independent they
become as bad as priests who were
organizing Bible study groups then
they're bad guys and you got to get rid
of it
so about 1986 1987 the u.s.
it's attitude toward Anita Noriega and
instead of becoming sort of a nice guy
on our side he became as Ted Koppel and
you know those guys called him you know
one of the most odious creatures in the
world you know kind of people the United
States Americans loved to hate and so on
and so forth major propaganda campaign
was concocted that turned him into a
sort of a hit Leary and figure and that
was all a build-up to the invasion of
Panama which incidentally remember was
George Bush's celebration at the end of
the Cold War the invasion of Panama took
place about a month after the Berlin
Wall fell and we were condemned by the
United Nations you know United States
had to beat those two Security Council
resolutions and so on but they moved in
they there's big furor about the fact
that Noriega had stolen election which
was true although with much less
violence than in the one in 84 that we
endorsed but this time he wasn't just
following orders
so we invaded Panama you know killed
however many people and destroyed what
we felt like an in-store installed a
regime of bankers and narco traffickers
and other crooks who everyone concedes
including the government wouldn't stay
in office for 10 minutes and was that
American force behind them and the
country is going down the tube as you'd
expect the narco traffic drug the drug
laundering is about doubled since then
but they did kidnap Noriega and brought
him here for trial and if you looked at
trial the charges against him were
virtually entirely from the period when
he was on CIA payroll another slight
fact that didn't appear in the press but
you know well that's another example of
nice brainwashing I mean people in the
United States by the time we invaded
Noriega people have you know much of the
population was trembling in his boots
about this Hispanic narco-trafficker
was gonna destroy our civilization and
you know the most odious character in
the world man do something about it to
protect ourselves
well that was effective propaganda and
it wasn't many years before three or
four years before when he was great guy
on our side having committed all his
crimes crimes didn't come from the later
period good propaganda works same place
the people in Russia looked some is dud
I mean there's there's plenty of sources
of information around first of all you
can learn a lot in the press you know
it's not a controlled press after all
and if you're really really carefully
you can learn a lot for example take say
this thing I mentioned about the Senate
vote I don't know if I hit the press but
it was on the 80 wires so it's probably
in the press somewhere or other the in
fact virtually everything I've described
is somewhere in the press know like if
you take a look at this stuff about the
health campaign I mean the fact that the
majority of the population is opposed to
the system that's being rammed down
everyone's throat well that's actually
in the press it's true is hidden in
paragraph 93 but it's there you know and
you can find it so there's an awful lot
you can find in the press and if you do
what you really ought to do is start by
reading every article from the in back
to the front you know most of the lies
are up in the front and then as you get
down to the story you know it turns out
there's a lot of stuff back there apart
from that there's quite a range of other
materials I mean from church sources
from dissident groups from
environmental groups from you know all
the activist groups around them so on
they all put out a ton of material and
much of it is very valuable the thing
about the Panama trial that I mentioned
is there or if you read the Central
American press it's in English you know
it's too expensive to you know you can't
subscribe to it unless you want to spend
a couple hundred dollars but a library
could really isn't libraries so there's
there's plenty of sources of information
but the main answer to your question I
think is that it doesn't matter how much
information is around unless you have it
accessible to you and as an individual
you can't have it accessible unless
you're an absolute fanatic I mean there
are a small number of fanatics you know
who you know to vote their lives to
trying to do it some kind of insanity
but normal people can't do that you have
lives to lead you know you can't act
like a fanatic and that's why people
have organizations like I mentioned in
churches and Kansas during the Nicaragua
well you know you go down to those
churches people know more about
Nicaragua than the CIA and the more
about El Salvador because they were
working together no and they had act in
fact I learned a lot when I went to
visit places like that I thought I was
following closely if people work
together they can find out a lot of
things and they can furthermore get
under you know they gain understanding
you can't really have thought you can't
think independently if you're alone I
mean anybody in the sciences knows this
like in this in the Natural Sciences you
work together you know why I want to
teach graduate courses because the
graduate students have all the smart
ideas
interact figure things out but anything
where you're trying to really understand
something as a collective activity of
some kind you try out ideas and other
people have them and they react and you
know somebody knows something you didn't
know and you put it together and so on
and out of collective activity you can
find out a lot but it requires
organization and in fact the genius of
American democracy has been the key
people very atomized well I can tell you
what I think is credible but that's just
believing what I think no reason why I
should believe that anymore you should
believe anything else you know I mean
like you know I write in certain
journals and I think they're by large
credible and I can tell you what I think
they are but my point is that there's
absolutely no reason for you to trust my
judgment I mean you know why my judgment
instead of some guy at its New York
Times you got to trust your own judgment
which means you have to look and see I
mean like I write for Zee magazine and I
think it's credible but that's my
judgment no maybe not your judgment
well there was that's a very important
fact I mean one of the things that
happened in the 80s remember there has
been a decline since the early 1970s
there's been a decline of real wages and
they slowed down of growth and that's
not just in the United States it's
throughout the industrial world and it
has very big causes I mean to complicate
it talk about now there's a big
structural reasons for that maybe
mention but anyhow it's been happening
now in the eighties it intensified the
its policy run policy driven you know
that's not happening by laws of nature
and the policies of the 1980s
particularly in Reaganite America and in
Thatcher England they were the most
extreme they accelerated and so there's
a big I mean the England is now back to
the degree of inequality they had about
a century ago and the United States is
the the degree of inequality measures
are one measure you can use of you know
what's happening in a society they were
improving up until about the 60s in the
United States then they kind of leveled
off and they got WAY worse in the 1980s
in every respect
I mean child malnutrition you know
income whatever you measure how was this
done partly by keeping the facts
I mean people knew what was happening in
their own lives you know everybody knows
what's happening to me but it's very
hard to find out what's happening
everywhere and in fact the page the
picture was that it was a period of
great growth and prosperity and Tom
Wolfe call that one of the great golden
ages and human history or something and
there was a you know there was there was
indeed a veneer of prosperity and for
some people probably people in my income
bracket it was great you know gained a
lot of money in fact there was some
income growth about 50% of it or more
went to the top 1% about 70% of it went
to the top half percent and the bottom
60% actually declined
huge differentiations but people only
knew what was happening to themselves
you know they didn't see it on
television no they didn't I mean finally
it actually broke through so you know
there were some even popular books about
it and so on but the general picture of
what's happening has certainly not been
explained I mean you can see that South
Central Los Angeles is exploding can't
keep that quiet
but try to find an analysis of why it's
true there's some reasons why it's true
you know take away the jobs you send
them overseas the places region really
screw the workers properly and people
who are left in South Central Los
Angeles they're going to start no not on
profound point and that's happening all
over the country it's called the
internationalization of production for
example I and it's supposed to be a good
thing you know we're all told about how
it contributes to economic efficiency
and it's rational and some economists
electricty about free trade zone and so
forth that's the story here what's
actually happening
people know from their lives and in fact
if you look at but but they don't
understand the picture because that
requires putting it together you know if
you see if you can take a look at the
public opinion studies you can see the
way people feel about it
so for example about 75% of the
population thinks that life is going to
be worse in the next generation than it
is today
now that's a real turning point in the
history of industrial society that's
never been true I mean even the depths
of the depression which is way worse
than anything now there was a lot of
hopefulness you know people felt it's
gonna get better
somehow remember that very well myself
but now people don't think so young
people for example think they're not
going to live as well as their parent
they may well be right but that
aspiration that sense is very widespread
when polls ask people what they think
about the economy an astonishing figure
the last ones I saw are over 80 percent
say that the economy is inherently
unfair meaning requires radical change
as for the political system about half
the population thinks both political
parties ought to be disbanded because
they're totally useless on the way so
you have a tremendous amount of
disaffection that goes on and on like
this and people just feel individually
that things are not going right but you
you are not going to find in the
mainstream establishment literature much
of an analysis of why or even that it
has happening and I think the basic
propaganda
method has been to focus basically to
distract people so you watch you know
sitcoms on television or you you know
look at nationally football or something
do anything except pay attention to
what's happening to you and and and
there is a strong effort to get people
isolated as you've been seeing over the
tube lately there's billions of dollars
being poured into the information you
know big information revolution which is
going to give everybody you know five
hundred channels which will all have the
same garbage all be owned by the same
people but there'll be five hundred of
them now so you'll really be stuck alone
in your living room you know twiddling
that channels trying to find something
to do and not talking to the guy next
door with whom you might get together
and maybe change things well you know
that's a technique of propaganda and an
effective all of these things are very
effective techniques I mean what I've
been talking about is indoctrination but
that's mostly aimed at elites that's
like tree-tops propaganda at the general
public propaganda is generally
distraction you know it's just to keep
the meddlesome outsiders busy with
something else whether it's sex or
violence or gossip or sports or whatever
just keep them there then they won't be
any trouble and give them a picture of a
kind of a glitzy world you know that I
think the way most of the Public
Relation system works
right
yeah
yeah yeah so the question I mean the
stealing of our grandchildren's money
which was going on on a massive scale in
the Reagan administration basically
that's what the debt is you know this
huge explosion of debt is an imposition
of a responsibility on future
generations and something the same is
true of the environmental issues
I mean environmental issues are a matter
of the welfare of future generations in
effect notice that takes a a market
system and there's nothing remotely like
a market but if there were a market
system it would have extraordinary
deficiencies fundamental deficiencies
one of them being that future
generations can't vote in the market you
know like they can't decide what they
want the money to be spent they're going
to be the ones that pay the cost well
that's essentially the issue that the
environmental movement is facing and
things are like that across the board
how is it done well you mentioned the
military buildup which was certainly one
part of it the CIA knew perfectly well
that in fact you know they find it in
their people Russia economists of the
Russians I mean it's just not a secret
that Soviet military expenditures were
leveling off in the 1970s there were
always way behind us I mean even the
most hawkish figures had NATO way out
spending the Warsaw Pact in fact Soviet
society was beginning to decline in the
mid-60s and stagnating and military
expenditures were leveling off the
Reagan administration had their rammed
through
an excuse for they had this huge
military budget and remember what a
military budget is a military budget is
mainly welfare for the rich what we call
the military budget is the technique by
which taxpayers pay the costs of
high-tech industry you know so that's
how you pay off IBM and you know
electronics industry in aeronautics our
biggest export is aircraft that's
publicly funded in fact virtually every
functional part of the economy is
publicly funded and because everybody
knows that capitalism is completely
unworkable we try to impose it on third
world countries to destroy them but we
don't accept it but the military budget
is one of the main techniques by which
the state intervenes in the economy to
funnel money from the taxpayer to the
wealthy and of course the Reagan
administration built it up I'm as other
functions like killing people and so on
but it has a major economic function and
you're right that that was one of the
factors that built up the big deficits
ultimately huge dead along with the
regressive fiscal policies which the
other shot in the arm and how did they
get people to agree to it well you know
actually they didn't agree to it if you
look at polls again the public was
strongly in favor of social spending and
faith rather than military spending I
mean by big margins
you know like 4 to 1 or 7 to 1
I asked the question it just didn't
matter the thing to do at the time was
to ram through a big military budget
because the economy needed a shot in the
arm and so on and so forth how did they
do it among the politically active class
you know they're responsible men they
educated 20% or whatever it is other
guys who actually play some role in
these things marginal even at least well
they just lie if you go back then you
remember the reason we needed a huge
military budget was because of something
called the window of vulnerability that
one and there was a window of
vulnerability the Russians had this
fantastic missile system and you know
they were going to destroy us all
because we had this window of
vulnerability and we quickly had to
close it you know and that required you
know all sorts of stuff
Star Wars being one of it now you know
they knew that the window vulnerability
was a total fraud they knew it perfectly
will and in fact it was kind of
interesting to watch what happened to
the window it didn't close the way it
closed was by about 1983 corporate
executives were beginning to get worried
about the wild abandon with which the
Reagan administration was spending money
I mean they could see it's really it's
harming what they care about you know
the domestic economy so they essentially
if you look if you look at corporate of
attitudes and pressures at that time
they were trying to get the friggin
administration to cut back on military
spending I mean fine to pour a huge
stimulus into the economy through public
funds but don't overdo it it causes real
problems there begin you worry about the
deficit and at that time and shortly
after that the Reagan administration had
a commission the scope
Commission which discovered that there
never had been a window of vulnerability
so therefore we could level off military
spending well of course they never had
it was complete fraud in the first place
but it was there for long enough to ran
through the military budget now you know
the Reagan recognized didn't invent this
in fact they were simply following a
script that was written by the Kennedy
administration who was their model I
mean the Reaganites and the Kennedy
people were extremely close you look at
the policies they were very very similar
and remember that's supposed to be the
opposite ends of the spectrum but when
Kennedy came in they bittered the
Kennedy people bitterly attacked
Eisenhower because he was letting the
country fall behind the Russians and
frittering away our resources while the
Russians were marching from strength to
strength and we had to have a huge
increase in the military budget to
defend ourselves and it sounded just
like the Reagan campaign against Carter
in fact the same rhetoric and when the
Kennedy guys came in they also had a
huge increase in the military budget
which set off the next stage of the arms
race and then it wasn't a window of
vulnerability it was a missile gap in
those days there was a missile gap you
know the Russian we didn't have any
missiles and the Russians at all these
missiles would be really in trouble so
we had to have a thousand Minutemen and
so on and so forth well they knew that
the missile the missile gap was a fraud
or to be more precise there was a
missile gap but it was overwhelmingly in
our favor in fact there were at that
time four Russian missiles all of them
sitting on some open airfield somewhere
we probably second probably not workable
anyway and we had a lot of missiles but
they knew that I mean now the records
they Declassified so we know they knew
it but as this National Security Advisor
McGeorge Bundy said he said the missile
gap is a good shorthand phrase for the
policy we're intending to put through so
let's keep so they had a missile gap and
the Reaganites had a you know window of
owner ability and the Truman
administration
the third big military buildup they had
another fraud totally different fraud
but also a fraud and that's the way it
is throughout the Cold War if like one
of the big problems they're having now
is that with the Russians gone it's
harder to concoct frauds you know the
Russians were big and frightening and
ugly and so on so he convinced convinced
people okay maybe they're coming but
it's pretty hard to do it when you have
to fight grenade or something in fact if
you look at the White House reports the
ones that go to Congress every year to
tell you what tell Congress why we have
to bigger have a bigger military budget
they've course drop the Russians it's
now the technological sophistication of
third world powers that requires that we
have this huge military budget or the
road nations you know like Iraq is gonna
conquer Saudi Arabia and North Korea is
gonna conquer Japan or something so we
have to have the rogue nations under
control and they're really struggling to
find some new enemy who replaces the
Russians because you need it for
population control but we know how they
did have the answer your question is
known you know fake a window of
vulnerability completely fraudulent
closed as soon as the business community
said you're overspending so therefore it
was closed it was as big as it ever was
nothing changed but you no longer needed
it's a propaganda device
yeah I mean the correlation is dramatic
you know but you have to be a little
intense takes a Haiti the current one I
mean there's a history in Haiti where
the nothing is you know it's not us just
didn't start today in fact the US has
over 200 years of involvement in Haiti
one of the first American foreign policy
initiatives after the Republic after we
won independence in 1791 was to
intervene in Haiti along with the French
who were trying to repress a slavery
goal there was a slave revolt in Haiti
was a French colony you know slave
colony there was a big slavery though
revolt which the French were having a
hard time were pressing so they called
in other European countries to help like
Britain and so on and the United States
helped to you know we sent money and
forces to try to repress the slave
revolt when the slave revolt
nevertheless succeeded the European
countries refused to recognize it except
by the about the 1820s they've had
mostly agreed to recognize that once
Haiti agreed to pay indemnities to
France Haiti had to pay indemnities to
France for the crime of liberating
itself from French rule which had
totally destroyed it that was considered
rather legitimate like you know Vietnam
making amends to us today and so on and
the only country that wouldn't go along
with that was the United States we were
much harsher in fact the United States
to the last country to refuse to
recognize Haiti we recognized it in 1862
in the context of the Civil War and
there were two reasons for that one was
because we needed Haitian bases for
the North's needed Asian bases for its
military operations in the south and the
other is because they were going to free
the slaves and the idea at the time was
well we're gonna free him but we're not
gonna let him stay here
the idea is send them somewhere you know
get rid of the blacks in the United
States that Lincoln was and Jefferson
and others that was one of their leading
ideas the idea is Jefferson put it is
that we have to have a country without
blot or mixture meaning pure white so
you know the natives exterminate and the
slaves you send them back somewhere and
in fact in 1862 the United States
recognized both Haiti and Liberia in
large measure for that purpose after
that we kept intervening in 1916 and 15
and 16 Wilson intervened the Marines ran
the place for 20 years the reason it's
in its present state comes from that 20
year occupation and the racism there you
couldn't believe if you I mean you know
I wish I had that stuff in front of me
but I've written about it if you quote
the Wilson administration on Haiti it is
mind-boggling
the Secretary of State talked about how
problem of Haiti is that the African
race has no capacity for self-government
no talent for self-government and
they'll sink back into savagery which is
their natural condition unless we do
something to rescue them and
you know it's just on and on with the
most hideous racist garbage including
Franklin Roosevelt it was involved in
that and it in fact the racism of the
invading forces very much sharpened and
exacerbated the racism that was already
present in Haitian society where there
was a split between the mulatto elites
and the blacks that went way back got a
lot worse in reaction to the racism of
the American invaders which lasted for
twenty years and it goes right through
the president I mean right now we have a
win when our Stephen won the election
the United States was appalled
not only because he was a representative
of the black majority but because he was
a representative of a huge grassroots
movement that nobody knew was there and
which you know crisis democracy in a
terrible way so when he was overthrown
nobody lifted a finger and we're still
basically not lifting a finger the plan
certainly you know this one can be in
these things is to allow the killers you
know the kleptocracy in the military to
demolish and destroy the civil society
so that if Ari steed ever gets back
there'll be nothing much left in the way
of popular support because it'll all be
demolished and you know it's been going
on for years and when if it finally
happens we'll praise ourselves about our
grand contributions to democracy
and undoubtedly there's a very strong
element of racism there and you can go
case after case and the same is true
like when Wilson invaded the Dominican
Republic at the same time it wasn't the
niggers that they were going to kill it
was the Degas except that they saw a
difference because if you go back to
Lansing Wilson Secretary of State he
said you know the niggers they don't
have
capacity for self-government and they're
just savages but the day goes at least
have some white blood you know so
they're a little better and maybe we
don't be quite as harsh on with them and
in the late 1960s Dean Acheson early
seventies Dean Acheson is one of the
founders of the modern world was
privately advising the government of
Rhodesia that they should not fall prey
to this one-man one-vote era see which
has done such a damage in the United
States and shouldn't be under the impact
of these liberal absurdities you know
keep white rule and so on that's Dean
Acheson
you know Truman's Secretary of State one
of the designers of the modern world
because right up until today you look at
the planning documents after the Second
World War when they were sort of
figuring out how the world should be run
what they say about Africa is George
Kennan who was the head of the planning
policy section when he wrote about
Africa each area had a certain function
he said Africa should be left for the
Europeans because we don't want it
really and the Europeans should exploit
Africa he said that was a term used
Europe should exploit Africa for its own
reconstruction cost herbs in a bad state
so therefore they to exploit Africa and
then he added that that task you know
that enterprise would give you're a kind
of a psychological lift and there was
kind of depressed at the time in part
because of the effects of the war and in
part because we were stealing and taking
for ourselves all of the traditional
European empires like you know South
America and so on I said this will give
the Europeans you know some kind of task
that they need that they can carry out
I'll make them feel good namely
exploiting Africa well you know the
races I mean just look everybody knows
the history of Africa
I mean the racism in implicit in that is
beyond description and deeper is the
fact that nobody seasoning wrong with it
so you take a look at the diplomatic hit
this stuff has been declassified for 15
years by now I've been writing about it
at least for that long
try to find something in the even in the
academic literature where somebody says
women there's something funny about
Europe exploiting Africa to reconstruct
and because it'll give it a
psychological lift I'm having another
project like Africa exploiting Europe to
reconstruct after centuries of
destruction and maybe they'll get a
psychological lift out of it I mean if
anybody proposed that you just laugh and
the reason is we're so fantastically
racist that the other approach just
comes naturally or takes a this is
Middle East peace so there's an example
I'm a US policy toward the Middle East
has been extremely racist we're the only
country in the world in fact which has
flatly rejected Palestinian rights
because they're just wrong color and
everything else and we won because the
guys who the guns usually won when
that's what all the euphoria is about we
ran through the rejectionist program
that we've had isolated in the world
incidentally for twenty years there's
plenty of racism behind this undoubtedly
and the sames true domestically I mean
you can find it all over the place on
the other hand let me say that part of
the reason you know it looks as if we're
always attacking people of color but
that's a little bit of an artifact in my
opinion because if you really look at
the broad picture what's happened for
the last five hundred years essentially
you know big brush strokes is that a
barbarian invasion took place from
Northwest Europe which swept over the
world and destroyed most of the world
now northwest Europe happened to be
white it wasn't more advanced
the rest of the world and you know
technology or anything else it just
happened to be much better at fighting
you know they their main advantage was
military it not only had the technology
of war it also had a kind of a culture
of savagery but most of the rest of the
world didn't have it's not the rest of
the world was pacifists or anything you
know they killed each other and so on
but you know you from the East Indies
what's now Indonesia to the United
States a common reaction was that no one
had ever seen people kill with the
savagery and fanaticism of the European
invaders it was really something
different and both that culture of
savagery and the technology of it and a
bunch of other things
in fact led to a world conquest and the
end result of that world conquest is
more or less you know a white people
killing non-white people now it's not
precise you know but at least it's this
is strongly in that direction in my
opinion if some white people were to
somewhere get up and declare
independence we try to kill him that's
what the Cold War was about people of
East Europe perfectly white but we
fought a 70 year war to drive them back
into the third world where they belong
that's called a cold war maybe five
hundred years from now some American
academics
we'll be able to face that fact but it's
pretty clearly what happened I mean in a
certain sense the Cold War was not all
that different from the invasion of
Grenada East Europe was a part of the
third world fact was the original third
world even pre-columbian it was Europe
Western Europe's third world they
declared independence
that's not permitted any more than if
Grenada starts running fishing
cooperatives and when they do it is
smashing Grenada it takes a weekend you
know Eastern Europe takes 70 years but
that's a matter of scale and they were
white we would a nuclear but they were
white and any other form of Independence
I think we would react to the same white
green and black anything else
although the bias is there and largely a
historical residue residue of the
barbarian conquest from Northwest Europe
over the rest of the world
most American
I don't know what you mean by that but
when you say Family Values what do you
mean like you mean for example ensuring
that children don't die of malnutrition
is that Family Values I agree that most
of the public believes in that means
what no most of the public is in favor
of choices always has been I mean the
United States is different from other
societies in that respect one fact about
American society which is quite true is
that it's deeply fundamentalist I mean
we're kind of like Iran if you look at
most measures and it's unusual among
industrial societies in that respect it
is quite true yeah but the point I mean
there is some significant truth to what
you're saying a very substantial part of
the public is kind of the counterpart
you know has the same attitudes as
deeply committed Islamic fundamentalism
that's not true in most societies so if
you look at beliefs you know a lot of
studies again about 75% of Americans
have a literal belief in the devil about
the percentage of Americans who believe
in art and Darwinian evolution is under
10% if you look at you know the whole
range of other things like that you 40%
of Americans have undergone a born-again
experience now you know these are all
deeply fundamentalist views and they
should sin teresting but and the United
what's striking is how far off the you
know the the graph the United States is
on this because if you look across the
world a lot of comparative studies these
beliefs tend to decline with
industrialization and modernization it's
very close correlation in fact the
United States is off the chart you know
it's like the most pre-industrial
societies in this respect sometimes this
is called family that
but it sounds like a funny term to me uh
pardon yeah right
okay you'll be next sorry it's my fault
if I haven't but you know these are all
true and it's perfectly true that a that
the press basically doesn't go along
with this the press typically is not
fundamentalism and in that sense you
could say the liberal press is different
from much of the country but that's
about the only respect I think so I
suspect that most journalists probably
believe in Darwinian evolution like they
don't think the world was created 6,000
years ago or something and in that
respect they are different from a large
part of the public and I suspect that a
large number of journalists don't
literally believe in the devil say and
so they'd be different from 75% of
Americans
we'll see I don't quite agree with that
because I think that part of the rhythm
of here there's an interesting question
and I don't think you know I don't we
live about it it's short and you know
really questions thought and actually I
don't think we know the answers but my
strong suspicion if you want my
suspicion is the reason that this
extreme fundamentalism in the United
States which makes us look kind of like
Iran is one of the techniques of
indoctrination that is it's the result
of indoctrination it's one of the ways
in which people have become marginalized
and in fact if you look at the history
you will find it back to the 19th
century the business community was
funding and trying to stimulate you know
fundamentalist preachers and so on very
much the way the rising bourgeoisie in
England did earlier simply to try to get
people from worrying about this world in
which they were going to be oppressed
one of the ways you try to prevent
people from interfering with what you're
trying to do them in this world is get
them to think about some other world we
do it overseas all the time one of the
major efforts in Central America 50
years and this one's known is an effort
to try to bring in evangelical
Christianity of a kind which says don't
worry what's happening to you in this
uninteresting and insignificant world
you know worry about you know whether
you'll get to heaven or something like
that that's a standard technique of
control and there's plenty of it in
American history and in my opinion it's
an opinion you know
really been settled this is a large part
of why the United States is so different
so I would tend to suggest that these
differences though they're definitely
real I think they're more a reflection
of indoctrination than a something that
the press is trying to block but if it
is I mean to the extent say that the
press comes out against the teaching
creationism and the schools
it certainly is opposing a significant
part of the American population which
thinks that the world was great at
sixteen six thousand years ago and
that's what we are teaching and it's
absolutely true that a leads don't agree
that's not the liberalism to that like
corporate executives agree I mean they
don't want managers who live in a world
of total irrationality I mean they want
people who are going to be able to deal
with the real world so if you looked at
corporate executives they probably even
more opposed to teaching creationism in
the school yeah
sorry
[Music]
too dangerous yeah other things yeah I
was nothing new about that in Johnny my
wife was a student at University of
Pennsylvania around 1950 and I remember
she took a sociology class undergraduate
sociology class when they you know they
got to Darwin somehow and the professor
opened the discussion by saying well
look I'm gonna be talking about
something that's very controversial and
none of you have to believe any of this
stuff but it's something you sort of
oughta know about I mean there are
people who believe it so therefore you
know will teach it I mean when they
taught the laws of mechanics they didn't
say that so there's nothing new about
this this goes way back yeah but this
was the University of Pennsylvania I
mean it's it's interesting and it's a
reflection of things about the United
States which are important I mean any
country which has you know I mean I
think it's a rather dangerous thing
about the United States today the truth
I mean fortunately in my eye here I'm
just talking opinion so this is not
facts anymore but in my opinion I should
say I max very much in favor one of the
reasons I'm very much in favor of
corruption I think it's one of the
greatest things around is that it tends
to undermine power and that's
particularly dramatic in the case of
these days and Jellicle movements every
time some evangelical preacher turns out
to be you know robbing people or has six
mistresses or something like that
I applaud because that's undermining
what could be very dangerous power I
mean if somebody comes along who is
honest you know once power will appeal
to these irrational sentiments kind of a
Hitler type I think the country is going
to be in real trouble because the
there's a massive disaffection you know
people are extremely disaffected they're
very isolated it's taken among a lot of
the population it's taken the form of an
extreme kind of religious fundamentalism
of the kind you don't find in the
industrial world and you know that's a
dangerous mix I mean it's the kind of
mix which has led to things like Nazism
so I don't think it's anything to joke
about and I think it's quite real but
when people say the liberal press is
opposing it I think they're missing the
point
corporate executives are way more
opposed to it because they want a
rationally run society now they may not
care if people out there you know the
working people believe in the devil they
may like that because then they won't
worry about does not have any jobs but
they want a spectrum of people who know
where the real world is who can do their
work for them and it extends to far than
I like
[Applause]
although professor Chomsky is quite well
known in many circles his dissenting
views and numerous books are seldom
discussed in political science or
journalism courses because I believe
they revealed too much about our society
and how it really functions
professor Chomsky's undergraduate and
graduate years were spent at the
University of Pennsylvania where he
received his PhD in linguistics in 1955
during the years 1951 to 1955 he was a
junior fellow of the Harvard University
Society of fellows he is an institute
professor at MIT where he's been since
1955 over the last 40 years he has
revolutionized the field of linguistics
from 1966 to 1976
professor shot Chomsky held the Ferrari
P Ward professorship of modern languages
and linguistics
during the years 1958 to 1959 professor
Chomsky was in residence at the
Institute for Advanced Study at
Princeton New Jersey in the spring of
1969 he delivered the John Locke
lectures at Oxford in January 1970 he
delivered the Bertrand Russell memorial
lecture at Cambridge University in 1972
the Nehru Memorial Lecture in New Delhi
and in 1977 through his Ingo lecture in
Leiden professor Chomsky has received
honorary degrees from the University of
London the University of Massachusetts
and the University of Pennsylvania to
mention a few he is a recipient of the
distinguished scientific contribution
award of the American Psychological
Association and the Kyoto prize from
Japan in addition to his widely
recognized academic contributions
professor Chomsky is America's leading
dissident intellectual and again
according to The Times perhaps the
clearest voice of dissent
in American history professor Chomsky
challenges us to recognize the sickening
hypocrisy in our establishments claims
supposedly in the support of freedom and
democracy at home and abroad as well as
to recognize the flood of lies and
distortions present in every area of
mainstream political discourse he
inspires us to question authority and
conventional wisdom in all aspects of
life personal political and academic as
well as to think about our
responsibility to act on our decent
human instincts professor Chomsky will
speak on some comments on the academic
and political world totalitarian values
in a free society
[Applause]
before I speak about anything are you
getting the same echo I'm getting I'm
dr. William Worrell on behalf the
University and the Department of
Psychology I'd like to welcome you here
on this very special occasion
our guest speaker today Noam Chomsky is
the best-known and most widely widely
recognized scholar intellectual in the
world today not only has he made
monumental contributions to the field of
linguistics but he has contributed much
to the thinking and research of many
other disciplines for example his work
in psycholinguistics has become the
foundation of psycholinguistics a branch
of psychology additionally he opposed
the strict environmental position of
American behaviorism specifically the
views of J V Watson and BF Skinner
professor Chomsky also ushered in the
doctrine of nativism and made it
respectable and viable in the
interpretation and understanding human
behavior particularly how children learn
to talk at this point I want to
introduce to you the person who is
primarily responsible for our guests
appearance today mr. Eric Epstein an
undergraduate psychology major ask our
guest to speak here and if it weren't
for him probably wouldn't be assemble
together here today so I think that it
is proper and fitting that
mr. Epson Stein make the formal
introduction of our guests
[Applause]
thank you dr. wall when the plans were
finalized for professor chomps his
lecture and we started to let people
know about his talk I heard some
interesting reactions how did you get
according to the New York Times arguably
the most important intellectual alive
America's leading social critic author
of over 70 books to agree to speak at
Kutztown University my response was very
simple we just called him up and asked
him in fact professor Chomsky will talk
to anyone who's willing to listen Noam
Chomsky has spoken to more college
students than any other speaker in the
world presenting his thesis and
motivating us to critically think I also
heard other reactions such as who is
Noam Chomsky I'm a political science and
journalism major a senior I'm sure I
would have heard of him if he was all
about hang up here no okay
I was afraid of it somehow these two
mics were interacting in a unpleasant
fashion so I'll just suffer with it as
long as you don't have to the the topic
that was just assuming totalitarian
values in a free society
it sounds like contradiction at first
but it actually isn't in fact it's a
rather traditional theme though it's not
usually put in those words it has to the
the issue arises from a basic problem in
the theory of government if you like
that was discussed among others by David
Hume a couple hundred years ago and his
fundamental work in political philosophy
Hume was puzzled by the fact that people
submit to Authority and he wondered why
that is true and he posed a kind of
paradox of government the paradox is
that power lies in the hands of the
governed people who are being governed
so why don't they use it why do they
listen to their rulers and his
conclusion was that the way that that
happens is through control over opinion
if you can't control the opinion of the
those who are ruled they would simply
rise up and take power for themselves
and he concluded that this is true of
all societies from the most despotic to
the most free and I think there's a lot
of truth
to that doctrine although it does
require two comments I think one is that
human der estimated the degree of
violence that is in the hands of
powerful states and that can control
people even if they no matter what their
opinions are that was true in his day
and it's even more dramatically true in
our day so if you were a dissident and
say pre Gorbachev Russia
life could be pretty unpleasant in the
days of Stalin terribly unpleasant in
the post-war period it could mean exile
or punishment the once order and other
varying degrees of unpleasantness if
you're a dissident in a typical US
dependency like say El Salvador
Guatemala you're likely to end up by a
roadside cut into shreds with machete
after being tortured if your this isn't
in other us dependencies today like say
Haiti again likely to be tortured or say
murdered as one of the president our
Steve's leading backers was the other
day and if you're still alive you can
listen to you can read this morning's
New York Times and discover that the
United States isn't going to do anything
about it
they'll send down observers but they'll
only observe the torture and the terror
they won't be authorized
interfere with it well there various
ways ensured of controlling dissidents
by extreme violence and we should know
all about them since we run some of the
worst that's one problem in humans
account it's not the case that in the
most despotic societies control of
opinion is really necessary there are
other means but he's right about the
societies that are more free when the
government loses the capacity when state
power or other domestic power loses the
capacity to control people by violence
it naturally turns to control of opinion
and seeks to install totalitarian values
in one or another form in fact I think a
proper emendation of humans para de
doctrine would be that control of
thought is much more significant and
much more important as societies become
more free for the obvious reason that if
you can't control people by the bludgeon
but you're committed to controlling them
that is
is in any community Galit Aryan society
with power with power highly
concentrated as is every existing
society past and present then you must
turn to other means of control and
control of opinion is about the only one
left as far as Jim recognized
furthermore that conclusion has been
pretty widely understood in the West in
fact it's a leading doctrine of modern
political science and modern political
leadership uncertainly of the corporate
community often articulated quite
explicitly throughout this century and
in fact we can trace it back hundreds of
years in the modern period to say take
world war ii the what I've proposed as a
neat World War one the inundation that I
proposed to humans doctrine namely that
you need control of opinion much more in
the more free societies that was pretty
clear in World War one the more free
societies where the anglo-american ones
the more autocratic society was German
and in fact Britain in the United States
far had by far the greatest achievements
in propaganda and flood control during
World War one a fact which was noticed
and has been quite influential for the
period that followed Woodrow Wilson had
a problem when he was elected president
in 1916 the problem was that he was
elected on the program of peace without
victory but he was committed to victory
without peace so something had have done
about that and in fact the country had
to be somehow turned from a passive
country into a country of raving
jingoist war mongers well that took
about six months after under a huge
propaganda campaign of a kind which was
quite unprecedented with the leadership
of progressive intellectuals I should
say people and John Dewey circle who
later took great pride in this
achievement they described this is the
first time that a country had been
driven the war not by generals and Kings
so on but by the more intelligent
members of the community namely
ourselves anybody who speaks is one of
the more intelligent members of the
community and the more intelligent
members of the community had succeeded
in bringing the population to understand
why we must go to war using materials
provided for them but British
intelligence which had committed itself
as they put it to controlling the
thought of the world I was quite happy
to provide fabricated horror stories
about the Belgium children with their
arms torn off and all sorts of other
stuff which in fact you often still read
about in history books but which was
mostly fabricated by British
intelligence and the whole pile of other
stuff and the rate of the Wilson
administration liberal Wilson
administration progressives in order to
facilitate this set up the first
government propaganda agency creel
Commission which was specifically
committed to controlling thoughts major
tasks was to build up support for an
extremely unpopular war and it's later
tasks were to come to the know and it
was very successful one of the founders
of
American political science Harold
Lasswell who is in particular the
founder of the field that's called
communications and so on which basically
means propaganda he began his career
with the study of propaganda during the
first world war he described Woodrow
Wilson as the Generalissimo of
propaganda and he was much impressed by
the achievements of the creel Commission
in bringing the population into
hysterical support for a war that they
opposed and all sorts of jingoist
fanaticism and hatred of all things
German and this and that and the other
thing simply by propaganda most of the
fabricated a lot of it provided by
British intelligence services well as I
say a lot of people notice this one of
the people who noticed it was Harold
Lasswell and it fed into a major part of
contemporary political science
undergraduate so you were talking about
certainly I've heard of Harold Lasswell
but I doubt very much that they have
read his work on propaganda which is
quite interesting another person who
noticed this and was influenced by it
was Adolf Hitler if you read mine come
you'll find that a large part of it is
devoted to his recognition of the great
achievements of anglo-american
propaganda and the inability of much
more authoritarian Germany to counter it
under the Germans tried to answer the
arguments but they were just wiped out
in the country and the competition
British and American
again the systems were far superior and
more effective and they essentially
massacred and Hitler noticed that and
determined that next time around the
German side would have an efficient
propaganda system which in fact he went
on to develop under Nazism although if
we were to really do a comparative
analysis it's not at all clear that he
ever came close to the achievements of
British and American propaganda even in
that period that's a another I should
say this went right on into the Second
World War so for example when Franklin
Roosevelt this is quite independent and
whether you think it's right to get into
the war wrong to get into it I'm just
describing what happened a couple of
months before Pearl Harbor when
President Roosevelt who was trying to
build up support for war
