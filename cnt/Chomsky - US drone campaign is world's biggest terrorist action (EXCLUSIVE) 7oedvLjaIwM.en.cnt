joining me today is American linguist
thinker author of over a hundred books
cognitive scientists Noam Chomsky thank
you very much for joining us on our tea
I'd like to begin with Iran the new
President rouhani has appeared to be
much softer than his predecessor on his
recent trip to the US
it was held progress first time to
president spoke in over 30 years
do you see US policy towards Iran
changing the real issue is what will
happen in the United States the way the
issue is presented in the United States
and most of the West the problem is
Iran's intransigence and its rejection
of the demands of the international
community there's plenty to criticize in
Iran but the real issue is quite
different it's the refusal of the West
primarily the United States to enter
into serious diplomacy with Iran and as
far as Iran violating the will of the
international community that depends on
a very special definition of
international community which is
standard in the West where the term
means the United States and anybody who
goes along with it
so if the international community
includes the world then the story is
quite different so for example the
non-aligned countries which is most of
the world's population have vigorously
supported Iran's right to enrich uranium
still do the nearby region the Arab
world Arabs don't like it ran it's quite
unpopular that's hostilities that go
back very far but they do not regard
around as a threat very small percentage
regard Iran as a threat they regard the
threat the threats they perceive are the
United States and Israel so they're not
part of the world as far as
international community's concern but
it's a it's a Western obsession and are
there ways to deal with it
whatever one takes the threat to be sure
there are ways so for example in 2000
there was a very positive advance that
could have mitigated whatever the threat
is supposed to be Turkey and Brazil made
I reached a deal with Iran in which Iran
would ship out its low enriched uranium
for storage in Turkey and in return the
West would provide isotopes for Iran's
medical reactors as soon as that was
announced Brazil and Turkey were
bitterly condemned by Washington and by
the media which more or less reflexively
follow what Washington says the
Brazilian the government was pretty
upset by this so much so that the
Brazilian foreign minister a marine
released a letter from President Obama
to the president of Brazil in which
Obama had proposed this assuming that
Iran would turn it down when Iran
accepted of course you had to denounce
it and Obama went right to the Security
Council to try to get harsher sanctions
well that's one case there's a more
recent one which is even more
interesting last December there was
supposed to be an international
conference in Finland to carry forward
long-standing efforts to establish a
zone free of nuclear weapons all weapons
of mass destruction in fact in the
Middle East this is under the auspices
of the non-proliferation treaty
basically the UN well it was to be in
December didn't happen first thing that
happened is Israel announced they
wouldn't participate then everyone was
waiting to see him what I was interested
was waiting to see what Iran would say
Iran said they would participate with no
conditions immediately Obama called off
the conference giving the reasons which
are the official Israeli reasons can't
have a conference until is a regional
peace settlement of course in the
background
can't be a regional peace settlement
until the US and Israel stop blocking
the international consensus on an Israel
Palestine agreement as they're doing and
have been for 35 years
so no meeting the Arab countries who
have pressed for this for a long time
said they're going to go ahead anyway
but of course it can't without us
support the European Parliament passed a
resolution calling for quick renewal of
the initiative Russia supported it
people in the United States have done
very almost nothing about it for a very
simple reason not a word about this has
appeared in the American press literally
you can read about it in arms control
journals or international affairs
journals or in articles that I write
things on the fringe but the press is
silent about it so no pressure well
could that have succeeded maybe could
have been steps towards mitigating the
crisis and this goes I won't go through
the record but this goes pretty far back
as long as the west following the u.s.
lead refuses to accept a negotiated
diplomatic solution the situation to be
very serious and it's also worth
remembering that every day the United
States and Israel are violating
international law on this issue the UN
Charter anybody cares bans the threat
threat or use of force in international
affairs every time an official says all
options are open that's a criminal act
you know here nobody cares we're
supposed to be able to carry out
criminal act that is a dramatic
illustration of that yesterday the if
you read yesterday's New York Times big
front-page article on the capture of el
bebe jihadi
target in Libya read down to the bottom
of the article there's a quote from the
Secretary of State who's asked whether
in a press conference was this legal
he said yes it's legal it's an accord
with American law that means American
law says we can win in any country we
like and kidnap somebody we want and
that's legal of course is that anybody
else's law you know suppose al-qaeda or
some other countries a Yemen whoever
comes to the United States and kidnaps
John Kerry is that legal if it's legal
by their laws what this says is we claim
that we own the world what we decide
applies universally doesn't matter what
international law is no one else has
these rights an honest report would have
had this as the headline I would have
explained what it means but nobody's
going to comment on that at the United
States or England they're probably most
of the world most of the West at least
elsewhere they know but these are very
important fact the United States has
always adopted the principle of American
exceptionalism this goes back to the you
know the early colonists but it's not a
unique American position every great
power at least everyone I know of has
taken the same position so France was
unique in its civilizing mission as a
which was announced proudly as the
Minister of War was calling for the
extermination of the people of Algeria
Russia under Stalin was uniquely
exceptional and magnificent while it was
carrying out all kind of crimes Hitler
was a pronounced German not German
exceptionalism when he took over
Czechoslovakia was done to end ethnic
cleansing to put bring of the people
into the broader power of the German
High culture and technology in fact I
can't think of an exception
every great power that I know of has
claimed to be exceptional the United
States among them exceptional in its
right to use force and violence isn't
the US doesn't the US I should say take
it a step further with exceptionalism
only because the u.s. is more powerful
if you go back 100 years a British and
French exceptionalism were far more
powerful than the US had the same
doctrine but what really mattered for
the world was the major imperial powers
and didn't Russia's domains it was a
Russia that was exceptional try try to
find an exception
so the exceptionalism is kind of
interesting and that it seems to be
without exception everybody accepts it
and of course it's ludicrous in each
case I'd like to ask you about Syria
they've just begun to dismantle their
chemical Arsenal the u.s. now seemingly
agrees more with Russia that perhaps
military intervention is not the best
way although it seems to be dragging its
feet on Syria policy do you expect
provocations from the armed rebels in
terms of trying to hamper this step to
disarm the arms
there are many armed rebel groups and
they're kind of unpredictable a lot of
them are fighting each other a lot of
them are local some of them are actually
pushing for autonomy like in the Kurdish
area the armed rebel groups are really
pressing for Kurdish autonomy may link
up to the Iraqi Kurdistan and there's
all sorts of others yours and they're
also secular Democratic elements which I
personally they're the kind of people
I'd like to see take over but you know
the dynamics of armed conflict or that
the harshest and most brutal elements on
all sides tend to take I tend to come to
the floor it's almost inevitable so one
may like them as I do but I don't think
their prospects are very good I don't
think what they will do is predictable
actually it's fine to get rid of Syrian
Chemical Weapons it's great but it's
it's not what the policy ought to be
when President Obama and the press and
so on talk about the Chemical Weapons
Convention they crucially miss stated
purposely chemical weapons that what
stated is that the Chemical Weapons
Convention bans the use of chemical
weapons it's only part of the story the
convention bends the production storage
or use of chemical weapons
now production and storage can't be
mentioned because we mentioned them
you've got a dismantle of Israel's
chemical weapons so therefore that can't
be mentioned but this is a perfect
opportunity to move to eliminate
chemical weapons from the region not I'm
just good to remove them from Syria but
remove them for the region and Syrian
chemical weapons are not they're just
for fun they were there as a counter to
Israeli nuclear weapons Israel is the
only country with massive nuclear
capacity in the region so there's a
broader issue goes back to the question
of weapons of mass destruction free zone
in the Middle East which the US has been
blocking for the same reason so this is
a partial it's good in itself but very
partial and the broader opportunities
are not being pursued and are not even
being discussed outside of no really
marginal areas recent information
released by whistleblower Edward Snowden
stirred up a whole lot of scandal across
the globe some see him as a villain
others as a hero the US wants to try him
while other people are calling for him
to receive the highest human rights
prizes what do you think of him I think
he performed the responsibilities of the
honest citizen let the population know
what your elected representatives are
doing the same thing with Bradley
Chelsea Manning let people know what
your government is doing
now the claim is that this those who
want them hang there you know traitor
etc what they say is the harm security
there's two problems with that defense
that one is that when a government or
others related to it claim security it
literally carries no information the
reason is it's predictable no matter
what any state does no matter how awful
it's going to say necessary for security
a message that's completely predictable
was completely uninformative so the
first it's uninformative we can't
however look and see what the claim of
security amounts to and here it's pretty
easy in a society like the United States
precisely because it is a very free and
open society maybe the most in the world
so we had a huge record of the
classified document going way back that
we're classified for security reasons
but are now available huge array of them
can study them and ask to what extent
was security relevant and done a lot of
work on this and others can do it too
and there's a conclusion the security is
almost always relevant but its security
of the government from its own
population that's the security concern a
genuine security like security of the
population from attack is it a very low
concern and you can see this in state
policy as well what time to go through
it but if you run through the record of
state policy from the very beginning up
until the present security is just of
the population is not a high priority in
the United States is not alone in this
that's pretty common why do we not see
more American scrutinize NSA spying
Obama's drone campaign clear violations
and things that you have certainly
people abroad criticize in the US for
why if it's so quiet
back home because the security it's a
frightened population and the security
argument has wait people feel that
somehow the government's protecting us
and it takes a drone the drone campaign
is by far the biggest terrorist campaign
in the world
that's not never described that way
that's of course what it is furthermore
it's a terrorist generating campaign
from the highest levels the most
respected sources it's recognized that
the drone attacks create potential
terrorists and quite a substantial scale
so therefore it is a threat to us
security quite apart from being a
terrorist campaign in itself almost
never discuss that take the invasion of
Iraq the invasion of Iraq was undertaken
with warnings from the intelligence
services in the United States and
Britain both the attacking countries
telogen services warned that this is
going to increase terrorism it did by a
huge factor according to government
statistics by about a factor of seven
the first year does that help security
well that other reasons to invade Iraq
not security and this guy's way back now
let's go back to 1950 okay the US was
overwhelmingly powerful at about half
the world's wealth for incomparable
security and so on there was a potential
danger serious danger
ICBMs with hydrogen bomb warheads they
didn't exist but they were going to
exist well if the government had any
interest in security it would have moved
to see if Russia would accept a treaty
to ban the production of these weapons
and it's very possible that they would
have not pushed they're nice people but
because they knew they were way behind
so it's might have worked there's a kind
of a standard history of nuclear weapons
policy by McGeorge Bundy he was national
security adviser
Kennedy and Johnson he had access to the
highest level internal document and in
this book there's a couple of lines
which are the most important in the book
hidden inside it which observe that he
could not find any paper internal paper
that even raised this possibility the
concern over destruction of the country
was so limited that they never even
discussed the possibility of developing
a treaty arrangement with their own only
adversary which could have eliminated
this threat it's just not a concern and
that's the way States operate where we
know anything about state policy it's
very typically like this these are power
systems they have their own interests
and concerns but security the population
is not a high concern but the population
accepts it they're afraid and they've
accepted in other countries too afraid
they need Big Brother to protect us from
enemies so there's our little protest
and of course our little discussion so
check to see where you can find the
drone campaign described as a terrorist
campaign which is generating terrorists
you can find it on the fringes but for
most people that we've never heard
anything like that thank you very much
for your time for inviting us to your
office here at MIT that was Noam Chomsky
and I'm a Nissen away for our tea
