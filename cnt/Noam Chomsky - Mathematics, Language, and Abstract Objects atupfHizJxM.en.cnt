and the basic source of all
well this if you can you can hear
pointed up it wet it correctly the
things have various aspects physical
mental abstract and so on and you make
mistakes by confusing them and the one
can ask the questions what extent
mathematics might think of this the most
pure abstract human language was capable
of meeting these names something like
that well here we have to be kind of
cautious the contemporary philosophers
like weighted talk about the difference
between physical and mental as if that
means something but doesn't mean
anything because we have no notion of
physical that's the newtonian discovery
there is no notion of physical so we
can't talk about the depiction instead
of going mental we can only talk about
different aspects of the world there the
old concept of physical you know the one
in the mechanical philosophy that's gone
forever and nobody's ever invented a new
one and there's no scientist we can try
the physical is whatever there is that's
the physical and among the things there
are are the mental aspects of the world
like thought they what is an abstract
object well that's a kind of a curious
notion for example the things that
scientists study are abstract objects
like say somebody somebody's studying
planetary motion for example I mean
they're not you know the theory of
planetary motion isn't concerned with
you know asteroids going by or the
effects of alpha centauri or you know
all sorts of other stuff they're
studying an app they're studying
planetary motion and abstraction from
the full complexity you're always
studying things in abstraction from the
full complexity actually that's why
people do experiment the point of doing
experiments is to try to get rid of a
lot of the complexity of the
natural world that somehow you assume
isn't relevant of course you can't do it
100% because the world is always there
but the point of experiments is to try
to get rid of as much as you can so
expose a geneticist is studying fruit
flies or something the geneticist is
going to want to make those fruit flies
as identical as possible and we'll
pretend they are in fact identical but
of course knows perfectly well that they
aren't but what you're doing is studying
them in abstraction from a lot of their
properties so everything we're studying
is an abstract object
there's no way to proceed in a directory
this is sometimes called idealization
but that's a highly misleading term
because idealization suggests to people
that you're moving away from reality and
it's the opposite you do idealization
because you're trying to get to reality
you're trying to cut away the
interfering factors that keep you from
understanding reality so therefore you
idealize to abstract things but that's a
way of finding out what reality is you
know it's not just this massive junk
going on around you that's a useless
mess you want to understand reality
you're going to have to try to find out
what's going on which means abstracting
and idealizing and so on this is the
core of science since since Galileo and
Whitehead of all people should have
known it he did very important work on
the 17th century so these concepts we
can't really make a lot of sense out now
you certainly would
yeah or now but now they don't mean
anything I mean now there is no physical
mental distinction because there's no
physical okay and as far as abstraction
is concerned it's a complicated idea but
this still I'm not saying there's
nothing to the point there is but we
have to be careful in thinking about
what he meant by it you know it's not
introducing polar distinctions of the
kind that might come to mind if you
don't think to worry but what about
mathematics is ideal language well
that's a metaphor I mean asking to say
that language mathematics is a language
is just a metaphoric use of the notion
language I mean it's a little bit like
saying suppose when we were to say look
humans you really fly in fact at the
last Olympics they flew about thirty
feet or so which is after all not very
different from chickens you know the
championship for chicken flight I think
is around 300 feet one over magnitude no
big deal so check people fly kind of
like chickens and they're both very
different from Eagles well I mean maybe
some Martian didn't understand with
organisms or like might say that but
it'd be a really stupid comment I mean
it's true that humans fly more or less
like chickens and neither are like
Eagles but that's not the way it works
chickens fly like Eagles and humans
don't fly at all even though they're
homologous organs involved in this case
like you know arms are sort of
homologous the wings but so to say that
humans fly would become a metaphor it
would be like saying submarine swimmers
say if you want but just metaphor it and
the same is true when you say that
mathematic
the language it certainly doesn't have
the properties of human language the
human language is a natural phenomenon
you know which is part of the biological
world mathematics share some properties
with but you know it doesn't have most
of the properties of language and it has
properties and language doesn't have
mathematics is a human creation
I mean it's if you're a sort of a
platanus you know you think there really
are numbers out there then which most
mathematicians do and it's not a dumb
idea it's hard to think of any other
intelligible explanation of the fact
that you can discover truth of
arithmetic whatever that means it's not
it's not it's not like language I mean
you use natural language in doing
mathematics but you use it in doing
everything else too and when you're
really doing technical mathematics you
sort of discard the language side I mean
you may use it informally you know and
your Club dear students and colleagues
but you mean them to understand that
it's really something else you know they
should throw away all the connotations
and so on the you can't really answer
the question
I mean mathematics is what it is you
know as to whether mathematics is a way
of bringing things together well I mean
that's question of applied mathematics
how can you use mathematics and dealing
with the world and the answer is that as
your conception of things gets clearer
and clearer you know you can move closer
and closer towards giving what we call
mathematical formulations which just
mean precise formulations we call it
mathematics when it's simple enough
mathematics mathematicians have
you know kind of a special dispensation
that scientists don't have they're
allowed to stop working when it gets too
complicated so this effect is kind of a
joke among mathematicians that the only
numbers that exist are one two maybe
three and infinity the others are just
complicated to think about and there's
something to that I mean mathematics you
know real mathematics is the study of
extremely simple structures and
sometimes the study of extremely simple
structures happens to shed surprising
light on the nature of the world that's
when you have applied mathematics but
most of the time that doesn't happen so
nobody does in mathematics of biology or
something like that because the things
you understand is way too complicated to
have any interesting mathematics bill
mathematics have mathematics when you
start proving theorems and that sort of
thing and in the case of language I mean
you know there's I mean I've worked on
it too there's thing called mathematical
linguistics which is the study of
systems that have some of the properties
of language but our simplified enough so
you can actually person theorems about
them and it's of whatever interest it is
I mean you have to look and see but it's
like studying other systems that you
abstract from reality and investigate
because they're interesting on their own
maybe because you hope to learn
something about the real world by
looking at their properties but there's
no other sense in which mathematics can
make meaning
