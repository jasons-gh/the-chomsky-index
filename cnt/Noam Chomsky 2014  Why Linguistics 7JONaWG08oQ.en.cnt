partly it's I mean I had some interest
even as a child not just from knowing
what my father's work my father was a
medieval Hebrew scholar and not his ten
years older so I probably read his
thesis you know I was with historical
Semitic so I'm just kind of interested
in that and when I got to college I was
bored out of my mind after the first
year I was ready to drop out because it
was hand in the neck and I happened
through political contacts to meet
someone who I thought it was about 90
years old he was about 40 but others and
a very interesting person Berg he
happened to be the the most important
theoretical linguist in the country and
he suggested to me that I should start
taking his graduate courses I think he
was in retrospect I think he was trying
to indirectly convincing enough at a
college but SR takes his graduate
courses and I got interested
good for a long time I thought no that's
got to be the right answer so I worked
on trying to improve the methods that he
was developing that were pretty old
these were the most sophisticated
version of the approaches are structural
linguistics I gradually came to secretly
just ignore direction but the reason for
interest in it is to get in kind of a
truism um that's the crucial property
that distinguishes humans from other
animals practically every aspect of
human cognition depends on tell me
that's why you humans are creative of
why humans and fifty thousand years ago
were creating new kinds of tools of the
meaning of symbolic art to the recording
natural events they had language and
other organisms didn't the there are
plenty of hominids human-like creatures
around
gone none of them have this capacity
somehow it developed in one apparently
very small group and that's us that
spread around the world are all
basically identical there's no
differences in cognitive capacities
language and others and it's the notes
it's unique biological phenomenon and
it's also one that may well destroy the
world but you can't see it and
help being interested
