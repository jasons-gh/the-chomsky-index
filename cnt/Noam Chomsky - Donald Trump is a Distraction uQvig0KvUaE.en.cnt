from the point of view of u.s
power he's harming it
but from the point of view of u.s elites
he's given them everything they want i
mean in fact what's
going on in the united states if you
think about it as
a kind of a two-level
wrecking ball if you want to call it
that trump
his role whether this is conscious or
not i don't know so you can see what
what's happening trump's role is to
ensure
that the media and public attention
are always concentrated on him
so every time you turn on a television
set trump
opened the front page of the newspaper
trump
and in order to maintain he's a con man
basically a showman
and in order to maintain public
attention you have to do something crazy
otherwise nobody's going to pay
attention to you if you do normal things
you'll be
you know way back somewhere so every day
there's one
insane thing after another and then
you know to me make some crazy lie you
know you have the biggest crowd in
history or something the media looks at
it and says no i'm the biggest crowd but
meanwhile he's on to something else and
then you go to that one
and while this show is going on in
public
the uh well in the background uh the
wrecking crew is working
paul ryan mr mcconnell um
executive orders what they're doing is
systematically urge my friends
to stand with us on this bipartisan bill
government
that works for the benefit of the
population
this goes from workers rights to uh
pollution pollution pollution of the
environment
the rules for protecting consumers i
mean anything you can think of is being
dismantled
and all efforts are being devoted
kind of almost with fanaticism to enrich
and empower
their actual constituency which is super
wealth
and corporate power who are delighted
that's why the stock market goes up
stock market has not much to do with the
economy but
keeps booming because that's the rich
people and they love
being granted now the worst policies
that he's carried out the most dangerous
are barely discussed those are
the two existential threats that we face
you have to face the fact that humans
are now in a
situation which has never arisen in
human history
this generation has to decide
whether organized human existence is
going to continue
and it's not a joke it's uh
global warming and nuclear war those are
the major issues they ought to be
big headlines every day and trump's
actions are making both of them much
more dangerous
in the case of nuclear war the policies
are significantly increasing the threat
of nuclear
war in case of global warming it's
almost indescribable that not only has
the u.s
pulled out uniquely alone in the world
it's pulled out from the international
efforts do at least something about it
but beyond that it's the trump
administration is going
out of its way to increase the threat
uh look listen to his state of the union
address or
the only phrase about global
climate was to talk about our beautiful
clean coal
the worst polluter there is which we
have
we have a thousand years of it you know
and
look at the new budgets that's coming
out sharply cuts
research and support for any kind of
renewable energy more
subsidies and support for the most
polluting destructive
things and and it's not just trump it's
the entire republican leadership
so if you look at the 2016 election at
the primaries
every single candidate not a single
exception
either denied that global warming has
taken place
or said maybe it is but we shouldn't do
anything about it
which i think is worse they were called
the moderates like
kasich so then and if you look at trump
himself
or say rex tillerson secretary of state
they know perfectly well that humans are
causing global warming
the fact that trump has golf courses all
over and
he's he hasn't built a wall in mexico
yet but he's building walls around his
golf courses to make sure that the sea
level doesn't destroy them
rex tillerson was ceo of exxon mobil
since the 1970s scientists at exxon
mobil have been
we now know they've been made public
forced to be making public they've been
producing severe warnings to the
leadership
about the effect of the use of petroleum
on
destroying the environment so they all
know about it
but they're not doing anything about it
which is a level of
criminality that is almost hard to find
words to describe
i mean here are you know educated
well-off rich people
very lead who know that what they're
doing
is destroying the prospects for human
organized human life and do it anyway
because they make more profit tomorrow
can you think of an
analog to that in human history i really
can't
i mean i've said sometimes
what's considered an utterly outrageous
comment that the
today's republican party is the most
dangerous organization in human history
sounds outrageous but think about it for
a moment
i mean hitler didn't intend to destroy
the prospects for human existence
attila the hun didn't intend that nobody
has
but that's what these guys intend and
it's not
ignorant uneducated you know religious
fundamentalists whatever you want to
blame people these are the most educated
best supported people in the world and
they're doing this
eyes open because you can make more
profit tomorrow
it's hard to imagine anything like it
and it's not just my opinion
take say the bulletin of the atomic sign
the doomsday clock
famous doomsday clock it's set up by the
bulletin of atomic scientists since 1947
each year they gather distinguished
physicists
political analysts others to look at the
state of the world
and make a judgment of how far we are
from terminal disaster
midnight is terminal disaster in 1947
the clock was set
seven minutes to midnight after the
autobahn
moved up and back since now it's at the
closest it's been to midnight
ever they just moved it to two minutes
to midnight that's where it was in
1953 when the u.s
and later the ussr exploded
thermonuclear weapons which were
could totally destroy the world so it
went to two minutes now it's back to two
minutes
and that's the republican party that's
the ones who are running
the country and dominating the world
there's never been a situation
like this
