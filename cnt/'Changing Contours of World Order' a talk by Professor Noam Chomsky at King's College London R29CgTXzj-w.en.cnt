chomsky ladies and gentlemen I'm Rick
trainer principal of king's college
london and it's my great pleasure to
welcome you all to this event sponsored
by the international state crime
initiative which as many of you know is
an increasingly successful center of
intellectual excellence and the
initiatives new international journal
state crime which is being launched here
tonight is something we're very proud to
host here at King's College London now
it's not my role to introduce tonight's
speaker but before I introduce the
person who is going to introduce him i'd
like to say just a word of welcome on
behalf of the college to professor Noam
Chomsky now King's College London has
two basic purposes one is to carry out
excellent academic activities especially
teaching and research and the other is
to be of service to society and in
respect to both of these basic purposes
we could hardly have a more appropriate
speaker than Noam Chomsky as far as
academic excellence is concerned he's
really in a class by himself he has
taught at MIT for no fewer than fifty
six years and he still teaching and in
terms of research he is arguably the
most influential scholar ever certainly
the most influential scholar of the
second half of the 20th century and what
we've seen so far of the 21st century
with influence not only in his own
discipline of linguistics but very far
beyond that and with regard to service
to society he is without any doubt one
of the most distinguished commentators
on the world beyond
Ka'Deem a role that he has been pursuing
for nearly as long perhaps as long as
he's been teaching at MIT he someone of
course who has been the subject of
considerable controversy in this role as
a commentator but even those who
disagree with him would have to concede
that he cares very much about the wider
world and he has had a very considerable
impact on it so in all these grounds
he's a very appropriate speaker for
King's College London and it's a great
honour for us to have him here as a
speaker this evening I now like to hand
over to Professor penny green director
of the center and one of the editors of
the journal and it will be her proper
task to introduce professor Chomsky
penny
I have to move it this way slightly so
everybody can see well we're delighted
to welcome you all here this evening to
launch the international state crime
initiatives new journal state crime over
here published by Pluto journals and
based here at King's College London and
the big welcome to all of those of you
in Waterloo I'm sorry you can't be here
but we're delighted you're watching us
live stream for those of you who don't
know me I'm penny green and with Tony
Ward over here I'm the director of esky
we are also along with Christian laslett
editors of the new journal I very much
hope that you will subscribe to what
will be a scholarly yet highly
accessible journal tackling questions
related to understanding and exposing
state violence and state corruption and
the resistance that these forms of
powerful criminality and gender if you
do subscribe this evening you will get a
hefty discount so I advise you to do it
tonight and I should also add that
gnomes books will be available upstairs
and his latest book will be heavily
discounted by Pluto press if you
purchase it this evening we hope to have
some specimen copies of the journal
available upstairs so please go to both
the Pluto press and the Pluto journals
tables and and do support us we'd be
really delighted if you did and before
introducing the man that you've all come
to here this evening I want to take this
opportunity to thank all those who've
worked so hard to make this event
possible thanks very much to Rick and
the principal's office to Tim Macklin
and the school of law to our dedicated
of doctoral students and iski supporters
to a particular thank you to Bev stole
who is noms PA at MIT she's an amazing
woman and has really facilitated this
this process but most especially of all
I want to thank our law school maestro
Adam Tupper who's been simply
magnificent in organizing this event so
thank you very much Adam could I ask you
now please to take a moment to delve
into your handbags and coat pockets and
take out those mobile phones and switch
them off thank you very much so that
done good it's now my profound pleasure
and privilege to introduce professor
Noam Chomsky who as an honorary fellow
of ischia and I see also John Pilger
who's another honorary fellow of whiskey
sitting right at the front we delighted
to have you here John gnome is very
generously launching state crime this
evening I very much like the way that
Michael Albert a former student of
gnomes at MIT in the 1960s the way in
which he introduced Noam Chomsky at the
rebellious media conference on saturday
by saying that gnome is a very special
person not least in denying that there
is anything special about himself he is
a brilliant linguist a searing critic of
u.s. foreign policy and crimes of the
powerful he's a man who barely sleeps
but who with the greatest of generosity
and grace somehow manages to respond to
the extraordinary demands made by his
millions of supporters around the world
and if you've ever written Noam Chomsky
an email I'm sure you've had a reply his
fierce critique and gentle manner stand
as the moral voice of our time
the New York Times have described him as
arguably the most important intellectual
alive so it's now a very great honor to
hand over to professor Noam Chomsky
thanks Benny whenever I hear that
sentence quoted in an introduction I
can't resist adding the next sentence
which doesn't get quoted which was how
can he write such terrible things about
American foreign policy well it's good
I'm glad to be here on the occasion of
the launch the journal the journal is
new the topic obviously isn't might open
with a word about the topic or at least
some sub part of it too much to cover
I'll just keep to one of the lesser
state crimes namely international
terrorism putting aside much more
serious ones like aggression so on the
that topic international terrorism
became kind of moved into the general
agenda 30 years ago when Ronald Reagan
entered office and his administration
declared that a prime focus of
administration policy would be
state-directed international terrorism
called at the the plague of the modern
age returned to barbarism at our time
sample some of the fevered rhetoric this
they did not have an
they had in mind you know Cuban directed
international terrorism which didn't
exist Russian directed international
terrorism which maybe could find with a
microscope they did not bet jokubas a
good choice Cuba in fact by then already
had the record of being the recipient
the target of more international
terrorism than probably the rest of the
world combined but they didn't have that
in mind obviously that was coming from
Washington the Kennedy administration
after the failure of the Bay of Pigs
launched the campaign operation Mongoose
to bring the terrors of the earth to
Cuba that was the phrase used by
historian Arthur Schlesinger Kennedy's
lat close Kennedy confidant Latin
American advisor this was in his
biography or less official biography of
Robert Kennedy the president's brother
who was assigned the task of supervising
the terrors of the earth as his highest
priority took it very seriously the
first book just came out of oral history
which gives the first kind of record of
the voices of the victims Keith blender
a Canadian scholar I think he may be
coming here soon bad it was very serious
it was no joke in fact it almost led to
terminal nuclear war apart from what it
did to Cuba the operation was supposed
to culminate in October 1962 you may
recall that that was maybe the most
dangerous moment in history
came very close to a nuclear war and
that was connected with the terrorist
crimes which are supposed to lead to an
invasion of Cuba in that month that's
one of many examples unfortunately very
many at that time the Reagan in fact
launched what these days is called a
global war on terror that's pronounced G
what if you have want to know don't ask
me why and he it also launched a flood
of books and articles a new profession
of terrorism studies dubious profession
but which England is right at the peak
it among the books and articles were
quite number of mine and friends mind
all concentrating on just what Reagan
said was the plague of the modern age
state-directed international terrorism
but these books and articles can't enter
the Canon because they have a
fundamental error of logic I in friend
Zuma and used the official definitions
of terrorism in the US Code British
government Army manuals there now
codified and UN Security Council
resolutions defining terror General
Assembly resolutions and all of that
material is kind of politically
incorrect because if you accept those
definitions it follows almost
immediately that the United States is
one of the lead maybe the leading
actor in in leading the plague of the
modern age with Britain that's junior
partner close second and that's the
wrong conclusion obviously so that can't
be allowed book with the title like
western state terrorism edited by a
british american philosopher is then at
oxford that can't enter the cannon
clearly so has been much narrower i
presume this journal won't won't meet
those conditions it's that one thing
that was set off in the early 80s when
the g wat began was a search a scholarly
search to craft a definition of
terrorism which would have the right
properties it would exclude the terror
that we carry out against others but
would include of course what they do to
us typically much less and that's there
are some general conclude their academic
conferences you know scholarly meetings
journals that said a profession started
and they all agree that it's a very
difficult concept to define terrorism so
you can't use the definitions that are
in US and British law international
conventions and you have to somehow
craft a definition with the right
properties and that's hard if anybody
has any suggestions you can get a PhD at
st. Andrews or somewhere by giving them
an answer but so far they haven't really
got the right definition so it's a lot
of studies still going on
it isn't easy well Reagan's G what has
been disappeared to borrow the
terminology of some of our victims for
good reason it his war on terror led to
appalling atrocities very quickly in
Central America when the main targets
maybe a couple hundred thousand tortured
mutilated corpses Middle East tens of
thousands southern Africa estimated
roughly a million and a half south
africa and depredations in the
surrounding countries that's aside from
what was going on in South Africa itself
all supported by the United States as
part of the defense against terrorism
and the reason was that's the Pentagon
explained in 1988 that you had to defend
South African apartheid state against
what they called one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
that was Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress so obviously I do that
and that been supporting their
depredations which were murderers in
fact Mandela himself had just got off
the terrorist list about two years ago
he can now come to the United States
without special dispensation but none of
this is a lot more like it is
appropriate for the historical record so
when Bush number two declared a global
war on terror in 2001 that was heralded
this
new not a repetition of an old and ugly
story straight now State terrors being
escalated to new levels some of you may
be old enough to remember that there
once was a concept in British and
American law the coke presumption of
innocence a person is innocent until
proven guilty in a court of law that's
long disappeared now there's a license
to kill anyone you want actually there
was a transition from Bush to Obama in
this respect Bush is G wat included
kidnapping people who you suspected of
something or other sending them off to
secret prison camps very nice treatment
but Obama has escalated it now you don't
kidnap them and imprison them without
charges you just kill them that's a
massive global assassination campaign
going on on just a couple of weeks ago
it escalated to a new level went beyond
the license to murder suspects to a
license to murder people who are
suspected of encouraging people to
engage in what we call terrorist crimes
so in the New York Times Sunday edition
week before this there was a headline
reading as the West celebrates a clerics
death the Mideast shrugs so we now not
only celebrate the assassination of
people accused of suspected of criminal
activity but even the murder of someone
clerk in this case who alleged to have
inspired others to carry out crimes this
particular case has been a little
mumbling because the cleric who was
killed happens to be an American citizen
and there
some sentimental thoughts that American
citizens still have some kind of Rights
unlike the unpeopled borrow the phrase
of the great British diplomatic
historian mark Curtis and his studies of
British state crimes since World War two
it's also worth bearing in mind that the
category of terrorism is quite broad
we're striking examples one of the few
cases that almost came to trial palmer
cotter is a 15-year old boy who was
captured by American soldiers attacking
his village in Afghanistan he was taken
to Guantanamo and stayed there for seven
years without charge at which point he
pleaded guilty and I won't comment on
what that means after seven years in
Guantanamo so he after pleading guilty
he was given an eight-year sentence the
charge to which he pleaded guilty was
trying to defend his village from
American soldiers who were attacking it
and that's obviously terrorists through
this well that's she's a Canadian
citizen and Canada could extradite him
and save him from the next eight years
of prison but they don't want to step on
the toes of the master so they're
courageously refusing to do this well
that's none of this of course is
completely new some of you may even be
old enough to remember the slogan of the
Gestapo during
Second World War the slogan was terror
against terror they were talking about
the need to carry out terror against the
partisans who were also terrorists
resisting Nazi aggression so we aren't
breaking any new grounds in that respect
well I'll put aside the miserable topic
of state terror which this is a tiny
sample and turn to the announced topic
the contours of World Order and the
changes they're undergoing which are
very real actually one quite prominent
concern these days is what's called
American decline current issue of the
major political science journal in the
u.s. American generally the American
Academy of political science you read
that it is a common theme that the
United States which only a few years ago
was held to stride the world as a
colossus with unparalleled power and
unmatched appeal is in decline ominously
facing the prospects of its final decay
and there's also a common corollary to
that namely that power is shifting
continuing its shift from east to west
you know first to Western Europe then
across the Atlantic now take another
step forward to the rising powers of
China and India if there were any truth
to that it would mean that we're
essentially going back to the 18th
century when they were indeed the
commercial industrial centers of the
world
before Britain help take care of that
well American the clock decline in fact
is very real the corollary I think is
extremely dubious they've had very
impressive economic growth but these are
very poor countries they're very severe
internal problems there the world is in
fact surely getting a lot more diverse
but despite America's decline which is
real in the foreseeable future don't see
any indication that is any competitor
for hegemonic global power well there
are further qualifications that are in
order for one thing the decline is not
something new contrary to what's being
said it started in 1945 in 1945 the
United States reached the peak of its
power and wealth historically
unprecedented during the war the war of
course ended the depression the US
industrial production virtually quite
Drupal competitive competing industrial
societies were devastated or destroyed
certainly it's merely harmed the u.s.
literally had fifty percent of the
world's wealth it's never been anything
like that in history it also had
incomparable security controlled the
entire hemisphere controlled both oceans
control the opposite sides of the book
of the of the oceans and the
it was an enormous amount of power and
it began to decline right away so by
1949 there was a serious blow to us
power that has a name it's called the
loss of China which is a kind of an
interesting phrase that had never
questioned you can only lose something
that you possess you know like I can't
lose you know your books but we of
course possess China are supposed to and
that's just taken for granted and since
we possess it and it became independent
1949 we lost it and the loss of China is
a major issue in world affairs that was
a blow to wartime plans that had been
developed during the Second World War
Roosevelt's planners understood very
well that the United States was going to
emerge from the war in a position of
extraordinary power and they laid plans
careful plans which were later
implemented sophisticated plans to
organize and run the world that they
expected dominate they constructed what
they called a grand area the grand area
was to include of course the entire
western hemisphere the whole Far East
and the former British Empire which US
was taking over British would Britain
was to be reduced to a junior partner as
the Foreign Office ruefully recognized
that in taking over the British Empire
meant crucially taking over the energy
reserves of Western Asia called the
Middle East which were staggering and
understood to be staggering State
Department 1945 called that a stupendous
source of strategic power one of the
greatest material prizes in world
history Eisenhower or later described
that it was strategically most important
at part of the world one of Roosevelt's
leading advisers liberal analyst
statesman a burly observed that if we
can control Middle East oil resources we
can control the world and the US didn't
intend to give that up and doesn't
intend to now that's highly relevant to
current affairs as one of the leading
British diplomatic historians Jeffrey
Warner when the most respected
specialists on the period is quite
correct when he writes that the
documentary record shows clearly that
President Roosevelt was aiming at United
States hegemony in the postwar world in
the early parts of the war 41 42 it was
expected that Germany would survive as a
major power so it'd be a German run
world and the grant area in American run
world after the Russian army started
grinding the Germans down after
Stalingrad the planning change was
recognized that Germany wouldn't survive
and the Grand area plans were expanded
to include the commercial and industrial
center of Eurasia Western Europe and
also southern Europe which was important
critically because of its perceived role
in protecting
energy shipments from the Middle East
fat grease was part of the near East
Department of the State Department until
nineteen seventy-four after the
us-backed dictatorship was overthrown
and it was not a trivial matter to
control all these places plenty of
violence the within i should say within
these domains however large they could
be there were specific plans i might as
well read them they're still in still
formulated the u.s. is still in
operation of the US is much less easy to
impose them able to impose them within
these domains the US was to maintain
unquestioned power with military and
economic supremacy while ensuring the
limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by states that might
interfere with us global designs it's a
pretty expansive vision and the
doctrines that do still prevail
government statements but the power to
implement them as indeed decline while
the wartime plans were not unrealistic
that even before the war the US had been
far and away the richest country in the
world and as I say the war greatly
enhanced that wealth and power
and the plans were sophisticated each
region of the world was assigned what
was called its function within the
global system so Southeast Asia was its
function was to provide raw materials
and resources to the former colonial
masters in Britain and Malaya and so on
so they could recover from the war and
play their proper role within the use us
dominated system each region of the
world was discussed some of them are
kind of interesting like Africa this was
all planned by George Kennan and his
State Department planning staff Kenan is
sort of one extreme doves in fact he was
kicked out of the State Department
because he was considered not tough
enough for this harsh world it's
interesting to read his proposal with
regard to Africa kennen proposed that he
said the US the u.s. the time wasn't
much interested in Africa so he said we
should hand over Africa to the Europeans
for them to exploit that's is frayed for
their reconstruction and you look at the
history of African Europe you might
think of a different possible
relationship but naturally that was
never under 10 entertained well now
that's no longer true us is not willing
to give up the Africa to Europe to
exploit wants to take part in it itself
well as I say by 1949 this grand vision
was already beginning to crumble the
loss of China was serious shortly after
that they came the threat of loss of
Southeast Asia in nineteen fifty or so
the first
a problem there was Indochina which
really didn't matter that much in itself
but the much bigger threat was Indonesia
Indonesia has quite rich which resources
and the the idea that Indonesia might
the loss of Indonesia that could be
serious actually this the planning for
the Vietnam War is worth understanding
it's sophisticated and in fact the US
won most of its objectives I disagree
with a lot of my friends about and this
general conclusion that the US lost the
war I think it basically won the war if
you look at its objectives which were
laid out in the early 50s of the plenty
of documentary material about this now
Indochina while not all that serious
ignimbrite spread contagion the virus is
the threat of independent successful
development which might spread contagion
and that others might follow the model
and try to pursue the same path
themselves and that could be dangerous
if the virus spreads a to Indonesia and
they pursued a path of independent
development and also to the other
regions Southeast Asia japanee Japan is
called the super domino by Asia
historian John dower Japan might move to
accommodate itself to increasingly
independent Southeast Asia and become
its industrial center technical in dust
commercial center and that would have
meant in effect that the United States
would have lost the Pacific phase of
World War two which in the Pacific
region was fought to prevent Japan from
establishing what was called a new order
in which it would be its role in the
early 1950s the United States was not
prepared to lose World War two so
something had to be done about the virus
well there's a way to deal with the
virus that might spread contagion very
simple way you kill the virus and you
inoculate the potential victims the
potential victims are inoculated by
installing vicious murderous regimes
which keep the place under control and
that's what was done by the mid-1960s
Vietnam it pretty much destroyed wasn't
going to be a model for anybody and the
surrounding regions were mostly mostly
brutal dictatorships were installed the
final most significant step was in fact
Indonesia 1965 there was a military coup
in Indonesia back supported may be
instigated by the United States which
was very successful the Suharto coup
would immediately killed hundreds of
thousands of people mostly landless
peasants destroyed the only functioning
political party party of the poor
and opened up Indonesia to free
exploitation of its resources by the
West and that was celebrated with
absolutely phoria Western commentators
couldn't keep down their enthusiasm New
York Britain to the New York Times
described what they had described was
going on pretty accurately the New York
Times described but they called a
staggering mass slaughter in Indonesia
which was a gleam of light in Asia that
was the conclusion of their liberal
commentator James rest and hope with her
once was none boiling bloodbath that
tremendous success and so on and it's
interestingly McGeorge Bundy who was the
national security adviser for the
Kennedy and Johnson later years he
looking back at retrospect he concluded
that the United States probably should
have pulled out of Vietnam in 1965 after
the Indonesia coup because they'd
already won the war Vietnam was
destroyed the region was inoculated no
fear of losing the Second World War so
was a mistake to waste resources to try
to destroy the last traces I should say
that the same reasoning held for Cuba as
soon as right away as soon as Cuba
liberated itself 1959 that within months
there were internal plans overthrow the
government bombing started a couple of
months later when Kennedy came in at all
escalated pretty sharply the Kennedy had
he intended to concentrate on
latin-american issues he had Latin
American mission headed by Arthur
Schlesinger they gave a report to the
inn
president which is very much worth
reading it was given it was summarized
by Schlesinger well known the ruling
story he explained to incoming president
that the problem in Cuba is what he
called the castro idea of taking matters
into your own hands an idea which might
influence others in the region who face
similar problems and might try to do the
same thing so the virus would spread
contagion and the the cure was the tip
of the usual one let's try to destroy
the virus and let's protect the region
and right then started the series of
military kuz first and Brazil and all
over the place installing really
murderous vicious regimes finally
reached Central America in the 80s
plague of repression like nothing that
ever happened in the hemisphere and they
couldn't quite get rid of the virus but
it was contained the terror war
restricted any likelihood of growth and
development of course is a very tough
and Fargo that was imposed and still
remains because the the CIA explained
that the problem with Cuba is what they
call a Castro successful defiance of
policies going back to the Monroe
Doctrine that's 1823 which proclaimed
that the US should dominate the
hemisphere couldn't do it then the
British were a deterrent but now they
could do it and that can't be tolerated
if you take a look at the policy it
gives you a lot of insight into how
foreign policy is formulated for 4 30
for 30 or 40 years public opinion in the
United States has been strongly in favor
of normalizing relations with Cuba but
it's normal for public opinion to be
dismissed and what we call democracy but
more interesting in this case is that
major sectors of us business want to
normalize relations that includes
agribusiness energy pharmaceuticals and
quite significant parts of the business
world they want to normalize relations
and their concerns are dismissed that is
unusual not unique there are other cases
and they're interesting cases but the
state dedication to punishing successful
defiance overwhelms the usual modalities
of policy formation which are typically
in the hands of private capital that
shows a really significant state
interest involved there are other cases
and you learn a lot from them
unfortunately these are not studied in
international relations theory which is
quite unfortunate but if you look at
them carefully you can learn a lot well
as I said American decline started
quickly meanwhile subversion and
violence continued through the South
don't have to run through that familiar
with it goes on constantly horrible
story well Europe was particularly
important in the grand area planning for
obvious reasons and there were plans put
in place right away for Europe to be
reconstituted reconstructed but there
was preliminary committed condition in
order to reconstruct
thanks in order before Europe could
reconstruct be reconstructed it was
necessary to impose what's called
stability meaning subordination to us
power that meant it was necessary to
destroy the anti-fascist resistance
which was the first target of us and
british forces when they invaded the
continent first in italy and greece and
beyond that meant destroying the labor
movement and dependent labor movement
and the left which was the core or the
anti-fascist resistance and reinstating
the traditional order including plenty
of fascist collaborators began during
the war when the British and Americans
started marching up through Italy and
was carried out consistently throughout
the region often very bloody as in
Greece plenty of subversion as Italy
Germany was of course particularly
important powerful state and it was
necessary to destroy Vito Vito Union
constitutions forcefully terminate
social experiments and in general to
wall off western Germany from the
eastern zone that was George cannons
phrase by the wall off the West to
ensure that there wouldn't be any
contagion coming from elements of
radical democracy in the East and that
was done the Marshall Plan came along
that doubtless aided European
construction but that wasn't its only
goal in large part the Marshall Plan was
in fact a taxpayer subsidy to major US
corporations and that's appreciated by
the
I Ares they don't read the foreign
policy literature they just look at
their records so the Reagan
administration had pointed out that the
Marshall Plan set the stage for large
amounts of private US direct investment
in Europe laying the groundwork for the
rise of post-war multinational
corporations businessweek main business
journal described the multinational
corporations as the economic expressions
of the political framework established
by post-war policymakers in which
American business prospered and expanded
on overseas orders fueled initially by
the dollars of the Marshall Plan that
protected from negative developments
like say a labor movement or something
like that by the umbrella of American
power it was always recognized and
feared that Europe might follow an
independent course maybe sort of
coalesced course of Europe independent
Europe from Atlantic to the Urals and
there were measures taken to prevent
that one of them is NATO and it's quite
interesting to see what happened to NATO
when the theoretical pretext for it
Russian hordes disappeared back to that
in a moment well meanwhile
decolonisation followed it's agonizing
course by 1970 the u.s. power had
significantly declined that wasn't fifty
percent of the world's wealth anymore
was about twenty five percent which
still approximately is it's still
colossal but nothing like what it was at
the end of the Second World War so there
had been significant American decline by
that time 1970 the world was becoming
what's called tri-polar economically
three major economic centers north
based in the US Western Europe mostly
German based and East Asia were ready
the most dynamic region of the world at
that time japan-based since expanded to
China 20 years later at nineteen ninety
the Soviet Union collapsed now for those
interested in the reality of the Cold
War that's a very important place to
look to ask what happened when the
superpower enemy collapsed that's very
instructive and I urge you to look at it
of course Washington immediately
instituted new policies now they're all
perfectly public you wanted search
hidden record the this is the first Bush
administration they immediately
presented a new national security
strategy a new defense budget to deal
with the world after the Russians have
disappeared and it's interesting reading
they started by saying that we still
have to maintain a huge military system
that's still necessary and not to
protect ourselves from the Russians
because they're not around but because
of the technological sophistication of
third world powers now if you are
properly educated intellectually you're
not supposed to laugh when you hear that
we'd still need the same system because
the third world is so technologically
sophisticated so we don't laugh they've
got a college degree you understand that
makes sense the it was still necessary
they said to maintain the defense
industrial base that phrase is a
euphemism for high-tech industry United
States and Britain believe in free
markets for the week you know but not
for us please for us we need a powerful
state that sustains the economy saves
the wealthy and so on and the high-tech
economy the modern
I tech economy you know your computers
the internet IT revolution so it mostly
comes out of it a Pentagon actually the
places where I was working in the 1950s
and 60s from about 30 years of
development mostly in the state sector
before it was handed over to private
power for profit and that's the way the
economy pretty much runs goes back to
the early days of British
industrialization it when Britain
followed the same path of state powerful
statement intervention to be create and
maintain an industrial economy us picked
it up but same with ever he developed
society so we still needed to the state
still had the subsidized the defense
industrial base meaning the next stage
of high technology that one of the most
interesting parts was about intervention
forces it concluded that we have to
maintain intervention forces directed at
the Middle East then comes an
interesting phrase where the serious
threats to our interest could not have
been laid at the Kremlin's door in other
words they were independent radical
nationalism so sorry folks we've been
lying to you for 50 years but it's too
late to go on with that so now we'll
tell the truth we need the intervention
forces in case those guys get out of
hand which is in fact what they were for
all along but it was you know it was now
quietly conceded well here too in the
Middle East it had as everywhere it had
been necessary to destroy viruses that
might spread contagion many examples
Iran and 1953 Iraq 10 years later sick
most significantly Nasser's Egypt which
was kind of the center of secular
nationalism that happened in 1967
the war it's the war is described justly
as a Israel Egypt war but there was
another war going on in the background
of a Saudi egyptian war in fact they
were actually at war and southern Yemen
and there was a lot of concern that
secular nationalism might spread from
Egypt to the radical Islamic
dictatorships the oil dictatorships and
in fact written in the United States
have pretty consistently supported
radical Islamism against secular
nationalism on Britain Curtis has a good
recent book on this and seems true in
the United States which kind of makes
sense if you think about it the real
problem is viruses little spread
contagion and maybe efforts to pursue an
independent path so that continued 1967
also established us-israeli relations in
their present form before that they were
so exceptional since then they have been
and the reason was it was recognized
that Israel performed a great service to
the United States and it's a saudi ally
or clan what are we going to call it it
destroyed the threat of secular
nationalism then came what's called the
Nixon Doctrine which was public the
Nixon Doctrine mostly for the Middle
East stated that the structure of what
they call Middle East security meaning
supporting us dominance in the region
would be of course the dictatorships the
radical Islamic dictatorship slike Saudi
Arabia are major friend
and then they the dictatorships have
been protected from the populations and
that would be done by what they call
cops on the beat surrounding states
preferably non-arab they do better
killing Arabs and they would protect the
power of the dictatorships from their
own populations of course it is really
the dictators the cops at the time were
the shut the Iran which was then under
the shot Pakistan providing royal guard
for the Saudi royal family intervening
when it had to Turkey major power and
now Israel Israel could be a cop on the
beat unstated but obvious where that
police headquarters are in Washington
and there's a branch office in London
where the junior partners assigned some
roles now and then so that's the basic
structure of power and it things have
changed but the basic thinking still
remains of the core of the us-israel
relationship is still sort of like that
well let's go back to the end of the
Cold War 20 years ago the fate of NATO
is quite instructive remember NATO was
supposed to be there to protect Western
Europe from the Russian hort well no
more Russian boards so what should
happen if anyone believed the propaganda
of the preceding years NATO should have
disappeared it's not needed anymore
that's not what happened in fact the
opposite happened that expanded NATO
immediately expanded to the east
incidentally in violation of pledges to
the Gorbachev who was willing to make
accommodations on condition that NATO
would not expand one inch to the east as
the Bush administration assured him
later wouldn't immediately made of
expanded East Germany than beyond the
orbit Jeff complained
happy about this and Washington explain
him if he's naive enough to accept
promises from the United States that's
his problem but a real statesman would
know better so that's gone and can use
to expand to the east by now the it's
going way beyond the current official
role of NATO's official role is first of
all to serve as an international us run
intervention force but mainly to protect
the infrastructure of the global energy
system that means to project sea lanes
pipelines all over the world and
Europe's supposed to go along with that
is indeed it does well at that that I
mentioned before that there was this
euphoria at the time about the
magnificence of the u.s. great Colossus
and there was I mean a very strange
period of intellectual history you go
back to the 1990s the rhetoric of
Western intellectuals was astonishing
sounds Frank Wright like very much like
North Korea so Clinton's foreign policy
was described by leading intellectuals
as having a as entering a noble phase
with a saintly glow the first time in
history a country is guided by altruism
alone dedicated to principles and values
an idealistic new world bent on ending
in humanity at last it could carry
forward unhindered the emerging
international norm of humanitarian
intervention I'm in rendering a
magnificent world it's interesting to
read it's not that long ago that it was
all over well not everybody was so
enraptured needless to say in the global
South the
victims they saw a little bit
differently so they bitterly condemned
what they called the the so-called right
of humanitarian intervention that
recognizing it to be just the old right
of Imperial internment domination and
there were more some more sober voices
at home I should say not everybody lisak
following the kimmel song style so for
example there were prestigious voices
that pointed out that the United States
was becoming the rogue superpower
considered the single greatest threat
greatest external threat to their
societies of third world and that the
prime rogue state today is the United
States these are not marginal voices
that's Samuel Huntington very
prestigious Harvard professor and Robert
Gervais in his presidential address for
the American Political Science
Association so not quiet voices but they
were kind of drowned out in the
enthusiasm for the mobile phase saintly
glow etc after Bush jr. took over this
hostility to the United States and the
global South particularly the Middle
East grew enormously he was his approval
ratings shot down Obama has carried out
an actual major feat he succeeded in
lowering his popularity in the Arab
world even below Bush its that's not a
small achievement is
now down i think the five percent
approval in egypt and similar numbers
elsewhere well meanwhile the decline
continued in the last decade something
very significant happened south america
has been lost as the term is that a
threat had been around for a long time
there was plenty of brutal interventions
and so on but it finally happened by the
last decade they've really moved for the
first time in five hundred years towards
integration independence many the all US
military bases have been kicked out of
south america and they're really going
their own way just right now a new
organization has been formed select
which includes every country of the
western hemisphere apart from what's
called the Anglosphere britain's
expansion extensions united states of
canada they're out the rest of the
hemispheres moving independently is that
actually functions it'll be another
another great loss with you know loss to
the grand area planning and it's serious
when Nick the Nixon administration was
planning to destroy another virus the
parliamentary democracy in Chile and
install the energetic tater ship the
National Security Council main planning
body advised that if the United States
cannot control Latin America it won't be
able to achieve a successful order
elsewhere in the world that is to run
the west of the world so it's critical
to maintain control over Latin America
okay that's been lost well that was bad
enough but the Middle East this far more
significant and that's beginning to
happen I already quote
the government assessments of the
significance of the Middle East and the
planners recognized as I quoted that if
you can control the Middle East if we
continue to control the Middle East we
can control the world and corollary if
you lose control of the Middle East
control of the world declines well
policies are pretty much the same it
doesn't have much to do with access to
Middle East oil us had the same policies
when it was a major oil producer and
wasn't taking a drop of oil from the
Middle East the issues control it
maintains the there's a further danger
in us hegemony and that's the power the
possibility that the Middle East might
move towards some form of democracy
Middle East in northern Africa what's
called maina now of course there's lots
of rhetoric about our yearning for
democracy and on and on but they're very
elementary reasons why the United States
and its allies it can't tolerate
democracy in the Middle East will do
anything to prevent it to understand why
it's only necessary to look at the polls
of public opinion polls are taken by
leading American polling agencies
they're released by prestigious
institutions they barely get reported
but planners certainly know about them
so for example they know that in Egypt
the most important country about ninety
percent of the population a regard the
United States and Israel as the major
threats to their existence that maybe
ten percent think of Iran as a threat
they don't like your gran but don't
consider it a threat in fact about
eighty percent think the region would be
more secure if you ran would have
nuclear weapons they independently of
this they don't want you around
nuclear weapons but in the context of
balancing the major threats US and
Israel there eighty percent think that
would be a good idea and you get fairly
similar figures throughout the region
varies a little bit well you know the
last thing the United States and Britain
and France want is for public opinion to
have an influence on policy for obvious
reasons and that's supposed to be what
democracy means so they'll do everything
possible to stifle democracy and it's
kind of interesting that the after the
partial victories in Egypt the regime is
still pretty much intact but there have
been victories they shouldn't be under
understated the first actions that were
taken in Egypt are very threatening to
the US and Israel so right after the
overthrow the Mubarak the Egyptian
government I'm getting late yeah okay
the Egyptian government permitted
Iranian ships to transit the Suez Canal
first time in 30 years that included
military vessels maybe submarines
Mediterranean supposed to be an American
lake nobody's supposed to interfere
there especially Iran hated enemy
they're moving towards relations with
better relations with Iran Egypt also
sponsored a unification between Hamas
and Fatah whether it'll get anywhere is
another question but they did try to
implement a unification that's extremely
threatening to the US and Israel 434 20
years ever since the Oslo Accords the
Oslo Accords incidentally declared that
Gaza and the West Bank are single
territorial entity and as soon as the US
and Israel got the Accords through they
immediately proceeded to do the opposite
to try to break Gaza from the West
that's quite important because if any
kind of Palestinian entity ever arises
if it's separated from Gaza that not
only does it lose a lot of its
population but it loses its only access
to the outside world take a look at the
geography whatever is left of the West
Bank will be contained within Israel of
the Jordanian dictatorship if you look
at the actual plans of Israeli
settlement which are proceeding they
make that even narrower so separating it
from Gaza is quite important and steps
towards somehow overcoming that division
would be considered very harmful and are
strongly opposed by the US and Israel
the most serious problem and the one
they're really worried about is the 1979
Israel Egypt peace treaty now public
opinion in Egypt doesn't want to get rid
of the peace treaty but they don't like
the way the dictatorship interpreted it
it was interpreted right away and Israel
in the u.s. understood this as giving
license to Israel to do anything you
wanted so the Egyptian deterrent is gone
Israel's now free to attack its northern
neighbor Lebanon as we did almost
immediately and to escalate its
operations of the West Bank well
Egyptian public didn't like that still
doesn't like it and if they have any
influence they might threaten the
interpretation of the treaty the way
that's described in the West is the
threatening the cornerstone of stability
in the Middle East stability remember
has a technical meaning do what we say
and
in the literal meaning the treaty is the
cornerstone of instability in the Middle
East like invading Lebanon you know
taken over the West Bank but not from
the Western point of view well there's
time skip it a lot more since times late
I'm getting told to shut up but there's
a lot more to say but I just want to
make a comment about one further crucial
fact American decline is quite real and
a large measure it's self-inflicted now
that has to do with policies that have
been instituted since the 1970s I mean a
major change in World Order took place
in 1970 the international economic
system was radically redesigned in the
West that meant two major developments
shift towards financialization the
financial institutions have just
exploded since that time they don't do
anything for the economy except create a
lot of concentrated wealth but and of
course continual crashes and so on but
the economy became financialized and
manufacturing be started being off short
it continues but somewhere else that had
a very significant effects both of these
developments had to do with kind of an
underlying factor declining rate of
profit and manufacturing which made it
better to invest in games with money you
know playing games with speculating
against currencies and so on and
production offshore and in fact what the
West has been doing the United States
Britain and others is living out a kind
of a nightmare that was described by
Adam Smith and David Ricardo the
classical economist I mean they
understood very well that the
what what could happen of course they
were interested in England and they
described what could happen if in
England the one the people who Smith
called the Masters of mankind the
merchants and manufacturers if they
decided to do their business abroad like
invest abroad and import from abroad and
Smith concluded the the the business
would prosper but England would suffer
however he said this is not going to
happen and the reason is because British
manufacturers and merchants would have
what's called a home bias they prefer to
do their business in England so as if by
an invisible hand England would be saved
from the ravages of a globalized market
that's a hard fruit paragraph to miss
it's the one time when the phrase
invisible hand appears in wealth of
nations in a critique of neoliberal
globalization David Ricardo essentially
said the same thing so law of
comparative advantage is great but if
England merchants manufacturers decide
you know his model to invest in Portugal
and import from Portugal and so on it's
all going to collapse but he said he
hoped that at least sentimental reasons
would prevent them from doing this they
preferred for the home country to
prosper so they knew what they were
talking about they were not fools and
it's happening we're living in the
middle of that nightmare just what they
predicted and the effect is very narrow
concentration of wealth the United
States gone off the spectrum I mean a
tiny sector of the population is so
small that the Census Bureau can pick
them up about a tenth of one percent is
responsible for the most of them
massive inequality and of course
concentration of economic power
immediately turns into concentration of
political power meaning you get for the
legislation to escalate the same process
and a vicious cycle is underway that is
leading to you know it's not becoming a
third world but it's having very
significant effects on the nature of the
society britta Britain as well and go
into that any further but the the
business world understands it very well
and the should say the successes of the
policy are quite real apart from the
radical concentration of wealth by
shedding the remnants of political
democracy which is what is happening
there laying the basis for carrying the
lethal process forward and will as long
as the victims are willing to suffer in
silence not just in the United States
thank you very much known gnomes kindly
agreed to answer questions we've got
about 10 minutes for questions and can I
ask we have a couple of roving
microphones if you could put your hand
up and we have Rachel here with one and
Melanie over here with another please
we'll find you but we only have ten
minutes so the questions must be
questions not contributions so questions
please so if we could get one up to
hello John London from one voice am it's
just interesting the way that you
described Israel's role within the
Middle East and also am I suppose
they're taking orders from Washington
being them a traditional way of viewing
it'sit's policemen as well I just wonder
where you could talk a little bit about
whether there'll be a change in calculus
in the part of US foreign policy and
also israeli foreign policy if we do see
a democratic surge within the Arab world
and if Israel's behavior becomes more of
a burden to u.s. foreign policy than an
asset thank you this is working is this
working yeah that's actually beginning
to happen there's some interesting
indications of recalculation and high us
planning circles of the value of
Israel's role you probably saw the
statement of David Petraeus the head of
the central command who said you know it
was intransigence is stirring up dangers
and opposition's to the US forces in the
field you know we got these armies out
there protecting freedom and the way
Israel to acting is creating opposition
then he was told to shut up and he
instantly shut up but he's reflecting
opinions that are increasingly being
voiced in the military and intelligence
and sometimes even in political circles
if that extends which it could you could
have a wave of anti-semitism in the
United States which would be ferocious
it's not that far being below the
surface I'm old enough to remember but
you start purveying the conception that
you know these Israeli Jews or
threatening our brave boys and girls and
Afghanistan you can guess the reaction I
could very well happen and there could
be there was recently a sort of a more
polite version of this there's a group
called the Center for Strategic and
International Studies CSIS kind of a
conservative think tank that you know
works out international policy pretty
conservative the you know Andrew
quarters and he's one of their Middle
East specialists they just came out with
a study quiet study saying that the
United States ought to rethink its you
know reflexive commitment to Israeli
power and violence and maybe becoming
harmful to our interests well if that I
don't know if that'll grow or not
there's a lot of factors opposed to it
including ones that are rarely
considered and this is a lot to overcome
one factor is the strategic relationship
another one is a couple of properties of
the Anglosphere Britain and it's
offshoots these are by comparative
standards deeply religious societies
Christian Zionism long proceeds Jewish
Zionism it was very it's not just
evangelicals it's high circles like Lord
Balfour and lord Lloyd George
the Roosevelt administration and others
and it's pretty strong so for example
when during the Second World War when
the British general Allenby conquered
Jerusalem you read the headlines in the
leading the major press the elite press
richard the lionheart it has won the
crusades defeating Saladin is now saved
the the Holy Land for us he's gotten rid
of the pagans and the holy book says
that the next thing that's supposed to
happen as the Jews go back to Palestine
it's when you get the Balfour
Declaration the mandate reading this in
and so on of course you know the very
small Zionist movement tried to
capitalize on this and it continued high
officials in the Roosevelt
administration described the return of
Jews to Palestine as literally the most
important event in history and that
continues right up to the present
there's another fact about the
Anglosphere which is significant the
angliss Imperial the anglosphere has a
somewhat different history of
imperialism from most of the West some
exceptions but in the Anglosphere the
British colonists exterminated the
population pretty much exterminated them
didn't get rid of all of them everywhere
in the United States virtually total
kind of the most Australia same and it
Britain has a kind of a similar history
at its expansion this did happen in some
other places like the French in Algeria
but most of the imperial record is quite
different and that means in the
anglosphere there's a kind of an
intuitive support for the idea that this
outpost of European civilization should
get rid of the natives I mean we did it
so it's got to be right and they're
doing it and beside its following God's
will and that's a pretty significant
factor I think somewhat underestimated
cultural factor in addition to the
strategic
but it can change I mean there have been
a number of times in the past when the
Washington simply have compelled Israel
to abandon plans that it desperately
wanted to pursue and when the orders
come from Washington they got to follow
it that's true even of the Bush
administration the second Bush
administration first one also and that
could happen but what the consequences
would be interesting to ask actually
what what Britain and Europe do is also
quite important just take the last
couple of weeks there's you know the
West has this illusion probably
conscious illusion about a negotiating
process in Palestine there's this honest
broker the United States who's trying to
bring together the two recalcitrant
sides and dedicating enormous efforts to
this but can't quite make it it's a
total force for 35 years the United
States has unilaterally blocked a very
broad international consensus on a
political settlement first veto was 1976
and it continues if there was a serious
negotiating process it would have some
neutral party maybe Brazil running it
and on one side would be the US and
Israel and the other side view the
Palestinians well that's not the way
it's presented in elite Western culture
now the Palestinians did make an effort
in the last couple of weeks to try to
get around the idle negotiating process
I'm in the US and Israel perfectly happy
let negotiations go on forever well
Israel takes over everything it wants
and so on the Palestinians didn't make
an effort to get around it at the UN and
it's interesting to see what happened
almost the entire world supports the
Palestinian call for statehood the US of
course opposes it
and so the crucial question is what's
Europe going to do and you're totally
capitulated very courageous and I must
say totally capitulated in fact it kind
of rubbed it in by picking the pathetic
Kony Blair to deliver the message to the
Palestinian saying you skip it go back
and go back into your corner and that's
a pretty pathetic performance I must
stand very significant I mean if your
app refuses to act with you know even
minimal courage and integrity it's going
to be very hard for anything to happen
and they're not forced to you know
Europe can be an independent force in
world affairs choice and then Rachel if
you could hand the mic to Harry here not
convincing them eek analysis what is to
be done sorry what's to be done yeah
well I think it's pretty obvious we live
in fairly free countries there's not a
lot of repression by comparative
standards you have lots of opportunities
lots of things would be done everything
from like right now for example there
are very important developments the
Occupy movements which began in wall
street off wall street have grown very
fast spreading all over the country I
think there's one coming up in London
next week these are pretty important I
mean you know the the goals are not very
precisely formulated but things can
emerge but it's a sign that the public
are saying we're just not willing to
continue to be victims of this and if
you decide not to be victims you can do
almost anything you can change the
policies you can they can move on to
other well beyond the political regime
in fact is kind of intriguing to look at
the
formulated demands of the Occupy Wall
Street you know the main one they have
formulated their demands you can read
them on the internet and they're quite
interesting for example they begin by
describing themselves as acting in the
tradition of the uprisings in the 1930s
us were ended the uprising the 1930s has
led to the New Deal the civil rights
movement and the Arab Spring it would be
nice if that were true but it's not true
in crucial ways which can be overcome in
the 1930s it wasn't Occupy Wall Street
it was reconstitution of a labor
movement that had been smashed in the
1920s beginnings of industrial were
organizing and quite significant
militant activities workers were
beginning to sit down strikes sit-down
strikes are terrifying to the owners a
sit-down strike is just one step before
recognizing ok we'll kick you out we
don't need an owners and managers will
take it over and run it ourselves which
they can do and the business world was
petrified if you read the business press
at the time that kind of trembling and
fear well we're a long way from that it
did they did that didn't happen but it
did lead to New Deal legislation which
was pretty significant kind of Social
Democratic legislation the civil rights
movement also you know we think everyone
thinks of the march on Washington Martin
Luther King I have a dream etc there was
a long background a background of hard
difficult struggle and run through a lot
of young people were in the forefront it
was pretty bloody it was pretty
impressive and also the civil rights
movement up to that point had northern
support northern liberals are perfectly
happy with denunciation of racist
Alabama sheriff's so they say Pat Martin
Luther King on the head shortly after
that the civil rights movement and King
moved on moved
on to King expressed opposition to
Vietnam War but more significantly he
moved on to class issues he went on to
try to organize a poor people's movement
when he was assassinated he was on his
way to Washington to take steps towards
that and he was involved it was a period
in a sanitation workers strike that's
when he was assassinated you take a
listen you listen to the speeches on
Martin Luther King Day they pretty much
stopped with I have a dream when it went
on to class issues the northern liberals
and why they do with that you know and
that part of Kings career is kind of
white washed out that's worth remember
as far as the Arab Spring is concerned
there are some facts about it that
shouldn't be ignored they've been
brought out particularly by Joel beynon
he's an American scholar has done a lot
of work on the Arab labor movement for
years and he's pointed out something
which i think is quite correct that the
successes of the Arab Spring which are
real even if partial at correlate with
the existence of an active militant
labor movement with a long tradition of
struggle so in the two countries where
something notable has happened and is in
Egypt that's what they have in Egypt
particularly there's a militant labor
movements been operating rears crushed
by the dictatorship but with some
victories too in fact the current july
twenty fifth movement which in the west
is usually described as you know
sophisticated young people with twitter
and so on it's not false but it's worth
remembering that the movement has a name
it's the April sixth movement that
doesn't mean anything in the West what
it means something in Egypt april six
2008 is the date when the labor the
militant labor movement in egypt had
prepared declared major strike actions
at big industrial installations with
supporting demonstrations all over that
was crushed by the dictatorship us West
UK back to cater shoot we don't know
about it but they remember and that's
the April sixth movement in fact when
the labor unions began to enter into the
protests they became much more
substantial a lot of more to say but I
think this is one core element that
shouldn't be overlooked and that plainly
is lacking so for the Labour leadership
doesn't have anything to do with you
know Occupy movements and so on so there
are big gaps to fill and but you know
they can be filled just like these
things were done and give lots of
opportunities where by comparative
standards again very free of repression
means lots of opportunity lots of
actions that we taken place it's a
question of the choice as to whether it
be passive in the face of what's going
on or take over and do something about
it thank you know my think we've got
time for only one more question I'm
afraid but there will be plenty of time
to talk and discuss these issues at the
reception final question here are you
gave a absolutely fantastic but rather
daunting analysis of their kind of a
reasonably organized global capitalist
machine during a speech and I was just
wondering what you think the is the
chances of building a kind of a
globalized resistance where we're kind
of local struggles are joined up and
where people here perhaps could support
struggles in other parts of the world
where they have less freedom than we
have and where you thought that the
impetus for that sort of movement might
come from I think the prospects are
pretty good all of these losses that
I've described are cases where parts of
the world have freed themselves from
Western domination and it's significant
ones South America
sent the Middle East East Asia you know
these are big changes and in fact there
are there have been the last 10 years
global movements which have been
involved with this the world Social
Forum and it's offshoots many places
these provide you know they've been
pursued enough but they preside provided
instruments for cooperative work in fact
it's kind of interesting to look at
during one of the dramatic moments
during the egyptian uprising in the last
in this year was around late februari
when one of the main labor leaders in
Egypt Kemal Abbas sent a message to
Madison Wisconsin to where there were
popular demonstrations to try to protect
labor rights that are under attack and
his message was we the Egyptian workers
are expressing our solidarity for your
struggles it's a little sick that that's
the direction it has to go it's real and
there's many more possibilities for the
direction for it to go in the opposite
direction well thank you again very much
known for a fascinating and fabulous
talk I'd like now to warmly invite you
to a reception which will be upstairs
there are ashes who will usher you up
please enjoy the rest of the evening and
thank you again for your support please
do support our new journal we'd be
really pleased if you subscribe tonight
that fantastic discount that Pluto
journals are offering and thank you
again for coming thank you again known
for a fantastic evening
you
