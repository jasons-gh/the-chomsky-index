you know for nine years we broadcasted
here with no problems until April 6 when
one of the biggest live streams in the
world was shut down and then banned and
deleted on YouTube and now I've been
introduced to this concept of censorship
which I always thought happened to the
other guy I'm curious how do you see
freedom of speech in the digital era
digital speech has always been speech
and writing have always been tightly
controlled nobody ever paid any
attention to it because the targets were
overwhelmingly on the left and so their
foot was considered perfectly normal and
okay now the targets are ranging widely
right-wing interests of course is
becoming an issue but it should be
that's a D we should carefully protect
freedom of speech it's the fundamental
right that we should make sure to give
very high priority to no matter whose ox
is being gored and when you look at it
in the digital era I mean so much of our
lives are lived online now and digitally
and yet it's not something I can I can
voice now it has to go through a
platform like YouTube or Twitter or
Facebook that's now controlled by you
know sometimes a trillion dollar company
in Silicon Valley sometimes I'm monopoly
how does that change the whole dynamic
of of freedom of speech Facebook is has
enormous power to control speech but and
there's a question how they should be
treated my feeling is that they should
be regarded very much like any other
media organization so they shouldn't be
under any government control but they
should be subject to whatever conditions
the regular media or so for example II
might don't believe in libel suits but
if there are libel laws they ought to be
subjected to the same laws that the
times are the GAR
you know I don't think British libel
laws I think are outrageous but even
more mild ones one should be very
cautious about however to free them from
that seems to give them a kind of a
unfair position relative to the regular
media
