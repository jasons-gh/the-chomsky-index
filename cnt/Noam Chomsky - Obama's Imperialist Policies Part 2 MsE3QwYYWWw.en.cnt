natural rate of unemployment and they're
calculating it up some are getting it as
high as seven and a half percent that
means that should be normal unemployed
not too far from the official figures
now in manufacturing industry where
likelihood the jobs will come back is
very slight unemployment about the level
of the Great Depression so these
problems are there and how that's going
to be combined with global war a global
warfare commitment expanding massive
global warfare commitment that's not
obvious I would you mentioned a very
critical example of how the media
largely fails to report on things like
this and I would like to ask you that to
what extent you think the internet might
change that picture for the better but
more importantly as we just saw this
great theater piece to what extent using
art in general and theater in particular
is doing a better job in reflecting
critically on these things well we just
saw is a good example how effective it
is I mean a lot of people are putting
out a lot of energy and effort into it
hasn't been enough to turn things around
as I said I've been through 75 conscious
years and had there been games you know
things have been done but not enough to
end the fact that we're in a permanence
that there there's a permanent state of
war going on in the world sometimes it's
not us sometimes we're not directly
involved so for example right now the
probably the worst atrocities in the
world are in eastern Congo and nobody
talks about that we talked about
therefore which is bad enough because
there you can blame it on errors so okay
that's good coughing eastern Congo
unfortunately has to blame it on every
one US ally and on multinational
corporations which are hiring of the
militias that are destroying the place
in order so that people like us can have
cold pain in our cell phones and other
such things so we don't talk about those
though maybe five main people have been
killed there in the last couple of years
and there are things like that happening
all over and all too often were directly
involved so has it been enough well
obviously not has it been something yes
it certainly has for example the Iraq
war Horrible's was was nothing like the
Vietnam War night clothes and large part
of the reason was there's just too much
internal resistance here in the case of
the Vietnam War there was almost no
internal resistance if you think about
it there was finally a strong anti-war
movement which had an effect but those
of you old enough to remember will
where that was nineteen sixty-seven 1968
that's after about five years of war the
first several years of worry no protest
in fact when there were protests they
they were broken up violently with the
applause the liberal press that didn't
happen in Iraq and it had some kind of
an effect and keep it keeping it down
now this is it's commonly point claimed
that you know a lot of wonderment about
why there's so much less protest against
Iraq as compared with Vietnam just think
back at the time when the Vietnam War
was anything like the Iraq war there was
no purpose at all to speak up much
higher broke that's in the case of array
and it it's you know has a kind of an
effect obviously not enough of an effect
but something so you know has more has
to be done clearly the wake of the Free
Gaza flotilla and the attack on it the
certainly the Israeli government and the
neo-cons here have made the interesting
twist of demonizing Turkey who i thought
the US was relying upon as an ally to
help them extricate themselves from Iraq
so have you any thoughts as to where
that's taking us well first of all just
one slight correction it's not the
neo-cons here the other day I i
occasionally torture myself by listening
to NPR I was driving home that's not the
day ogontz that's the other end I was
driving home
it's a must and friday and was listening
to the news and they're all things
considered they have two commentators
for those of you who listened david
brooks on the right and ej on what's
called the left and that's the spectrum
and so that was it came off with
question one of the questions I think
was friday was it what do you think
about the flotilla and the two of them
out did each other in tried outdo each
other in vociferous support for the
Israeli action I was completely moral
and just justified maybe not carry out
very well but certainly correct if you
look through our beds it's the same New
York Times has had a bunch of our beds
about it either they come from
spokespeople for the Israeli government
government officials even or or also
they're supportive of them the United
States is kind of off the Global
Spectrum on this I don't you know I
don't read the whole world press but
from what I've seen in the world press
it's very angry about this even the the
kind of mainstream business press like
the London Financial Times but not here
it's not the neo-cons unfortunately it's
across the board it's a it's you're
quite right about the going after turkey
I mean the thing has been reconstructed
as if it occurred with Israeli
government propaganda that the real
issue is
Turkish terrorists were attacking Israel
that's kind of like what I quoted from
the Israeli press about how he ran is
carrying out aggression against Israel
and southern Lebanon yeah or for that
matter Vietnam take Vietnam what's an
interesting case in the early 60s when
it was the Liberal Democrats you know
Kennedy administration the line was that
the United States is facing internal
aggression in South Vietnam that was
Adlai Stevenson the liberal hero
speaking at the UN says we're facing
internal aggression in South Vietnam
Kennedy called it an assault from within
that's what we're facing in South
Vietnam and that's a very and it's a
very typical component of Imperial
ideology we own the world so wherever we
get attacked and for Israel the same
thing and they're smaller domains
somebody's carrying out aggression
against us even if we're invading their
country and that's happening right at
this moment not just in the case of
Turkey in a much bigger case you all
know that the main of the main policy
foreign policy problem that the Obama
administration is facing according to
thee you know analysts and commentators
is Iran the threat of Iran well exactly
what is the threat of Iran we have an
authoritative answer to that there was
just a study that came out called the
global military balance 2010
comes out every year by the Institute of
Strategic Studies and it's called an
institute that's basically part of the
US government they come out with a an
analysis of the global military
situation so of course they have a
section on Iran and they discuss the
threat of Iran what's the threat of the
rent well it turns out it's not a
military threat they point out that Iran
has its military expenditures are among
the lowest in the region and you know
minuscule fraction of us expenditures
furthermore Iranian military doctrine
they point out is designed to deter
invasions so to try to hold back
aggression long enough so that it can
move to diplomacy that's their military
doctrine they say if they're developing
nuclear weapons it would be as a
deterrent against know very attack so so
what's the thread exactly this huge
threat that we have to face well it
turns out it's a political threat the
usual kind the threat is that Iran is
what's called destabilizing its
neighbors how is it destabilizing them
by trying to increase its influence it's
trying to increase its influence in the
countries that are its neighbors and
that's aggression because we own those
countries when we invade them that's not
destabilization that's imposing bringing
about stability just read the report
we're working to bring about stability
in the countries surrounding your
and their destabilizing them by trying
to extend their political influence so
there are real threat they're also the
other thread of supporting terror what
is terror the terror is Hezbollah and
Hamas well you know whatever you think
about Hezbollah and Hamas it's pretty
hard to call what they're doing terror
as long as a Lebanese organization it's
now being charged with developing
obtaining weaponry to enable it to deter
an Israeli invasion us-backed Israeli
invasion the kind Obama loves as he told
us news website that's terror Hamas is
trying to protect Hamas took power in
Gaza in an election they were freely
elected it's the only free election in
the Arab world and they happen to win it
and as soon as they won the election the
US and Israel immediately within days
stepped up and attacked on the
Palestinian population to punish them
for voting the wrong way in a free
election and that was the first act of
terror the next major act of terror was
you know that was January 2006 was in
june two thousand seven when they took
power in in the gaza eliminating thought
you know I'll see an authority for it
that's the way it subscribe but if you
look closely that's not exactly what
happened what happened is that the US
and Israel with the help of the
Palestinian Authority try to carry out a
military coup to overthrow the elect
government and they beat back the
military coup and that's when they took
power that's when the siege really
stepped up that's a us-israeli siege of
course well you know they're not i mean
i don't like them frankly they do a lot
of brutal ugly things but it's pretty
hard to call that iranian terror but
that's if the threat of iran a
supporting terror and destabilization
well you know if you own the world
that's natural so in South Vietnam we
faced internal aggression that's all
from within and in the case you
mentioned when Israel with us support
and us equipment attacks about in
international waters killing people of
Major Crime it's the fault of the people
on the boat now they're the ones
carrying out the terrors turkey in this
case and it's a tricky case as you
mentioned because turkey is a major ally
and how they're going to finesse this is
not very clear you know it's from
Israel's point of view apart from the
criminality its sheer insanity in Turkey
is there only regional ally and a close
ally it's been this second closest ally
after the united states that sits about
since 1950s and they you know the they
use eastern turkey for military
exercises military bases there they're a
major military supplier turkey in the
flame of the relations in the other
direction two and two adam ak one ally
by an act like criminal act like this is
profound irrationality
one of many extremely irrational acts
that they're carry out last couple years
which is pretty ominous because it's a
it's a powerful state than when it's
overcome by paranoia and irrationality
and hysteria there could be real dangers
I wanted to ask about a totally
different area which is on art the
environment through verb because of the
not only the oil that is leaking from
the British Petroleum explosion but the
methane that is being released and
methane is the worst heat-trapping gas
that there is do you think that people
are going to start to wake up to how
fragile our planet is and then we can't
sustain wars that in in Pakistan last
week they had the highest temperatures
they've ever had 128 degrees you know so
it do you think this is going to
there'll be something good coming out of
it last year as you probably read was
the warmest year on record the what's
going on in the Gulf is horrible enough
but it's worth noting a real racist
element to our concern about that I mean
it's a fraction of what's happened in
the Niger Delta Delta for example where
the huge oil spills going on all the
time at causing enormous damage killing
all sorts of people but you know that's
like Africa's cares and it's not as
serious as the oil spills in the amazon
by texaco now Chevron so it's bad enough
but that's what we do all over the place
and nobody pays any attention this
sounds us it becomes a big issue yeah
it's
today Obama announced that more oil
drilling it's going to renew voyel room
so the methane is no joke you're quite
right as as the permafrost melts in
Siberia and other places its owner it's
the predictions are it's going to
release huge amount of truth trapped
methane which you're correct is much
more dangerous than carbon dioxide so a
lot of other I mean these are what are
called what are called nonlinear events
you know that you can have a sudden
spurt after things go continue slowly
absurd direction will anything be done
about it it's I mean we're facing the
question of species survival in this
case it's not like nuclear weapons but
unfortunately there are institutional
factors that make it very hard to do
anything it's not that there are sort of
bad people and control the people who
are making the decisions are trapped by
institutional structures so for example
there's tape I mean the major power
center in the country unquestionably is
the corporate sector but if you're the
CEO corporation you don't have a lot of
choices you have to act so as to
increase short-term profit or else
you're out if you don't do that first of
all sorry it's it's it's required by
angle of America so if you don't do it
it's illegal but even apart from that if
you don't do it you're kicked out and
somebody comes in
does do it that's the nature of the
system the semi competitive system now
major corporations and business
associations like Chamber of Commerce
and so on American Petroleum Institute
they've been carrying out large-scale
campaigns in the last couple of years to
try to convince the public that global
warming is a liberal hoax okay and it's
succeeding by now the proportion of the
public who thinks that believes in
anthropogenic global warming human
contributions global warming is barely
over a third to decline sharply so the
propaganda campaigns have been
succeeding well you know these CEOs who
are carrying out this campaigns
understand as well as you do that this
is no liberal hoax that it's going to
destroy what they own and destroy the
lives for the grandchildren they know
that as human beings but in their
institutional role as CEOs they have to
dismiss this as what's called an
externality and economic theory
something you put aside because it
doesn't have to do with making the best
market transactions well in this case
the externality happens to be the fate
of the species but it's still an
institutional requirement but they
overcome that is no small task that
means really reconstructing
institutional structures in a
large-scale way and the limited market
is very limited market that we have kind
of compels those highly destructive
decisions I was the same in financial
markets so
the this what's called systemic risk you
know if Goldman Sachs they make some
transaction if they're fine playing the
rule the game by the rules and a half
door else you know their guys are out
they ignore that they carry out an
transaction in such a way that it
benefits them and if it's a risk they
don't insure themselves against that
wrist but they don't consider the effect
on the rest of the financial system
what's called systemic risk that's an
externality they ignore it and it's
built into the system that they must
ignore even though it's understood that
this is brings about repeated financial
crises worse and worse of course that
can be overcome by a government
regulation from the depression until the
1970s when deregulation started
financialization of the economy began
during that whole period there were no
financial crisis because the regulatory
structure of the New Deal was sufficient
to constrain plus the whole way the
financial system was organized but since
the 70s they've been repeated crises
getting worse and worse we're likely
we're probably building up for the next
one right now and
again this externality is not accounted
for well in the case of systemic risk is
at least an answer the government can
regulate sufficiently to overcome this
serious mid-market defect in the case of
the environment nobody's going to do it
unless God steps in there's no one to
control the externalities the fate of
the species but that's what we're faced
with so it takes real work to try to do
something about this and how much time
there is we don't know I mean what we do
know is the longer we it's delayed the
worst is going to be how bad it we just
guess Barack Obama promised to close
Guantanamo within a year of becoming
president he hasn't done so and it
doesn't seem to be any indication that
he will so I was wondering if you could
address one whether we understand his
political and legal reasons for not
doing so and whether you yourself see a
type of solution because it seems like
the claim is that there is no solution
there's a solution closer but actually
the whole Guantanamo case is kind of
interesting at one time we what right do
we have to be in one time altogether I
mean Guantanamo was stolen from Cuba at
gunpoint in 1902 the u.s. invaded Cuba
to prevent it from liberating itself
from Spain in the history books here it
says we deliberate them but that's not
what happened scholarship has wiped that
out we invaded to prevent them from
liberating themselves from Spain among
other things we had done
pass the amendment which required them
to hand us Guantanamo the main port and
the eastern part of the island and one
thought this treaty with Cuba that there
they want to get out of who we won't 11
which it does have conditions on the use
of Guantanamo supposed to be a coaling
station there's nothing on that treaties
that says you can use it to store
Haitian refugees that you don't want
that's what's being done for a long time
there's nothing in it that says you can
use it as a torture chamber so first of
all it's stolen at gunpoint by
completely illegitimate fear of a treaty
and it's being used in violation of that
treaty furthermore the fact that it's a
torture chamber was obvious it at the
beginning I can't understand why anyone
was surprised when the torture memos
came out I mean why have interrogation
carried out in Guantanamo instead of in
a prison in New York there's only one
reason you can claim that American law
doesn't apply that no other reason for
it so of course it was going to be a
torture chamber and it is now it's not
the only one the Bagram Air Base in
Afghanistan is probably worse and if you
look at the legal breaker the Supreme
Court did pass decision that to make a
decision that contrary overturned the
Bush administration ever claimed that
and ruled that prisoners is one time
have babies corpus rights well that the
Bush administration tried to restraint
that to say well it just applies to
Montano mo not to other interrogation
centers like Bagram but the district
courts in fact a bush appointee and the
district court ruled that it applies
everywhere okay the Obama Justice
Department is now trying to overturn
that they're trying to outflank bush
from the right on torture and try to get
the courts to decide that it doesn't
apply to say Bagram which means as Glenn
Greenwald pointed out a blog that what
that means is that if the United States
capture somebody say in Yemen and
decides it wants to torture them they
can't send the Guantanamo to be tortured
but things end of Agra big different you
know well that's a vomit you know on the
legal issues it's it's not not much of a
record of the few things that are
improvements over bush but not on the
main ones and this is an example but
there's snow there is no problem that
Guantanamo it can just be closed why
should the United States be running
toward your chambers one where did the
detainees go if we close Guantanamo even
bring them to court and try them and if
they're guilty in a fair trial sentence
somewhere else you free them I'm s what
what
if the country's don't take them back we
should provide refuge for but that's
what criminal trials are I'm suppose
you're arrested for something you're not
supposed to be tortured they're supposed
to be brought to trial and if there's a
charge against UK government tries to
present it and if you're free you're
free well that's the problem they don't
have credible charges against them if
they did they could bring them to trial
that's why Obama is in favor of military
commissions which don't have anything
like the guarantees of fair trial I mean
there's a claim welder wore their
prisoners of war or something like that
but you know that kind of acclaimed
anybody could make about anything are we
out of time Sarah this is yes so there
are three commercials before we end noms
book is outside for sale and it's called
it has an optimistic title actually what
is the title tell me the title of your
book hopes and prospects that sounds
good so I think everyone should buy a
copy um we have two more weeks of
prophecy and please tell your friends
were not yet sold out we would like to
be very much and thanks to peace action
for creating with us this evening and
this benefit and they would like to say
and I would like to say of course that
we should all take peace action in our
lives and do whatever we can to change
things so thank you very much thank you
you
