okay let's get started they microphones
maybe start over there okay well what
what this suggests is that maybe for the
people of Latin America their only hope
is in a strategy of say sendero luminoso
which also suggests that maybe we be
getting a distorted picture of than
Darryl well I don't think that everybody
know what's narrow Luminoso is this is a
it's a kind of a Maoist guerilla
movement in Peru which is pretty
murderous I think we have a fair I mean
yeah you're right you always want to
question what you read and hear but in
this case I think it's really pretty
ugly on the other hand sendero luminoso
has a lot of support there's just no
doubt that it's got a lot of popular
support and that support appears to be
growing in fact it's right into the main
cities now personally I don't think
that's the right way I think the right
way is the way that was tried in Central
America and if it failed it's our fault
I mean we can sit around and tell people
how you have to be nonviolent from all
that nice stuff but we don't do anything
about it they can't be nonviolent they
gotta be brutal murders the Central
American Way was very hopeful it was
just the right way and we let it get
destroyed but it's still the right way
and that's our fault and we just have to
stop letting it get destroyed um I
wanted to raise a question about the
basic assessment that the United States
one in Vietnam are in Indochina and is
on the winning side in Nicaragua that is
while you say the goal of the United
States is to prevent the model of
successful economic development
controlled by the people as well as to
inoculate the country there's another
goal of US policy which is to destroy
the example of a country saying we're
going to run ourselves and they failed
on that score in Vietnam and they failed
in Nicaragua and in failing it seems to
me that example became the more powerful
because of the efforts that the United
States wage because of the 500,000
groups that had in Vietnam when it lost
the Vietnam War it then gave rise to the
overthrow of the portugal portuguese in
their colonies in Africa ultimately to
Nicaragua which took advantage of the
u.s. defeat took advantage of anti-war
sentiment in the United States and took
power and I think that while as you
explain Nicaragua is still fighting the
United States has failed to re-establish
its rule over Nicaragua the people are
still in the saddle in Nicaragua albeit
beaten down in poverty and my feeling is
that the rise of struggles in El
Salvador today the failure for example
of the United States to move in on
Panama the fact that there would be two
thousand people here today all of that
is testimony to victories for our side
in the midst of the tremendous crushing
burden of the United States so I'd like
to hear your comment on well I think
that's there's a lot of truth to that
but there's only one part of what you
said where I don't agree and it's a
matter of judgment so you got to figure
out what you think but the one part of
what you said that I don't agree with
doesn't one of the way it looks to me is
that the success of the Vietnamese and
holding on inspired others to do the
same I don't think that was the lesson I
think if you look there was no
connection between Vietnam and what
happened to the portuguese empire that
was unraveling independently for other
reasons and in fact i think the lesson
people drew from Vietnam is that if you
try to stand up against the global
enforcer you get murder now as far as I
still people do it because they're
willing to struggle despite Kalessin
that they learn not the way I would look
a part from that I I think the United
States did suffer one major defeat at
home that's absolutely right I'm glad
you mentioned it the United States is a
very different country from what it was
25 years ago or even the peak of the
peace movement at very different country
i mean i know just for my own experience
talks like the one I gave tonight I
couldn't give anywhere
at the peak of the peace movement even
for peace movement activists circles
because it would sound insane now I give
folks like this anywhere in the country
you know / no quite honestly I gave a
talk like this in the State Department
last year literally at the open forum
and the State Department and the point
is the country has just changed you know
it's possible I mean it's just a
completely different the country is out
of control and that's very important and
that is a defeat for power we ought to
make it a bigger defeat but that's a
change and that's important now as far
as US planners are concerned they do
want to keep the domestic population
under control and you know that they're
not doing too well at thank goodness we
go to make sure they do less well at it
as far as Vietnam is concerned I don't
think you can answer simply the question
whether it was a victory of defeat they
had larger goals and they had minimal
goals they achieved the minimal goals
they didn't achieve the larger goals for
larger goals were to reincorporate
Indochina within the u.s. nominated
global system and that they did not
achieve but the basic goal the crucial
one the one that really counted was to
destroy the virus and I think that when
they did achieve it's not a model that
anybody in Southeast Asia is trying to
follow in fact it's a basket case and
that's a big victory for the United
States and as I say we're trying very
hard to keep it that way even to the
extent of supporting call pot now in the
case of nicker of Central America are I
think it's still going on so you can't
judge and I think the outcome depends a
lot on what happens among the population
in the united states if the population
of the united states let's American
policy go on I think you can predict
quite readily what's going to happen
it's going to win it's going to succeed
in destroying the possibility of
recovery I think I think it's going to
succeed in destroying the possibility of
any kind of recovery and the United
States will do that if that's necessary
in order to prevent successful
independent development remember that
the United States has long-term
goals for Central America I didn't get
into this but this is part of much
broader planning for years the world has
been drifting into three major
competitive blocks there's a kind of a
yen based block which is around as Japan
and as its center and the former
Japanese colonies in the periphery and
as Japan to the surprise of everybody
recovered because of the Korean War and
in the Vietnam world they made a huge
profit on the system began to
reconstitute itself there's a
european-based block which is taking a
big step forward in 1992 with the
european common market and remember
europe is a serious competitor europe if
it ever gets its act together is richer
than the United States as a bigger
population in the United States more
educated population they become an
integrated power of the United States a
second class power so that's another
development and the third one is the
dollar based block that has recently
been extended that was the major purpose
of the free trade agreement with Canada
to incorporate canada as their major
trading partner basically in the u.s.
system as a colony and i think that's
probably achieved than the last
remaining election will now play itself
out the same is true of mexico at least
those parts of mexico there you know
where there's us-based industry around
the north and so on and the caribbean
baseman ish ative was intended as
something like that the caribbean basin
initiative and you know that includes el
salvador you know it's not on caribbean
that caribbean basin initiative meaning
central america and caribbean was
intended to create something for the
united states like what japan has been
developing in its periphery korea taiwan
indonesia and so on whether they do that
i don't know but this plane that
independence in those regions is
inconsistent to that and i think the
world will probably drifted that's been
drifting in that direction for years you
can see the tendencies continuing what
that would lead to nobody knows maybe
that's the kind of thing which in the
past has led to global war
maybe there's enough interconnexion
among the great powers now to keep that
from happening but that means there's
going to be a real drive to block a
successful development in Central
America and the Caribbean even to the
extent if it's necessary of just
virtually decimating the places now it
doesn't have to happen people there are
struggling I don't know how they
continue to do it frankly I never
understood how people can continue to
struggle against this kind of brutality
but they do somehow and the question is
whether we provide them enough margin
for survival I hope that depends on what
happens here so to get back to your
point which I gets right to the point
the biggest defeat that us power
suffered parked in fact that it didn't
achieve its major Ames in these places
is at home and that's the one that's
under our control fortunately so you can
do something about it if the Peace Corps
used as a political tool is the Peace
Corps used as a political tool to F to
promote economic interests abroad well
the Peace Corps was intended to be the
sort of benign face of the death squad
I'm not saying the pieces for is a bad
thing quite honestly I think the piece
got any more because they've changed it
but the Peace Corps for a long time was
very healthy thing frankly I doubt that
the Peace Corps did much good to the
countries where the people worked but I
think it did a lot of good in the United
States people who went to third world
countries learn something about the
world and they brought what they learned
home and that made a difference a lot of
those people became activists that they
learn something about what the world is
really like and how much maybe some of
them help maybe they didn't it's hard to
help you know just isn't that easy but
whatever they did they helped the United
States and that's good they helped make
it a more civilized place do you think
the arrest of John Hall and Costa Rica
will have any ramifications on the North
trial or is it just the culling of a bad
apple to keep the barrel alive it's an
interesting question the do you know the
question was about the rest of John
Hollen in Costa Rica I don't was that
reported here yeah it's interesting cuz
New York Times didn't report it
yeah very interesting near-constant
reported John Howe who's this you know
American Rancher up in u.s. Rancher up
in northern Costa Rica and his big CIA
asset he was right in the center the
Contras thing he was actually he was
detained I think for questioning I don't
think he was actually arrested by the
Costa Rican government for questioning
with regard to his activities in the
North network the question was whether
that's going to affect the North trial
my own guess is not I don't need anybody
with any power once I think they want
the North thing to go away you know I
mean it was sort of embarrassing to
become me see I mean that whole North
story wouldn't was perfectly well known
before the iran-contra hearings I mean
I'll say that in retrospect I take a
look at my book turning the tide and I
wrote about it in there that was 1985
and I don't have any access anything's
at public sources everybody knew about
the North network you might not have
known all the details and so on but the
main story was perfectly well known it
was known to the media was known to
Congress they just chose to look the
other way there were congressional
hearings in march or april nineteen
eighty six that's well before the story
broke in which most of the thing came
out it was all over the wires a AP wires
and our congressmen were saying my god
you know i never knew was this bad and
so on and so forth nothing appeared you
could keep up the lid on it the same was
true about the shipment of arms to Iran
incidentally that did not begin when
they ran counter hearing said it didn't
begin in 1985 it began almost
immediately after the fall of the Shah
they began in nineteen eighty it was
done in exactly the way it was always
known it was done through Israel which
was the main contact by 1982 long before
the iran-contra hearings Israel was
providing probably about half of the
arms for Iran and that was public
knowledge he could read at the front
page of the New York Times furthermore
the
the Israeli top Israeli government
official said exactly what it was about
the prime minute the front the
Ambassador Moshe Arens was in the United
States gave interviews in the United
States in October 1982 in which he said
Israel is sending arms to Iran Khomeini
regime with the cooperation of the
United States I'm quoting him at almost
the highest level that's diplomatic talk
for everybody except Ronald Reagan who
everyone knows doesn't know what policy
is but a table submit means every oral
policy at the highest level it was
sending arms to Iran for the purpose of
trying to organize a military coup the
main Israeli figures who were involved
later in the iran-contra hearings David
Kim Ki and Yaakov named Brody the whole
bunch of them they all appeared on BBC
television in February 1982 and they
described in some detail how they were
involved in organizing an arms flow to
the Khomeini regime in order to try to
set up contacts with military officers
who could then overthrow the regime and
restore the convenient arrangement that
existed under the shop and in that same
dvc program Richard Helms who was former
head CIA and also US ambassador to Iran
and Robert comer to the Pentagon said
they didn't know for heat ensure that
that was going on but obviously it ought
to be going on now that is very closely
related to what I was talking about one
aspect of this wrong understanding that
you have to establish relations with the
military in other countries is that if a
country gets at a hand you try to
establish relations with its military
that's one of the ways to overthrow it
that's the way I end they was overthrown
in fact that's the way the Suharto coup
took place the whole time that would
right before the Suharto coo the coo in
indonesia that i mentioned throughout
the whole time we were very hostile to
indonesia and we were sending arms to
them the whole time there's no
contradiction there same with ind
obviously very hostile died ND we were
sending arms to them the whole time you
do it all the time that you send arms to
cassettes the way you establish
relations
the right kernels and so on who will
overthrow the government for you you
give him goodies and arms and stuff and
undoubtedly that's what we were doing
with Iran way back in the early 80s in
nineteen eighty four or so the Israeli
contacts were caught and executed we
know that from Israeli sources after
that the north kc network just picked
the story up you know just picked it up
all over again and tried to reestablish
the same context I don't think there's
any doubt that that's the real story and
as I say it was all known I mean I I was
wrote about it in a book that appeared
1983 you know it's all known nothing
secret so what happened in the
iran-contra hearings well what happened
is that a moment came when it was just
impossible to keep it undercover when
the hospital was plane was shot down
American mercenaries shot down in
Nicaragua you couldn't pretend it didn't
happen you know his pictures this guy
being carted around and then Lebanese
newspaper and the Iranian government
recorded that the National Security
Advisor was walking around terror on
handing out Bibles and chocolate cakes
oh well can't keep it quiet anymore you
can't pretend you don't know so at that
point you moved to the next phase damage
control try to keep it under control you
know and that's what the iran-contra
hearings were about but now that damage
controls been completed you don't want
anything more to come out so I think
it's pretty safe to suppose that the
North trial and all the other trials
will drift away why Costa Rica
apprehended oh I don't know I mean I
think Costa Rica plays a very complex
role when all these things costa rica
depends for its survival and a huge us
subsidy I mean it's one of the most
heavily subsidized countries in the
world and they know perfectly well that
they're paid off only as long as they
more or less stay in line they have
little twitter's of independence now and
then but not much
re s in particular has been very
subordinate to US policy and why they
did that I don't know malayan clearly is
refreshing I really appreciate it I
wanted to ask you what is a person to do
you you have you implied I think you use
the word disruptive internally what can
we do I gather writing letters isn't
enough voting isn't enough we need to
get out March like we did in the Vietnam
days is that what you're saying well I
you know nothing is enough but I think
voting is sometimes meaning what
meaningful you know depends on the
situation writing letters is often
meaningful surprising what a few letters
to a congressperson might do sometimes
demonstrations are can be very
meaningful but the main thing is it's
got to be sustained you know it's got to
be sustained and organized the point is
that anybody in any country you know
take the country like you'll find some
group that has real power and they got
to make sure they're else is quiet and
that's the way power works if people are
not quiet if they're not apathetic it's
a cost that has to be paid because you
don't want power challenged now power
you know it's not a big secret where
power is in the United States power
basically lies in the hands of people
who are in a position to determine
investment decisions what's produced was
distributed and so on it lies in a
pretty narrow corporate elite they staff
the government by and large they run the
ideological institutions they keep
everything going and one of the things
they want is a passive quiescent
population so one of the things that you
can do to make life uncomfortable for
them is not be a passive quiescent
population and there are lots of ways of
doing that even asking questions is
considered an unacceptable cost take the
hysteria and about the universities in
the 1960s the whole while on bloom
business what are these guys are upset
I mean that you know the act as if the
world was coming to an end what was
happening is that students were asking
questions you know that's the main thing
that was happening they were just
refusing to obey you know to follow and
copy down every stupid thing they were
told they wanted to think about things
and ask questions and so on and that was
considered an intolerable threat to
order I mean that's now described you
read Owen blooms bestseller it's
described as if it was like the Nazis
taking over you know and that's exactly
the way people in the Faculty Club
perceived it it's not that they're
exaggerating they perceived it that way
I watched it at the time you know
students are supposed to be obedient
they're not supposed to think you know
they're not supposed to they're supposed
to do what they're told they know and be
obedient and be nice kids and pick up
and run the place the next generation if
they don't do that that's a problem
knowing you got to do something about it
and these caught and the same as this
goes all the way to direct resistance
you know Vietnam War the resistance for
the war was quite significant that was a
cost and there's no answer nothing is
even you ask what's enough the answer is
nothing is enough I mean nothing will
ever be enough until the institutional
structures have changed as long as that
doesn't happen it's going to continue
what we're just seeing is going to
continue to go on and I think they ought
to be changed I mean I quite frankly
think we have to realize the ideals of
the American Revolution which have not
been realized in my opinion but that's
another story short of changing the
institutions there's a lot of ways of
acting including the ones you mentioned
and others but it only makes a
difference if you keep it up you go to
one demonstration there you go home
that's something but they can live with
that what they can't live with is
sustained organizations that just keep
doing things and keep building and where
people learn more and you know learn
lessons from the last time and do it
better next time and reach others and so
on that's no good and it's not just
letters to Congress it's also pressure
on the newspapers and everything else
any system of power even as a fascist
dictatorship is going to be responsive
to public visit
and it's certainly true in a country
like this where the state doesn't have a
lot of force to coerce people
fortunately yes many younger Americans
were initiated into the reality of the
shadowy aspects of American history and
politics during the recent revelations
regarding top officials and covert
activity and gun and drug running you
recently just spoke of the iran-contra
hearings the seamy aspect of American
history and politics is new to many
young people and is rarely discussed in
right-wing corporate media and
educational institutions this
information while scholarly is also
marginalized by many progressives with
the label conspiracy theory the Christic
Institute has initiated a lawsuit
against the 29 defendants members of a
secret team with linkages not only to
the iran-contra event but a string of
other events including Watergate various
domestic and foreign assassinations and
international political and economic
destabilization how do you evaluate and
judge this type of activity and will it
be helpful in our drive to impeach the
former head of the secret police now the
President of the United States and vice
president Quayle
well first of all these you I think
which said it which said is correct I
mean these things are sort of consigned
the dusty archives but most of this
stuff has been known for a long time I
mean take the involvement of the US
government in the drug racket that was
most of that was exposed by in a book
written by Southeast Asia scholar
several Southeast Asia scholars Alfred
McCoy and several associates the book
came out forget certainly the early 70s
was called the politics of heroin in
Southeast Asia sort of a scholarly study
it began in 1947 with the reconstitution
of the heroin racket in France that's
actually connected to what I described a
little bit in the talk I mentioned that
the first major task of the united
states throughout the world was to
destroy the anti-fascist resistance and
to restore the old elites often fascist
collaborators in power in france there
was a particular problem you had to
break up for labor unions Libyans were
very powerful in France they had to be
broken up for one thing because unions
lead to too much democracy and popular
involvement in politics not bad stuff
and for another thing because the unions
were impeding the flow of arms to
Southeast Asia to try to you know
reconquer Vietnam so that had to be
broken up well one of the first CIA
operations was an effort in jointly with
top American later Labor leadership
incidentally which is quite proud of it
was to break the split the French labor
unions and to do that they needed booms
you know you want to break up strikes
and that sort of thing you need guys
will break kneecaps you know break
people's heads and that sort of business
and they had to hire thugs especially
around this waterfront marseille in
places like that well who do you go to
the Mafia now the Mafia had been put out
of business by the fascists fascists
tend to run a pretty tight ship they
don't like competing authority like
other gangsters around so the Mafia had
been pretty well dispelled by the by the
fascist government the Sicilian Mafia
was reconstituted
as the US Army moved up through Italy
1943 in 1944 as an alternative base of
power in the in 1947-48 when the CIA was
moving to break the labor unions they
basically made a deal with the Corsican
mafia which they reconstituted Corsican
mafia was hired as goons and strike
breakers and that sort of thing but and
they worked you know a lot of violence
on the waterfront and so on but of
course they don't do it for the fun of
it I mean they want to be paid off and
the way they were paid off was by
allowing them to reconstitute the heroin
racket that's the source of the famous
French Connection marseille was one of
the centers of the world heroin racket
until i think around nineteen seventy
when it round then it sort of shifted
over to Southeast Asia at that point
where it was run largely out of Laos in
connection with the CIA CIA was running
a huge secret war so-called it was
secret like the arm slow to you ran the
secret everybody knew about it but
everybody was disciplined enough not to
talk about it that's exactly what
happened but the way they ran their
so-called secret war was by organizing
classic Imperial style they organized
Highland tribesmen into an army to
attack the lowland Lao and again you got
to pay him off well you pay them off by
letting them run the glor opium but then
you got to fly the opie mouth to markets
and they don't have planes so the CIA
provided the planes and flew him to
Saigon that's where the American army
got hooked on drugs and then it goes out
to the west now a lot of the flow of
drugs is coming from Afghanistan in fact
the source of director pretty much the
same reasons the sort the trace around
the history of the drug rackets usually
located someplace where there's a
insurgency and counterinsurgency
operation going on that's the way you
get a lot of money I'm the CIA operates
with undetectable money its main thing
and how do you get undetectable money
well usually through some racket it's
easiest way to do it so most of this
stuff was pretty well known and well
documented long before the iran-contra
hearings but you're right nobody knows
that
of course that's not the kind of thing
you teach in high school and so on but
it's there now as far as the Christic
Institute material is concerned you've
got to look at everything with a
critical eye everything and one of the
things got look at the critical Isaac
ristic Institute material I think a lot
of it's interesting my own feeling is a
lot of it is plausible but not
demonstrated you know not implausible
but also not demonstrated now how much
of it will turn out to be true i don't
know i mean certainly interesting a lot
of the parts of it look rather quite
well done for example is a book by
leslie Coburn who was a analyst for one
of the television stations i forget
which one one of the channels called out
of control came out a couple years ago
which is quite a good analysis a lot of
this material and that stuff is very
solid I think she's good researcher and
there's other things too i mean i'm sort
of related to the pristiq material but
i'd watch all of this stuff for the
grain of salt it's easy to be carried
away by big complicated conspiracies
frankly there's one aspect of the
Christic Institute stuff that leaves me
unconvinced and that's the idea that
there's some kind of a hijacking of the
government by you know by crazies I
don't think that's what the record shows
I don't think the record shows that
there are rogue elephants around and
there may be some but they're not very
important the CIA does what it's told
the crooks of the Richard C chord albert
hack and variety they can do what they
can do their things as long as the
government let them get away with it but
I think the record at least as far as I
read it shows pretty careful central
planning and control by the civilian
authorities and the idea that maybe the
government was hijacked by a secret team
but I don't believe it I think that
that's not correct and probable
diversionary it turns attention away
from the way the institution's
themselves functioning
but you know you got to read it and
think about it and make your own
decisions it's not easy it's not and the
impeachment or any impeachment the
impeachment well you know personally
it's in my honest if you are my judgment
every American president should have
been impeached and in fact and and I
think legally speaking there's a very
solid case every American president
since the Second World War is either an
outright war criminal or has been
involved in serious war crimes and
furthermore the same is true of the
leaders of every other state at least
every state that has enough power to do
anything like maybe not Luxembourg or
something like that but that's the
nature of state power could you please I
discuss in more detail specifically what
US interests in Central America are what
world that the news media play in
securing those interests and
specifically how these interests are
manifested or are representative in
these media content so I couldn't hear
the last sentence and how US interests
are manifested or are represented in
news media content yeah I was just told
that we only have another minute or two
so that's a serious question it would
require a long answer which I'm not
gonna have time to give but I think the
answer to it is basically given in the
Declassified documentary record now
without trying to answer because there's
no time I have a lot of that stuff's
quoted in the book called the unpowered
ideology which quotes a lot of first
chapter of it costs a lot of then
recently declassified documents they
tell it straight out it's exactly what I
said the United States has to block the
development of nationalist regimes which
are responsive to their to the needs of
their own population because there's a
higher priority the higher priority is
maintaining a favorable investment
alignment protecting our resources
making sure you get profits and so on
now it's not that Nicaragua you know I
mean as far as American business is
concerned Nicaragua could disappear and
nobody would notice it or the same is
true of El Salvador but the trouble is
if any of those countries begin to get
somewhere the rot will spread that's the
consistent fear you got a bear in mind
that the weaker and the poorer a country
is the more dangerous it is it's a very
striking fact that it's the weakest
poorest countries that arouse the
greatest hysteria I'm going take the
hysteria over Grenada you know Grenada
you couldn't even find you know it's
like a I mean hundred thousand people
who produce a little nutmeg when lo
began to undergo a mild social
revolution Washington went berserk you
know Laos is probably the poorest
country in the world most of the people
in Laos didn't even know there was such
a thing as Laos they didn't know it
until the bombers came over and started
driving it into the hills they just knew
that little village and there was
another village somewhere as soon as a
very low level social revolution began
to develop him in Laos Washington went
berserk I mean they started the biggest
secret but you know huge bombing I've
wiped that the place you know and that's
consistently true the attack of
nicaragua's the same and is a reason for
that the weaker a country is the more
dangerous it is and the and it's not
because its resources are important
that's because of the rotten apple
effect the point is if even a tiny
country you know say Grenada no
resources nothing I mean if even they
can begin to do something for their own
population like maybe make a fishing
cooperative with 10 people or something
some other place which has more
resources we'll ask why not us you know
so the poor and the weaker you are the
more dangerous you are that's so you
know you don't want to get a mechanical
idea that it's the resources of country
X that we're not willing to give up I
mean
indochina which is pretty big although
Eisenhower and people like that ranted a
lot about the rice and the rubber and
all that stuff that wasn't all that
important what was the danger was that
if Indochina was lost to its own
population and really worked they would
emulate it in Thailand and if that work
they do it in Malaya and pretty soon
you'd find Indonesia becoming
independent and pretty soon the whole
Southeast Asian Network would unravel
and then what would happen well what
would happen then is that Japan would
accommodate to an system of independent
societies and there would be a co cost
prosperity sphere but the United States
wouldn't run it and that was
unacceptable we had just fought the
Pacific War to prevent that and in 1948
the United States was not willing to
lose World War two that's why Indochina
was important and the reasons are
perfectly clear we want a global system
which will be subordinated to the needs
of us investors and you can't let pieces
of it start unraveling because if one of
them works others will go the way that
this appears in the documentary record
even the public documentary record
sometimes is quite striking so take ind
in Chile Chile is a fairly big place but
again you know the United States wasn't
going to disappear Chile became
independent why were they so concerned
about Chile well you know Kissinger
talked about that in this case publicly
because we don't have the secret records
yet he said that Chile was a virus which
might have an effect all the way to
Italy why Italy I mean didn't expect you
know he didn't expect ind to conquer
italy but what he meant was very clear
he said it's going to send the wrong
message to italian voters if they see
that a social democratic government can
take over and succeed and do things
other people get funny ideas well you
know Italy despite 40 years of CIA
subversion still has a labor movement
and suppose they get funny ideas about
taking control of their own country and
you know reinstituting the workers
councils
we destroyed in the 1940s and so on they
might be stimulated by seeing it happen
in Chile that's a virus that has to be
eliminated those are that's the thinking
and it's plausible thinking I mean a
vulgar version of it is no no theory you
know the idea that ho chi minh's going
to get in a canoe and you know conquer
California or something or that the
Nicaraguans are going to march on Texas
I mean that kind of biz that's what
everybody laughs about and that's the
version of the domino theory that's used
to frighten the public may be leaders
believe it I don't know you know it's
possible that they believe it but
rational planners certainly don't
believe it they understand that the
domino theory is correct which is why
it's never questioned but it's correct
because of the demonstration effect of
success that's why the domino theory is
correct and that's why it's never
challenged and that's why tiny little
places pose such a threat and have to be
crushed no because pretty soon bigger
systems start unraveling and the whole
world becomes independent can't have
that I think the interests are very
clear
