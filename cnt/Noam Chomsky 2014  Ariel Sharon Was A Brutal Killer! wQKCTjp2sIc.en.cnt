and those are some of the headlines this
is democracy now democracynow.org the
war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman we
begin in Israel where state funeral is
held today in front of the Knesset the
Israeli Parliament for former prime
minister ariel sharon he died saturday
after eight years in a coma he was 85
years old he'll be buried in a state
funeral today at his home in southern
Israel the US was among eight countries
18 countries to send delegations to
attend sheron's funeral along with
Middle East international envoy Tony
Blair and the Russian and German Foreign
Ministers at a State Memorial in
Jerusalem Vice President Joe Biden
remembered sharone as a controversial
but bold military leader and statesman
when he told 10,000 Israelis to leave
their homes in Gaza in order from his
perspective to strengthen Israel I can't
think of much more controversial as a
student of the Jewish state I can't
think of a much more difficult and
controversial decision been made but he
believed it dan he did it the security
of his people was always Eric's
unwavering mission an unbreakable
commitment to the future of Jews or the
30 years or three hundred years from now
that was vice president joe biden
speaking during our assurance memorial
thousands of israelis came to pay their
respects that as as his coffin layin
state outside the parliament building in
Jerusalem ministers held a minute's
silence at Sunday's cabinet meeting to
remember their former leader this is
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu kafka go kasaba the home k in
all of his latest roles as minister of
defense as minister of housing minister
of infrastructures minister of foreign
affairs parikh has contributed to the
state of israel and as much as he could
the security of Israel and that's what
he did as Israel's Prime Minister I
believe he represents the generation of
Jewish leaders who rose from our people
with the resumption of our independence
he was tied to the land he knew the need
to protect the land and he understood
that above all that our independence is
our ability to protect ourselves by
ourselves I believe he will be
remembered as one of the prominent
leaders and one of the bravest
commanders in the heart of Israel
forever RL sharon has been one of the
most dominant political figures in
Israel's history involved in each of
Israel's major Wars dating back to its
founding in 1948 as prime minister he
oversaw Israel's disengagement from the
Gaza Strip the Gaza withdrawal caused a
serious rift insurance Liquide party
which led to his departure he formed a
new party Kadima which maintained the
Gaza disengagement while expanding
Israeli control over the major
settlement blocs in the occupied West
Bank among Palestinians Iran was one of
the most reviled political figures in
the history of the israel-palestine
conflict he's seen as father of the
settlement movement an architect of the
israeli invasion of lebanon which killed
a reported 20,000 palestinians and
lebanese an israeli commission of
inquiry found Sharon had in direct
responsibility for the massacre of over
a thousand Palestinian refugees at the
Sabra and Shatila camps in Lebanon in
1982 to talk about RL Sean's life and
legacy were joined now by three guests
in New York were joined by rashid
holiday the Edwards a professor of Arab
studies at Columbia University author of
a number of books including brokers of
deceit how the US is undermine peace in
the Middle East and just reissued under

nineteen eighty-two war joining us from
his home in Massachusetts by phone Noam
Chomsky world-renowned political
dissident linguist and author Institute
professor emeritus at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology where his taught
for more than 50 years his 1983 book the
fateful triangle is known as one of the
definitive works on the israel-palestine
conflict in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon
and we are also joined from Oxford by
avi Schleim an emeritus professor of
International Studies at Oxford
University the author of Israel and
Palestine reappraisal revisions and
reputations he served in the Israeli
army and
mid-60s and is widely regarded as one of
the world's leading scholars on the
israeli-arab conflict we welcome you all
to democracy now let's go first to the
Israeli historian avi Schleim your
response to the death of RL sharone what
you feel he should be remembered for
aria Charan is what is one of the most
iconic and controversial figures in
Israel's history he had deep he was a
deeply flawed character renowned for his
brutality mendacity and corruption
despite these character flaws he is a
major figure in shaping Israel's modern
history he was one of the five most
influential figures who left a deep park
on modern Israel the first was the vide
ben-gurion the founder of the state who
in 1949 concluded the armistice
agreements with the neighbouring Arab
states the only internationally
recognized borders that Israel has ever
had second was levy eshkol who in the
aftermath of the june nineteen
sixty-seven war presided over the
transformation of israel from a plucky
little democracy into a brutal colonial
power the third was the liquid leader
Menachem Begin who signed the first
peace treaty with an Arab country he
signed the peace treaty with Egypt in
1979 the force was it Sakura being the
only Israeli prime minister who went
forward on the political front towards
the Palestinians and he did this by
signing the Oscar called in 1939
and clinching the historic compromise
between the two nations with the iconic
handshake with Yasser Arafat on the
White House lawn and finally there is
Ariel Sharon who always rejected the
Oslo peace process who is Prime Minister
try to sweep away the remnants of Oslo
and forge a new strategy of
unilateralism of giving up on the
Palestinians and redrawing unilaterally
the borders of Greater Israel so his
legacy can be summed up in one word
unilateralism acting in defiance of UN
resolutions international law an
international public opinion the real
question is how was I real sure on in
how is Israel today under his successors
able to defy the entire international
community and the answer to that is that
Israel could not have done it on its own
but it has a little friend and the
friend is the United States of America
but that is a different story we're
going to break and then get response
from Professor Rashid holiday and
professor Noam Chomsky as well as
continue our discussion with Israeli
historian avi Schleim this is democracy

ariel sharon's stay with us I'm Amy

the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
we're talking about the death of the
former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon who
died Saturday after eight years in a
coma he was 85 years old we are joined
by professor Noam Chomsky in
Massachusetts by Avi Schleim the Israeli
historian at Oxford University in
Britain and were joined here in new york
by rashid holiday among his books are
brokers of deceit how the US is
undermine peace in the Middle East he's
the Edwards Sade professor of Arab
studies at Columbia University you are
also Palestinian your response to the
death of arielle sharone well for me the
most important emotion is as a sense of
finally the man who carried out a war in
which 20,000 people were killed the
lebanon war of 1982 who besieged they
dude who destroyed building after
building killing scores of civilians in
a search to destroy the PLL leadership
has finally left the world I was in
baited with that summer of nineteen
eighty-two and I to me it's it's
horrific to watch The Hague geographies
that are being produced by people like
Vice President Biden by the New York
Times by much of the media about a man
who really should have ended his days at
The Hague before the International
Criminal Court he was a man who from the
very beginning of his career started out
killing people as the commander of unit
101 he was the man who ordered the fibia
massacre explain what is unit 101 unit
101 was a military unit of the Israeli
army formed at the orders of the Israeli
leadership of the time to carry out
savage reprisal rates but we're talking
about dozens of victims in retaliation
for in this case two or three people
being killed 69 people had their homes
blown up over their heads this is 1953
in a small village in the what is today
the West Bank um the this is the first
condemnation
Israel by a Security Council resolution
this is something that the United States
at the time was willing to say was a was
a was a horrible horrible crime and this
is a man who since then really has only
acted on the basis of a belief that
force is the only thing the Arabs
understand the idea that he is now
considered by some to be a peacemaker is
it's grotesque frankly Noam Chomsky you
wrote the fateful triangle in response
to what happened in Lebanon it changed
the discourse for many in this country
first explain your reaction to the death
of arielle sharone and what we should
understand about him oh you know they're
there is a convention that you're not
supposed to speak ill of the recently
dead which unfortunately imposes a kind
of vow silence because there is nothing
else to say there's nothing good to say
what Rashid and these lima said is
exactly accurate the wizard brutal
killer he had one text idea in mind
which drove him all his life a greater
Israel as powerful as possible few
Palestinians as possible they should
somehow disappear and in Israel which
could be powerful enough to dominate the
region the lebanon war then Patricia's
worst crime also had a goal of imposing
a client state in Lebanon a Maronite
client state and Aziz were the driving
forces of his life the idea that the
gadget evacuation was a controversial
step for peace
is the almost farcical by 2005 the Gaza
had been devastated and he played a
large role in that as the Israeli Hawks
could understand easily that it made no
sense to keep a few thousand Israeli
settlers in Gaza using a very large
percentage of its land and scarce water
with a huge IDF Israeli army contingent
to protect them what made more sense was
to take them out and place them in the
West Bank or the Golan Heights illegal
that could have been done very simply
they could have the Israeli army could
have announced it on August first
they're leaving Gaza in which case the
settlers that would have piled into the
trucks that were provided to them which
would take them from their subsidized
fountain Gaza to illegal subsidized
homes and other territories that Israel
intended to keep and that would be the
end of it but instead of what Israeli
sociologist called barf kimberling
called an absurd theater was instructed
to who tried to demonstrate to the world
that there cannot be any further
evacuations the the the farce was a
successful public relations ever just
Biden's comments illustrate that it was
particularly farcical when you recognize
that it was a virtual replay of what
happened in nineteen eighty-two when
israel was compelled withdrawal from the
Egyptian Sinai and carried out an
operation that the Israeli press
ridiculed as
national / alma 1982 we have to show the
world how much were suffering by
carrying out an action that will benefit
our power and our security and it that
was the peacemaking effort but his his
career is one of the unremitting
brutality dedication to the fixed idea
of his life he doubtless showed courage
and commitment to pursuing this ideal
which is an ugly and the horrific one um
avi Schleim go back to nineteen
eighty-two and what happened in Lebanon
first where were you in 1982 Ariel
Sharon was defense minister in Maine
ahem begging's government and he was the
architect of the invasion of Lebanon and
it was a war of deception because Sharon
tricked his cabinet colleagues into
launching this operation by pretending
the eggs were very limited where is in
fact he had a big plan to completely
change the burger politics of the region
to create a new order in Lebanon but by
helping Israel's Maronite Christian
allies to come to power in Lebanon and
then sign a peace treaty with Israel
then to expel the Syrian forces from
Lebanon and to replace Syrian with
Israeli hegemony in the Levant this war
of deception ended in tears he didn't
achieve any of its grand year's
geopolitical objectives and it ended
also with the mass
occur in the refugee camps of sabra and
shatila there was an Israel that there
was an Israeli communica mission of
inquiry which found Defense Minister
Sharon is responsible for failing to
prevent the massacre of the Palestinian
refugees by Israel's Christian allies
and Sharon was forced to step down he
was fired as minister of defense and no
one could have guessed at that time how
a man who was found unfit to serve as
minister of defense would bounce back as
Israel's Prime Minister's but this is
all of a piece insurance career as a
soldier and as a politician because as
Professor Hal ed pointed out Sharon
committed his first war crime as a young
major in 1953 when he destroyed many
houses in the Jordanian village of
Gibeah and he was responsible for the
massacre of 69 civilians so that was his
first war crime but it was not to be his
last and the consistent thread in his
career as a soldier and as a politician
was to use brute force not just against
the regular armies of the Arab states
but also against Palestinian and
civilians and the other consistent
thread is to shun diplomacy and to rely
on
force to impose Israeli hegemony on the
entire region President George W Bush
famously called Sharon a man of peace
Sharon was nothing of the sort he was a
man of war through and through and he
called his autobiography warrior not
diplomat but I his approach to diplomacy
reversed Clausewitz's dictum for sure on
diplomacy was the pursuit of war by
other means for the last 40 years the
arab-israeli conflict has been my main
research interest and I can honestly say
that I have never come across a single
scintilla of evidence to support the
notion of her on as a man of peace I
wanted to go back to nineteen eighty-two
the Commission report you refer to avi
Schleim and ask Noam Chomsky about the
kahan Commission and what it is they
found and how it is that RL sharone
actually survived politically beyond
that the comm Commission did condemned
Iran for what they called indirect
responsibility for the subversive to a
massacre the common Commission I think
was really a whitewash it it tried to
give as soft as possible and
interpretation of what was in fact a
horrifying massacre actually one that
should resonate with people who are
familiar with Jewish history they were
almost a replica of the kitchen of
massacre in the in the pre projectory
First World War Russia one of the worst
atrocities
Israeli memory led to a famous the
nationalist poem by the main Israeli
poet Donovan bialik city of killing the
Czar's army had surrounded this town and
allowed the people within it to rampage
killing jews four seven three days they
killed 45 people that was pretty much
what happened in suburbs at DIA Israeli
army surrounded it I said in the
phalanges forces were obviously bent on
murder these were the Lebanese Christian
forces living is Christian the terrorist
force allied with Israel the soldiers
watched they illuminated it they felt
the matter they watched for several days
while they murdered not 45 people but
somewhere Israel claims 800 other
analyses go up to several thousand
that's the sub reticulum massacre the
idea that children had indirect
responses are incidentally was bitterly
condemned internationally for direct
responsibility that's in fact one of the
events that set off the huge flow of
refugees from Eastern Europe including
my father among others so this was a
kind of a replica except far more brutal
and vicious and the chevron escaped more
than a mile danger true that he was
removed as a defense minister but it
wasn't long before he came back and it
that's one of a number of extremely
shocking incidents in his career I'm Amy
