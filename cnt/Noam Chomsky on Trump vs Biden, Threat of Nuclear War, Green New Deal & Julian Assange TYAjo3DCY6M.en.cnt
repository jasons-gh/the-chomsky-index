i'm ashton ratanzi and welcome back to a
brand new season of going underground
still swimming against the current
of the mainstream amid a global pandemic
orbit civil war in the united states
and the impending threat of climate
extinction i'm joined now from tucson
arizona
by one of the most cited intellectuals
on earth the father of modern
linguistics
american dissident noam chomsky thanks
so much for coming back on the show so
what is the
global green new deal that's the new
book climate crisis
and the global green new deal and why is
it to you
the most important political plan in all
of human history
we're now facing a number of crises
serious ones one crisis is
the threat of climate environmental
catastrophe we must move to
net zero emissions within a
few decades and one
goal of the green no deal is to provide
the means to do that the other problem
which is arising with great
severity right now is the collapse of
the economy
as a result of the pandemic now it is
not this is a very
different kind of crisis from the
financial crisis
this time there is no escape
through just consumer spending or
pouring money into the
stock market that's not going to do
anything
we have to create a new economy
which offers good jobs
constructive work developing
the kinds of infrastructure social
environmental structure physical
structure that we need
the kind of goods that we need to live a
decent life
and that's the other half of the green
new deal it is essential
for not only for survival but for
healthy survival
you mentioned corona virus
how does coronavirus alter your
analysis given that coronavirus
threatens
corporate profits too interestingly it
does not
yet threaten most
corporate profits many corporations are
making money hand over fist of the
high tech for example there was one day
in which
jeff bezos earned 13 billion dollars
they're getting hedge funds private
equity funds
uh all doing fine because the treasury
is pouring money
into the economy in a way which largely
benefits them
if you take a look at the economy take
the united states but it's worldwide
the stock market is breaking records
poverty is breaking records
they are totally dissociated and that's
a sign of the deep disease
of the economy which can only
be overcome by the development of the
policies outlined in the
details of the green new deal proposals
what do you make of the continuing
corporate
reframing of the climate crisis it's up
to
uh ordinary people to recycle to
buy organic food it's up to them rather
than the need for systemic change
naturally those who benefit from
existing
institutions do not want to see them
changed
not a surprise if you have a
totalitarian dictatorship
and there are problems the dictator
isn't going to say
overthrow me well that's analogous to
what you're describing
the core of the problem is the
massive production
for private profit not for need
and the use of the fossil fuels when we
have to be
phasing them out and moving towards
total sustainable energy no
no emissions within a few decades
we've talked to scientists about how
deforestation
led to coronavirus tell me about how in
the book
you talk about even strategies like
red it's called redd
it's funded by corporations to stop
deforestation
but in your book you say that it
actually facilitates deforestation
encourages it
helps corporate farmers at the expense
of others why is it time and time again
these strategies
sponsored by governments and the world
bank in that case seem to achieve the
opposite effect i mean they may
in the back of their minds have decent
intentions
but they are constrained by the nature
of institutional power to develop
programs which will not harm the
powerful institutions of the society
mostly the corporate sector but will in
fact
conform to their needs the result is
policies which whatever their intentions
are often negative in their effects we
have to address
the problems directly without
uh giving priority
to the needs of the destructive
institutions
there's no time to overcome and
eliminate them
we have to accommodate to their
existence
the time scale of institutional change
is out of the range of time scale for
dealing with the environmental crisis
so we have to work within the basic
institutional structure that exists
but within it we can find very
clear definite policies
they're outlined in my colleague bob
collins
contributions to the book in some detail
which with a small percentage
of the economy to fight
will suffice to deal with these
twin problems yes your book actually
goes further than
the road to hell being paved by good
intentions because
perhaps what will shock people is you
call it deliberately
malicious let's take what's just
happening right in front of our eyes
so the last few days with strong
corporate backing of the trump
administration
has been eliminating
regulations which protect
the population and the environment
from release of methane
arsenic other toxic wastes
to the benefit of the corporate system
not only the fossil fuel companies but
the banks that finance them
benefits them severely harms the
environment
and it harms the american people they
don't care
now if that's not malice what is now
there may be somebody in the boardroom
who says
it would be nice to deal with the
environment
and it would be nice to help people but
when it comes to making specific
decisions to maximize profit
and market share all those good
intentions fade into
the background in the book the deal
is clear that full employment is
key bob pollin quotes karl marx
saying capitalism requires
unemployment to diminish the bargaining
power of workers
whereas this green deal seems to provide
for full employment
remember that we do not live in
capitalist societies of the kind that
marx was discussing
marx was discussing quite properly
an abstract form of capitalism
which brings out its essential nature
so every existing society is one or
another form of state capitalism
where state action has been undertaken
under popular pressure to mitigate
the destructive forces of pure
capitalism so yes pure
capitalism would require as mark says
a reserve army of labor but state
capitalism
can overcome that flaw and move to
guarantee
employment and in fact decent employment
to everyone
it doesn't deal with all the problems of
capitalism in fact we were
moving pretty close to formal
full employment under obama's
tepid response to the financial crisis
continued by trump it was not the kind
of full employment that any
decent human being would want a very
large part of it was
highly precarious jobs at very low pay
i've got to ask you does it surprise
even you how
capitalism has reinforced systems of
power
amongst uh elites even though it may
endanger their own children
suppose you're the ceo of
jp morgan chase biggest bank
or exxon mobil you basically have two
choices
one choice is to meet
the requirements of the institutional
structures that exist and work to
maximize
profits no matter what the human
consequences
that's one choice the other choice
is to put those aside and work
to create a decent world suppose you
make that choice
then you're immediately thrown out by
the board of directors
and somebody else is put in who makes
the first choice
these are institutional problems not
individual ones
now that's not to say that it cannot be
changed
within existing institutions it can
so take jp morgan chase again
biggest bank recently uh
internal memo of the bank was leaked
and made public it was very interesting
it warned the directors of the bank that
this
in their words the survival of humanity
is at stake if we continue on our
present course
of funding fossil fuels and it added
that the bank is facing reputational
risks
meaning the public is getting enraged
and will take its revenge on you
and harm you the leaders of the bank
unless you make moves towards
working to save humanity from
destruction
otherwise the banks will be taken over
by the public and nationalized
which can be done or replaced by public
banks
that's all within reach and the leaders
of the
economy know that their hold is quite
fragile
well everything seems nationalized here
in britain more so than after the 2008
crash because of the
pandemic and hundreds of people are
being arrested on the
streets of london as part of the
extinction rebellion protests but
jp morgan claims in public rather than a
leaked memo
fossil fuel loans for the arctic uh
drilling have stopped they're phasing
out
uh loans for coal mining and they're
planning a 200 billion
empowerment something called the
empowerment economic development deal
uh on par with goldman sachs you
mentioned exxon mobil well the boss of
shell says
yes climate change is real yes
renewables are
an indispensable part of the future
energy mix but
no provoking provoking a sudden death of
fossil fuel
is not a plausible plan and then what
you do
is explain to the general public
that this is false that they're serving
their own
interests and you must hold their feet
to the fire
to drop those pretenses and to do what
they know
is in fact both feasible and correct
to move away from certainly from
coal and from all fossil fuels
as rapidly as possible we are involved
in
class war and one the ruling class
doesn't say
i'm just going to do what i want i don't
care about you
they can't they don't have that power
their rule is fragile they know it
therefore they must accommodate to an
energized
active engaged population exactly as has
been often done in the past
the green new deal uses the phrase new
deal
because the new deal in the 1930s
did something very similar
not on a sufficient scale but
same kind of thing a government
action to overcome a crisis
a deep crisis called caused by
the fundamental flaws of capitalist
society
and then came the war with vastly more
public expense
way beyond anything required today
ended the depression created
a vast
background of consumer demand which led
to
several decades of fairly rapid fairly
egalitarian growth
no i'm trump scale stop you there more
from one of the world's greatest public
intellectuals after this break
welcome back i'm still here with
american dissident and author of the
seminal manufacturing consent
no i'm chomsky you mentioned the new
deal
clearly your primary process for the
democrats did not elect
bernie sanders who favored new deal
style politics here in britain of course
jeremy corbyn lost
the election what do you make of
november you say in the book the
democrats are in the pockets of wall
street
lobbyists the republicans you compare to
right-wing
fringe parties of europe yup that's
correct
we have it right now the republicans are
way off the spectrum they are in
international comparisons they are
compared
with the parties in europe with
neo-fascist backgrounds done on
issues like the climate they're the
worst in the world
they want trump administration wants to
race
towards maximizing the use of fossil
fuels
eliminating the regulatory system which
reduces somewhat their destructive
effect
on the climate and on the population
perfectly open about this
they're not pretending anything
otherwise take a look at the republican
convention
not a word about it just trying to
arouse people's emotions
fears fears about white supremacy
about uh these taking away their
their guns any emotional appeal you can
imagine
it's all very familiar from autocratic
regimes with a neo-fascist variety
and inside the democratic party there's
a conflict
very striking conflict you can see it if
you look closely
at what's happening so take climate
you go back about two weeks
take a look at the internet two weeks
ago
look for a democratic party climate
program
it was a pretty progressive program it
was biden's program
forced on biden he didn't choose it
forced on biden by the
progressive base very progressive
program
better than any that had yet existed
take a look at the same
internet now tickle and
write the titan click democratic climate
program what you find is nothing
they removed the democratic
national committee the dnc basically
clintonite donor-oriented democrats
managed in a big power play to remove
biden's progressive climate program
that's a battle inside the democratic
party
they're very rather similar to what we
just saw in britain
where the blair-right right-wing
labor party parliamentary labor party
managed to undermine the corbyn campaign
in a really vicious manner is a very
powerful 800 page
detailed study of how they did it
which is being mostly suppressed in the
british press
but very important which showed the
means that they went to
to try to undermine corbyn's effort
to develop a labor party that would be
responsive
to the needs of its constituents a
participatory labor party
with policies that actually had very
high approval among the government
the right-wing parts of the labor party
the parliamentary labor party couldn't
stand that
they'd rather lose the election than
lose control of the party
we're seeing something similar to that
in the conflict
within the democratic party today and
what it means is
that the progressive popular base must
work
harder more energetically
more commitment case biden wins the
election
to ensure that they go back to the
progressive programs that they had
announced
and not be forced to abandon them
by the donor-oriented clintonite
conservative element of the party and
basically what used to be called
moderate republicans
but all of that is vastly overshadowed
by the desperate need to get rid of
the malignancy in the white house which
whatever criticism you make of the
democratic party
the white house malignancy is
incomparably worse
and will if let free uh
basically destroy us well
uh we invite secure stammer on to refute
what you said about labor however he's
seeking an investigation into our right
to broadcast at all as for joe biden
apparently the policy hasn't changed two
trillion dollars to boost clean energy
an upgrade of four million buildings a
seeking of a shift towards
public transportation uh but of course
as you know
in the most recent speech joe biden said
no ban
on fracking there's so many different
aspects obviously to the green
new deal but given that we've had the
deaths
of refugees being reported
here in the english channel in this book
you say rich countries are in turmoil
because a small fraction of refugees
might defile their precious ethnic
purity
and you also quote the un figure of 65
million refugees fleeing violence
persecution and
global warming why do you think they are
presented in our media as
migrants and that the real enemy here is
human trafficking
not foreign policy for the reasons that
you just quoted
an ironic but accurate comment
about how they might defile our racial
purity
we've seen that before in human history
it's disgraceful
it's shocking it has to be overcome
europe's reaction to the
refugee crisis is despicable
europe is moving and setting up
centers in the poorest countries in
africa
like niger to try to deter
people from fleeing from the wreckage
of european imperialism to make sure
that they don't get
to europe's shores bribing
turkey to keep them away from us
there's a reason why people are fleeing
it's not because they
love europe it's because of intolerable
conditions
largely created by european terror and
violence over
okay now it's europe's responsibility to
behave
humanely towards them it's a and not to
resort to racist
pretenses in order to punish them
for for europe's crimes
same is true here when president trump
compels mexico to keep
central american refugees from reaching
the territory of the united states to
call for asylum which they certainly
deserve
why are they fleeing central america not
because they don't like their homes
because u.s terrorist
violence destroyed their country there
are quite a few books people can read of
yours about that
alleged terror and violence i just got
to ask though that
you would agree presumably with donald
trump however that our greatest
immediate threat
was a nuclear holocaust caused by
nuclear weapons
agree with tom trump is racing
towards maximizing the threat of nuclear
weapons
that's why the doomsday clock
has been moved of the famous doom state
park
has been moved a minute hand has been
moved
closer to midnight every year
that trump has been in office this last
january
they abandoned minutes moved to second
100 seconds to midnight since january
trump has continued his attack
on the arms control regime which is
has been the has somewhat
limited the enormous threat of nuclear
destruction
it already eliminated the inf treaty
a couple of months ago march he
eliminated the
open skies treaty which traces back to
eisenhower
he is now delayed on frivolous grounds
delayed to implement the renewal of the
new start treaty
by now it may even be too late to renew
it that's the last of the major treaties
he's even gone beyond that by
threatening to start
nuclear testing hasn't been done for
28 years all of this is
on top of that moving towards creating
a new weapon new and far more
threatening
weapons of destruction against which
there is no
possible defense democrats don't have a
pretty record on this i should say
but nothing like trump well we invite we
invite the u.s ambassador on trump says
actually he's all for peace obviously
but
finally i've got to ask you about julian
assange
of wikileaks he begins the trial of his
life
in 48 hours time in the london court the
u.n rapporteur who has been on this
show says he's been effectively tortured
by british authorities
what do you think it'll mean if the
wikileaks founder is extradited to the
united states on espionage charges
it would be a criminal act on the part
of the british government
to accede to the u.s demand for
extradition
uh he would be if they've already
committed
many crimes assange's offense
is not paying bail okay
now she had good reasons not to because
he would have been
extradited if he had but not paying bail
requires
a tap on the wrist not torture
in a high security prison okay
up to the point where he's not even
allowed to receive
books i mean mass murderers are
being treated like in a way beyond the
worst vicious criminal
okay and if he's extradited he comes
up for trial on the u.s espionage laws
which even carry a potential death
sentence
his trial he's being tried because he
committed the crime
of letting the general population
know things that they have a right to
know
and that powerful states don't want them
to know
that's the crime uh and the way the
british government is acting is
deplorable of the popular pressure again
must be developed to ensure
that he can be released quickly
from these charges and
that he'd be absolved of all these
threats well uk prime minister boris
johnson says it's only right that julian
assange finally faces justice
the uk government says it supports the
important work of the un special
rapporteur and torture
but disagrees with a number of his
observations as for the u.s secretary of
state pompeo he says wikileaks
is a hostile intelligence agency no i'm
chomsky thank you
and that's it for this season premiere
we'll be back on monday with one of the
world's greatest chroniclers
of los angeles and pandemics mike davis
