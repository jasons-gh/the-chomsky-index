professor stronski so something this is
a little bit different I'm wondering
what your your analysis of the conflict
in the Democratic Republic of Congo it's
described as the worst in most deadly
war since World War 2 40 million dead
since 1998 so I looked I mean haven't
yet read your book but I looked in the
index I didn't see it so I'd like to
hear that you're right you're perfectly
right about the Congo it's one of the
worst etre may be the worst ongoing
atrocity in the world and you're quite
right that among many other hideous
atrocities in the world I didn't discuss
that one in the book because that just
doesn't happen to be the topic if
someone can partly the reason why I
didn't discuss it is I can't think of a
sensible way to do anything about it if
somebody could come up with some
sensible proposals that we can implement
yes let's do it there there is a week UN
force there and one sensible proposal
would be to strengthen it and to give it
logistic support and other means to try
to dampen down the conflict but as I'm
sure you know any form of intervention
in a complex conflict has to be
evaluated very carefully with regard to
its consequences I mean it's nice to sit
on an academic seminar and say okay
let's go send troops and solve it but
that doesn't work sending troops to
solve it often exacerbates it you have
to understand the situation you have to
ask what lies behind it you have to work
out the potential consequences of what
might happen and I haven't researched
that and nor has anyone else to my
knowledge and I haven't seen any serious
proposal as to what to do about it other
than to strengthen somewhat the UN
forces that are there and to try to put
pressure on all the countries that are
involved in making it worse yeah that
all makes sense but I don't see a lot
that we can do about it which is why I
didn't write about it I'm what I focus
on frankly is based on a very elementary
moral principle I realize it's almost
universally rejected but I'd still like
to reiterate it
our prime concern should be our own
responsibilities we should our prime
concern for anybody should be the
predictable consequences of your own
actions I mean it's very self it's very
convenient and you know be
self-righteous and to talk about
somebody else's crimes so you know if
you were a Russian commissar in the
1970s they'll be very convenient to
concentrate on us crimes but the
important thing to do in Russia was not
that I don't care whether soccer I've
said anything about us crimes what you
care is what the saying about their own
society and something they can do about
and the same elementary moral principle
applies to us the focus of our attention
should be on what we can do what we are
doing what are the options for us to try
to terminate major crimes in which we're
involved and there are plenty of them
and to mitigate harm and atrocities
elsewhere and there's a lot that we can
do about the Congo I really don't know
you
