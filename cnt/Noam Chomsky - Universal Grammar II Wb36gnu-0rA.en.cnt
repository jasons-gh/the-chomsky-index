how have your ideas on universal grammar
changed over the years are you more or
less convinced of the theory now than
you were initially well there's there's
a lot of confusion about the notion
Universal grammar univer Universal
grammar had a traditional meaning but in
modern linguistics last 50 years or so
it's had a technical meaning which is
not unrelated to the traditional meaning
but it's not identical either Universal
grammar is just the name for the theory
of the genetic component of the language
faculty I mean transparently there's
some genetic component right there's a
reason say why my granddaughter
reflexively identified some part of her
environment as language related which is
no small trick nobody knows how to
duplicate that and then more or less
reflexively picked up the capacity that
we're all now using whereas her pet say
kitten or chimpanzee or songbird or
whatever it may be with exactly the same
inputs couldn't even take the first step
can't identify part of the environment
as language related obviously not the
later steps well there are two possible
answers to how that happens
that one is it's a miracle the other is
there's a she had some specific genetic
capacity that's like the capacity that
had her growth arms and wings let's say
just some fixed or had a mammalian
visual system but not an insect visual
system now this is not controversial for
anything except human higher mental
faculties for some reason when people
investigate human higher mental
faculties they have to be insane you
know you can't accept the approach that
we take to everything else in the world
the kind of a methodological dualism
everything else in the world we study by
the standard methods of science but when
we talk about human higher mental
faculties we have to become mist
so therefore the controversy about the
existence of universal grammar which is
like which means a controversy about
whether there is some genetic property
that distinguishes humans from everybody
else which leads to these for the
ability to do doing what we're now doing
but there shouldn't be any controversy
about that the only question is what is
it well there have been theories about
it from the 1950s when these studies
began up till the present and it's a
living field so they keep changing so in
that sense yes my views about universal
grammar keep changing say when and
walked into my office as a graduate
student and told me I was wrong about
everything so okay my views changed but
in that sense sure there's going to be
constant change until the field is
disappears or is dead or something and
it's a lot this long way to go these are
not trivial questions at the the sort of
general tendency of change not every
linguist would agree by any means so
it's a personal opinion at the in the
early stages when the first question was
asked seriously about 50 years ago as to
how we are capable of doing what we do
all the time how are we capable of
understanding producing expressions
which have we've never heard which may
have never been uttered in the history
of the language and do it over infinite
range or various strange properties that
they have as soon as you look at them
how can we do it
the only answer seemed to be that each
of us has a highly intricate
computational system in the brain which
yields these very specific results but
that then poses a paradox because it
must be the case that we all all humans
have the same genetic capacity with
marginal variation the reason is if you
take
a child from say a hunter-gatherer tribe
in the Amazon and the child is raised in
Cambridge Mass it'll perfect made this
become a graduate student studying
quantum physics at MIT with no
difference from anyone else you know and
conversely so we all have the same
capacity and it's more or less
understood why the capacity developed
very recently in evolutionary time and
probably in some window between a
hundred thousand and fifty thousand
years ago something like that and that's
just the flick of an eye so whatever
happened never changed except extremely
marginally so we're all fundamentally
identical for all practical purposes
human genetic variation is very slight
anyway superficial differences but not
very profound foreign and outside they
an extraterrestrial observer looking at
us the way we look at frogs will say
there's only one human and one language
with minor variations so on the one hand
it's got to be uniform on the other hand
the it seemed to be the case that each
particular language had a highly
intricate and complex system of rules
computational system and they were very
different from one another and that is a
paradox in fact then serious paradox
well over the years there have been
efforts to deal with it to try to
overcome the paradox a major step was
taken and here views on universal
grammar at least for many of us did
change radically was around 1980 be sure
you were there yeah it's her fault when
a different view of the matter sort of
crystallized what's called sometimes
called the principles and parameters
view the picture that the principle that
there are fixed principles which are
really invariant nobody has to acquire
them they're part of universal grammar
and then there's a number of options
that can be taken called parameters
that the child has to pick up from
experience and they have to be pretty
simple you have to be able to pick them
up from limited evidence because that's
all there is so for example in some
languages like English the it's called a
head first language so the verb precedes
the object and a preposition precedes
the object of the preposition and so on
other languages like say Japanese are
almost the mirror image the verb follows
the object the post positions not
prepositions and so on so languages are
virtually mirror images of each other
and you have to set the parameter child
has to set the parameter which says am I
talking English or my thousand Japanese
and that can be took me determined from
very simple data so that's a reasonable
choice of a parameter and the hope was
that you could find some finite set of
parameters like a finite switch box
where you set the switch the child has
set switches one way or another and can
do it on the basis of fairly simple data
and then once this enters into a
predetermined system of principles you
get things which superficially look very
different but are actually almost
identical just differing in a
superficial choices well if you could
work that out you'd have solved the
paradox it's a long way to work that out
but that made it possible at least to
confront the issue seriously without
facing an immediate near self
contradiction and it set off a lot of a
really rich period of research and
inquiry and nothing like it in the
thousands of years of history of study
of language in the last 25 30 years of a
wide variety of different languages new
questions at a depth that could never
have been proposed before sometimes the
answers leading to new questions and so
on been a very lively period and we also
raised another question what about the
principles where do they come from
that's a fact the choice of parameters
where do these things come from if
they're in universal grammar if they're
part of the genetic endowment then they
had to evolve somehow but not a lot
could have evolved because it's too
recent you know you go back a hundred
thousand years there's as far as we know
nothing
humans had the same Anatomy anything
that's preserved in the fossil record is
about same you know hundreds of thousand
years back so some small change must
have taken place in the in the brain
which somehow allowed all of this to
suddenly blossom and pretty soon after
that again in evolutionary time like
maybe a couple of tens of thousands of
years which is no time at all humans
started leaving East Africa where we all
come from as far as anyone knows so some
small group developed this system and
then spread all over the world now
they're all essentially the same but
what evolved in that short period of
time cannot have been very complex
you know wouldn't expect a series of
extensive stages like say development of
limbs millions of years
therefore what you'd predict is that
some other principle external to
language maybe some principle of nature
the principle of computational
efficiency or something like that which
is not specific to language interacted
with a small mutation which just gave
rise to the universal grammar well that
sets forth a new goal of research to ask
to see if you can determine that the
principles themselves do not have the
intricacy that they appeared to have but
are actually the result of application
of non linguistic in fact none may be
non-human principles like general
principles of computational efficiency
to whatever small change took place and
the small change was probably the
capacity to
carry out recursive enumeration
basically the capacity that gives you
the number system for example to take
two things two objects already
constructed in the mind and make up a
new object out of them and then keep
that process up indefinitely so you get
an infinite array of possible
expressions each with some semantic
interpretation and some mode of
externalization speech sign whatever
maybe that would be and the goal would
be to try to show that that was
essentially instantaneous once the small
mutation took place
given the this operation the recursive
enumeration operation it allows you to
create a discrete infinity of expression
structured expressions well that's at
least a feasible picture the trick is to
show that it's true true or how close it
is to true it can you cut away at the
apparent complexity of the principles
and show that they can actually be
accounted for in terms of general
principles of that hold for organisms
generally perhaps and maybe even
elsewhere in the physical world and that
are instantly are almost instantly
applied once the original move is made
to whatever small move it was to produce
the capacity for recursive enumeration
well that's a goal far from being
attained but last 15 20 years there's
been considerable progress towards
there's a lot of things that it seemed
twenty years ago you had to assign to
the genetic endowment have no now been
rather plausibly shown to be possible
consequences of just application
particularly principles of computational
efficiency to a system which had only
the ability to construct an infinite
hierarchy of expressions and that we
don't know enough about the brain to
know how that might have happened but
that could have been a very small
mutation just changing something in
somebody's genome and then spreading
through the small breeding group
so that in that respect it's it's it's a
goal you know and steps have been taken
towards it but you would expect that
something like that ought to be true
just from the what's known about the
history of evolution of Homo sapiens in
very recent times without much
opportunity for selection have had any
effect maybe a small effect but not much
so that's I think it's in that that's
the tendency of thinking at least my
thinking and some other many others on
how theories of universal grammar have
changed but the idea that there is
universal grammar that exists that can't
be controversial unless you believe in
magic for the elementary reasons that I
mentioned
