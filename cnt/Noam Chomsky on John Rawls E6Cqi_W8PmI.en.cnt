so about Rawls theory of justice I mean
it was actually a personal friend and I
think his work is very good I like it I
don't really think it applies very well
to the real problems that are that are
arising it's interesting in a kind of an
abstract way that they try to derive
principles of justice from pretty
abstract considerations but when it when
he tried himself to apply it to real
situations it became a recipe for a
liberal democracy internationalism kind
of things that many of us would think
you're fine but they don't really follow
from the theory and there's no real
basis for them that I can see and he
doesn't he didn't try to address the
complex reality of social and economic
life the power system and how it works
so for example you can't study the
United States without recognizing that
there is a very class conscious
unusually class conscious very powerful
business community always fighting a
bitter class war never relentless and
unusually powerful that's one of the
reasons for the difference between the
United States and Europe and you just
can't study the United States without
paying attention to that they have
overwhelming power over the political
system they basically Shrek frame what
happens in the media without just even
introducing that factor you're just not
discussing the country so doesn't matter
what the abstract theories say and there
are other things like that there other
things about the United States which
really have to be considered seriously
it's a very frightened country and
always has been back to colonial days
and some good scholarship on this but
there's a reason why people didn't laugh
when Reagan
strapped on his cowboy boots and said
we're under threat from Nicaragua from
Grenada you know so I'm saying whoever
it's a frightened country and always has
been and you've got to pay attention to
that you know there's a cultural effect
and there are other basic things that
have to be considered if you want to
talk seriously about the country and and
roll's it it just wasn't his interest
and he was synthetic you know it's a
decent liberal but it's not his concern
and the theory doesn't try to reach the
questions like that so I don't seem you
know kind of intellectually interesting
but I don't see much we can do with it
actually I'm personally interested in it
because you may not he kind of played it
down after a lot of criticism but the
model that he used was a linguistic
model very explicitly there was so much
criticism from philosophers who hated it
that he withdrew it but it's recent work
is bringing it back and that was not
uninteresting it was actually following
ideas that human David Hume Express and
that are sort of encanta more or less
but there has to be some instinct will
base for our moral judgments and he
thought he could use models of language
to be suggestive about how to construct
a theory of the instinctual base from
which people can draw indefinitely many
moral judgments and do situations that's
a reasonable framework and there's
actually interesting work going on about
it but it doesn't begin to reach
problems of human concern that's hard I
mean even in the hard sciences
it wasn't until pretty recently that
they had much to say to engineers and
doctors and so on so hard job
