well there are analogies between
language and music and they've been
studying interesting work there's a
Leonard Bernstein actually had a book on
this forgot what it's called there was
rather was the Charles important a late
Martin lectures that gave it Harvard
about twenty years ago or so which he
tried to develop analogies between
language and music there were various
people who were dissatisfied by the way
he did it and tried other ways the
best-known case is a joint work by a
very good linguist great jackendoff than
a modern composer or Fred their adult
Jack and that's also a near professional
musician himself they did a book again
forget the title there darling Jack and
uh which is on some it's actually on
tonal music in the Western tradition and
tries to show that it has character some
characteristics that you also find in
language which is pretty interesting and
you know there could even be a common
origin in fact the same could be true
about mathematics you know like how
people have the ability to do
mathematics is quite a mystery from an
evolutionary point of view I mean it
certainly was no factor in the selection
like you know hunter-gatherer societies
you didn't have more children if he
could prove theorems about prime numbers
there's
it's so it played no role in human in
the evolution of humans because it's
never been evoked by the experience or
whatever so it's some kind of capacity
that's the error but played a no role in
human evolution and that raises the
question what's doing there and one you
know speculation that's been around is
it's some kind of abstraction from the
language faculty that it takes some of
the properties the language faculty
throws that a lot of others and then you
get arithmetic let's say which is not so
crazy as I mentioned this property of
discrete infinity is realized very
sharply and arithmetic and it's true of
natural language and you could conceive
of the idea that maybe it's just the air
because you throw away the rest of the
language faculty and you keep this and
the same could be true of music maybe
some of its structural properties and so
on kind of some kind of abstraction from
the language faculty and maybe that's
way it has some of the same properties
or maybe they have some common origin or
maybe they just develop totally
separately and we don't know why it's
you know it's certainly something one
can look at and people have looked at
it's pretty much pretty obscure
