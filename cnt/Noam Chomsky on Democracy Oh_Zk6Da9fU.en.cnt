... the political system is increasingly operating independently of the people. 
People do not even think their approval is important, let alone reject the decisions. 
They assume that decisions are made independently of whatever they choose in the elections. 
A system in which even affirming decisions is made independent of the people, is a very weak democracy. 
What kind of confirmation are you talking about? 
By affirming, I mean, offering me, the voter, two options. I choose one of the two. 
This is a very limited form of democracy. 
A meaningful democracy means that I also take a role in making those decisions and take a role in the creation of these options. 
This means that these options reflect my active and creative participation. 
Not just me, of course, everyone ... 
This means real democracy. We are far from this. 
There is a problem in capitalist democracies ... It is seen as a problem ... 
... This problem is this: the general population has a method to participate in the decision making process. 
They can be taken into politics. The state cannot stop them, silence them, put them in jail, or keep them away from elections. 
And interestingly, this has always been seen as a problem to overcome. 
It has a name: the democracy crisis. 
Too many people organized and put on public stage. 
This is a crisis. 
Hence, as Walter Lippmann puts it in the 1920s, "production of consent" is necessary. 
We need to make sure that the real decision-making power, in his words, is in the hands of the "specialized class" ... 
... of cunning men. 
They will make the right decisions ... 
We have to put the general population aside. Because they always make mistakes. 
Did you mean by "tossing over"? 
Making them indifferent and obedient. 
Let them take part in the political system as consumers ... 
but not as a real participant. 
Let them approve of decisions made by others. 
But eliminate the methods by which they can train themselves, organize themselves, or take action that affects decision-making. 
The idea is this: leaders control us, not us. 
The doctrines of enlightenment predict that individuals should not be under the influence of the repressive regime established by focused forces. 
Intentions from focused powers; church, state, feudal system, and so on. 
We can imagine a more or less equal population of property white men and not controlled by these special powers. 
But a new kind of power developed in the future: companies ... 
... they created a very intense force on decisions and the economy. 
They started to control what was produced, what was distributed, where to invest. 
That is why the vice-president of the company L **** says "public opinion is cheap thought". 
People's thoughts may have funny ideas about democracy, ... 
... ideas like "we shouldn't be forced to hire ourselves to the owners and organizations of the country". 
It is true democracy that we have our word about what these organizations are doing. 
If we move towards democracy, even an 18-century democracy, ... 
... we can say that there should be no inequality in the distribution of power that determines what is produced, what is distributed, where it is invested. 
These should be of public interest. 
My personal opinion is that if we do not go in this direction, humanity will most likely not survive. 
Why? 
We are now facing the biggest problems in human history. 
Possible nuclear conflict between superpowers, or the proliferation of nuclear weapons, 
Problems such as destroying the fragile environment, ... 
... even though it was obvious that we went to disaster decades ago, we are now beginning to realize it. 
Other problems like this ... 
These problems have reached a more serious point than ever before, because ... 
Why do you think public participation and more democracy are the solution? 
Because more democracy is a value in itself, ... 
... it is not necessary to defend the value of democracy, as it is not necessary to defend the value of freedom. 
Being free, participating, not being under pressure is an essential part of human nature. 
These are self-worth ... 
What do you think will happen if we go this way? 
because the only hope I can see is that other values   come to the fore. 
I mean, if the people are subject to the control of the personal wealth, the people will reflect it, and the only prominent human trait is greed, ... 
... and maximize personal earnings for the sake of spending others. 
A small people with these principles is an ugly people, but it can survive. 
A global people with these principles is on the road to great destruction. 
And we are the last one. 
We need to have a social organizational structure that reflects other values, and I think the inherent values   inherent in people. 
What exactly are you talking about? 
What is a human son? For example, in your family ... there is no such thing as every individual in a family, just for the sake of spending others. 
If there is such a thing, this is a diseased condition. 
If you and I walk on the street and see a child with sugar in his hand, we don't steal his sugar because there is no one who sees us and we're hungry. 
Doing this would be diseased. 
Caring for others, thinking about the needs of others, worrying about the fragile environment that will support future generations are all part of human nature. 
These are parts of human nature that are suppressed by the social and cultural system designed to take care of personal interests. 
I think we should try to remove this pressure. 
Democracy can make this possible. 
It can enable the expression of human needs and values   that are suppressed under the system of personal power and personal interests. 
If true democracy will come to light, if real values   deep in human nature can flourish, 
which I think is necessary to save us, 
People can be together, share their concerns, express their opinions, get answers, ... 
... it is a definite necessity to form groups where they can discover what they think, what they believe and what they value. 
These cannot be loaded from above. 
You have to discover for yourself by trying, trying, practicing. 
And this has to be done with others. 
Moreover, at the center of human nature is being in touch with others, in solidarity and cooperation. 
This can, by definition, only occur with the group structure. 
And if ... 
Political organizations ... 
Political or other ... 
Civil organizations ... 
All types... 
Sub-class associations ... 
There are many ways people can join. 
And a society that I hope to see, where the voluntary organization proliferates, ... 
a society where hierarchy and domination, and the property and control factors that lead to them, are eliminated as much as possible, 
... and being a society where we can manage ourselves and our lives.
