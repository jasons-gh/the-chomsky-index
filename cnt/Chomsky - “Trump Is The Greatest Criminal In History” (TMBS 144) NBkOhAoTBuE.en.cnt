No could I just could we I wanna I just
really want to ask you about the
election professor Chomsky but could you
take a couple of extra minutes and I
just cuz I think what you're saying is
extremely important and sometimes in the
popular conversation things
unfortunately get a bit I don't know
what the what the right way to frame it
is but if if we have an understanding
that America is you know is deeply
corrupt has profound institutional
problems that the structure of
capitalism produces all of these these
outcomes in contrast would say a kind of
mainstream Democratic Party MSNBC
narrative that sort of says a you know
Trump created all of the problems Under
the Sun and everything else now this is
something that particularly younger
people and definitely people in this
audience are going to be very familiar
with this critique and this
understanding and it's a correct one but
I also fear and I really appreciate that
you just highlighted that and I'm
wondering if you could just take a few
extra minutes to explain that even as
that is true structurally that what
Donald Trump is doing institutionally
actually is unique and does matter on
its own terms
quite apart from the sort of evasions of
the Democratic Party and the kind of
mainstream liberal establishment well
Trump is actually this sounds strong but
it's proved he is the worst criminal in
human history undeniably there has never
been a figure in political history who
was dedicated with passion to destroying
the prospects for organized human life
women birth in the near future that is
not an exaggeration people are focused
now on the protests on the pandemic
there the bad no the pandemic is serious
enough we will emerge from that terrible
cost the cost is greatly Apple
by the gangster in the white house and
killed tens of thousands of Americans
will be varying and making this the
worst place in the world in response to
but we will emerge we're not going to
emerge from another crime with trumpets
committee they're heating of the globe
global heating global roasting which was
coming we're not going to emerge from
that both each said it's a very serious
business the ice sheets melting you're
not going to recover but leads to
exponential increase in global warming
[Music]
yet artic glaciers are melting could
flood the world recent studies indicate
that on the present course in about 50
years much of the hobbit hole part of
the world will be unlivable live in
South Asian watch the Middle East
watching the United States sea level
we're approaching the point of 125,000
years ago when sea levels were about 25
feet later than thing right now
it's worse than that recent study by the
top Siam climate scientists concluded
that the Scripps oceanography needs to
just in which monitors particles in the
universe that could Co two particles in
the end as we did the mainland just came
out and studies showing little cousins
steady increase and escalating increase
and they estimated they were coming mom
honestly close to a point three three
million years ago when sea levels were
fifteen feet higher than they are today
no all around the world countries are
trying to do something about some pretty
much enough would be something there's
one country which is led
president who wants to escalate the
crisis to race toward the abyss to
maximize the use of fossil fuels
including the most dangerous of them
than to dismantle the regulatory
apparatus that limits your impact there
is no crime like this in human history
okay
nothing this is a unique individual
that's not that he doesn't know what
he's doing
of course it does so when it comes time
to when his golf course and fireman is
threatened by rising sea levels
he whoever manages things war on those
enough to petition the government of
Ireland to build a seawall because of
rising sea boogie
yes he doesn't care you can pour more
profit into the pockets of his rich
constituency tomorrow than him as well
who cares of the world disappeared in a
couple of generations they can lose
elections of the best minute sir
I should say that as far as the
government is concerned we've seen
something pretty interesting
the parliamentary democracy has been
around for 350 years started named
London 1689 when so-called Glorious
Revolution and sovereignty is
transferred from the loyalty to the
forelimb beginnings of parliamentary
democracy the United States our century
lady it's not parametric democracy is
not just based on laws and constitutions
in fact the British constitution was
maybe a dozen words it's based on trust
and good faith the assumption that
people will act like human means so I
take Richard Nixon very rotten me going
but when the time came he had to leave
office he left office quietly nobody's
expecting that he's drunk he doesn't act
like a human being so somewhere else
call it but something I leave it to the
psychiatrist say what it is but it's
plain that's there and what he has done
is crush the the executive offices
correctly destroyed it doesn't mean make
up appointments that can be confirmed by
the Senate why bother
let's make appointment I don't like
somebody long now
one Republican Museum of cuffs dares to
raise a small question about his
nobility came down and I only had ton of
bricks I'm gonna destroy you
or develop myself destroy me it's not
fascism it's what I said before tin-pot
dictator of some small Neil :
with F news of a couple of years that's
the mentality
we're concerned about vaccines
okay it was a sign chief scientist in
charge of vaccine production needed
raise some questions but one of trumps
quack medicine helped it's the executive
branch is nullified Congress the Senate
happens to be in the hands of a soul
mate of his Mitch McConnell many ways
the real evil genius of this
administration dedicated to destroying
democracy long before Trump when Obama
was elected Senate Majority McConnell
said openly publicly my main goal is to
insure them oh well I can achieve
nothing okay that same I want to destroy
parliamentary democracy which is based
as I said the one good faith and trust
in Turkey but it's me the Senate is no
so called world's greatest deliberative
body to reduce the two things passing
legislation that'll enrich the very rich
and power the corporate sector and
massive Judicial Appointments to stack
the judiciary with young ultra-right
mostly incompetent justices who can
ensure for a generation that no matter
what the public wants they'll be able to
block it this is and it's kind of like
the Republican effort to suppress the
vote keep people from voting all the
rest I mean it's a deeply deep hatred of
democracy and fear of democracy that's
not unusual among elites they don't like
democracy for obvious reasons but this
is something special as I say 350 years
of parliamentary experience they're
really being put to the test that's on
top of the pandemic top of the the
global warming crisis the crisis of
nuclear weapons which is equally severe
Trump is dismantling the entire arms
control regime greatly increasing the
threat of destruction to us virtually
inviting adversaries to develop weapons
that could destroy us can't stop I mean
but of course with great euphoria in
military industry they love it getting
huge contracts what's wrong I mean it's
a unique position but when but you said
as you say it's not just Trump its trunk
taking the worst aspects of the
capitalist and particularly neoliberal
version of capitalism and amplifying
them but you can see it in let's just
take the pandemic why is there a
pandemic
in 2003 after the SARS epidemic which
was a corona virus it was well
understood by scientists and they were
saying another corona virus much more
serious than this is very likely now
here are the steps we have to take to
prepare for somebody has to take the
steps well there is a pharmaceutical
industry extraordinarily wealthy huge
huge loves can't do it capitalism you
don't spend money on something that
might be important ten years from now
from stopping a future catastrophe it's
not profitable we'll do what we can sell
tomorrow so that's a capitalist crisis
they are out what do i government they
have the resources they have great labs
but then comes something like called
Ronald Reagan at the beginning of the
neoliberal assaults on the population
government is the problem not the
solution
meaning we have to take decisions away
from government which has a serious flaw
it's influenced by people now we have to
put them in the hands of unaccountable
private institutions which have no
influence from the public then
everything will be great in the United
States that sometimes called
libertarianism interesting concept but
just get it out of any public influence
just for the rich and powerful that's
the beginning of the neoliberal assault
the end factor at the same time they
both knew just what the grocer advisors
knew what they were doing first step
destroy unions first step for both
because they're the basis main basis for
the public response so we can get rid of
them you've enhanced the destruction of
democracy and the transfer of power to
the very few man I don't have to go
through the details and is what happens
news
but private Big Pharma was out
capitalism governor is out neoliberalism
nevertheless the government could do
something the first Bush each
double-knot established a presidential
scientific advisory council board Obama
called it into office correctly the
first day of his administration asked
them to prepare a pandemic the warning a
reaction system a couple weeks later
they came back with the system was put
in place January 2017 the rhetoric comes
into office first days of his
administration dismantle the whole
system to respond to an endemic started
defunding the Center for Disease Control
every health related aspect of
government year after year eliminated
programs of American scientists in China
working with Chinese scientists to
identify potential coronavirus throats
let's throw it out so when it finally
hit United States was uniquely
unprepared thanks to the record and then
it got worse he refused to reactivate
other countries responded some of them
very well for it quickly he's almost
gone what we under control not the
United States in care for months US
intelligence couldn't get to the White
House say there's a serious crisis we
finally according to reports he noticed
that the stock market was declining from
like that so I have to do something what
he's done since it's just chaos the
United States but again a large part of
the problem is pre true so why aren't
the horse and hospitals ready well they
run on a business model that's
neoliberalism you have to be just on
time delivery you don't want to lose a
cent
so we don't have an extra hospital bed
we have to make sure the owners of the
private
the CEOs of the private hospitals get
the millions of dollars of the year in
compensation if you have an extra bed
which would cut into that
so everything's paired to the bone the
nursing homes which are privately owned
are reduced to minimal functioning
because we can make more money that way
for a private equity corporation that
owns them
now we can contribute to Trump's
campaign so you can have a photo op with
us telling us I'm wonderful you are for
destroying the nursing home killing all
the elderly people that's what we're
living with so yes it goes deep into
issues well before Trump but he's a
unique phenomenon again the worst
criminal in human history some of his
minor crimes are to destroy American
democracy and to create a Penta amplify
epidemic she's killing tens of thousands
of people because of him but those are
minor crimes by his standards you should
recognize him living in a unique moment
of human history
very striking everything's coming
together I'm afraid I alright well
professor Chomsky I think you you
answered the question about voting as we
say strategically in this election I
think you outlined the reasons they're
extremely clearly and I remember
President Trump saying when he cut the
pandemic office he said I don't like to
waste money anyways professor Chomsky
thank you very very much for doing this
and we wish you all the best and stay
stay safe thank you you just watched a
