I am intrigued by the statement that our
biological endowment does not give us
the ability to grow wings and the
observation that it does give us the
ability through a lengthy process of
bootstrapping to build a machine that
has wings of machine that has wings an
airplane we build tools with which we
build more complex tools with which we
build yet more complex tools that
eventually allow us to build an airplane
and I'm left wondering how much of that
process applies in the cognitive domain
to what extent may we be able to build
machines that help us conceive new
machines that help us conceive new
machines and eventually understand
things that as biological organisms
alone we cannot understand what you're
describing is in fact what interested
early modern science so Leonardo da
Vinci conceived of an airplane couldn't
build it at that time but he could
conceive of it oh the thinking of the
early modern revolution Galileo up
through Mouton which is the foundations
of modern science was based on what was
called the mechanical philosophy the
idea that the world is a machine the
universe is a machine the kind of thing
that could be constructed by a master
craftsman and in fact it was constructed
by the ultimately skilled in bastard
craftsmen now that was what lit that was
the fundamental idea of the modern
scientific revolution so Galileo for
example argued that if you can't
construct the machine and machine means
just what you're describing gears levers
and things pushing and pulling each
other and so on if you can't construct
the machine to explain some natural
phenomenon you failed and in fact he
felt at the end of his life that his
scientific career was a failure but
because he was not able to construct the
machine to account for the tides or the
motion of the heavenly bodies and so on
and that goes right through up to Newton
a Newton's great discovery was the world
isn't a machine it's not a machine it
has what we're called are called
elements forces like action at a
distance or repulsion at a distance and
that's not part the machines can't do
that so the amazing discovery is the
world simply isn't a machine the Newton
as I mentioned regard this is a complete
absurdity he never accepted it spent the
rest of his life trying to disprove it
other great scientists of the day
regarded as ridiculous Leibniz Huygens
and so on and for a long time afterwards
the scientists did try to show somehow
that the bucket mechanical science could
account for the world now ultimately
Newton's proofs were rigorous became
scientific common-sense that people gave
up the enterprise and science changed
radically from trying to show that the
world is intelligible to us which was
given up to trying to show that we can
construct theories that are intelligible
to us and that's something quite
different
it's a radical change in the nature of
science that took place it was
understood by Locke and Hume that's why
him and his read his history of England
were as a chapter on Newton you know the
greatest genius who ever appeared he
points out that his great achievement
was to lift the veil from some of the
mysteries of nature but till it showed
that there are other mysteries which we
will never penetrate which turns out to
be correct
science has just changed its objectives
it's lowered them and when you come to
your question we just don't know
can the admittedly there's every reason
to suppose I think that cognitive
capacities are like all other capacities
their biological capacities and it's
just part of the logic of a biological
capacity that if it has any scope at all
it's going to have limits the reason it
has scope is because of some of its
intrinsic properties so we have
intrinsic genetic properties that
determine that from the nutrition of the
cell of the embryo we end up with the
mammalian visual system but by that same
token these same properties tell us that
no matter what the nutrition of the
embryo we're not going to get an insect
visual system scope and limits are
logically related and that actually was
curses insight that I quoted about
abductive principles but he's often
misunderstood so in modern contemporary
philosophy a purses argument
philosophers among you will know is
often interpreted as what's called
inference to the best explanation but
that's not what he said at all what he
discussed was the idea which i think is
plausible that you can't learn or
discover anything unless there's some
initial limitation of the hypothesis
space yeah there has to somehow be
limited to particular hypotheses and in
support of this he discussed the history
of science and he points out that if you
look at scientific revolutions quite
typically when particular circumstances
exist the particularly love
understanding particular problems being
formulated they're often many people who
come to pretty much the same conclusion
some of them to get there first and we
tribute it to them that others are
pretty near and the reason they argued
is that these conditions are are somehow
putting in operation our internal
abductive principles even though
they were we don't know what they are
that limit the hypothesis space so you
explore certain hypotheses and not an
infinite number of others that are
consistent with the evidence and the
same has to be true of learning just
couldn't get off the ground unless the
child's hypothesis space is highly
limited and in fact we're coming to
understand very limited so that gets to
your question how far can our abductive
principles reach and we'll know at a
cyborg reform
