[Music]
welcome to the eighth annual LA Film
Fest I'm Peggy Johnson I'm the executive
director of this nonprofit art cinema
that puts on this festival every year
and I really want to thank you for being
here for this very special night with
noam chomsky this is kind of like a
dream come true for a lot of us so sure
that's why you're here too
I want to start out by thanking our
title sponsor desert diamond casinos and
entertainment they've been loyal
sponsors for years and without their
financial support this wouldn't be
happening so I really want to thank them
we also got a grant from the National
Endowment for the Arts this year for
this festival which is a big deal they
only gave 66 grants in total for film
related things and very few of them are
for just general film festivals so
pretty we're in pretty good company
there and we just found out this week
that they gave us a grant for next year
too so very excited about that I also
really want to thank one of our major
partners which is the College of Social
and Behavioral Sciences they support us
have supported us for a long time
financially but more importantly really
is with their partnership in so many
different things that we do from
journalism on screen on and this I don't
want to even start but for tonight
they're a very special partner because
they arranged for professor Chomsky to
be here tonight so JP Jones is in the
back the Dean and I really want to thank
him and everybody at SPS for their
incredible support we love xbs
our presenting sponsors are the Arizona
in Buffalo exchange the Geico office
which is located next door
Tucson lifestyle and zocalo which
printed our beautiful programs we really
want to thank them and I really want to
take just a minute to thank the staff
who works in this festival because I
think they're extraordinary and the
programming the quality of the films and
the representation that it contains and
everything about the program is so
thoroughly well thought out and I'm so
proud
JJ Giddings and Jeff Yantz are the
co-directors and they've been great
leaders for programming this in really
great fest so I'm proud of them and
everybody who works at the law including
everybody at the theater and the people
that sell your popcorn and your tickets
and the projectionists and everybody I
also really want to thank our volunteers
who are amazing 100 plus our board of
directors several of whom are here and
of course our loyal loft members we
thank you so much we have about 7000 now
so pretty good quickly we're doing a
drawing for two passes to next year's
Film Festival so there's a place in the
lobby you can fill out a form and next
year's gonna be great one of the things
we're going to be doing is going solar
so this entire building will be so
powered by solar and it will include
covered parking so there'll be those two
things to look for so if during the film
you'd be careful to be sure heard of all
your devices are silent and your screens
don't light up we'd appreciate it and if
you take your stuff with you when you
leave that'd be great and make it easier
on the staff and that's all the
housekeeping now I want to introduce the
co-director of the festival and when
he's not doing that the program director
Jeff yawns who will be presenting
professor Chomsky with the lofty
Achievement Award Jeff
Thank You Peggy so welcome everyone
needless to say we are very excited this
is an example of why I love working here
at the law cinema two nights ago we
kicked off the festival with an event
built around the film Revenge of the
Nerds which have shot here in Tucson and
we had Curtis Armstrong the actor who
plays booger here as our guest and then
tonight we have an entirely different
kind of guest it's everything all under
one roof and I love it so tonight we are
honored we're excited and just thrilled
to have the world-renowned author
activist intellectual and movie star
Noam Chomsky with us yep
so in addition to being the founder of
modern linguistics and one of the most
well recognized public intellectuals on
the planet
I like to think of him as an
intellectual rock star we don't have a
lot of those and having appeared in over
25 films he is now also officially a to
Sonnen which i think is it great so now
we've got some really cool people living
here so he of course joined the
University of Arizona faculty this fall
as a laureate professor in the
Department of linguistics in the College
of Social and Behavioral Sciences he
also holds the title of agnese Nelms
Howry chair sponsored by the agnese
Helms Howry program in environmental and
social justice at the U of A and now
he's here at the LA cinema and I can't
wait so would you please give a warm
Tucson welcome to our newest two zonin
Noam Chomsky
so no just before we start having a
little discussion here I just wanted to
present you with this will give you a
bag to carry this home I'm sure out of
all the awards you've won in your career
this is the one that you're waiting for
so in honor of your contributions to
cinema which is why you're here tonight
and of course I think your tireless and
really inspiring efforts to make the
world a better place
and for just being noam chomsky we would
like to dedicate and give you the lofty
Achievement Award for 2017 to Noam
Chomsky yes let's take a picture you
don't actually have to hold it we'll put
it right here thank you very much we
have set aside a place in our new house
exactly for that oh great well thank you
professor Chomsky that's great so so
we're here tonight professor Chomsky to
celebrate the 25th anniversary of
manufacturing consent which of course is
based on your book from 1988
manufacturing consent the political
economy of the mass media which we have
copies of this available in the lobby if
you I can't imagine anyone doesn't
already own this but just in case you
should get a copy and then the film of
course came out in 1992 this is I think
just one of the most important relevant
political documentaries ever made and I
think anyone who feels like fate news is
a modern phenomenon needs to watch this
film so could you talk a little bit
about how the book evolved into the film
I can't really say very much about them
because I was involved in the film about
in the way that the moon is
involved in a photograph of the moon I I
had interviews and discussions with the
producers and they welded it together
and turned it into a film which today
the truth I've never actually seen I
can't I can't stand looking at myself
during myself oh well then you would
hate this film it's all you well it's a
very good film just good it's just so
you know they're very talented producers
yeah so it's mark h-bar and Peter wins
tonight yeah really just a great film so
this movie is so as I mentioned so
incredibly relevant today 25 years on
could you because you talked a little
bit about I guess the book since you
haven't seen the film I have seen the
book yes so could you talk a little bit
about how the ideas the thesis of the
book is relevant to us today in 2017
well actually my co-author ed Herman and
I had worked together for many years
actually our our first book was perhaps
relevant to the film and the on the
actual book was about 1971 I think and
it had an interesting history the book
was published by four rather successful
publishing company that was producing
materials mainly for universities and
the company happened to be a subsidiary
of Warner Brothers now part of Time
Warner pretty soon probably part of
something bigger
and the the one of the executives of
Warner Brothers saw some publicity for
the book and didn't like the fact there
was called counter-revolutionary
violence and you can guess what the
topic was they didn't like it much so he
asked for a copy of the book and when he
looked at it he was appalled and he
ordered the publisher to withdraw all
copies of it and when they refused he
simply put the publisher out of business
literally kind of interestingly there
was not much reaction to this it was
considered legitimate because it's not
an infringement on freedom of speech the
people who speak up for freedom of
speech and that Hentoff ACLU didn't see
any problem it's private enterprise and
of course private enterprise is entitled
to do whatever it likes well that's
actually relevant to the book because
one of the my my co-author is a
professor of Finance at the Wharton
School his main field professional field
is corporate power corporate control
ridden some of the main books on that
and the two of us decided to try to do
an analysis of the factors that enter
into choice and framing of news in the
major media so we neither of us watched
television much so we kept print media
New York Times Washington Post you know
the major media CBS people a few others
there was no CNN in those days the we
one of the factors that we think enters
into determination of the framing
structure choice of news is a simply
ownership these are corporations we
during business their business is to
sell a product to a market like any
corporation the product they sell is you
and they sell it to advertisers to other
big corporations so what you have is a
system structurally which is one of the
major corporations in fact parts of mega
corporations selling people to other
major corporations now that already
suggests what you might anticipate the
character of the product would be it
would meet the needs and demands of the
sellers and the buyers and we then
consider several other factors that
relate to this same issue the closed
interval closed interaction between the
corporate system and state power is
extremely intimate so there's a
reflection of state power and its
propaganda needs and so on and a few
other things and from that we developed
a model of what one would anticipate if
you say we were a Martian looking at
this system what would you anticipate
the media products would be and that's
the first chapter of the book and the
rest is illustrations of how it works
and we picked we tried to we didn't want
to bias the choices so we picked
examples of which the media were most
proud the things that they thought were
their major successes and tried to show
you can look and see if you think the
demonstration is successful that we
tried to show that in fact the
predictions of the model which are quite
simple it's basically a kind of a guided
free market model of the kind that
economists take for granted let's see if
these if these actually were
we have also done the same thing in
quite a few other cases several books on
political economy of human rights
several volumes in which we again
studied the media analysis of different
situations and sought to show that we
asked whether and sought to show that in
fact it informed the same natural
expectations incidentally this is not
really a critique of the media so it's
nothing like the fake news business in
fact in this book manufacturing consent
the last part of the book maybe about a
third is actually defense of the media
from criticism by liberal monitors
Freedom House who have launched a major
assault against the media a couple of
huge volumes and published that they
published trying to show that the media
were unpatriotic and we're responsible
for losing the Vietnam War so what we
did was it go through the probably the
only people ever it was a lot of
publicity for this you know Freedom
House big institution the author was a
famous journalist Peter gray stroke but
but I suspect that we were the only
people to actually take a look at the
two volumes the first volume was the
charges against the media the second
volume was the documentation and when
you go through the documentation you
find it completely refutes the charge
and in fact so it's a kind of defense of
the media but the meat but journalists
hated it
it was first published in an article in
a Journalism Review and journalists were
very upset by it but they didn't like
the whole idea and the what the reason
was what we pointed out was that
contrary to the criticism the
journalists the correspondents
especially the foreign correspondents
were doing a very honest
serious courageous job they deserved a
lot of respect for what they were
discovering and producing however they
were doing it within an ideological
framework which was highly supportive of
state power and ideology it's not so
different from the Ken Burns film that
just came out the idea was the war began
with Anthony Louis put it from the left
began with blundering efforts to do good
we were desperately trying to bring
democracy and freedom to the poor
Vietnamese and unfortunately we failed
so turned out that we had to withdraw
without succeeding in our wonderful and
that was the framework and within that
framework they did an honest job of
describing what was going on and they
hated it because what they wanted they
want to be perceived as courageous
Crusaders opposing power and ideology
not as serious honest professionals
doing the job their own job within an
unquestioned framework of subordination
to ideology of course the war never
started with blundering efforts to do
good it started with quite purposeful
and understanding efforts to prevent
independence and freedom for a former
French colony that where the u.s. took
over the imperial role and in fact the
truth of the matter is it wasn't a lost
war the u.s. succeeded in its major
objectives we're at Hermon and I are
maybe almost alone and arguing this but
I think it's correct if you look back at
the original objectives we have now a
ton of internal documents that have come
out Pentagon Papers and others
it was pretty much what you'd expect
it's the normal imperial commitment was
put pretty well by Henry Kissinger not
my favorite person that he says some
things quite accurately now what he said
what he pointed out is that a leading
principle of policy must be to detect
viruses that might spread contagion and
destroy the virus and prevent contagion
from spreading the virus is independent
nationalism that might succeed and the
contagion is others might be in similar
situations might be tempted to follow it
so what do you do when you have a virus
that's going to spread contagion and
destroy the virus
you inoculate the potential victims the
way to do it is by instituting a vicious
and brutal dictatorships which will
repress any threat that the thought of
into successful independence might
spread and the u.s. did that very
successfully Indochina was destroyed not
a model for anyone not going to spread
anything the surrounding region the u.s.
succeeded in installing murderous
dictatorships in every relevant country
Thailand and Philippines the great
success was Indonesia that was
considered the major concern Vietnam
itself nobody cared much about but
Indonesia had rich resources and in 1965
magnificent event took place there was a
military coup supported backed by the
United States you helped implement it
which carried out what the New York
Times called a staggering mass slaughter
Time magazine devoted an entire issue to
the boiling blood bath which was praised
because you read the main liberal call
to the New York Times James Reston he
called that a gleam of light in Asia and
the editors of the times appraised the
US government for keeping its own role
in implementing the staggering mass
slaughter quiet not making it public so
that the Indonesian moderates as they
called them who carried out this great
achievement would be able to get full
credit for it without having to any
indication that they were really just
being helped manipulated by the United
States that was the general reaction at
the time it's quite interesting that
just recently you may have seen
government archives were released some
government archives on the US role in
the indane massacre and it was reported
in the press pretty adequately with one
crucial exception they didn't mention
the fact that they knew all the time
right at the beginning that the u.s.
government was directly involved and
they praised it they thought it was
wonderful because this ended the threat
that the contagion might spread in fact
the McGeorge Bundy who was national
security advisor for Kennedy and Johnson
later in retrospect argued that the
Vietnam War should probably even ended
in 1965 when this massacre took place
because by then the goals have been
achieved that's the story it's not the
story you get in the media it's not the
story again in n burns as documentary so
the picture is that the journalists on
the scene are serious honest courageous
professionals that working hard taking
real chances discovering all sorts of
things giving us a very valuable news
not fake news but doing it within
framework of ideological subordination
which is quite extraordinary
and we tried to show that in case after
case so it's not really a critique of
the media it's an analysis of how a
society that is permeated with intensive
propaganda internalizes and perceives
the events of the world and incidentally
the United States attend is rather
different in the way it perceives these
things from other countries so one thing
that you haven't read in the American
press is that there are international
polls taken by the leading US polling
agencies Gallup polls which ask all
sorts of questions about the
international opinion and one of the
questions they ask is which country is
the greatest threat to world peace guess
what the answer is in fact nobody else
is even close way behind and second
place was Pakistan and that was inflated
by the Indian vote and the countries
that we call the major threat to world
peace like Iran were barely even
mentioned but that's just the world and
there's no reason why people here should
know anything about that
so that's not the kind of news that's
fit different just like the reasons for
the invasion of Vietnam and the basic
success in achieving the fundamental
goals but I think that's what we that's
what we investigated in a pretty wide
range of cases
what's interesting reading reviews of
the book from the time the word
conspiracy theorist was thrown around a
lot went to me it seemed like a very
fair and balanced look so how did you
and how do you respond to those kind of
critiques well I would ask suppose that
General Motors is trying to make a
profit next year and they make plans and
it
side with the produce and they produce
advertisements and so on is that a
conspiracy I mean it's the normal
workings of a a player and a state
capitalist system that's exactly what
we're saying the media same kind of
conspiracy as General Motors when they
try to make profit now the book and the
movie came out pre-internet era
certainly and you've written and talked
a lot about the internet but could you
just talk a little bit about social
media and how it relates to the ideas
and manufacturing consent I mean it
feels like read an unprecedented time
where we have perceived access between
the higher and the lower through social
media the idea that our president would
engage in a Twitter war with a teenager
from Des Moines seems unthinkable five
years ago actually it's very thinkable
for those of you who are old enough may
remember the first the first George Bush
his campaign his vice presidential
candidate was Dan Quayle and in the many
of you may remember this in the middle
of the campaign there was a sitcom that
was being shown called was called it was
about some woman named Murphy Brown and
Murphy Brown mates in the sitcom made
some comment the critical of Bush and
quail and Quayle responded to her and
then the producers figured okay this is
great we can exploit this so they
rewrote the series so that Murphy Brown
then responded the band Quayle and he
picked it up and responded to her and
there was a big battle going on between
and for the president vice presidential
candidate and a sitcom character
I happen to be in Europe at the time
people couldn't believe so it's not a
new phenomenon yeah so so does social
media give us more access to those
empowers that just an illusion
do you think social media has personal
internet does provide us with in
principle access to many different
sources of news and information so you
can for example read say correspondence
from the in the Middle East to publish
in the London independent you can read
what the Iranian press how they
interpret to the events of the world you
can listen to the pick up the Russian
press and Russian media you can see what
they think about things so there are
there is a diversification of
information but it doesn't fundamentally
change the basic sources that we have
the social media provide valuable means
for people to provide and present their
opinions to interact with others to
debate concrete discussions and it can
it sometimes is very healthy and
productive but there's a negative side
which has been well discussed that tends
to create political you know bubbles in
which people basically go to a range of
media which have reinforced their own
views and in fact that is a major source
of conspiracy theories that explode and
develop well you may have noticed today
I think and they press there was a
report of the reaction of to the to the
massacre in the church and immediately
before anything was discovered
the social media were putting out
material saying that it was a Muslim who
was working for Isis when it turned out
that he was a white man who lived in a
near community they changed the support
of the idea that they changed it - he
was a recent convert to Islam and this
was seeing these this things were put
out and you know repeated and you get
them somebody else repeats them and they
reach a huge number of people and these
are often people who just don't look at
anything else in fact there was a
startling poll taken recently by one of
the leading polling agencies you may
have been pew who asked simply just
asked Republicans alone not Trump
supporters Republicans what their what
news source did they trust most of
course the mainstream media were way
down at the bottom Fox News was a little
higher but the one they trusted
completely was Trump so does anything he
says has gotta be true and if it's even
if Fox News doesn't accept that that
means they just know what they're doing
and that's the kind of extreme sort of
consequence that can follow from the
creation of self reinforcing bubbles and
people on the left are not immune to
that either you tend to go to your own
sources and you don't need other
opinions so I think it's both got a it's
got a positive side it's been I mean all
of us use it and should in fact but
there are downsides as well however as
far as the now that the structural
analysis is given in the book what we
called the propaganda model I don't
think it affects it at all we have the
same major sources of
news and information they're pretty much
subject I think to the same constraints
and conditions which are just part of
the nature of the institutions do you do
you think that an ongoing issue is the
issue we have with media literacy in the
United States in terms of teaching
children from a very early age were
saturated with media right out of the
womb practically how to be critical
thinkers about what they're seeing and
reading and consuming well you know I
don't think it's so much
I think it's media illiteracy people
just younger people just aren't reading
the the level the amount of the acts I
can remember as a child you know first
of all in those days back in the 1930s
the newspapers came twice a day you read
the morning newspaper you met the
evening newspaper they came from
different attitudes and opinions of
people discussed that working people
were immersed in the media you go back
further they had their own media there
was a range of opinions this was just
part of the part of life was to be
immersed in media political discussion
analysis and so on that's pretty much
disappeared
I think forget the exact figures but a
very high percentage of young people get
their news from Facebook not from the
not from the media and that's serious
yeah it's really frightening you had a
great anecdote last night at the
Centennial Hall discussion where you
talked about researching fascism when
you were in the fourth grade
okay so you're obviously at a child who
was interested in the world around him
and maybe that's part of it getting
children interested and what's happening
I think children are naturally
interested in what's happening but
they have you have to make sure not to
stifle and suppress that interest I
think that's the real threat not there's
no need to encourage curiosity among
children anybody who's had any
experience with children know that
they're infinitely curious they are
asking questions all the time one of
those things won't understand things and
unfortunately a good part of the
cultural and educational system is
geared to restraining and controlling
and suppressing those natural impulses
and they should be stimulated so being
interested in the rise of fascism in
1939 1938 was not all that surprising as
a fourth grader it doesn't kind of blew
my mind
so we're already kind of having to wind
this down but I just because we're in a
cinema and we're giving you the lofty
Achievement Award I just want to ask you
a little something about movies I've
seen you here a couple of times just
watching movies at the loft so I I feel
like maybe you're a fan of film well my
wife and I very much like to watch films
when we have time but the problem is
finding that thought and so we're we're
hoping to become regular attenders at
the loft so you'll see us around
[Music]
and are you are you able to just relax
and watch a film for entertainment are
you always thinking about how the
ideologies being constructed through the
narrative and anything but in fact my
wife has introduced me into cinema
genres that I didn't know about before
which are a lot of fun and so then so my
final my final question is do you have a
favorite movie
well there's one movie that I did States
it through twice couldn't city lights
Charlie Chaplin's yes and I've watched
it again since I thought that was is one
of the greatest closing shots of a film
ever oh yeah yes if anyone's seen it
they know hmm
and did you see Captain Fantastic by any
chance actually we haven't we we came
close
we had a plans to do it but actually
yeah I'm ever will wondered and
understand this we were we met a close
friend of all of us Mars Halliday and we
were going to go out to see the film but
we just got involved in a discussion
NeverWet for those of you haven't seen
it the characters celebrate noam chomsky
day instead of Christmas and it's great
his brain spine which we should all be
celebrating hometowns today
Thank You Noam Chomsky thank you
everyone for coming
