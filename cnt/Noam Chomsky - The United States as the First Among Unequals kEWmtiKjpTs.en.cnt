you actually have a really interesting
expression i'd like you to elaborate on
you talk about the United States being
the first among the unequals this one or
should we talk about what that means
well particularly since if if you go
back to the late 19th century the United
States had by far the biggest economy in
the world well beyond other industrial
economies combined to go through the
20th century the major events like the
world wars were devastating for
industrial rivals and very beneficial to
the United States during the Second
World War
u.s. industrial production actually
quadrupled well other industrial
societies were smashed at the end of the
war the United States was at a level of
power that had never been imagined in
history half the world's wealth total
security before the hemisphere of the
ocean is the opposite sides other
industrial societies were devastated or
seriously weakened and of course that
couldn't last other societies
reconstructed the world became more
diverse over time but it was a still way
above others in terms of advantages
remarkably that does not translate into
quality of life so if you look at the
tech the ovc the rich countries the OECD
countries is 31 the u.s. ranks near the
bottom in social justice poverty
inequality that ranks alongside of
Greece and Turkey the rich other rich
countries and a lot of this has to do
with internal policies which maintain
military superiority
so in military terms the u.s. is far
away
I would say beyond anyone else
in other respects which is a critical
fact about American society which is
crucial for Americans but also for the
world
because of us power you also refer to
the introduction the ability of the
United States shaped global discourse
and the terms in which politics are
debated you elaborate on that well given
its power the u.s. in the-- has an
enormous effect on determining what
international policies will be but it's
limited in fact in the 1940s already the
u.s. suffered a very serious blow to its
global hegemony 1949 China became
independent is an interesting phrase for
that in u.s. discourse it's called the
loss of China which presupposes that of
course me on the world and if China
becomes independent we've lost it and
loss of China became an issue in u.s.
domestic politics and culture you know
it's the source of McCarthyism who was
responsible for the loss of China it
immediately drove the United States to
support the French in their effort to
reconquer Indochina it was fear the loss
of Indochina goes all the way through to
get to the Kennedy one of Kennedy's
concerns about Vietnam was even want to
be responsible for the loss of Indochina
and that runs right to the present and
since then other things have been lost
you know that's ten or fifteen years
there's been a really remarkable change
in world affairs with the lots of Latin
America Latin America it used to be the
backyard did whatever we said we didn't
like it had a military coup put her back
on the will be in courts by now the u.s.
is practically being thrown out of the
hemisphere the
trip to Cuba's presented here as a noble
effort to help Cuba out of its isolation
bring democracy and freedom exactly the
opposite it was undertaken because the
government realized that if they don't
accept the Latin American demand that
you would be readmitted into the
hemisphere the US will be throwing up
that's a major challenge if you look at
the Middle East the u.s. kind of took
over from Britain and for a long time
pretty much determined what happened
longer it's a loss to know so there's an
enormous power and in fact if you look
at the recent military engagements for
the first time everyone has been a
defeat people talk about the war in
Vietnam as being a defeat but that's
really a mistake the u.s. did achieve
its major goals Iraq was totally
different totall defeat at the end of
the war like 2007 ended the Bush
administration when it was pretty clear
what the dimensions of the defeat were
the Bush administration did formally
announced the war games that hadn't done
it before before that it was rhetoric
about democracy and so on the war aims
were that the US must maintain military
bases right at the heart of the world's
energy producing regions and there must
be preferential treatment for US
corporations in access to directing
resources they lost both the winner of
the war was the Iran
for this total devastation and the say
mr. Wilson was supposed to be a great
achievement source for the flow of arms
and to hidings to the Middle East but
particularly to West Africa which is no
the major locus of global terror and
also it became a funnel for Africans to
flee to Europe that's what's called the
refugee crisis which are you're
unwilling to face the fact that we would
want to face the fact that when people
flee from Central America totally
smashed up the society all of these are
indications of the way in which enormous
military power does not translate into
determining the course of world events
it often does and often in quite
dangerous ways so to pick the end the
end of the Cold War the collapse of the
Soviet Union there were two visions as
to how the post-soviet world should
evolve one was this barber charts there
should be a Eurasian security system
with several centers of Brussels Moscow
on Corrado may be ultimately integrated
somehow China that was one and both
military pacts NATO and the Warsaw Pact
should resolve because the consequence
of the US had it differently
NATO should expand and
Russell should be subordinate to it and
it happened right away during the bush 1
administration when this was happening
that NATO already expanded to East
Germany the contrary to verbal promises
beyond but now it's right off to the
Russian border this is the first time
since the Nazis that foreign forces have
been right at the hostile forces right
at the Russian border a couple of years
ago you know formally requested Ukraine
to join NATO which is would be
intolerable to any Russian leader if
Gandhi was running Russia it wouldn't be
able to accept it it's right there
Jewish refugees Heartland and quite
apart from the star connections and so
on so and this does it the u.s. is
getting its way but at the cost of
raising tensions which could very well
lead to a thermal nuclear war both sides
Russia and the United States are
building up their forces acting
aggressively we know from the historical
record that war has almost broken out
repeatedly the record is actually
shocking new cases are constantly being
discovered so just a couple of months
ago for example it was discovered that
in 1979 the u.s. automated detection
systems would make hundreds of errors
detected a major Russian missile attack
against the United States and was taken
seriously enough so that the virginity
National Security Adviser
was literally on the phone ready to call
President Carter to launch a strike when
the information came in that it was
another one of the hundreds of errors
that's happened over and over the idea
of playing with fire with this
catastrophic consequence likely it's
just beyond belief I mean if some
Marshall were looking at us so yes
here's the case with you it didn't get
its way in fact the mission of you might
ask when NATO exists at all all of its
history it was there to defend Western
Europe from the Russian whores okay no
rush record what happens they don't
expend but nominee expands but it got a
global mission it's official mission is
to control the global energy system
sea lanes and so on and he says it
basically to act as a us-run
intervention force this is so the u.s.
is capable than many respects of getting
its way often which is pretty harmful
