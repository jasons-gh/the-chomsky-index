years and it showed that it was poll of
the population not the dictators and it
showed that indeed there were some of
them did the fear I ran at 10%
in contrast 77% regarded the US as the
major threat to the region and 88%
regarded Israel as the major threat in
fact antagonism the US policy was so
extreme that a majority 57%
I thought the region would be better off
if Iran had nuclear weapons
well those polls I don't think we're
even reported in the United States they
certainly were not mentioned and all of
the excited reporting about how the
Arabs support our attitude toward Iran
and it's the guiding principle again as
long as the dictators support us or we
think they do and as long as not much is
happening everything is fine it's quite
striking that this was accepted he's
kind of expected in the Diplomatic
Service in the State Department but it
was also in media reporting and public
commentary pretty much across the
spectrum the liberal commentators too as
far as I could tell and again the polls
I don't think we're going to report it
well perhaps the most serious case of
all of these is Pakistan that's no big
secret that the population in Pakistan
has is now stridently and radically
anti-american huge percentage been
increasing over the years the WikiLeaks
cables have interesting material about
that now they revealed that the
ambassador ambassador Patterson has been
regularly informing Washington that by
expanding the Afghan war into Pakistan
as we've been doing and by pressing the
Pakistani army to attack the tribal
areas and by drone
and so on all of this is in flamin
public opinion even further it's also
strengthening the radical Islamists who
are now a very serious threat to the
country it's even raising the threat
that Pakistan's nuclear weapons huge
supply of nuclear weapons which
incidentally were built with the help of
the Reagan administration it's raising
the fear that these might fall into the
hands of radical Islamists and that's
the ultimate nightmare now but we must
continue we can continue on the present
course keeping to the guiding principles
and facing the consequences of fomenting
terror crashing our own economy
inspiring hatred among oppressed
populations that sooner or later are
likely to explode as is happening right
now before our eyes and with
consequences that could be very severe
the quite severe in Egypt but in
Pakistan extremely severe then elsewhere
too but if we decide to pursue this
course we should at least do it with
eyes open well let me turn to the
domestic scene throughout American
history there has been a constant
struggle over who should control and who
should obey the founding fathers were
quite ambivalent about democracy even
democracy for the narrow sector of
people who they felt should participate
namely free men no women no slaves it's
worth remembering that the first
revolution in the hemisphere that
brought about a society of free men not
women but free men that was in 1804 in
Haiti that one of the reasons why Haiti
was so feared
repressed by the United States which was
terrified that this might spread same
with Europe but then still is up to the
present moment the but not here here it
was supposedly of democracy for freemen
and a limited democracy at James Madison
who was the main framer of the
Constitution as you know he was
concerned that if voters could determine
policy then the majority would challenge
privilege and they would insist on
policies in the interests of the large
majority of the population and that's
unacceptable so he therefore framed the
constitutional order so that power
should be in the hands of the Senate
that's the way it was set up under the
Constitution the executive was an
administrator power was in the hands of
the Senate the Senate according to
Madison as he explained in the debates
of the Constitutional Convention
they said the Senate represents the
wealth of the nation the more capable
set of men who have respect for property
owners and their rights and understand
that the primary the primary task of the
government I'm quoting him is to protect
the minority of the opulent against the
majority well in order to ensure this
outcome sent the Senate was given the
most power and Senators were given
six-year terms and they were elected by
legislators so they'd be under control
remember it wasn't until a century later
in the under the 17th amendment more
than a century that under a very
substantial popular pressure direct
election of senators was established
with the 17th amendment is and now quite
interestingly the far right
supporters of unhindered the corporate
power
are talking about rescinding the 17th
amendment so put power backward belongs
in the hands of the property and their
rights people who know how to protect
the minority of the opulent against the
majority Madison to his credit very
quickly perceived that this system that
he had established was seriously
undermining his own principles of
justice and freedom just a couple of
years later in 1792 he lamented him
quoting him about the daring depravity
of the times as the stock jobbers that's
our Wall Street are becoming the tools
and tyrant of government bribed by arts
largesses and over owning it by clamor
and combinations that he could be
describing what's happening right now
the words apply quite precisely a little
less literary Flair but exactly right
the struggle for popular democracy that
continued after the Constitution it's
actually it's always been particularly
in through the central 19th century and
on it's always been in the labor
movement which was at the forefront and
it's a it's been a core element we might
remember that or discover if we don't
know it already that in the mid 19th
century American workers regarded wage
labor as essentially the same as chattel
slavery differing only and that it was
temporary that was the banner under
which northern workers fought the Civil
War
eliminate all slavery chattel slavery in
wage labor in fact that was such a
popular idea that it was a slogan of the
Republican Party and Abraham Lincoln
there was at the time a very lively Free
Press actually that's the period of the
most exuberant and lively Free Press in
American history included a labor press
which was written and produced by
workers in factories that many of them
women from the farms who were called the
factory girls they condemned what they
called the new spirit of the age
this is 1850 the new spirit of the age
gained wealth for getting all but self
sound familiar and the reduction of
working people to I'm quoting it now to
a state of servitude under the
domination of a moneyed aristocracy
hanging over us like a mighty Avalanche
threatening annihilation to every man
who dares to question their right to
enslave and oppress the poor and
unfortunate the owners and managers the
labor press also condemned what it
called the bought priesthood of the
media the universities the intellectual
class apologists for power who sought to
justify the despotism that was
strengthening its grip and demeaning and
the demeaning value is that it upheld
they also held quoting again that those
who work and the mills should own them
these are ideas that became the rallying
cry of the organized labor movement in
the late 19th century including some
more conservative elements and have a
lot of significance for today right now
the government or corporate alliance as
you're aware is closing plants that
could be converted to production of
things that the country badly needs like
for example high-speed rail or green
technology but for that to happen it
would be necessary to recover the
Democratic spirit of working people of
the 19th century which was renewed in
the 1930s with very significant effects
battered by bitter class war since then
well it actually if you look back over
the history it was no small task to
drive these ideas out of people's heads
probably not very far below the surface
and also to beat down the democratizing
forces of the labor movement the United
States for all kind historical reasons
happens to have an unusually
class-conscious business class and not
by accident we also happen to have a
very violent labor history hundreds of
American workers were being killed by
security forces and labor actions and
well into the late 1930s that nothing
similar had been taking place in Europe
throughout the century and Europe also
unions were far more solidly established
along with parliamentary Labour Party's
that disparity is once again quite great
and much to the detriment of American
society in my opinion well despite the
reliance on violence by the time of the
first world war the business classes
that were coming to realize that so much
freedom had been won by popular struggle
that it was becoming impossible to
control the public by force they
recognized around the first world war
that new means had to be devised in
order to control the public to maintain
that guiding principle and the new means
that they devised were control of
opinion and attitudes and diversion of
the population away from the political
arena this is all very self conscious
incidentally read all about it in the
business
Chris that's when the public relations
industry now a huge industry
now that's when it began to develop in
the two freest societies in the world
written in the United States where the
problem was greatest the goals were very
explicit you know read some of them the
goals were to engineer consent of the
masses so that the intelligent minority
could rule without disturbance by
ignorant than meddlesome Outsiders that
is the population their role is to be
spectators not participants in action
these Outsiders must be fed necessary
illusions and emotionally potent
oversimplifications in order to keep
them under control sham quoting I'm not
quoting from the right these are leading
progressive intellectuals Wilson
Roosevelt Kennedy liberals Edward
Bernays it was one of the founders of
the public relations industry walter
Lippmann who was the most prominent
public intellectual of the 20th century
the distinguished moralist Reinhold
Niebuhr is called the theologian of the
liberal establishment
incidentally Obama's favorite
philosopher he's told us if you move
over a late opinion was similar across
the spectrum and it's naturally much
harsher as you move to the right and the
similarity to the that comes to debates
in the Constitutional Convention is
quite evident also the similarity to the
MOR doctrine that the u.s. is applying
and the dictatorships that it supports
well the business press
