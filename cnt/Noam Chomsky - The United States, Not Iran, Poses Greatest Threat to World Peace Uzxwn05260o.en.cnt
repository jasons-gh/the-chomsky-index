um this is democracy now
democracynow.org the war and peace
report I'm Amy Goodman as we spend the
hour with MIT professor author activists
political dissident Noam Chomsky over
the weekend he spoke to a packed
audience at the new school here in New
York City the former Republican Party
has now become a radical insurgency
that's abandoned in parliamentary
politics and quoting two highly
respected very conservative political
commentators Thomas Mann and Norman
Ornstein of the right-wing American
Enterprise Institute and in fact they
may succeed in increasing sanctions and
even secondary sanctions on other
countries and carry out other actions
that could lead Iran to opt out of the
deal with the United States with the
United States that is that however need
not mean that the agreement is nullified
contrary to the way it's sometimes
presented here
it's not a u.s. Iran agreement it's an
agreement between Iran and what's called
p5 plus one of the five veto holding
members of the Security Council plus
Germany and the other participants might
agree to precede Iran as well they would
then join China and India which have
already in finding ways to evade the
u.s. constraints on interactions with
with Iran and in fact if they do they'll
join the large majority of the world's
population of the non-aligned movement
which all along has vigorously supported
Iran's right to pursue its nuclear
programs as a member of the nvt but
remember that they're not part of the
international community so when we say
the international community opposes
Iran's policies or the international
community does some other thing that
means the United States and anybody else
who happens to be going along with so we
can dismiss them if others continue to
honor the deal which could happen the
United States will be isolated from the
world which is not an unfamiliar
position that's also the background for
the other element of Obama's what's
called Obama's legacy his other main
foreign policy achievement the beginning
of normalization of relations with Cuba
on Cuba the United States has been
almost totally isolated for decades if
you look say at the annual votes in the
UN General Assembly on the US embargo
they're rarely reported but that the
u.s. essentially votes alone the last
one Israel joined but of course Israel
and violates the embargo they just have
to join because have to join with the
master occasionally the Marshall Islands
are allowed or someone else joins and in
the hemisphere the United States has
been totally isolated for years
the main hemispheric conferences have
foundered because the United States will
simply not join the rest of the
hemisphere in the major issues that are
discussed last one in Colombia the two
major issues were admitting Cuba into
the hemisphere US and Canada refused
everyone else agreed and the u.s. drug
war which is devastating Latin America
and the
want to get out of it but the US and
Canada don't agree that's actually the
background for Obama's a great
acceptance of steps towards
normalization of relations with Cuba
another hemispheric conference was
coming up Panama and if the United
States had not made that move it
probably would have been thrown out of
the hemisphere
so therefore Obama made what's called
your noble gesture courageous moved and
Cuba's isolation although in reality it
was u.s. isolation that was the
motivating factor so if the United
States ends up being almost a
universally isolated in Iran that won't
be anything particularly new and in fact
there are quite a few other cases well
in the case of Iran the reasons for us
concerns are very clearly and repeatedly
articulated Iran is the gravest threat
to world peace we hear that regularly
from high places
government officials commentators others
in the United States there also happens
to be a world out there and it has its
own opinions it's quite easy to find
these out from standard sources like the
main US polling agency Gallup polls
takes regular polls of international
opinion and one of the questions that
posed as posed is which country do you
think is the gravest threat to world
peace
the answer is unequivocal of the United
States by a huge margin way behind in
second place is Pakistan it's inflated
surely by the Indian vote and then
a couple of others Iran is mentioned but
along with Israel and a few others way
down that's that's one of the things
that it wouldn't do to say and in fact
the results that are found by the
leading US polling agency didn't make it
through the portals of what we call the
Free Press but it doesn't go away for
that reason well given the reigning
doctrine about the gravity of the
Iranian threat we can understand the
virtually unanimous stand that the
United States is entitled to react with
military force that unilaterally of
course if it claims to detect some
Iranian departure from the terms of the
agreement
so again picking an example virtually at
random from the national press
considered the leader tutorial last
Sunday in the Washington Post it calls
on Congress on quote to make clear that
mr. Obama or his successor will have
support for immediate US military action
if an Iranian attempt to build a bomb is
detected meaning by the United States so
the editors again make it clear that the
United States is exceptional
it's a rogue state indifferent to
international law and conventions
entitled to resort to violence at will
but the editors can't be faulted for
that stand because it's almost Universal
among the political class in this
exceptional nation although what it
means is again one of those things that
it wouldn't do to say sometimes the
doctrine takes quite a remarkable form
and not just on the right by
any means so take for example the
Clinton doctrine namely the United
States is free to resort to unilateral
use of military power even for such
purposes as to ensure inhabited
uninhibited access to key markets energy
supplies and strategic resources little
own security or alleged humanitarian
concerns and adherence to this doctrine
is very well confirmed in practice as
need hardly be discussed among people
willing to look at the facts of current
history
well the Washington Post editors also
made clear why the United States should
be prepared to take such extreme steps
in its role of international primacy if
the United States is not prepared to
resort to military force they explain
then Iran may and quoting Iran may
escalate its attempt to establish
hegemony over the Middle East by force
that's what the president President
Obama calls Iran's aggression which we
have to contain for those who are
unaware of how Iran has been attempting
to establish the Germany over the Middle
East by force or might even dream of
doing so the editors do give examples
two examples its support for the Assad
regime and for Hezbollah well I won't
insult your intelligence by discussing
this demonstration that Iran has been
seeking to establish hegemony over the
region by force
however on Iran Ian's aggression
there is an example I think one in the
last several hundred years namely
Iranian conquest of two Arab islands in
the Gulf under the us-backed regime of
the Shah back in the 1970s
well these shocking Iranian efforts to
establish regional hegemony by force can
be contrasted with the actions of US
allies for example NATO ally Turkey
which is actively supporting the jihadi
forces in Syria support is so strong
that it appears that Turkey helped its
allies in the illness run the Al
qaeda-affiliated on this road front to
kill and capture the few dozen fighters
that were introduced into Syria by the
Pentagon a few weeks ago it's the result
of several years and who knows how many
billions of dollars of training they did
enter and were immediately captured or
killed apparently with the aid of Syrian
Turkish intelligence
well more important than that is the
central role of the leading US ally
Saudi Arabia for the jihadi rebels in
Syria and Iraq and more generally for
Saudi Arabia having been quoting a major
source of financing to rebel and
terrorist organizations since the 1980s
that's from a study recent study by the
European Parliament repeating what's
well-known and still more generally the
missionary zeal with which Saudi Arabia
promulgates its radical extremist
Wahhabi Salafi doctrines by establishing
Quranic schools mosques sending radical
clerics throughout the Muslim world with
enormous impact
one of the closest observers of the
region Patrick Coburn writes that the
wahhabis ation by Saudi Arabia the
wahhabis ation of mainstream Sunni Islam
is one of the most dangerous
developments of our era always with
strong us support these are all things
that wouldn't do to mention along with
the fact that these pernicious
developments are a direct outgrowth of
the long term tendency of the United
States picking up from Britain before to
support radical Islam in opposition to
secular nationalism these are
long-standing commitments other others
like UN Ambassador Samantha power who
condemn Iran's destabilization of the
region that destabilization is an
interesting concept of political
discourse so for example when Iran comes
to the aid of the government of Iraq and
Iraqi Kurdistan in defense against the
assault of Isis that's destabilization
and we have to prevent it if not
aggression
perhaps in contrast when the United
States invades Iraq kills a couple
hundred thousand people generates
millions of refugees destroys the
country sets off a sectarian conflict
that's tearing Iraq and by now the whole
region to shreds and on the side
increases terrorism worldwide by a
factor of seven just in the first year
that's stabilization part of our
imperial mission that we must continue
for the benefit of the world
actually the exceptionalism of US
doctrinal
stitute is that quite wondrous to behold
well going on with the Washington Post
editors they join Obama's negotiator
Obama's Clinton negotiator Dennis Ross
Thomas Frieden and other notables in
calling on Washington to provide Israel
with b-52 bombers and perhaps even the
more advanced b-2 bombers and also huge
what are called massive ordnance
penetrator
bunker busters and formally that there's
a problem they don't have air strips for
huge planes like that but they can use
maybe turkeys air strips and none of
this is for defense these are not
defensive weapons remember all of these
weapons are offensive weapons for Israel
to use to bomb Iran if it chooses to do
so and you know since Israel's a US
client it inherits from the master the
freedom from international law so
nothing surprising about giving it vast
supplies of offensive weapons to use
when it chooses well the violation of
international law goes well beyond
threat goes to action including acts of
war which are proudly proclaimed and
presumably because that's our right as
an exceptional nation again one example
is the successful sabotage of Iranian
nuclear installations by cyber war the
Pentagon has views about cyber war the
Pentagon regards cyber war as an act of
war which justifies a military response
and a year ago NATO
ferm the same position determined that
aggression through cyberattacks
can trigger the collective defense
obligations of the NATO alliance meaning
if any country is attacked by cyber war
the whole Alliance can respond by
military attacks that means cyber war
attacks against us not by us against
them and the significance of these
stands is again something that it
wouldn't do at a mansion and you can
check to see that that condition is well
observed
