you go to the right wing as much harsher
if you haven't done it I urge you to
take a look on the internet at very
significant that memorandum by lewis
powell powell was corporate lobbyists
later appointed the Supreme Court by
Richard Nixon and he wrote a very
important memorandum very influential
member and and I think 1971 which he
wrote actually to the chamber of
commerce the main business lobby and
what he told the chamber of commerce is
he said the entire free enterprise
system the basis of our Liberty is under
attack the universities the media the
government have all been taken over
literally is very paranoid but it
reflects the attitude they've been taken
over by left-wing extremists who are
going to destroy our freedoms it's a
little bit like listening to MIT Romney
and the rest of them today the only
choices he said are between freedom free
enterprise or bureaucratic regulation of
our lives by the state and they're
winning they've taken over everything
they're destroying free enterprise he
said the businessmen he said are the
group that have the least influence in
the country on government on the economy
and everything else and he said we've
got to do something to mobilize and the
core part was the universities the
institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young he said
after all we the business world have the
resources and we have the money you know
we fund them that we paid on weird that
what's now called job creators don't
mean profit creators and so we have the
money so we've got to mobilize and
organize and do something about it and
right at that point this kind of common
conception across the spectrum that did
lead to many significant changes which
you're living in right now so takes a
student with that depth is now as you
no over over trillion dollars that's
more than credit card debt and it's
phenomenal well that's a virtual way of
dealing with the failure of the
institutions responsible for
indoctrination of the young you come out
of college with a heavy debt
you're trapped that's the rest of your
life maybe you wanted to be say a public
interest lawyer when you way into
Harvard but come out with tens of
thousands of dollars of debt just gonna
have to go into a corporation to pay off
your debt you get trapped in the
corporate culture it's the end of that
and it generalizes its supposed to
generalize across the society very
that's the point at time in fact early
seventies when debts started to when
college tuitions started to go through
the roof by now it's outlandish and it
isn't instantly not an economic
necessity that's very easy to see so our
own country our own society in the 1950s
that's the period of the greatest growth
fifties and sixties greatest economic
growth in history very successful fury
that education wasn't entirely free but
it was fairly free so when I went to
college in 1945 University of
Pennsylvania it was $100 a year which
was a lot of money for working students
which we were but you could very easily
get a scholarship to pay it and work on
the side you could make out did not play
now the advert for the GI Bill was
passed and that brought a huge number of
students we'd never been able to get
into college
then able them to go to college free and
that was a major kind of big effect on
their lives of course but also on majors
that's spurred to the development of the
society it's part of the reason why the
50s and the 60s for such a successful
growth period
furthermore if you look at other
countries you can see clearly
that it's not an economic system
necessity so go across the border to
Mexico that's a poor country they have
something like us richest country in the
world they have quite a respectable
higher education system you know
universities electric lecture there a
couple times very high standards lively
student body rotten salaries of course
the reasonable facilities you know not
exports stadiums not for anything but
it's free and there's a reason why it's
free
about ten years ago the government tried
to institute a small tuition there was a
national student strike across the
country beat it back still free in fact
one of the main administration buildings
on the moon on campus is still occupied
it's become a kind of an activist Center
on campus this kind of thing that was
going on all over the continent in Chile
there have been major student strikes
for almost a year now which has become
national strikes which are aiming to
undermine the the system the system of
education that was imposed by the
Pinochet dictatorship which we installed
back in 1973 which created basically a
sharply two-tiered educational system
education for the rich nothing very
little for anyone else that's been very
effective it's spreading through the
hemisphere and in places like Mexico
both persist in fact it's more than that
Mexico had a left-wing mayor Mexico City
a couple of years ago and he established
a university on in the city which is not
only free but is open admissions so
anybody can go
they have compensatory courses for
people who have to have little back more
background then they got out of school
and it's pretty good
collected their two med students and
features fairly high standard ones these
are not economic issues the same is true
in rich countries like Germany is a rich
country education is free and as I say
here it was not free but very low pain
except for the gentlemen's club back in
not very long ago fifties and sixties
well but these but these are effective
techniques of indoctrination you know it
yourself and there are other things like
them Sam mentioned the increasing for
fertilization of the universities which
is part of the more general growth in
power of corporate institutions in the
society altogether not that they weren't
there before they were the dominant
force in the society for well over
century but there's been a big change in
the last thirty years that's the change
that's symbolized by the occupy slogan
which is now taken over everywhere
ninety nine percent one percent the last
thirty years I won't go through the
details as you know there's been virtual
stagnation or decline for the majority
of the population plenty of wealth
generated but going into mostly a
fraction of one percent of the
population
