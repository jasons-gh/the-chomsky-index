end of it after the collapse of the Camp
David negotiations President Clinton
recognized that the us-israeli position
that the negotiations could not be
accepted by any Palestinians even the
most vocal moderate ones pro-us ones so
Clinton and December of 2000 issued what
he called his parameters their kind of
aid but somewhat more forthcoming he
then said that both sides Israel and the
Palestinians had accepted his parameters
both sides had made reservations to them
well they met in Taba Egypt in january
two thousand one sinica to try to iron
out the differences the reservations and
they made quite a bit of success in
their last press conference we know a
lot about this it was internationally
monitored there's extensive reports from
Israel most of it in Hebrew but some in
English so we know quite a lot about it
they practically reached agreement and
their last press conference they said if
they had a few more days they could have
reached agreement on every issue pretty
much in line with the international
consensus you know tweaking it here and
there there were few issues still Israel
called off the negotiations prematurely
and that was the end of formal
negotiations informal pretty high-level
negotiations continued leading to some
agreements the main ones called the
Geneva Accord it was rejected by Israel
ignored by the United States so that's
down the tube all this is quite
significant it means that a resolution
in terms of the international consensus
is feasible if the United States will
permit it unfortunately there's very
little sign of that well meanwhile the
US and Israel are just extending and
deepening the illegal occupation in 2005
September august/september 2005
Israel made a sensible tactical decision
the right wing government are real
insurance decision the government
decided that they make any sense to keep
seven or eight thousand Israeli settlers
in the Gaza Strip which button had been
half destroyed taking you know maybe a
third or more of the resources and land
and protected by half the Israeli army
so he made the decision to transfer the
settlers illegally settling in the Gaza
Strip to the west bank which is much
more important now it could have been
done just like that they flick of a risk
you know but they decided to stage with
it was called a national trauma so there
was a huge trauma perfectly for
completely farcical if the if they'd
want to do it quietly all I had to do
was announced that on august first the
IDF the Israeli army is going to leave
the Gaza Strip at that point the 8000
settlers would have climbed into the
buses provide trucks provided to them
and they would leave their subsidised
homes in the Gaza Strip to subsidize
homes in the West Bank but you don't get
any propaganda out of that what they
wanted was a trauma so it was staged you
know big front pictures on the front
pages of you know little boy pleading
with the soldiers not to destroy his
home Boston Globe and so on and shouts
of never again and so on you know no
more holla costs and it was pretty
effective actually it was a it was a
farcical repeat of a similar stage drama
in 1982 when they had the part pick
settlers out of Egypt out of the
northeastern Sinai there were
commentators in Israel who just
ridiculed it correctly like the late one
of Israel's leading sociologists bar
kimerling died recently wrote it
justjust ridiculed the farce as it
should have been done but it played it
played where it mattered here
so never again we've got to hold on to
the Occupy at the West Bank well after
the withdrawal from technical withdrawal
from Gaza Israel maintained its total
control and it was pretty vicious it
picked up in intensity a couple of
months later when the Palestinians
committed a serious crime there was a
free election in Palestine in January
2006 and they voted the wrong way now
that's not acceptable you can do all
kind of things but not that you don't
vote the wrong way in a free election so
the u.s. quite openly Israel to of
course turn to punishing the
Palestinians for this crime and it
wasn't secret like you can read it in a
column in the front page of the New York
Times right alongside another column
which is lauding our magnificent
messianic pursuit of wilsonian ideals
and supporting democracy and so on
there's no contradiction so or well you
may recall how to concept which you call
double think the whole think is the
capacity to have two contradictory ideas
in mind at the same time and believe
both of them that's almost a definition
of the intellectual culture but this was
a dramatic case and immediately after
that crime the punishment of the Gaza
Strip sharply increased got worse later
I won't go through the details but it is
pretty awful very savage siege brutality
and so on it peaked December 19 2008
with the latest us Israeli invasion
which was murderous and destructive the
invasion of the US has it's called an
israeli invasion it's a us-israeli
envision us arms us diplomatic support
and so on it was given a pretext but
every act of aggression has a pretext so
you have to ask does it meet anything
actually the pretext was that Israel was
defending itself against rockets from
Gaza
that pretext is accepted by the human
rights groups by the Goldstone
commissioned by about a hundred percent
of commentary it doesn't have a particle
of credibility Israel in the u.s. knew
exactly how to stop the Rockets there
had been a ceasefire and during the
ceasefire Israel admits it was not a
single Hamas rocket Israel violated the
ceasefire a couple of months earlier and
the rocket started Hamas called for
renewing the ceasefire Israel considered
it and refused well you know the use of
force when you haven't exhausted even
tried a peaceful means is just pure it's
just major war crimes I mean the
discussion about the war crimes in
Gaza's trivial in comparison so Israel
in fact at a free pass from the
Goldstone report and others well since
then the savagery continues they will go
on the details and talking too long
that's pretty similar in the West Bank
the restrictions are not quite as if not
a severe in the West Bank as they are in
Gaza which has become basically
unlivable that's the point that they're
bad but Israel has finally understood in
the West Bank that it should do what
every colonial power has done they don't
punish the entire population ensure that
the elites are making out fine you go to
any third world country you know under
colonial rule or neo colonial rule and
there's a sector of wealth and privilege
which is you know beyond anything that
we dream of and Israel's finally
understood that that's what you do so if
you go to Ramallah you can go to elegant
restaurants and go to the theater it's
just like being in Paris in London you
go a couple of miles away and it's
horrible but that allows the the
journalists and others to talk about the
wonderful achievements in the West Bank
well when you're running in fact Israel
is following finally the explicit
recommend
of Israeli industrialists about 10 years
ago who urged that Israel should move
from with their words from colonialism
to neo colonialism it should establish
the standard neo-colonial structures
like this took a long time to realize it
but the doing fact that's becomes even
more like South Africa South Africa
relied on the banter stands and it tried
to keep them they weren't there pretty
awful but it tried to keep them viable
it needed it that was their labor force
so they kept them going they tried to
get international recognition for them
but outside Israel no country recognize
them but that's Azura's not doing it for
all the West Bank it's just doing it for
the elite sector in Ramallah where the
Palestinian Authority is well if you
want to maintain a neo-colonial system
you have to have a an iron fist indeed
military force and there is one it's
called it's the army run by general
Keith Dayton actually that's the more
mild of the military forces with the
better-known one US general runs an army
trained in Jordan with us Israeli
participation and support and it keeps a
grip over the population in fact Obama
the Obama administration was
particularly impressed by how well the
army worked during the attack on Gaza
during the attack on Gaza there were no
protests in the West Bank which can i'm
surprised everyone and that's attributed
to the power of the Dayton army which
prevented any protests so Palestinian
course they can't demonstrate or
anything they were not even allowed to
protest the destruction of the other
half of Palestine what's going on in
Gaza at John Kerry in particular head of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
was particularly impressed with this he
said finally he said Israel may have a
legitimate partner for peace thanks to
the success of the general Dayton army
and
suppressing the population sufficiently
so they can't even protest against the
massive atrocities well let's turn
finally to the options for Palestinians
what are they hear the discussion I
think is pretty misleading and you
should think it through one option of
course is the international consensus
and there's a barrier the u.s. won't
accept it but that's our problem now a
very common view you hear it all over
the place now from Palestinians from
Israeli doves from the supporters of
Palestinians here that the alternative
to that is that Israel takes over the
territories it becomes a single state
and you can have a civil rights struggle
an anti-apartheid struggle within this
single state in which Palestinians will
be roughly half the population and
that's many of the doves including
Palestinian leaders think okay that's
better than the vanishing to state
settlement there's only one problem with
that logic those are not the two
alternatives there's a third alternative
which isn't discussed the third
alternative is that the US and Israel
continue doing exactly what they're
doing and what they're doing is very
clear has a name Prime Minister even all
merit called it convergence what you do
what Israel with us backing is doing is
taking over everything behind Xing
everything behind the separation wall
some of the most valuable land all the
water resources that's quite crucial and
zarad region that takes over the Jordan
Valley you know more fertile territory
kicks out the Palestinians and runs some
salience settlements and it's right
through the territories actually the
three of the big one east of Greater
Jerusalem Jerusalem has been sharply
expanded is one that goes almost at
Jericho and two others to the north one
taking in the town of arielle the other
enough to do me a look at a map I'm
feeling at a map it looks as it doesn't
penetrate through deeply into the West
Bank but that's misleading because the
area where it doesn't penetrate is
mostly rocky desert where you can't
settle the livable part of the West Bank
is broken up into four major Canton's
with arielle Sharon in fact the
architect of this called the banter
stance he was honest except that they're
not cared for as well the bantha stands
so Israel will take those no demographic
problem no palette very few Palestinians
if there are a few you kick them out no
problem of too many non-jews in a Jewish
state no civil rights struggle no
apartheid struggle as for the
Palestinians they can rot up in the
hills that Israel takes no
responsibility for them they can follow
a proposal of Moshe Dayan back in 67 the
defense minister was in charge he said
we should tell the Palestinians that we
have no solution for you we're going to
treat you're going to live like dogs and
whoever wants to leave can leave and
we'll see where that goes well yeah
that's the policy and that's the real
alternative to his to state settlement
there is no alternative of the kind
that's being discussed because neither
Israel nor the United States are in fact
anyone the world is not accept that
rather they'll continue doing exactly
what they're doing now that's not going
to change unless there are changes
inside the United States as in the
current world scene it's hard to see
wherever where else changes could come
from and that's kind of an optimistic
conclusion for us for people who oppose
current u.s. Israeli policies because
here is the one place where we can
influence what happens and here is the
one place that matters that's where this
is going to make a decisive difference
there are implications for tactical
choices I think they should be pretty
obvious but the I'll stop there sorry to
have going on to them
you
I take a look at the history of
apartheid it's suggested no not exact
but suggested two decades of Education
and organizing things of things like
this before the situation in the United
States reached the point where Congress
the business world general population
was so opposed to apartheid that the
Reagan administration had to lie its way
around it to try to keep to maintain the
support well okay that's one thing that
can be done another thing that could be
done is what began in the case of South
Africa and the late 70s namely
divestment by then it already had the
support of large part of the population
including even businesses and pretty
soon Congress but the requirement that
US corporations divest from a white
nationalist firms in South Africa which
they themselves are already beginning to
do under pressure here okay that can be
done now that's and that you can go
beyond I'm there were a number of the
International reports about the Gaza
attack that one of the most important
was from Amnesty International not
exactly an extremist organization they
called on the United States to withhold
all arms shipments from Israel saying
that the arms shipments violate
international law which they do and they
even violate US domestic law arms
shipments are supposed to be subject to
the condition that they are used only
for defensive purposes or for you know
internal security and the Gaza attacked
wouldn't had no defensive purpose as I
mentioned and certainly wasn't for
internal security and they were used in
commission of major crimes crime of
aggression lots of other were crimes so
there could be a popular movement here
to call on the US government to live up
to its own laws and to terminate arms
shipments and there's a lot of other
things no so there's no shortage of
things that we can do
uh well you know it's no deep secret I
mean like we're doing right now how did
people just taking a look at the change
just take the recent years in the United
States you can go all the way back in
history but how are you go back further
how a slavery overcome how did women get
the right to vote you know how and they
since the 1960s were women's rights
pretty substantially established not
perfect but totally different from
anything before how are civil rights
achieved how did environmental concerns
begin to be addressed not well enough
but at least somewhat and every step
forward in history comes the same way
and people like you do something about
it and there's it's very free country
you can do all sorts of things your
people in universities are extremely
privileged students for example are in
the moment of their lives when they are
most free they're sort of out of
parental control they don't yet have the
burdens imposed on them to try to
survive in a society where incomes for
the majority of stagnated for 30 years
because of government corporate policies
so you know they're kind of free they do
lots of things that others don't have a
choice about okay do them yeah that's
fine i think that's one of the things
you can do but there's plenty more I
mean we all know that a vote doesn't
mean much thank you it does a vote
I'm in more democratic countries than
ours that's understood like take say the
poorest country in South America Bolivia
I mean they had a pretty remarkable
election 2005 another one just last year
in which the majority of the population
indigenous people the most repressed
people in the continent had by then
organized enough to enter the political
arena and vote somebody from their own
ranks you know not some rich guy from
you know went the skullenbones of Yale
but they've elected someone from their
own ranks they formulated the programs
which the president is following serious
programs and the voting was just one
moment in an ongoing struggle it wasn't
I go to the polls I push a button I
forget about it for the next four years
it was there's just an ongoing popular
struggle about all kind of serious
issues you know access to water control
of resources complex complex questions
of ethnic and civil rights in a complex
society and they're at it all day all
the time okay that's functioning
democracy we've got a long way to go
well we've had it in the past but it's
kind of been suppressed and it can be
recovered and that's what elections
ought to be just a moment in a process
which goes on from there hi first thank
you so much for coming I've learned
allowing to what you shared with us my
question is specifically about Iran and
the nuclear weapons and the discussion
that you are having with regard to Iran
in the international community I
definitely understand the idea of a
country obtaining a nuclear weapon or
developing one themselves out of a form
of protection or to be on the same I
guess international status as other
countries who
are considered super powers are on the
same level as a super power because they
themselves have nuclear weapons but what
do you do when a country is openly
trying to develop one or obtain one and
also open it open and openly threatening
to wipe out a country and claiming that
a country shouldn't exist I mean those
are two really big issues that we're
dealing with and I didn't really think
you address that and I was curious to
say well what do you do about countries
that already develop nuclear weapons
outside the framework of the
non-proliferation treaty and our daily
violating resolutions of the Security
Council in the International Atomic
Energy Agency that's the much more
serious problem but that's a different
situation because back up those
countries aren't openly threatening to
wipe out another country nor is Iran
just take a look at the statements the
statements are that they don't think
they said in the actually goes back to
home a knee at the time of the u.s.
Iranian alliant the Israeli errata an
alliance and Israel didn't care about it
then I keep being repeated this
statement is that you know in the course
of time Israel should no longer exist
well actually I happen to agree with
that too effexor to a lot of people in
Israel the ones who think there should
be a single democratic state that's not
calling for wiping anyone out in fact
Iran has supported the international
consensus on the two-state settlement
actually there is there are two
countries that are not only calling for
some nation not to exist but are
destroying it namely the US and Israel
that's their position with regard to the
Palestinians and they're not just saying
i stress they're not just saying it
they're doing it day by day that's the
meaning of the policies that are going
on right before our eyes in Gaza and the
West Bank which we are supporting and
paying for so sure you shouldn't call
for the destruction of another nation
and you shouldn't implement that
actually the official position of Israel
backed by the United States they've
slightly modified it but back about 20
years ago their official position the
coalition government labour Likud was
that there cannot be i'm quoting it an
additional palestinian state between
Jordan and Israel in other words they
declared and the u.s. supported that
authority is a Palestinian state namely
Jordan and the Palestinians object you
know they say no no way meant that's not
our state but who cares about them we
say that's your state and there can't be
an additional one well that goes well
beyond calling for the destruction of
another country I mean it's it's
analogous to saying that if somebody
came along suppose off mountain the
judge said the Jews don't need Israel
because they already have New York ok I
mean you know we'd call that a revival
of Nazism but that's the official you
has been the official US Israeli
position so there's a lot to be
instantly about Iran nobody in their
right mind wants a grin to have nuclear
weapons or anyone else but it is well
and it's a horrible regime undoubtedly
though there are worse ones in the
region which are allies but every
everyone I'm not referring to Israel am
referring to the other Arab state I'm in
comparison with Saudi Arabia Iran looks
like a civil rights paradise but
the but it's awful you know no doubt and
and as a way to deal with it like for
example moving towards a nuclear
weapons-free zone but among strategic
analysts including Israeli ones there is
no real there's no real question about
why Iran is moving to nuclear weapons
capability which is not the same as
having nuclear weapons it's just being
at a point where he could have them like
most of the advanced industrial world is
in that position Japan Italy all sorts
of countries the reason is very simple
actually was described by one of
Israel's leading military analysts very
hawkish Martin fun krefeld a couple of
years ago after the invasion of Iraq he
wrote an article in which he said he
doesn't know if Iran is developing
nuclear weapons and he hopes not but he
says if they're not developing nuclear
weapons they are crazy that was his word
they're not developing their crazy the
United States is just announced we're
going to attack anybody we feel like and
invade you if we can do it with impunity
so you better have a deterrent well
maybe they're developing a deterrent but
no serious analyst thinks that they
could use nuclear weapons now if you ran
had nuclear weapons and missiles which
nobody saying wants them to have I mean
if they went as far as even loading a
missile the country would be vaporized
you know instantly even if there was a
suspicion of it well you know the
clerics may be hideous people but
they've shown no particular inclination
for suicide and destruction of
everything they own and everything they
value same is true about the leaking
nuclear weapons to others if there was
any suspicion that they were doing that
you can say goodbye to we ran so chances
they're using it or you know probably at
the level of an asteroid hitting the
earth or something like that but
it's a serious problem in fact if you
look at the Israeli literature they're
pretty straight about it they say the
real threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon
is not against Israel but it's against
Zionism that is what they're afraid of
is that if the region becomes too
dangerous people it is really just going
to leave people who have the capacity to
more educated wealthier and so on
because they won't want to live in a
region with that threat and in fact
immigration is a pretty serious problem
emigration of the educated and the
trained educated sectors so they don't
want to face that thread but I don't
think any serious strategic analyst at
least I've never seen one who thinks
that this the threat that Iran might use
a nuclear weapon I'm gonna do it total
suicide thank you first thank you Anna
good evening dr. Chomsky um my question
is concerning the well just getting
information how do we how do we inform
the intellectual classes where do you
find your information and how do you how
do you access truth in any media that's
so corrupt and overtaken by corporate
interests just how do you become a good
biologist you work you know I mean you
know that the important results aren't
like written in bold face I mean you
know the best biologist is not somebody
who read all the technical papers there
are can't do that we have to know what
to look for and I have to like take say
would be some of the things i mentioned
like the International Atomic Energy
Agency resolution on Israel that I
mentioned well I was lucky I happen to
be in Mexico the last September and they
have happen to have an independent
newspaper in Mexico that's the only one
in the Western Hemisphere that I know
very good newspaper you know big
newspaper second largest in Mexico gets
no commercial advertising because
business won't advertise their that they
subscribe this they do very well just on
reader support and they happen while I
was there they happen to run an
Associated Press piece on this well I
didn't know whether believe it or not so
when I came home I checked up Associated
Press which is on the internet and now
it's true then you know I did a media
search and I found out that there was
one mention of it in the united states
in the muny paper in Washington the
washington times there was a one in the
united kingdom in the irish times okay
that's the kind of thing you got to do
on all sorts of issues I'm if you know
what you're looking for and you're
willing to put the effort into it you
can find out a lot of things now for an
individual it's extremely hard I have to
be kind of a fanatic but if you're in a
group if you're part of an organization
it gets a lot easier I mean that's one
of the advantages of joining with other
people you can do a lot of things you
can't do a or so so if somebody finds
something is disseminated you know
others help out and pretty soon you get
things done and one more thing if you
could just quickly repeat the the column
you mentioned in the beginning of your
your top o the the myth this morning's
New York Times ethan bronner thanks who
i think is a terrible correspondent but
he have never good you haven't have a
good column this morning good honest
column i also did his homework he dug up
the chevy article which didn't expect
it's on I don't think it's in English so
some Hebrew I believe and he also dug up
that international poll which I haven't
seen you reported anyway so thanks for
coming again um I recently watched the I
guess the classic video of you with
women if Buckley debating the Vietnam
War back in the 60s um so I feel like
you've been asked probably every
question underneath the Sun so I guess
my question would be what what does noam
chomsky now wish that Noam Chomsky back
when he's debating buckling in the 60s
what is what did he wish he knew and if
you could also indulge us what is your
happiest moment in life and I don't
answer personal questions well I don't
actually remember I think that debate
was in 69 so can't remember it in any
detail but looking back at the period in
general my main regret is I was much too
mild I mean well I should have been
caught taking a much stronger position I
mean Buckley seen would disagree with
that he would disagree yeah but if I was
having a debate with some Soviet
commissar and I criticized what Russia
was doing he'd say it's too harsh but
maybe you have to remember that it was
not easy then in retrospect the sort of
fairytale is that everyone was opposed
to the war that's absolutely untrue I
mean in the early stages of the war in
Vietnam it was much harder to talk about
than it is to talk about Israel
Palestine today I'm in the as late as
october 1965 that's three years after
Kennedy had launched a major war against
the south in fact the South practically
destroyed we tried to have our first
public meeting in Boston Boston's pre
liberal city there's a place in downtown
Boston wasn't common which is dedicated
to open meetings so we figured okay
we'll take a chance and have a public
meeting on the Boston Common criticizing
the war very mild criticisms I mean it
was broken up by students if it wasn't
that there were a couple hundred State
Police there we probably all would have
been killed the Boston Globe you know
the liberal newspaper a huge
denunciation how dare you stand up and
criticize our magnificent government
it took a long time before any kind of a
peace movement developed and then if you
look at how it developed in fact you can
read this today in your history books
and in the press and so on what
developed was quite different in the
elite culture and in the popular culture
if you look at the elite culture which
is going to read a history book or you
know in the newspapers and so on was
that there was a debate over whether the
war was winnable or not ok in fact when
people make analogies to Afghanistan you
know or Iraq they say well
