1995 just very recently it was
commercialized meaning handed over to
Bill Gates people like that who were
least you have to admire sometimes for
their honesty gates for example has
pointed out that his he's attributed his
success to his ability to embrace and
enhance the ideas of others mostly from
the public sector and which is correct
and that's in fact the way the economy
works there's an enclosed way back you
know it goes back to textiles and steel
and everything else and in fact every
other successful economy works the same
way there are new zealand is unusual in
that it's actually believed the official
ideology or chosen to believe it and is
following the path that was imposed by
force on the third world namely they
have been forced to follow free market
rules and that's a good part of the
reason why india's india and england is
or was England pre Thatcher England was
injured well that's the history of these
are things that we can understand I mean
maybe it's not all well the economic
theory isn't entirely clear but facts
are reasonably clear and control your
own conclusions from the the United
States also is still keeping to the
United States has a happens to have an
extremely violent labor history it's a
unusually free country in many respects
but a very violent country and the by
comparative standards and look
comparative that is to the industrial
societies the labor history is
particularly violent so hundreds and
hundreds of American workers were being
murdered by security forces at a time
when that was just totally unknown in
Europe I mean even in very reactionary
societies by the 1920s it appeared that
the there was a lot of glee about the
end of history utopia the Masters the
over movement
totally destroyed mostly by violence and
the business was running evident it
looked as if everything was under
control workers would probably
intimidated you stock market you know
going through the roof in fact kind of
extreme version of what's being praised
today well then came the 1930s economic
collapse revitalization of popular
forces rapid revitalization because even
when they seem to be destroyed they're
sitting there right below the surface
ready to get going again and I did the
labor organizing was more than
successful and other popular movements
developed and they essentially first the
government to grant the kinds of Rights
that had long existed in other
industrial societies sort of the right
to organize some minimal form of
security and so on and so forth that's
the new deal and that became frightened
it became nearly revolutionary the
sit-down has yet to remember the
sit-down strike which was what was
taking place then a sit-down strike is
just one step short of taking over the
industry and placing it under worker
control which is a radical change in the
nature of the social system and it
doesn't take long for people to figure
out well you know we can Matt around
this factory why let the managers cause
us around them give the honors profit
that's extremely small move sit-down
strikes we're getting there the ideas
were around it's a month at least my
opinion ought to take place but they
came very close to taking place at that
time and i frightened business no end if
you read the business literature at the
time they were very frightened they
warned what they call the hazard facing
industrialists in the rising political
power of the masses which was
threatening traditional business rule
there was a counter-offensive that
started off wed away in the late 30s it
was put on hold by the war about Second
World War which had other priorities
but it was picked up immediately after
the war there were immediate legislative
efforts to cut back the rights of labor
they started in the late 40s they've
been continuing since and there was also
a kind of an innovation business
recognized that they could no longer
control the workforce by violence and it
was therefore going to be necessary to
turn far more to techniques of
propaganda there's a huge public
relations industry in the United States
it is dedicated to what it calls
controlling the public mind right
amending the minds of men as just as an
army regiments their bodies and quoting
from PR manuals that's what they were
going to do after the Second World War
the they there were calls in the top
business world for fighting the
everlasting battle for the minds of men
and indoctrinating people with the
capitalist story until they can repeat
it by rote and so on and so forth major
campaign which targeted everybody
captive audiences and factories were
compelled to submit to this propaganda
got into the schools including the
elementary schools the universities of
course the churches I mean even in
sports leagues everything was targeted
it was an enormous campaign and it had
some kind of effect the United States
was basically a social democratic
country in the popular attitudes in the
late 40s within about 10 years it looked
as if that had been controlled again and
by the end of the 50s you know people
were talking again about the end of
ideology I mean things are under control
passive and pleasant okay then came 60s
everything blew up massive changes very
constructive changes i think that led to
totally really substantial change in
American society not institutional that
didn't change but in attitudes and
awareness and
the understanding of an implementation
of human and civil rights so women's
rights for example rights of minorities
respect for other cultures opposition to
aggression and terror in the
environmental movement and all of these
things grew out of this major changes
that of course set off a
counter-offensive again right away and
in fact what's called neoliberalism is
just a part of that counter-offensive
it's part of the effort to undermine
democracy and Laurel fair state the
social contract of another phase in the
same battle that's been going on and on
and it's pretty straightforward the new
liberalism it's called you know economic
rationalism it's given different names
does what I knew about it it's a an old
old policy it was imposed by the British
on India in the late 18th century and
afterwards and on the colonies generally
it's so it's not new it's certainly not
liberalism because the rich and the
powerful insist on a powerful state that
will foster their interest that's
extreme on dumbest a under Reagan for
example state power vastly increased
along with protection and subsidy and
bailouts and so on the take a look at
the last budget was just passed a couple
months ago and nope you have noticed
that the so-called conservatives the
chicka the House Majority Leader at that
time House Majority Leader Newt Gingrich
and the Senate Majority Leader trent
lott who are full of a impassioned
rhetoric about how seven year old
children have to learn responsibility
and get off of the cycle of dependency
and so on they continued to hold the
record which they always hold for
government subsidies to their own rich
constituents so Gingrich has been in the
lead for a year
lot joined him this year and that's
typical they all understand that the
rich have to be subsidized and protected
that's the purpose of the nanny state
they have to be kept on their cycle of
dependency it's poor women with you know
young children who have to learn that he
harsh lessons of the market and that
extends to the third world they're all
who are women the children except for
the rich a leak that works for the
Masters that's a good part of the
structure of the world and hit a good
deal of the violence of modern history
is the effort to impose those structures
by force if people don't accept them
there are occasional exceptions where
air exceptions where they're adopted
voluntarily New England isn't a new
zealand's an example but typically it's
by force and banana state remains in
fact if you look at the OECD countries
the rich countries the state has grown
relative to GNP during the period of
so-called minimization of the state it's
not minimization of the state it's a
shift of the state from some degree of
response to public needs two more
concentration on the needs of private
power and the market is mostly a joke
all right for lots of reasons well the
big change and this the big change that
took place in the modern period the
cooks world
