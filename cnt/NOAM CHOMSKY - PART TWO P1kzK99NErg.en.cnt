well how can we do it foreign policy
literature is full of suggestions but
there's one that's missing the one that
can work namely moved to establish a
nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle
East that's here's another case where
the u.s. is almost totally isolated
there are regular review sessions of the
non-proliferation for the
non-proliferation treaty the latest was
about a year ago international support
for a nuclear weapons-free zone was so
overwhelming that obama had to formally
agree however he insisted that there be
a qualification namely Israel has to be
exempted and of course the u.s. is self
exempted from all international
obligations important fact not discussed
so what he said is it's a fine idea but
this isn't the time and furthermore the
u.s. insisted no proposal can call for
Israel's nuclear program to be placed
under the auspices of the International
Atomic Energy Agency or can call for
release of information about Israeli
nuclear facilities and activities
including information pertaining to
previous nuclear transfers to Israel and
of nuclear weapons free zone well these
policies can persist as long as we obey
here the more I sure doctrine as long as
we don't do anything about it yeah then
we can face the possibility of a Iranian
nuclear threat and very volatile region
although there is a solution actually
it's rarely noted in fact almost never
that the US and Britain have a special
responsibility to move to a nuclear
weapons-free zone in the Middle East
it's a very good reason for that when
the US and Britain invaded Iraq they
tried to construct a legal cover
wreath in legal cover fell apart pretty
soon they cover was that Iran you'll
recall I'm sure Iraq was developing
weapons of mass destruction and it was
there for violating a Security Council
resolution of 1991 which called on them
to eliminate their WMD programs well we
know the fate of that but putting that
aside if you go back and look at that
Security Council resolution it committed
the signers to work to establish a
nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle
East so the US and Britain above all
other countries have a special
responsibility for this and US isolation
in blocking it is a serious threat to
the world and shouldn't be tolerated but
that's up to us nobody else can do
anything well the I mentioned that the
doctrines the hegemonic doctrines that
were formulated during world war two
they've they're still prevailing at
least in rhetoric but the power to
implement them is notably declining some
of the major reasons are actually
domestic the American Society now the
last 30 years is being quite consciously
undermined by the Masters of mankind at
home since the 1970s there's been a very
sharp change in the economy as a move
from production to financialization back
at that time financial institutions were
a small fraction of the economy and
they're doing what they're supposed to
do in a state capitalist economy they
were taking unused resources like
somebody's bank account and transferring
them to productive use that's what
they're for that's go on since the 1970s
that's almost totally gone by now
they're not a few percentage of the
economy either by 2007 right before the
crash they created now they had forty
percent of corporate profits and their
activities have maybe no social utility
may be harmful
effects don't contribute to the health
of society their ways of making tons of
money by financial manipulation and
trickery well there's no time to go into
the details but if you look into it
there have been a variety of factors
since the 1970s that have interacted if
can converge to create a vicious cycle
of radical concentration of wealth which
is mostly in the top fraction of 1% of
the population that means CEOs had found
Minaj van hedge fund managers and so on
such a small percentage of the
population it's not even captured by the
census figures gifted careful analysis
to find it that's the main source of the
extreme inequality well then we go to
Adam Smith's Maxim the concentration of
economic power leads to concentration of
political power which in turn leads to
state policies government policies that
increase this concentration fiscal
policies like taxation you might say
when John Boehner says everything's on
the table except raising taxes for the
rich things like it's plenty more like
it rules of corporate governance
deregulation which is great for the
financial institutions leads to repeated
crashes and a lot more so you have this
vicious cycle at the same time part of
it is that the costs of electric
electoral campaigns are skyrocketing
which drives the political parties
deeper into the pockets of concentration
of capital increasingly financial
capital for the Republicans just
reflects it for the Democrats who is
they are now what used to be called
moderate Republicans for them they're
not far behind
well while all this is going on and
income and wealth and power becoming
extremely narrowly concentrated for most
people for the last 30 years real
incomes have pretty much stagnated the
people have been getting by with
increased work of hours way beyond
Europe no the debt and asset inflation
like the housing bubble which is
regularly destroyed by the financial
crisis crisis that began as soon as the
regulatory apparatus began to be
dismantled under Reagan now none of this
makes any difference it's fine for the
very wealthy especially for the
financial institutions which are at the
heart of it they benefit from the
government insurance policy that Neil
Barofsky mentioned what's called too big
to fail so what that means is the banks
and the investment firms to make risky
transactions they get rich rewards that
happens with the risky transaction and
you can ignore what economists call an
externality something that doesn't
figure in market transactions in this
case it's systemic risk the risk that
the whole system will collapse this only
goes wrong with your transaction but you
that's a footnote forget about it well
inevitably the system crashes and then
what they can do is run to the nanny
state that they nurture and ask for a
taxpayer bailout clutching their copies
of Hayek and Milton Friedman and I brand
and so on now that's been a that's been
a regular process since the Reagan years
each crisis is more extreme than the
last for the public that is real
unemployment in the countries at the
level of the Great Depression for much
of the population Goldman Sachs
meanwhile the main architects of the
current crisis they're richer than ever
bigger than ever
and they've just quietly announced
seventeen and a half billion dollars in
compensation for last year with CEO
would blank fine they're receiving at
twelve and a half million dollar bonus
and his base salary more than triple but
we have to make sure that he doesn't get
taxed because that would harm jobs no I
won't talk about elections there just by
now a charade run by the pr industry
well as barely skimmed the surface of
these critical issues but I don't want
to end without mentioning one more
externality that is dismissed in market
systems that is the fate of the species
if you're the CEO of a corporation or an
investment bank that's something you
don't take into account in market
transactions it's an institute its
effect about market systems well
systemic risk in the financial system
that can be remedied by the taxpayer but
nobody's going to come to the rescue if
the environments destroyed and that we
should recognize as close to an
institutional imperative as things now
stand business leaders
business leaders are quite openly
declaring that they're conducting
massive propaganda campaigns to convince
the population that anthropogenic global
warming human contributions global
warming is just some kind of liberal
hoax now the people who are carrying out
these campaigns they understand
perfectly well that the threat is very
grave but they have a institutional role
they have to maximize short-term profit
and if they don't somebody they'll be
kicked out and somebody else will come
in who will do it that's a institutional
fact not an individual one which makes
the problem much more severe now this
particular vicious cycle could well be
lethal and to just get a sense of how
the how serious the threat is it's
really enough to have a look at the new
Congress that came in propelled into
power bi business funding and propaganda
almost all our climate deniers now
they've already been cutting measures
that might mitigate environmental
catastrophe kind of a one indication of
how far the country has shifted to the
far right is that they're basically
trying to right now one of the things
they're trying to destroy is the
environmental protection agency that was
in student or Richard Nixon who was in
fact the last liberal president
literally ever since then it's
going to the rec
and then worse still a number of them
are really true believers like the head
of one of the the newly elected
Republican congressman is the head of
one of the subcommittee's on the
environment as you may have read he
explained that the global warming can't
be a problem because God promised Noah
that there wouldn't be another flood
well you know if that was happening in
some tiny country somewhere we could
laugh but not when it's happening in the
richest and most powerful country in the
world and before we laugh we might also
bear in mind that the current economic
crisis is traceable in substantial
measure to a fanatic faith in dogmas
such dogmas as the efficient market
hypothesis and in general to what Nobel
laureate Joseph Stiglitz 15 years ago
called the religion that markets know
best that made it unnecessary the
religious faith made it unnecessary to
notice than a trillion dollar housing
bubble that had no basis whatsoever in
economic fundamentals and devastated the
economy when it inevitably burst well
it's useful to contemplate what's being
done in the richest and most powerful
country in human history hours and in
the poorest country of South America so
in the u.s. that Congress is taking the
lead in undermining any hope for
preventing catastrophe and that again is
driven by deeply rooted institutional
factors dead people poorest country in
South America is Bolivia that's taken
the lead internationally in efforts to
protect the environment it's
this most recent effort just a couple of
weeks ago was to pass legislation
granting rights to the natural world now
sophisticated Westerners can ridicule
such knifed a but unless we can gain
some of the sensibility of the
indigenous majority and Bolivia the last
laugh maybe on us well all of this and a
lot more can proceed as long as the
moocher doctrine prevails as long as the
population is passive apathetic angry
diverge the consumerism hatred of the
vulnerable and so on as long as that
remains true then the powerful can do as
they like and those who survive can
contemplate the ruins but we all know
that we don't have to obey them washer
doctrine that's what we're here for now
we're here
we're here right now to celebrate 75
years of courageous refusal to do it
with many noteworthy successes and that
leave they leave a legacy the legacy
that we can carry forward often been
done in the past it's being done right
now in chopper 2 square many other
places under conditions far harsher than
those that we face so fortunately the
future is very much in our own hands
sure PSA here so we're going to have a
short question and answer session in
just a couple of minutes before a quick
word from the Peace Council we're really
excited here was really happy with how
professor Chomsky at ended his his talk
that we don't we don't have to accept
this us imperial order that is really
negatively affecting so many people
around the planet and that we can work
together and we can resist we can
educate we can agitate and we can
organize against these things that are
being pushed and pushed at us by the you
at the government and the corporations
that control it and so I hope everyone
will take a look in their program in the
middle there's a whole list of different
ways that folks within the Peace Council
and in the community are organizing
together and are educating our neighbors
about the truth behind us policy okay
I'm going to turn this because I'm going
to read some things but first I'm going
to say the good news is that actually
you don't have to know everything you
don't have to be as smart as Noam
Chomsky you don't have to be as well
informed you can plot right along just
as you are and do an enormous amount of
good I think
it's really true it's a really really
true but there are there are huge
obstacles for most of us to add in one
more thing to the day or the week or the
month and not the least of the problems
are the feelings of despair fear and
hopelessness which pervade our culture
and which arise in ourselves in the face
of a world which is on fire and an
imperial system which has convinced us
of its invincibility but there's a big
difference between feelings and actions
hope of short-term success is not a
requirement for action and we in that
really large sense of we are actually
the only ones who can change the course
by objecting to the decisions that are
made in our names daily and we have no
choice
so I made up a list of five things to
tell you exactly what to do five easy
steps ok first you look at the big
picture hold it clearly in focus while
you do the small things that one human
being can do this will remind you that
no matter what you're doing you're not
doing it alone the whole is greater than
the sum of the parts and you are an
important part of the whole number to
respond to an issue or a task that needs
to be done but choose something that
moves inspires and motivates you
personally number three raise that
activity up to the priority of something
that simply has to be included in how
you spend your time on the level of work
school taking care of children mowing
the lawn making dinner in other words
make a commitment to political action
and community involvement being part of
your everyday life
okay there's only five things number
four is do it and I say about that
you'll get used to it it's okay and
number five I want to say you will feel
better you can check the research on
this action cures numbness and despair
it brings meaning to life and creates
community with other humans at a time
when we most desperately need that
how about to do thanks Carol that was
really great and so there's so many
issues out there that we could you know
all spend our time working on but I
would really encourage you to check out
our info tables and them and the brooch
and the the program just to see specific
ways that you can plug into the Peace
Council we're a very large very diverse
organization and from working on
hydrofracking to stopping the Colombia
free trade agreement to protesting the
drones at Hancock airbase we're doing a
lot of work and there's a lot of work to
be done so if there's something that
really inspires you that you want to see
happen just come talk to us come see us
and we can hook you up connect you with
other people in the community that also
care about the same issues oh you know
all that matters enthusiasm and energy
we all have so many skills and talents
and the movement needs everyone so
please open up your programs and there's
a little green sheet where you can you
know put down your email so you can stay
in touch with us and Andy's going to
talk to you a little bit more about the
green sheets
greetings it's great to see this full
house we apologize for the slight
inconvenience is getting everyone in
here but we weren't expecting so many
people to be so psyched about hearing
Noam Chomsky so that's great
so ursuline Carol talked a little bit
about what you can do how you can get
involved physically in our work there's
another piece of it as well that we also
need funds to help support our work and
certainly tonight's event is very
helpful to that but we made a very
conscious decision to keep the cost of
tonight's event really low so anyone
could come in because we think that
information is important but we want to
ask those of you who can to think about
contributing more the peace council's
annual budget is a little over a hundred
thousand dollars a year a couple of
years ago there were reports that the
Pentagon said spent a hundred thousand
dollars on a single toilet seat the this
coming year that war budget in the
United States is about 1.4 trillion
dollars so we do a tremendous amount of
work on really limited resources and
we'd love to not have to scrimp quite so
much so I'm going to turn over to Cindy
squillace who's going to talk a little
bit about her role in the organization
good evening I must admit when Andy left
me a voicemail message asking me to help
by doing the fund Emile my immediate
thought was oh my god no way and then my
second reaction was if I just don't
answer his phone call he'll find
somebody else they'll get somebody else
to do it I don't have to worry about it
but then he called back again he kind of
fooled me and I answered the phone and
he asked me to help in this way and I
realized that it was just my fear of
stretching myself of facing all of you
and asking for money that was keeping me
from saying yes and just like the Peace
Council has done for 30 years in my life
asking me to stretch myself a little to
go out of my comfort zone I knew that I
wanted to say yes to this and stretch to
meet this request there's so little
requests that the Peace Council makes of
any of us so wanted to let you in on
that this is a little bit scary looking
out at all of you My partner Jack Ma
know when I moved to this area in 1977
we didn't know anybody but what we knew
was that we had a commitment to ending
war to ending racism homophobia sexism
and we found the Peace Council within a
couple of weeks of moving here and that
became a place where we could put our
passion where we could work on projects
where we could meet with people who had
the same vision for a better world that
we did and so for the past 30 years
we've been working on projects such as
ending nuclear power talking about the
connection between nuclear power and
nuclear weapons letting people know that
they were in our backyards through
through the decades there have been many
many projects that we have worked on
most recently attending the drone ending
the the drones in our area and yes
please
what what a horrible thing to have to go
travel around the country travel around
the world knowing that we have this in
our backyard so it's really up to us to
tell the world know that we won't let
these exist in our backyard another
committee that I've been involved with
is the neighbors of the Onondaga Nation
we've been supporting the our neighbors
our friends and neighbors in the
Onondaga Nation and letting them teach
us about the things that are important
to them that of course turn out to be
the things that are important to us also
like hydrofracking we're supporting them
with letting people in our community
than non-indigenous people in our
community know that they are a sovereign
nation amongst us and how important it
is to acknowledge that and to let our
friends and neighbors know about that
there's many committees parts of
neighbors of the Onondaga Nation parts
that you can get involved with but what
I guess I want to say to you is that the
Peace Council offers a gift to all of us
in central New York and that's the gift
of holding a place open for us for those
of us who want to make a difference in
our world for ourselves for our children
and all the children to come because of
the work that the staff people at the
Peace Council do many many others of us
who don't do this full time but have
other jobs we can plug in to what carol
was talking about the things that are
important to us while the staff members
at the Peace Council hold that place
keep going keep the work going so that
we can all add to that over the years
Jack and I have donated what we could in
time and money to the Peace Council
we've been pledged
consistently for about 20 years after
realizing that the staff can't count on
a regular paycheck unless they know how
much money is coming in and they have
people regularly pledging to this we
can't all give a lot but we can all give
a little bit every month or maybe just a
one-time donation if that's what you can
do and knowing how much of a difference
that makes so you may be thinking that a
pledge that you give to the Peace
Council is a gift from you but I've come
come to understand that by pledging I am
being gifted with the opportunity to
support the beliefs that I feel
passionately about
and as I've learned from my onondaga
friends and neighbors noticing and
giving thanks to everything in our world
is vital for us to live a good life so
I'd like you to please take this time to
notice all the steadfast ways the circus
Peace Council has contributed to our
community and to our world and I'd like
you to give thanks to them for that
so Ursula mentioned these green sheets
in your programs I'd encourage you
before you leave if you have to leave
early to do it now to take it out fill
it out think about what you can give if
you can write a check that's great
there's a form you can fill out to
donate by credit card on here and as
part of our 75th anniversary we're
trying to increase the the regular
pledgers people like Cindy and Jack to
75 families for 75 years so we have 30
more people or families that we need to
add so we ask you to really consider
that if that's something that you can do
and unlike the politicians and these
other people who what they want is a
small number of very large donors
because it's quick and easy that way
what we want at the Peace Council is
hundreds and thousands of small donors
people who invest in peace and social
justice so we really encourage you to do
that tonight there's folks at the
entrances with these nice buckets that
you can drop some coins into some
dollars some checks whatever you can
give so again thank you very much and
let's bring dr. Chomsky back up here for
some questions and answers
so no Chomsky is generously agreed to
stay for some questions and answers we
do have mics in the aisle I would like
to particularly encourage any high
school students who might have a
question to make your way to one of
those microphones we'd love to hear
what's on your mind and what you have to
say and if somebody in the sound booth
could please make sure those mics get
turned on as people make their way to
make a line behind the microphone that's
closest to you please remember we are a
large crowd I'm sure there are many
people who would like to ask a question
we ask that you make your question or
comment brief and to the point and that
you speak clearly and then please step
aside so that the next person can move
up we will alternate between the two
microphones if we can't hear i'll try to
repeat the question as accurately as
possible do we have mics on yet yes okay
wonderful let's start over here then
well that's a really important issue the
the public education system was one of
the real major achievements of this
country was the first country to have a
really broad mass education system that
contributed enormously not only to the
cultural health of the country but to
its economic growth that after the
Second World War there was a major
period of economic growth in US history
was the several decades after the Second
World War and a substantial reason for
that was the GI Bill which allowed a
huge number of people not enough
unfortunately but a huge number of
people to go to college who would never
been able to do it and in those days
college was cheap public education was
free I mean I went to college in 1945
and I having to go to the look I went to
the local school you know he'd never
went anywhere else but the local school
happened to be the University of
Pennsylvania which which is private but
it was a hundred dollars you know and
that he could get it and you could
easily get a scholarship so education
was basically free and for the GI bill
at the huge number of people and that
had an enormous impact well oh that's
being reversed if there's an attack on
public education which is without any
precedent because all the way from
kindergarten up to the university's so
take say the university's allowed to
stay a personal experience a couple of
months ago I travel around a lot giving
talks I happen to give a talk at in
Mexico City at the National University
pretty impressive University couple
hundred thousand students
high level very engaged in fact salaries
are ridiculously low by our standards
but they were facilities are pretty good
it's free that's a poor country you know
but public education is free the
furthermore in mexico city itself
there's a city-run college which is not
only free but has open admissions so
anybody can go and if they need help to
get in they get remedial training I was
there too pretty impressive also high
standards well that's a poor country I
happen to go from there to the Bay Area
in California this may be the richest
place in the world outside of the Gulf
Emirates they the public education
system is being systematically destroyed
tuition is so high in the major
universities that it's just for the rich
it's at fact it's at the level of Ivy
League colleges work for this year for
the first time more funding for the
public institutions is coming from
tuition than from the state in a rich
state not Mexico and this is happening
all over the country I mean a majority
of the states by now the tuition and the
public universities is higher than
funding now it's not because of the lack
of wealth and it's not because of the
deficit which is complete farce as as
easily the show it's because of a
decision to destroy public education the
in California for example the the great
universities which are being will be
proud almost certainly be privatized
they're almost private now you know very
high tuitions big endowments and so on
and that means the rest of the system it
gets kind of lowered to this low level
technical training well you know for the
economy of forget the human cost for the
economy of California that's very
serious california became rich large
measure because of the high level
education system well the people who are
running the program that top one-tenth
of one percent of the population they
don't care i mean there are kids will be
fine you know they don't use the public
education system its privatized they can
pay for the phenomenal wealth and
there's a change and this is generalizes
over the country we have to recognize a
significant change in the nature of
contemporary state capitalism from the
70s you go back to the 1950s the CEO of
a firm's a General Motors had to care
about the future of the firm that had to
have brand loyalty you know the firm had
to persist and so on so they tried to
build it so it would persist that's not
true anymore the CEO of say General
Electric which is mostly a financial
institution all they have to do is make
money in the short term I'm in it and
then of course they get bailed out by
the taxpayer if it goes wrong but if the
company itself declines it doesn't
matter they walk away with their golden
parachute that's the new system and as
for the country they don't really care
about it along with the financialization
of the economy came offshoring of
production so if you can make more
profit by using a super cheap exploited
labor and China let's say without
environmental constraints and so on fine
it happens to harm this country severely
but that's not their concern so we're
getting into a situation where the
future of the country just doesn't
matter for the people for the decision
makers and it's going all the way down
to elementary school I don't have to
tell you there's a huge attack on
teachers I'm in an effort to try to
shift the blame for for the financial
crisis and a general economic crisis
away from you know Goldman Sachs the to
the public school teachers and the
firefighters with there is huge tension
I mean it's so ludicrous you can hardly
believe that it getting away with it and
there is a backlash like in Wisconsin
most significant backlash but it's
certainly going on and it is so so
you're right there's a major effort to
destroy the public school system now I
think there's a fundamental reason
behind that it's not just that the rich
don't care they think the same thing
lies behind the attack on Social
Security Social Security is a
phenomenally successful program has
almost no administrative costs I mean
far less than privatized insurance and
so on very cheap works very well keeps a
lot of people alive it doesn't mean much
two people in higher income levels you
know they get a small amount they can
forget it but for a lot of the
population that's what keeps them
surviving particularly after the huge
economic collapse collapse of the real
estate bubble so so why attack Social
Security well partly it's of no benefit
to the rich but there's a deeper reason
I think and it's think it's the same
reason as the public education system I
can't prove it but this is what it looks
like to me the public education system
and Social Security are based on a
certain principle namely the principle
that we care about other people okay
so Social Security means you care that
the disabled Widow across town doesn't a
foodie or let's say I don't have kids in
school but you know I'm happy to pay
school taxes because I care that the kid
across the street can go to school and
and this for this concept of sympathy
and social solidarity is considered
extremely dangerous there's a major
effort propaganda effort to try to drive
into people's heads they should only be
concerned for yourself now there's
nothing new about this you go back and
Americans good to learn know about
American history you go back to say 1850
the beginnings of the Industrial
Revolution and incidentally the period
of the freest press in the United States
there are hundreds thousands of
newspapers a lot of readership the
direct participation they were written
factory workers and others and one of
the main themes was anger at what was
called the new spirit of the age gain
wealth forgetting all but self that was
the new spirit of the age in 1850 and
there's been a tremendous effort over
the years to somehow drive that into
people's heads and drive out all normal
human feelings and you know it it's had
some success and I think you see it in
the willingness of parts of the
population at least to try to kill the
elements of the society in the culture
that are based on care and concern for
other people and to try to turn people
into crazed maniacs who care about
nothing but themselves well that's all
that's pretty dangerous again if it was
happening in some small country you know
it'd be a shame but when it's happening
in the richest most powerful country in
history it's very
dangerous
apologies that our sign interpreter has
to leave ur at this time but let's
proceed with the next question at this
microphone
well sure we know it's pi think you know
it's important point we know that it's
possible because it's been done over and
over again I mean that's why we don't
live under feudalism we don't have
slavery women have some rights and yes
it's because of things like that and
it's a lot of its in very you know our
own recent lifetimes so what the society
is a lot more civilized than it was say
50 years ago in a lot of respect the
there are there have been repeated
periods through American history when
there's been a struggle a popular
struggle against the effort to turn
human beings into you know satanic
creatures and it succeeded over and over
like takes a financial crises okay the
immediate cause of the current economic
crisis there weren't any financial
crises from from 19 from the Second
World War up until reagan none and the
reason is there was a regulatory
apparatus in place it was a regulatory
apparatus which comes out of the New
Deal and the New Deal wasn't a gift from
above it came from very extensive
popular struggle CIO organizing you know
sit-down strikes mass demonstrations all
sorts of things and that's my childhood
I remember and that left a legacy which
first of all meant like the GI Bill like
substantial economic growth egalitarian
growth in the 50s and 60s not like
what's happened since and things like
say a regulatory apparatus which contain
the tame the worst excesses of the
system the deficiencies are still there
but their ways of remedying the same
with health care like now there's a
battle to try to save Medicare for the
elderly and met
paid for the poor but if you go back 50
years there was nothing to save they
came because of the activism of the
1960s which got the government to do
some not as much as they should at least
something now you take a look-see at the
at the famous deficit for the visit for
the financial institutions they want
everybody to focus on the deficit you
get rid of the deficit it's good for
bankers there's it's not the problem of
the country the problem of the country's
joblessness and that requires stimulus
not deaf it's not austerity good let's
but let's even put that aside suppose we
buy into the propaganda and say okay
we're worried about the deficit where's
it come from well about half the deficit
is military spending you know the the US
said and a u.s. oh you you all know this
u.s. spends about as much as the rest of
the world combined it's not for security
as I mentioned it's harming security as
other purposes like the ones that
Clinton mentioned so that's half the
deficit where's the other half the other
half comes from the completely
dysfunctional health care system it's a
privatized unregulated health care
system it's in it's it's an
international scandal has twice the per
capita costs or more of comparable
countries some of the worst outcomes a
huge number of people with no coverage
at all well you know it's not if our
health care system was the same as other
industrial countries there would not
only not be a deficit there would be a
surplus ok now it's not utopian to think
that we can have a we can radically cut
a military system that's dangerous for
the world and harmful to us and it's
certainly not utopian to think that we
can have a health care system like other
countries that's not utopia but those
things aren't discussed and they're not
discussed because of the the control of
the doctrine and debate and discussion
by the same narrow concentration of
power of setting these policies well you
know that's this I mean people you take
a look at people's attitudes it turns it
it's very strike as a heavily polled
country we know a lot about what people
think and it's worth looking so for
example there there are recent studies
of that sector of the population that
says you know get the government off our
backs let's have a small government that
that under sentiment you take a look at
what their what their attitudes are it
turns out their Social Democrats
literally they think there should be
more money spent on education on health
on more money should be used for helping
poor people like women with dependent
children but not welfare not welfare but
all the things that welfare does and the
reason is because welfare has been
demonized ever since Reagan welfare
means black women you know being
chauffeured to the welfare station with
in there by their chauffeured Cadillacs
and picking up your money well okay
nobody wants that so let's get rid of
welfare but let's keep or in fact
increase all the things that welfare
does that one of the most striking cases
is foreign aid a huge number of people
post a foreign aids way too high when
they're asked what they think foreign
aid is they give estimates way beyond
the mize early level that it is when
they're asked what they think it ought
to be twice as high as it is you know
well you know this generalizes the
people are resistant to these efforts to
turn them into monsters but if you're
sitting alone you know listening to Fox
News and you're not getting anything
else from the Democrats either you know
NPR well you know you get muddled
confused and that's what groups like
this are about to try
to carry out the policies of the
programs of organization that will
enable people to break out of this now
that's
I mean I've purposely been keeping two
band-aids two very small things that
could be done to make it a much better
society but I think your question
pointed to something deeper what about
the institution's themselves they're not
graven it's done they can be changed you
don't have to have institutions like
that and there's plenty of possibilities
but that's another question so I think
we'll just have time for one more
question from each line and I would just
say that if you want to let a young
person in front of you just consider
that and otherwise we'll move back to
this microphone over here and take the
next question
well the faith wanted to stoop to that
level there'd be very simple responses
but you know I I mean he's been
producing hysterical rants for 20 years
I just ignore them they're not worth
responding to but if you really want to
look so for example let's take one of
his main cases one of his claims is that
I I claimed that the clintons bombing of
the Sudan would was worse than 911 are
you can check back and see what I said
and he seats total fabrication but
there's something much more interesting
there are liars and there are brazen
liars there is one person who actually
did say that the bombing of the Sudan
was much worse than 911 Christopher
Hitchens ok you can find it I've quoted
it ok is there any point responding to
things like this um it's kind of like
responding to some Soviet Thomas or
what's the point
billionaire my manager
would you be able to repeat the first
part of that question please who was it
I didn't see that one yeah Gifford
straight robbery yeah yeah yeah I
honestly well you know I mean Lee he's
not being that's a case that's been
going on for a while and he's not being
indicted for things like the lying and
the cheating and the dishonesty that
created the financial and economic
crisis he's being tried for things that
harmed other businesses and they don't
like it you know so they go they'll go
after people who harm their interest but
I you know I didn't read the report but
if it happened yachts that's it
it's enforcement but nothing very I mean
the serious enforcement ought to be the
kind of things that borovsky is talking
about these the Special Inspector for
the bailout I mean there was to repeat
what he said it's important there was a
bargain the bargain is the culprits who
created the disaster will be bailed out
by the taxpayer and the people who were
harmed by them will get at least you
know something you know maybe they'll be
able to stay in their homes instead of
being thrown out well as he pointed out
half that bargain was kept the other
half was disregarded tells us something
about how democracy functions the loud
voices the rich loud voices yah they get
their way Adam Smith's masters of
mankind the rest of the population are
you know the more doctor again we can
disregard them so they'll get thrown out
of their homes or that's a major crime
as is the fact that there is a that
these thats a credit rating agencies are
now calculate when they give a credit
rating to some company they count in the
likelihood in fact near certainty that
if they go bust the taxpayer a bail
amount that makes them a lot more rich
and powerful than they were are those
are real fundamental forms of corruption
I don't if you call it corruption the
same is true of say tax policy I mean if
you take a look at tax policy it's
pretty amazing so take say the bush tax
cuts which were which are a tremendous
burden on the economy I mean if it
wasn't for the effect of those tax cuts
we'd have nothing like the crisis that
there is now well how are the tax cuts
designed take a look at it a those of
your old enough may remember the tax
cuts were 2001 there
run for 10 years the first year
everybody got a couple hundred dollars
in the mail so you look your I'm giving
you a tax cut for everybody and it was
it was tilted toward the wealthy but it
was everybody got something but it was
designed so that year after year that
would shift and in the last year I think
it was the top 1% got over half the tax
cuts but by then everyone had forgotten
you know that's called a sunset policy
you design program so at first they
don't look too bad and then as they
begin to take effect they go to what the
Masters want all for ourselves and
nothing for anyone else what Adams
mythical the vile Maxim of the Masters
of man and gun that's the way policies
design you go to the congressional
debate now so take John Boehner
yesterday everything's on the table
except the bush tax cuts okay we've got
to make sure that the rich get even
richer and more powerful now there's a
way of talking about this and if you
read his speech it's typical he said we
have to do this because of jobs you
think for a moment has nothing to do
with jobs you want jobs that's not what
you do but we have to remember that
there's been an interesting change in
the English language there's a certain
word which you're not allowed to
pronounce it's an obscene word since
their children in the audience all spell
it instead of pronouncing it PR 0 f I TS
you're not allowed to use that word that
word is now pronounced jobs ok so when
when you read about a
all right these are and here the media
just go along and commentary just goes
along and so on those are real serious
problems or takes a the debate over
Medicare it's the Ryan proposal which is
supposed to be serious and courageous
we're supposed to think about it it's
designed on the sunset policy take a
look at it it's designed to destroy
Medicare but not for the current voting
population so people who are 55 are over
which is a big part of the voting
population they're excluded because
their Medicare will stay what's going to
be killed is years down the road and
that's not a small effect congressional
budget office estimates a 34
trillion-dollar costs to seniors over
the life of the program 34 trillion
dollars alright that's what's being cut
for elderly people but not now because
we want them to vote for it now so
they're exempt sunset policy again
Medicaid is being devastated and what is
being omitted is the source of the
problem Medicare is not a problem
Medicare is pretty efficient that's
quite low administer of course it works
pretty well it's very expensive but the
reason is it works through the
privatized system that's where the costs
are the ridiculous costs you know
profits advertising bureaucracy all kind
of things that's why it's twice as high
as anywhere else well that's not being
touched ok so with all of this all of
these debates are framed in a way which
kind of guarantee that the rich and
powerful will get more rich and more
powerful and the rest will suffer are
those are real problems but they can be
dealt with you know that doesn't have to
be like that
thank you
