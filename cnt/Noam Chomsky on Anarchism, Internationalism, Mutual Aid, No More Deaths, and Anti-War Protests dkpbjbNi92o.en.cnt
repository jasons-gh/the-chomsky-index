welcome to episode 20 of the time talks
podcast part of the channel Tarot
Network my name is Christine Steele and
I'm happy to start off 2020 with this
episode featuring the legendary linguist
philosopher political commentator and
our kids activist author and
revolutionary Noam Chomsky I first got
in touch with Noam it's a young
journalist for an Occupy Wall Street I
was writing articles about Occupy Denver
and was threatened with slap suits my
good friend Tim also known as the hip
hop artists soul and host of the podcast
soul cast told me to reach out to as
many people as I could for support one
of the people I emailed is Noam Chomsky
not knowing no one returns emails better
than most of my friends he wrote me back
in support of what I was doing this led
to me eventually collaborating with him
a research and interviewing him twice at
MIT one of the interviews was published
in his book occupy reflections on class
war rebellion and solidarity I'll link
that chapter titled there's always a
class war going on in the show notes
since then we've kept in touch he
graciously decided to give an interview
for my podcast and this episode we
discussed anarchism and its influence
Palestine and internationalism mutual
aid the group doing important work
called No More Deaths
the Pentagon Papers and anti-war
protests the food I've been read or seen
the documentary manufacturing cassette I
highly recommend it there's recent
documentary reform for the American
Dream is excellent
highly recommend necessary illusions by
Noam and his recent books on Western
terrorism from Hiroshima to drone
warfare matches and mankind and on
Palestine if you're into his work on
linguistics the science of language is
great and a really important work if you

network hello
you know how are you doing this was
chris christie oh hi yeah let's go ahead
so my first question is i wanted to ask
you about anarchism and i first
contacted you and interviewed you in
your office regarding surveillance the
parents paris commune and occupy wall
street and with anarchism in the spanish
civil war when it says about the pieces
with elements and direct action shutting
down the World Trade Organization in
occupy now the environmental movement
you're exposed to anarchism at an early
age and I was wondering how has
anarchism progressed and what where do
you see its role in the future well
first of all we should bear in mind that
the term anarchism covers boydle quite a
wide range of thinking and activities if
you look and as the term itself has a
derogatory connotation
thanks to the workings of the whole
world propaganda system over the years
the paramater chasm has come to mean two
people or something like violence terror
destruction the elimination of all order
an organization and so on that's not
what an angstrom that urk ISM ever was
I'm a fringe as were but anarchism polls
for a highly organized society but
organized by the participants without
illegitimate hierarchy and domination
that calls for a high degree of
organization but based on solidarity
solidarity mutual concern cooperation
shared information and understanding and
so on how is that chump change
well you know for a long time it just I
mean it's for it exists in human life
but it didn't exist as a recognizable
element of society in the sixties it
began to change because the activism
that very much took these forms even if
the word wasn't used the Freedom Riders
Britain South and say we're living in a
system a society that they created a
mutual aid and support and common
decision-making and so on the early
feminist movement said yeah and had some
of the same properties and so on and
it's happening again today with the
especially with the rise of the
environmental movement among young
people but much beyond that but they're
things developing in the world that we
don't call anarchism but our elements of
potential anarchist society to take
things like when the big steel mills
shut down and Youngstown Ohio that they
had been built by the community they
were the major contribution they were
community creation to a large extent and
the community fellow for not just the
workforce but instead of just
disintegrating and peering ah they began
to organize in a participatory form this
was the help of intellectuals who were
interested in Italy Portlander labor
activist lawyer walk by back to this
girl power that's we've been working on
ideas would be short for a long time
enough though developed and Youngstown
in fact the former Rust Belt altogether
including Cleveland a network of work
around worker managed matter prizes
which are based on participatory
mechanisms there of course embedded in
the broader state capitalist society but
those are the kinds of things that
great Atticus 19th century so you're
Michael Condon was talking about what he
referred to the task of trying to build
the germs of the future the elements of
the future within the existing society
and I think that's sort of many ways in
which is this is taking place and it's
it's kind of ideas that come to the
surface more than in the past in the
recent past at least and of course there
are there are developments independent
developments which are have been pretty
exciting like most recently the in the
Kurdish areas of Syria the mahalo
areas where they've tried to institute
strongly feminist a commonly based on
the model of marie book kids work
society which has held been betrayed to
its worst enemies by all problems
something may survive yeah thank you for
sharing that
um I'd like to talk about the value of
internationalism immutable aid and how
tactics could aid Palestine we often see
internationalism going in the wrong
direction with the Israeli Defense Force
training police officers in the US on
repression techniques but this scenario
is often flipped like when Palestinians
and communities in Ferguson with black
lives matter showed all authority and
shared tactics can you speak on this
internationalism in Palestine well as
you correctly pointed out there's two
kinds of a turn a tional ism you as the
atom the internationalism of the
powerful of the repressors there's the
internationalism of those struggling for
freedom and elementary rights and that's
always been true so
go back to the American Revolution for
example there were the British were
fighting with horses from the Germans
the Americans had supporters from France
Lake Lafayette and it goes on like that
there's always through history we see
both tendencies about the rich and the
powerful have shared interests and they
cooperate to try to achieve them when
the u.s. backs a right-wing military
coup in some Latin American countries
that's mutable aid of the rich and
powerful when during the 1980s we saw a
pretty amazing development phenomenon
which is rarely discussed because it's
much too frightening
oh this was the first time in history
that mainstream ordinary people by the
thousands who went to a country that was
on a under attack by their own States
not only to give some aid but even to
try to participate in their lives but to
give what help comes from having a white
face in your midst and nobody ever
thought of going to it Vietnamese
village or an entranced of an Algerian
village during the when the United
States was destroying Indochina entrance
was crushing Algeria but these are ideas
that never came to people's minds but in
the 1980s it happened by the tens of
thousands in the United States and from
all over the country evangelical
churches and rural Kansas for example it
wasn't just the young people who were
derided as it's on the listeners that's
an amazing phenomenon of
internationalism and mutual solidarity
as very important which is one of the
reasons White's
it's kind of written out of history
it's not the kind of thing that people
wish was to have in their minds but it's
there
and it came nobody could have predicted
it came out of nowhere it's right below
the surface I think old time mm-hmm
thank you
so my next question is you've rightfully
called Tucson occupied territory and all
of North and South America's indigenous
land with a current situation of
children dying and being imprisoned on
the border can you speak about how this
is part of the ongoing legacy of
colonialism and genocide and what you
see being done about rectifying
colonialism and bringing justice to
stolen land well that's that's another
pretty amazing phenomena Arizona
altogether
not exactly a leftist paradise but if
you take Tucson where we're living the
solidarity with the most reviled people
is quite extraordinary
but nobody's as reviled in the American
propaganda system as much as refugees
fleeing from their life or their lives
from the countries we destroyed in the
South I don't have to tell you about it
it's shocking but there are groups here
in Tucson one group called No More
Deaths
mostly mostly young people some others
will go out into the desert which is
very harsh forbidding set up camps where
refugees can come to receive a little
medical aid a little food a place to
rest send them on their journey through
the territories controlled but very
brutal border controls they leave the
bottles of water in the desert which is
a crying summer brought to court
interestingly in this in this city
itself there's a fair amount of
solidarity
when they're broke try there's been a
couple of federal trials recently one of
going now and the support for the
defendants is pretty strong you drive
around the city you see on people's
lawns a sign saying the humanitarian age
it's not a crime in fact in the major
federal trial just a couple of months
ago there was a guy on trial who've had
a felony charge was possible 20-year
sentence for getting assistance to
people fleeing for the pride to survive
in the desert spot Warren yeah he came
it was a jury trial it was free by the
jury by two to one that's a local people
know hearing the standard propaganda
about these rapists and robbers and
kilometres and murderers coming to kill
us but you have that but you have the
opposite to of course but it does again
our examples of spontaneous dedicated
very courageous international solidarity
my wife Larry and I visited one of these
camps and who wants to go out in the
desert before it was dismantled by the
Border Patrol and it was pretty
impressive very primitive his quarters
meant little possibility for some help
and succour salvation for the desperate
people yeah there is no more just doing
amazing work thanks for sharing that my
next question is uh with a recent
escalation in Iran people are having
recollections of the anti rock protests
which were the largest in history and
didn't stop the war you've mentioned an
important overlooked part of the
Pentagon Papers is towards the end where
advisors word out of protest kept
escalating in the US troops we need to
leave Vietnam to fight protesters or
poor peace in the US my question is what
does an effective anti-war protest look
like in this current age well you know I
think that is a part of the Pentagon
Papers which is almost never mentioned
it's the very last part of the Pentagon
Papers and when the after the Tet
Offensive in South Vietnam when the
government Lyndon Johnson was thinking
of sending a couple hundred thousand
more troops and the Joint Chiefs of
Staff were opposed they were concerned
that they need them for civil disorder
control in the United States there's
also mounting evidence it's first
brought to attention by Dan Ellsberg
because no more evidence for the Nixon
administration was thinking seriously
his nuclear weapons vote was talked out
of it essentially by the massive
anti-war demonstrations in Washington
after the Tet Offensive that the
government began to slowly isn't
disentangle itself from the crimes and
Aegina the fighting continued but they
gradually started to deescalate the
1980s popular movement that I described
I think is actually an anti group an
outgrowth of the Vietnam anti-war move
there have been careful studies of
public opinion on the Vietnam War
starting in 1975 when it officially
ended going on for many years one of the
questions they asked was love different
topics one of them was people's opinion
about that he had not war and it's
pretty surprising when you look at it
turns out that about over thoroughly
seventy percent of the population
regarded the war as I'm quoting not a
mistake fundamentally wrong and immoral
there's a word you can't find in the
intellectual community the intellectual
journals except on the list
the public media each don't find that
but that's the public and that lasted
through the eighties certainly at least
by the poll by the studies and I think
it was considerable part of the
background for the general popular
movement of solidarity and direct
engagement in Central America it beat
back the Reagan's programs his initial
programs were to duplicate what the
United States had done in Vietnam but
they backed off pretty quickly because
they realized they can't get away with
it and a temper of the times when you
get to Iraq as you said it's the largest
demonstration in imperial history for
this but before the war was even
officially announced now it's generally
described as a failure but I don't
believe that I think and put constraints
on what the government could do it was
bad enough it was nothing like what
Kennedy and Johnson did in Vietnam
before any purpose develop so I think it
was a partial success in that respect
and I think we're seeing the same now
there's a wave of protest in the country
some of it you know visible and
demonstrations much of it just
detectable in people's general attitudes
just any they don't want them a little
room at least and maybe that'll have an
effect if it that's really up to people
like us activists and organizers you can
commit themselves to trying to turn this
from general attitude of discontent and
opposition to an active movement they're
not a very direct protest which will
change things
Freitas gotta take off
