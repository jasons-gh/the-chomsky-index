right after the Second World War the
business community the country was
social-democratic in a very social
democratic at that time and they knew it
and the business leaders said that they
had to renew with vigor what they called
the everlasting battle for the minds of
men and indoctrinate citizens with a
capitalist story the reason is the truth
is subversive it's anti-american it has
to be eliminated and it was destroyed
with a tremendous power play this
covered everything from the
entertainment industry to the corporate
media to the schools and so on billions
of dollars a year were devoted to this
taking over schools churches
recreational activities anything you
even think about the corporate media of
course you're right in the center of it
the entertain films were quite important
commercial films as well as propaganda
films
propaganda films were reaching twenty to
third business propaganda was reaching
twenty to thirty million people a year
in the early fifties business was
providing about a third of all school
material this was not a small thing on
top of that there's a whole commercial
industry like good you know the standard
depiction of unions in the movies is
sort of Marlon Brando on the waterfront
you know the tough working-class Joe
stands up against union bosses and you
know because that's and unions in fact
word portrayed as some has something
that the workers have to fight against a
huge amount of energy and effort was put
into this it was pretty successful this
picked up again in the 1970s is another
upsurge with foundations trying to take
over the educational institutions you
know Olin professorships of free
enterprise and glossy right-wing student
magazine
is very well-funded all over the place
and so on and so forth it's left its had
an effect the effect has been to pretty
much demolished civil society to turn
people into what is the ideal the ideals
very clear the ideal is a completely
fragmented atomized society where
everyone's totally alone doing nothing
but trying to pursue created once and
the wants are created that's known that
they're created nobody wants those
things you created once people are stuck
with their television set or you know
they're interactive whatever it is and
they they're glued to this thing and
they're told what they want and they
have to want it they're not any
connection with anyone else you know you
don't see anybody else you don't deal
with anyone else you're an atom of
consumption and you go to work get lower
and lower wages for more and more hours
and less and less benefits and security
in a flexible labor market that's the
kind of utopia that they're looking for
and it's not very far from there it's
led to very strange effects in the
country I mean the country is like a
devastated peasant Society you know you
really have to go back to Europe and
then black death I think 14th century to
find anything similar people are scared
angry hostile hate everything don't know
what they hate you know don't have
anybody else to talk to just angry
desperate their cults all over the place
at a scale that is unknown in any other
society I mean you have to you
the level of religious fundamentalism
alone is probably the highest in the
world its I'm almost certain higher than
Iran you know and that's the only one of
them you know the people right now the
militias happened to be on the front
pages but that's just a tiny fragment of
it and which it's only not the rightful
it is the same you know it's across the
board it's just a dissolve society very
scary it's the the important is ominous
you know it's the kind of a situation
and it's a kind of a situation which is
indeed reminiscent of Germany in the
late 30s in a lot of ways or Iran in the
late seventies you know at the same time
is it kind of an you know it's the kind
of an organizers dream you know people
if you look at people's attitudes they
remain social democratic like you know
people are overwhelmingly believes that
working people ought to have more
influence there aren't enough that that
the government ought to help poor people
that's its job you know that people are
overwhelmingly opposed to things like
budget-balancing if for example it's
going to cut down educational or health
expenditure and so on across the board
as I said the matter because it's
irrelevant to policy they do what they
like but it's a situation in which the
opportunities for organizing and
rebuilding a democratic culture are very
very high and it can be done but it's
certainly not going to happen by itself
it's gonna happen the saint's take the
same kind of energy and activism that
it's taken to lift us out of the
feudalism and slavery and every other
power in the past what has been created
by this half-century of
massive corporate propaganda is what's
called anti politics so anything that
goes wrong you blame the government well
okay there's plenty to blame the
government about but the government is
the one institution in which that people
can change
so one institution you can affect by
participation without institutional
change right that's exactly why all the
anger and fear is directed against the
government the government has a defect
it's potentially Democratic corporations
have no defect
they're pure tyrannies so therefore you
want to keep corporations invisible and
focus all anger on the government so you
don't like something you know your wages
are going down blame the government you
know not blame the guys in the fortune
500 because you don't read the fortune
500 you know the thing you just read
what they tell you in the newspapers you
know read about the dazzling profits and
the stupendous this and the wages going
down and so on all you know is that the
bad government's doing something
thoughts get mad at the government as I
say plenty to be mad about about the
government but the government is exactly
what do we described it as it's the
shadow cast by business over Society you
want to change something change the
substance not to shadow and everyone
contributes to this including the
Democrats they're deeply committed to
you take a look at the Clinton campaign
literature it's it's like you know it's
a public relied on oh what public
relations firm wrote it but whatever one
did it understands their business the
thing that they were getting out at the
drugstores you know 10 cents for their
mandate for change as they called it
incidentally a slogan that they borrowed
from Eisenhower it shows how much change
they contemplated the
the first chapter of it was called
entrepreneurial economics and that was
their big economic program I explained
how these then we're not old-fashioned
liberals you know believe in
entitlements getting children food to
eat and that sort of thing we're
interested in entrepreneurial economics
and they go on to describe it and it's
very really carefully very interesting
to see how the mind of the commissar
works the way it works is like this
entrepreneurial economics involves
workers and their firms it's all about
workers and their firms you know anybody
who works in the firm you can tell you
how much it's their firms
so there's workers and their firms and
then there's the government which is
going to try to help out the workers and
their firms the work there's a couple of
words that don't appear in like profits
you know bosses managers they're not
investors banks they don't appear it's
just the workers and their firms there
are entrepreneurs who have a kind of a
shadowy existence they're sort of nice
guys who live in a slum school or
somewhere and every once in a while they
come around and they sort of help out
the workers and their firms and then
they cannot even disappear somewhere and
that's the economic that's
entrepreneurial economics well ok you
know that's the kind of thing you're
taught to do in good universities to put
things that way and that's the Democrats
know when you got that on one side and
on the other side you got you know I
hate the government because they're
responsible for everything and it's
taxes and the the pointy-headed
bureaucrats in Washington but not the
ones in the insurance offices you end up
with a mood of what is called anti
politics and any politics is a very
scary phenomenon it can take the form of
that it is taking you know
forming what shouldn't be called
malicious because remember militias are
things raised by States these are just
private armies forming private armies to
defend the country the people against
you know the UN forces being brought in
and the black helicopters by the Council
on Foreign Relations to commit genocide
or whatever story alike or else it's you
know fight against Lucifer and beast 66
who's doing this that and the other
thing and that's what if you take a look
across the country that's what people
are worried about and fighting against
aliens you know the devil the UN forces
the federal reserve I mean everything
except what's real namely private
corporate private tyranny private
corporate power the guys who are listed
in the fortune 500 well that's an
achievement
that's a propaganda achievement and
while the anger and the fear is real and
it's based on something and you got to
sympathize with it because it is real
when your wages have dropped 25 percent
roughly and say 15 years and you know
your wife has to work and your kids
can't eat and so on and so forth you
have no future and everything's rotten
you know a lot to be angry about but
people are not focused on what's doing
that's the difference between the days
in which there was a live functioning
labor movement that was organizing these
people
