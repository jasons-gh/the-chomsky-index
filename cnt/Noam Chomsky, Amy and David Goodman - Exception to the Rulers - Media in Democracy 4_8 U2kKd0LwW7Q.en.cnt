and without any warning or provocation
or hesitation they rounded the corner
they swept past us and they opened fire
on the crowd gunning people down from
right to left the first to go down a boy
behind us with his hands in the V sine
and the soldiers just kept shooting they
beat me to the ground Ellen Thrones to
himself on top of me to protect me from
further injury and they took their us
m16s like baseball bats and they slam
them against a skull until they
fractured it we were lying in the ground
they were killing everyone around us
they put the guns to our heads a group
of them and they were shouting politique
politique because to bear witness is
political to witness such a crime and
then they started shouting Australia
Australia because 17 years before right
before the invasion there were six
journalists working for two Australian
TV crews that were covering the events
leading up to the invasion they lined up
five against a house and they executed
them the sixth Roger East the day after
the invasion reporting for the world
about what was happening from a radio
station in dili they dragged him out of
the radio station and as he shouted I'm
from Australia they shot him into the
harbor and so there they were shouting
Australia where we from Australia we
said no AMERICA AMERICA not after the
journalists were killed in 75 the
Australian Government hardly raised a
peep protest maybe that was explained by
several years later the Australian and
Indonesian foreign ministers wrote in a
plane over the team or gap and they
signed a treaty that divided up the oil
spoils not with Timor but between
Indonesia and Australia oil has caused
so much pain in the world so we lie on
the ground Alan was covered in blood
we're saying AMERICA AMERICA they'd
stripped us of everything he only had my
passport left and I threw it at them and
at some point they decided to take the
guns from her heads maybe because we
were from the same country their weapons
were from they'd have to pay a price for
killing us that they'd never had to pay
for killing the timorous and they moved
on and they killed so many to marie's
they killed more than 270 to marie's a
Red Cross jeep pulled up we were able to
get in it dozens of to marie's jumped on
top of us and on top of the
cheap and we drove like that as a human
mass to the hospital when we got there
the doctors and nurses who saw started
to cry not because we were in worse
shape than the timorous but because I
think of what we represent to not only
the people of Timor but people all over
the world we represent the sword and the
shield the sword because we provide so
many weapons to so many repressive
regimes in the world or the US
government uses them themselves but we
also represent the shield and that
shield and that day was bloody and it
just deepened their despair what we do
in this country makes such an enormous
difference to the rest of the world I
recently interviewed a woman from Guyana
on Democracy Now about globalization and
after the conversation I said thank you
very much and we were going to go on to
a conversation about the u.s. elections
and she said I'll be staying for that
conversation I said well no we're done
with this conversation global as I
should know I'm going to be a part of
your conversation the u.s. elections I
said why she said because I believe
everyone in the world should get to vote
for president of the United States but
what we do in this country really does
matter ten years later the temari's
though suffering an unbelievably high
price ultimately did win their freedom
they got to vote in 1999 for their
independence and in May nineteenth
twentieth two thousand two Ellen Erin
and I returned to celebrate with the
people of East Timor May nineteenth at
midnight hundred thousand people at
osito low a sandy plain outside of dilly
they gathered they watched the rebel
leader now the founding president of
East Timor ascend the stage and on a
goose mouth and raise the flag of the
Democratic Republic of East team Wars
the fireworks went off the to marie's
looked up and you could see the light
reflected in their tier stained faces
this nation of survivors had prevailed
and an unbelievably high price but they
had resisted and they had one it is a
lesson to all of us that persistence
that kind of unbelievable struggle but
with a solidarity of people all over the
world does make a difference and that
people right here in this country who
organized for many years to help the
people of timor an amazing organization
called the east timor action network
that lobbied and educated people and so
many others learned and wrote to
congress members and even went east
timor and did things that all of them
taught us that it really does make a
difference what we do every day that we
have a decision to make in every action
every hour of every day whether we want
to represent the sword or the shield
democracy now thank you the New York
Times once called Noam Chomsky arguably
the most important intellectual alive
he's the author of some 70 books and
ranks with Mark Shakespeare and the
Bible among the 10 most quoted sources
in the humanities of all time
in a lengthy profile last year the new
yorker called him one of the greatest
minds of the 20th century and one of the
most reviled of course professor Chomsky
has had a few choice words about the
news media as well but i will leave
those to him welcome to the cambridge
forum Noam Chomsky
is this going to work or do I have to go
through Amy's routine can you can you
hear me oh great so I'll leave it there
well I was asked by John grebe who's
around here somewhere to inform you that
he's he's running democracy now on the
radio at the Boston College campus
community radio and they're trying to
gain support to keep it going there
should be some forms going around and if
there are according to this announcement
there are and he asked me to ask you and
I'm glad to do so that you sign the
forms there either in the audience or
table by the door and if you have any
Boston College affiliation to indicate
that on the on the form as well so
that's a way to overcome the fact that
this is one of the few cities important
cities where it's very hard to hear
democracy now have to work and that's
shame because ought to be available I
understand from John that the station
there has a pretty wydad outreach so if
it does get played should be heard
around much of the city so I urge you to
do that well I guess the next thing I
have to do the way I'm reluctant to do
it is get involved in a family quarrel
that's always a bad mistake and I could
evade it by saying truthfully that I
never knew anybody named George Goodman
actually did know somebody named
gedaliah Goodman who that may be who
they're referring to I don't know if
they know his name actually he and I
were campers together not counselors at
a hebrew-speaking camp but anyone who
thinks it through should know that that
story can't be correct because it was
also a kosher can
and you're not allowed to take a bite
out of a live animal that's so that
couldn't happen but he was the best
quarter mile ER in the camp I can tell
you that well I thought a since I
figured they'd be slamming the media as
a counterpoint I ought to defend the
media so pick that a couple of stories
from today's paper and yesterday's paper
just to show you he can learn from the
meeting actually one of the things you
can learn is what we're all missing
right now according to the Boston Globe
this morning there's a PBS Frontline
documentary running right now which is
headlined I only have the description of
it in the patents morning's paper a
timely look at how faith informs Bush
presidency and if you haven't looked at
it you should I can't blow it up but the
picture here of George very serious look
carefully telling us what we're supposed
to believe and behind him is a painting
of the Jesus I guess it's Jesus Christ
kind of like this George carefully
placed right beneath him pastel colors
those are you have travel to Europe no
it's the kind of cheap reproduction that
they sell for a dime or something
outside of you know on the street and
Italy but it's to convey the profound
commitment of the president to faith and
it's about says about his spiritual
development and this solid linear piece
which your meeting missing is timely for
the presidential campaign and relevant
to the bush messianic mission to graph
democracy on to the rest of the world
notice that's a fact right this is
described as a fact there is bush
messianic mission to graft democracy on
to the rest of the world and we know
that it's fact because we have evidence
for it the evidence is that he said so
in fact if you examine it you'll notice
that's the total evidence but I
obviously haven't read everything but
ever since you know when the pretext for
the invasion of iraq began to collapse
and you needed some new ones the new one
turned out to be bush's messianic
mission to graft democracy on to the
rest of the world that was affirmed by
the president in a visionary speech I
don't know if they had Christ standing
over him then at the National Endowment
for democracy last November and I out of
curiosity read as much as I could of the
reporting and commentary after that and
believe it or not I have yet to find one
report news report or commentary that
doesn't take it for granted proposed
that this was in fact the goal and there
are critics plenty of critics the
critics say it's a noble and generous
messianic mission but it's beyond it
reach or maybe those people aren't ready
for it or it'll cost us too much or
something but I've been looking pretty
hard and asking other people to look to
see if they can find anyone who
questions that this is the mission it's
pretty remarkable because if you believe
that that is the mission you have to
assume that George Bush and Tony Blair
are some of the most accomplished liars
and history after all they were telling
us straight out that does wish put it
the single question is whether Saddam
Hussein is going to get rid of those
weapons of mass destruction with which
he's threatening us and end his ties
with al-qaeda that's the single question
but it turns out that was all a lie and
that it was really messianic mission to
bring democracy to the Middle East and
the independent
adversarial media have two and
commentators because this is all over
the intellectual culture it's not just
immediate have to quickly shift gears
and find that oh yeah this was the
mission all along and the fact that they
were lying to us before we sort of
forgot about it's even farther back than
Honduras yes whatever that was and we
have to believe in this one almost
everyone does in fact if you read that
article carefully you find you really
can learn things from the media so the
article talks about how bushes spiritual
development took place and it turns out
that the crucial change was when he was
working on his father's campaign in 1987
as a link between the campaign and
evangelical community and he was reading
all the memoranda that were passing
through and had a spiritual awakening he
realized that if you appeal to the
evangelicals in the country pretending
to be religious then you know I could do
this in Texas and become governor and
then another commentator says advisor to
Bush the elders as that the message did
come home after the election he said my
god you could win the white house with
nothing but evangelicals so that's a
real spiritual conversion and we
can see that there was a profound change
in his conception of the world and
therefore it's quite right that he
should be facing us with the portrait of
the painting of Christ in the background
well that's what you're missing right
now so sorry can I give you Secondhand
