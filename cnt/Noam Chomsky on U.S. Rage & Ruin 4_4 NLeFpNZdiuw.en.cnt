it almost gets a little scary to me you
can't clothe house or feed everyone
somebody has to pay for that and you
know a few things that I kind of kind of
live by the strong survive the weaker at
their mercy for for the most part in the
world that's how nature it is in the
world will always be that way and a poor
man without capital never started a
company and hired five hundred to a
thousand people and gave them job that
allowed them to raise the family you
know buy a house such as it may be and
the biggest thing nowadays it really
hurts me and I just want to go on record
as Tracy Lehman saying this today man
cause global warming is the largest hoax
ever perpetrated on the American public
global warming and cooling has been
going on for millions of years predating
the dinosaur and for man to think we are
the driving cause of disarming cycle is
ludicrous Tracy let us grab it right
there and give to Noam Chomsky there's a
world view it is not a rare one in this
country how do you respond
it is not a rare one trait what Tracy's
just out Louisville warming well on
global warming on the way in economy
works the strong survive go to a tea
party rally I think you need fires and
that's why every republican senatorial
candidate accorded the last studies
denies the overwhelming consensus of the
scientific community very much as the
caller does and they're just flatly
wrong I mean if you look at the global
warming question there are basically
three positions only two of them
represented in media debate the one is
the you read a debate and a New York
Times it if it talks about the
scientific consensus and the deniers so
ninety-eight percent of scientists is
one half and a fringe and a couple of
senators is the other half there's a
third component which is missing
that's the many scientists right at MIT
for example who argue that the consensus
is wrong because it's nowhere near
serious enough it's much worse than what
they say there was a big study done by
MIT scientists recently the most
comprehensive model II ever done
they did extremely dire forecasts and
say that unless we cut fossil fuels very
rapidly our grandchildren are going to
live in a system that's disastrous Tracy
they I'm sorry the professor but our
time so short and Tracy there's
something there's a the Chomsky view for
you to chew on I appreciate your call
Mike and Albemarle North Carolina Mike
you're on with Noam Chomsky I would like
to thank you professor Chomsky for your
enlightening works your writing your
stars of empire which I've read in my
history classroom I was a history
teacher for 35 years in which teachers
well in high school and I got in trouble
for being way over there with you but I
support you wholeheartedly at my
question I have two parts to two
questions one why can't the Left come up
with a viable leader who can be honest
about about everything starting with was
with the environment was with with
fossil fuel depletion and resource
scarcity yeah in question to Mike our
time is short my friend and secondly why
can't there be a democratic socialist
party in this country where people's
interests are you know how can so many
people be led to vote you're directly
against their own interests in this
country and duped by these the nonsense
of denying global warming and the lies
about Obama and everything it just seems
as though there there needs to be a
truth mission here and then Mike thanks
for your call we've got just two minutes
noam chomsky there's the big questions
it's a very big question it goes way
back first century it's been asked why
is there no left party was there no
socialist movement and so on and there
are a lot of reasons first of all it's
not entirely true so they say the New
Deal and Johnson Lyndon Johnson's Great
Society they were what in Europe would
be called social democratic movements we
don't call them that here for all kind
of ideological reasons and if you look
at say participation in activism on the
environment on civil rights on many of
anti-war
and so on it's probably greater now in
the United States than it was any time
in since the 30s a little bump in the
1960s but it's a very substantial on the
other hand this is to an unusual extent
a business run society it's different
from Europe in that respect there are a
lot of historical reasons for it a lot
of it has to do with the fact that this
country didn't grow out of feudalism
which left some institutions of social
support you might remember that the
first major welfare state was Bismarck
in Germany coming out of feudal
background we were not like that this
was a society of immigrants it
effectively exterminated the indigenous
population spread over the country
plenty of government support all the way
through contrary to mythology and it was
a very rich country a lot of the
resources it was possible to grow and
develop with serious crises but with a
substantial business sector dominating
it we've got half a minute less than
that what's your best hope looking
forward or do you have one the best hope
I think is something like what happened
in the 1930s I mean after several years
of deep depression and it was quite a
few years there was a popular revival
the core of it was Labor organizing and
unless that's done there won't be much
of much progress I don't think that it
can be done I don't think it's you
couldn't have predicted in 1932 that you
were going to get the CIO organized well
maybe that won't happen Noam Chomsky
eighty-one years old and still in there
wailing away professor Chomsky thank you
very much for being with us today Thanks
listeners thanks for your calls and your
questions thanks for joining us today
I'm Tom Ashbrook this is on point
