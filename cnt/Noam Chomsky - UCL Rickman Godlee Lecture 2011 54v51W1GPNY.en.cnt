when we settled on the title for this
talk some time ago few would have
guessed how act it would be when the
time came that is how dramatically the
world would be changing and how
far-reaching are the implications and
consequences for a domestic and world
order the democracy uprising in the Arab
world has been a spectacular display of
courage dedication and commitment to by
popular forces it coincided fortuitously
with a remarkable uprising also
unexpected of tens of thousands of
people and support of working people and
democracy in Madison Wisconsin and other
US cities in fact one telling event
occurred on February 20th when Kemal
Abbas sent a message from Tahrir Square
in Cairo to Wisconsin workers saying we
stand with you as you stood with us
Abbas is a leading figure and the has
been and the many years of struggle of
Egyptian workers for elementary rights
what's happened since January 21st did
did not come out of nowhere
in fact the April 6th movement which
organized it the movement of young
people tech-savvy young people that took
its name April 6th from a major strike
action support action in the big
industrial center textile industrial
center of Egypt mahalo center of the
couple of years ago that was crushed by
force but it was April 6 and that is the
name for the movement that erupted
unexpectedly even the organizers on
January 25th
he Abbas's message of solidarity evoked
the traditional aspiration of labour
movements worldwide for solidarity among
the workers of the world and among
populations generally well however
flawed their record labor movements have
regularly been in the forefront of
popular struggles for both basic rights
including labor rights and democracy
generally in Tahrir Square and the
streets of Madison and many other places
the popular struggles underway right now
that reached quite directly to the
prospects for authentic democracy that
means socio-political systems in which
people are free and equal participants
in controlling the institutions in which
they live and work and I stress
participants and not mere spectators
that's the way democratic theory has
insisted is their function as it's
called the function of the public the
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders to
quote the walter Lippmann the most
prominent 20th century American public
intellectual wilson roosevelt
progressive is there in his highly
regarded progressive essays on democracy
and he was articulating a standard view
which actually traces back to the
founders of the US Constitution and is
upheld of course in much harsher forms
elsewhere
right now the trajectories in Cairo and
Madison are intersecting in a way but
they're headed in opposite directions in
Cairo they're headed towards eliminating
towards gaining basic rights that had
been denied by the western-backed
dictatorships
in Madison they're heading towards
trying to defend rights that had been
won in long and hard struggles and are
now under series attack they're sure to
be far ranging consequences of what's
taking place both in the decaying
industrial heartland of the richest and
most powerful country in the world in
human history in fact and in what
President Eisenhower called the most
strategically important area of the
world
a stupendous source of strategic power
and probably the richest economic prize
in the world in the future in the field
of foreign investment
those are the words of the State
Department in the 1940s that was a prize
of course that the u.s. intended to keep
for itself
and for its allies in the unfolding a
new world order that was emerging from
the ruins of the Second World War the
different plenty of changes since but
the strike despite all these dramatic
changes there's every reason to suspect
suppose that today's policymakers
basically adopt the same perspective
they undoubtedly still adhere to the
judgment of one of the most more
influential advisors of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt a burly and his words that
control of the incomparable energy
reserves of the Middle East would yield
substantial control of the world and
correspondingly loss of control would
threaten the project of global dominance
that was clearly articulated during
World War two by high-level planners and
that has been sustained in the face of
major changes in world order since that
day
these common understanding is as is
quite often the case
articulated most frankly and clearly in
the business press in the u.s. in the
Wall Street Journal where they're
meeting political correspondent charged
old side I commented a couple of days
ago that there's a big problem in the
Middle East we have not yet learned how
to control the new forces that are
emerging the assumption is well of
course we have to control them that's
our right to their duties that we have
to learn how from the outset of the war
Second World War in 1939 Washington
anticipated that it that the war would
end with the United States in a position
of overwhelming power high-level State
Department officials and non
governmental foreign policy speculate
specialists met regularly through the
wartime years they laid out plans for
the post-war world they delineate it
what they called a grand area that the
US was to dominate the grand area was to
include at least the Western Hemisphere
the entire Far East and the British
Empire which the US was planning to take
over including the US Middle East energy
resources the British Foreign Office was
aware of this if you look at their
documents not very happy about it but I
said we're gonna have to recognize
they're gonna be a junior partner they
called as an evolving worth World Order
the well that was in the early years of
the of the war as Russian forces started
to grind down the Nazi armies after
Stalingrad the conception of the grand
area was enlarged to include as much of
Eurasia as possible including certainly
the industrial and commercial center the
heartland of Western Europe now within
the grand area and now quoting within
the grand area the US was to maintain
unquestioned power with military and
economic supremacy while ensuring the
limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by states that might
interfere with its global designs that's
a live policy right now I'll come back
to crucial instances when should bear in
mind how venerable the doctrine is and
how appropriate to the nature of the
world that was in fact emerging have to
remember that when the Second World War
ended the u.s. literally had half the
world's wealth a position of power of
security that was totally unparalleled
nothing like it in history and that was
understood it's quite clear from the
documentary record I'm quoting now that
President Roosevelt was aiming at United
States hegemony in the post-war world
that's quoting the British diplomatic
historian Jeffrey Warner quite an
accurate assessment and more significant
the careful wartime plans were
implemented in very much the terms in
which they were outlined during the war
they were implemented shortly after well
it was always recognized from the
beginning that Europe might choose to
follow an independent path
NATO was partially intended to counter
this threat and rather strikingly as
soon as the official pretext for NATO
you know protecting Europe from the
Russian hordes as soon as that dissolved
in 1989 reflexively NATO was expanded if
anyone had believed the propaganda it
should have disappeared
instead it expanded one of the
interesting things that happened in 1989
is a lot of clouds lifted we could sort
of see policies less concealed by
ideology so natives expanded to the east
that was in violation of verbal pledges
to Gorbachev
he was naive enough to believe he's
pretty irritated by it that nothing you
could do and it's since been expanded
beyond now it's a us run global
intervention force and it has an
official task the official task is
controlling the crucial infrastructure
of the global energy system that's quite
an expansive role and that's what NATO
is now committed to the grand area
doctrine limits the sovereignty of
others explicitly but it grants the
United States unrestricted rights that's
what it means to be a global hegemon and
that was made very clear that explicit
at once for example in 1946 when the
u.s. agreed to world court jurisdiction
but with a condition the condition was
that the United States would not be
subject to any international treaties
meaning the UN Charter the charter of
the Organization of American States
later the Genocide Convention and so on
that that this has come up before the
court repeatedly and the court has
accepted and as it was required to do
the reservation that none of these
treaties apply to the United States the
principles also clearly license military
intervention at will and that conclusion
has been clearly not not only
implemented
continuously but also pretty clearly
articulated that one tends to think of
the right wing administration's but
that's misleading one of the most
expansive forms of the doctrine was
under Clinton in fact Bill Clinton the
Clinton administration declared quote
that the United States has the right to
use military force unilaterally to
ensure uninhibited access
two key markets energy supplies and
strategic resources and must maintain
military forces forward deployed in
Europe and Asia in order to shape
people's opinions about us and to shape
events that will affect their livelihood
in our security that's actually much
more expansive than the much-maligned
george w bush doctrine they came later
the Clinton doctrine doesn't even
require the pretexts that the Bush
Doctrine insisted on but it was
presented politely so therefore didn't
arouse much interest actually the
antagonism towards bush was almost
entirely style not substance the
substance is pretty standard the I think
that's one of the reasons Obama was so
welcomed in Europe the style changed not
the substance the same principles
governed the invasion of Iraq that
became clearer as the u.s. failure to
impose its will became clearer that as
that preceded the actual goals of the
invasion couldn't be concealed any
longer behind pretty rhetoric about you
know democracy and all sorts of nice
things in November 2007 the White House
issued what it called a declaration of
principles concerning Iraq two main
points the one was that US forces must
remain indefinitely in Iraq big military
bases right to carry out combat
operations and secondly that Iraq must
privilege us investors two months later
January 2008 President Bush informed
Congress that he would reject
legislation that might limit the
permanent stationing of US Armed Forces
in Iraq or US control of the oil
resources of
I'm quoting the these are demands
incidentally that the United States had
to abandon shortly after in the face of
Iraqi resistance as it had been forced
to back off step-by-step all the way
through that's a major triumph of
nonviolent resistance that the US and
Britain have no trouble at all killing
insurgents they're very good at killing
people but they couldn't deal with the
mass nonviolent resistance the hundreds
of thousands of people were
demonstrating and protesting so I had to
back off and finally the basic war aims
were abandoned articulated pretty
clearly as they were being abandoned
that's a major defeat as Jonathan Steele
and other serious analysts have
recognized in Tunisia and Egypt today
the popular uprising has scored quite
impressive victories but as the Carnegie
Endowment reported a few days ago its
research group while names have changed
the regime's remain the as they point
out a change in ruling it elites and the
system of governance is still a distant
goal maybe it'll be achieved maybe not
it's not going to be easy the report
discusses a variety of internal barriers
to such changes to democracy but it
ignores as usual the external barriers
which as always are quite significant
the United States and its Western Allies
are assured to do whatever they can to
prevent authentic democracy in the Arab
world and the very simple reasons for
that to understand why it's only
necessary to look at the studies of Arab
opinion which are conducted by the most
prestigious US polling agencies released
by a major institutions like the
Brookings Institution they reveal that
by overwhelming majorities
Arabs regard the US and Israel as the
major threats they face the United State
the United States is regarded as the
major threat by ninety percent of
Egyptians in the region generally not
much less than that
some regard Iran as a threat 10%
opposition to US policy is so strong
that a majority believe that the region
would be that security would be improved
for the region if Iran had nuclear
weapons in Egypt that's 80 percent other
figures are similar if public opinion
were to influence policy the United
States would not only not control the
region but it would be expelled from it
Britain as well along with its allies
that would undermine fundamental
principles of global domination that
have been operative in their current
form since the Second World War and as
far as Britain's concerned back long
before then in general support for
democracy is the province of ideologists
and propagandists in the real world as
the more serious scholarship that's
conceded the US and its allies support
democracy if and only if it corresponds
to strategic and economic objectives
actually Stalin could have said the same
thing
elite contempt for democracy was
revealed very dramatically in the
reaction to the recent WikiLeaks
exposures the ones that received the
most attention with euphoric commentary
were the cables that reported that Arab
support the US stand on Iran really
important and the reference was
reflexively to the ruling dictators the
attitudes of the public were unmentioned
the guiding principle behind this
apart from the obvious contempt for
democracy on the part of the general
intellectual community the guiding
principle was articulated quite clearly
by a Carnegie Endowment Middle East
specialist and Marwan washer he's
formerly a high official of the
Jordanian dictatorship the principle is
there's nothing wrong everything is
under control in short as long as the
dictators support us
what else could matter the more assured
doctrine is rational and venerable to
mention just one case that's highly
relevant today and my opinion ought to
be in the front pages in 1958 President
Eisenhower expressed an internal
discussion since Declassified he
expressed concern about what he called
the campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and not by governments but by
the people the National Security Council
explained at the same time the reasons
for it is the highest planning body they
said there's a perception in the Arab
world that the United States supports
dictatorships and blocks democracy and
development and that we do that so as to
ensure control over the resources of the
region and furthermore they went on to
say that the perception is basically
accurate and that that's exactly what we
should be doing relying on the bellagio
doctrine as long as people are quiet
everything's under control
it's fine the after 9/11 there were
internal government studies US
government studies which confirmed that
the same is true they responded to
george w bush's plaintive plea that they
hate our freedoms they concluded that no
they don't hate our freedoms though they
hate our policies and with good reason
same reason they did in the 1950s
actually 1958 was a particularly
interesting moment because that was just
two years after Eisenhower had expelled
Britain France and Israel from Egyptian
territory that not incidentally because
he disapproved of the invasion thought
that was okay but the timing was bad and
interfered with a u.s. planned coup in
Syria and he didn't like the
disobedience the Britain France and
Israel are supposed to understand who's
boss and not to carry out operations
like this without informing the Masters
so they were summarily expelled and you
might have guessed that our public
opinion would be favorable to the US
after this but and they perceived things
a little more deeply than Western
ideologist so yes there was a campaign
of hatred for the reasons that the NSC
the National Security Council
articulated the current polls which I
mentioned indicate that how little
anything has changed in this regard not
at all in fact well it's if we look back
a little farther to history there are
some lessons there too it's quite normal
for the victors to regard history as
bunk
you know consign it to the trash can who
cares let's look ahead it's also quite
normal for the victims to take history
seriously for pretty good reasons there
just make a few observations it's a very
important matter I'll just barely touch
it but to be useful to think about it a
little today is actually not the first
occasion when Egypt and the United
States are in somewhat similar
situations the that was also true in the
early part of the 19th century economic
historians have argued that in that at
that time say around 1830 Egypt was
well-placed to undertake rapid economic
development about the same time the US
was beginning to do so both Egypt in the
US had rich agriculture that included
cotton
which is sort of the oil of the 19th
century the fuel of the early Industrial
Revolution though there was a difference
unlike Egypt the United States had to
develop cotton production and a
workforce by conquest extermination and
slavery the consequences are still very
much alive all you have to do is take a
look at the reservations for the
survivors of the extermination program
and also at the prisons that have
expanded very rapidly since the Reagan
years and far beyond any other country
and the needed there needed to house the
superfluous population left over by the
industrialization there's a pretty close
race class correlation so it ends up
being largely black it's some extent
Hispanic there was however one
fundamental difference between Egypt in
the United States at that time the
United States had gained independence
and it was there for free to ignore the
prescriptions of economic theory they
were delivered at the time by Adam Smith
in terms quite similar to those that are
prescribed forced sometimes for the so
called developing societies today Smith
right away urged the at the time of the
war of independence he urged the
liberated colonies to produce primary
products for export and to import
superior British manufacturers and
certainly not to monopolize crucial
goods like particularly cotton any other
path he said would retard instead of
accelerating the further increase in the
value of their annual produce and would
obstruct instead of promoting the
progress of their country towards real
wealth and greatness familiar words
bless it was elegantly today but same
Sims same prescriptions
well the colonies have gained their
independence and so therefore they were
free to ignore the principles of sound
economics and they were able to follow
England's own course of state guided
independent development this was in fact
the case
and so the colonies right away imposed
hype very high tariffs to protect
industry from superior British exports
at first textiles later steel and others
and a range of other devices to
accelerate economic development the
independent republic also proceeded to
try to gain a monopoly of cotton that
was the primary goal behind the conquest
of Texas and conquest of half of Mexico
and the goal was quite explicit the
Jacksonian presidents explained that if
the United States could gain a monopoly
of cotton we could place all other
nations at our feet particularly the
British enemy which was the main
impediment to expansion that's why
Canada is still technically free of
becoming slowly incorporated by other
means the the for Egypt on the other
hand a comparable course was barred by
British power Lord Palmerston declared
that no ideas of fairness towards Egypt
or to stand in the way of such great and
paramount interests of Britain as
preserving its economic and political
hegemony he also expressed we called his
hate for the ignorant barbarian Muhammad
Ali modernizing leader who dared to seek
an independent course and the Britain
was able to deploy its fleet and its
financial power to terminate the egypt's
quest for in
pendants and economic development it's
policies like these incidentally that
are substantially responsible for the
divide that developed between what we
call the first in the third world they
were not very different in that period
after World War two the United States
replaced Britain as global hegemon and
the United States adopted exactly the
same stand the u.s. made it clear that
it would provide no aid to Egypt unless
Egypt that here giving standard rules
for the weak Adam Smith's prescriptions
IMF World Bank prescriptions the u.s. of
course continued to violate them but
that's according to the regular
principles as well so the u.s. imposed
high tariffs high tariffs on Egyptian
cotton to protect u.s. cotton production
and it led to a terrible dollar shortage
in Egypt that's the usual interpretation
of market principles going back
centuries market principles are kind of
like democracy you appeal to them when
they're useful disregard them when
they're harmful so it's not too
surprising that to see the campaign of
hatred against the United States that
concerned Eisenhower over fifty years
ago based on the recognition that the
United States like Britain France others
with the power to do so the United
States supports dictators blocks
democracy and development and does so
for quite understandable reasons in Adam
Smith's defense I should mention that he
recognized what would happen to Britain
if it adhere to the rules of sound
economics as there's what's now more or
less called neoliberalism he warned that
if British manufacturers merchants and
investors turned abroad they might
profit but England would suffer however
he felt that they would be guided by
what sometimes called a home bias they'd
prefer the home country so as if by an
invisible hand England would be spared
the ravages of a classical of economics
called economic rationality actually
that passage and wealth of nations is
pretty hard to miss it's the only
passage in which the famous phrase
invisible hands appears in a critique of
what we now call neoliberalism and a
warning against it the other leading
founder of classical economics David
Ricardo he drew pretty similar
conclusions he explained that he hoped
that home bias would quoting him now
would lead men of property to be
satisfied with the low rate of profits
in their own country rather than seek a
more advantageous employment for their
wealth in foreign nations speaking of
England of course and he said these are
feelings that I would be sorry to see
weakened putting aside their predictions
the instincts of the classical
economists were quite sound well going
back to coming back to today the
democracy uprisings in the Arab world
are pretty commonly compared to Eastern
Europe in 1989 but that's a rather
dubious comparison in 1989 the democracy
uprising was supported by Western powers
in accord with a standard doctrine that
democracy is fine if it satisfies
strategic and economic interest
furthermore the democracy uprisings were
tolerated by the dominant power in the
region by Russia almost exactly the
opposite of what's happening now there's
no Gorbachev in the West quite the
contrary
and Western power remains a hostile to
democracy in the Arab world and for
quite sound reasons those that I
mentioned so a more relevant comparison
than one would
is never drawn but I think it is more
relevant would be to events that were
taking place in US domains at exactly
the same time 1989 so for example a few
days after the fall of the Berlin Wall
and a leet Salvadoran battalion it was
fresh from renewed training in the John
F Kennedy School of Special Warfare in
North Carolina invaded the Jesuit
University in El Salvador and brutally
murdered six leading Latin American
intellectuals Jesuit priests along with
their housekeeper and their daughter all
under orders of the government which was
very closely linked to the United States
following direct orders that culminated
a decade of Horrors and which began when
the archbishop who was called the voice
for the voiceless that was assassinated
by much the same hands during that
period about 70,000 people were killed
in El Salvador overwhelmingly by the
u.s. armed and trained forces about
twice that number were killed elsewhere
in Central America and the same years
same source the primary targets were the
people's organizations fighting to
defend their most fundamental human
rights those are the words of the
assassinated archbishop days before he
was killed while saying mass pleading in
vain and letter to Jimmy Carter by
pleading for the end of US military aid
to the murderers Hunta to serious
scholarship in the West and of course to
the victims it's well known I'm quoting
now that between 1916 and the Soviet
collapse in 1990 the number of political
prisoners torture victims and executions
of non-violent political dissenters in
Latin America
vastly exceeded those in the Soviet
Union and East European satellites and I
can add of course the hundreds of
thousands of people who were simply
slaughtered all of this supported or
tolerated by Washington included many
religious martyrs such as those who
framed the horrible decade in El
Salvador and mass slaughter as well
watch I'm quoting well-known Latin
Americanist John cotesworth in the
recently published Cambridge history of
the Cold War at coasts worth picks the
Year 1960 for good reasons
there had been of course many similar
horrors and earlier years but the u.s.
crusade against democracy and human
rights in the Western Hemisphere
escalated very sharply the right at that
time right after vatican ii in 1962 the
nineteen that was a historic event the
words of distinguished theologian Hans
Bernd it assured in a new era in the
history of the Catholic Church the it
was an effort to restore the
Christianity of the Gospels that had
been what Christianity was in its first
few centuries which is why Christians
were persecuted but ended when the Roman
Empire took it over and turned it into
the Church of the persecutors not the
persecuted in the fourth century so this
was an attempt to restore the
Christianity of the Gospels and inspired
by that Latin American bishops adopted
what they called the preferential option
for the poor priests nuns laypersons
tried to take the radical pacifist
message of the Gospels to the poor and
the persecuted of the hemisphere people
who were and try to organize them and we
were called based communities and urged
them and tried to help them
take their fate in their own hands and
work together to overcome the misery of
survival in the harsh realms of us power
this was recognised it wants to be an
intolerable heresy and the reaction was
very Swift the Kennedy administration
immediately helped install a vicious
national security state in Brazil
plagued them spread throughout the
continent in ways which should be
familiar it culminated exactly when the
Berlin Wall fell these events have been
disappeared to borrow the terminology
used in Latin America they suffer from a
fallacy the fallacy of wrong agency that
we carried them out therefore they
cannot be in history and you don't study
them in school you know read about them
people write about them and so on we
write about our nobility and supporting
the Eastern European dissidents who
surely suffered but not even remotely
like what was going on in our own
domains and I should add that horrible
as these events were they're barely a
pee on a mountain as compared with other
crimes in that period notably the
Indochina wars that followed from
Kennedy's invasion of South Vietnam
almost exactly 50 years ago it's also
been disappeared for the same reasons
fallacy of wrong agency a careful look
reveals that the grand area doctrines
continue to apply to contemporary crises
take what's considered the main one in
western policymaking circles and among
political commentators the Iranian
threat is considered to pose the
greatest danger to world order and hence
must be the primary focus of u.s.
foreign policy
Europe's trailing along politely as
usual this year is called the year of
the grant
because of the danger of that enormous
threat which does raise a question what
exactly is the Iranian threat you read
the public commentary you don't get much
of an answer but there actually is an
authoritative answer which is ignored
the authoritative answer is provided by
the regular reports to Congress by the
Pentagon and US intelligence agencies
come every year reports on the global
global security and of course they
include a section on Iran most recent
was almost a year ago other reports make
it very clear that whatever the Iranian
threat is it's not military it's a
little quote Iran's military spending is
relatively low compared to the rest of
the region
in fact it's less than a quarter of that
of Saudi Arabia and miniscule was
compared with the u.s. of Gouri its
Iran's military doctrine is strictly
defensive that designed to slow an
invasion and to force a diplomatic
solution to hostilities Iran has only
limited capacity to project force beyond
its borders they of course bring up the
nuclear option and say that Iran's
nuclear program and its willingness to
keep open the possibility of developing
nuclear weapons is a central part of its
deterrent strategy
well the brutal clerical regime in Iran
is undoubtedly a major threat to its own
people though hardly outranks US allies
in that regard but the threat lies
elsewhere
and it's ominous one element of the
threat is Iran's potential deterrent
capacity notice that that's an
illegitimate exercise of sovereignty
because it might interfere with us
freedom of action in the region and it's
of course glaringly obvious why Iran
would seek a deterrent capacity just
take a look at the disposition of forces
in the region including
nuclear forces seven years ago the one
of Israel's leading military historians
Martin von Krefeld wrote that the world
has witnessed how the United States
attacked Iraq for as it turned out no
reason at all
had the Iranians not tried to build
nuclear weapons they would be crazy
particularly when they're under constant
threat by a constant threat of attack by
the United States of course in violation
of the UN Charter but remember that that
doesn't apply to the United States
whether they are in fact of developing a
nuclear capability we don't really know
but perhaps so well the Iranian threat
is described in the documents and the
reports goes beyond deterrence Iran is
also seeking to expand its influence in
neighboring countries and thus what to
destabilize the region as it's called
notice that when the u.s. invade and
occupy maids and occupies your Iran's
neighbors
that's stabilization when Iran tries to
expand its influence a commercial
relations with its neighbors that's
destabilization that is absolutely
routine
usage in foreign policy commentary so
for sometimes it becomes almost comical
here's prominent foreign policy analyst
James chase former editor foreign
affairs rather on the liberal side
incidentally he was properly using the
term stability in its technical sense
when he explained that in order to
achieve stability in Chile it was
necessary to destabilize the country
namely by overthrowing the elected Ind
government installing a vicious
dictatorship sounds contradictory but it
isn't if you understand the technical
meaning of the terms well other concerns
about Iran I know
time to go into they're interesting to
explore but I think they simply show
underscore what the guiding doctrines
are and they're continuing status and
imperial culture that's very much in
accord with the doctrines that were laid
down by FDR's
planners back in during the the Second
World War the United States cannot
tolerate any exercise of sovereignty
that interferes with its global designs
and the United States and Europe are of
course engaged in the punishing Iran for
its threat to stability and trying to
get it to become a more civilized
country but it's useful to recall how
isolated the US and Europe or the
non-aligned countries which is most of
the world they have for years been
vigorously supporting Iran's right to
enrich uranium within the region as I
mentioned the irrelevant public even
strongly favors Iranian nuclear weapons
the major regional power turkey voted
against the latest US sanctions motion
in the Security Council along with
Brazil which is the most admired country
the South this polls showed the turkeys
disobedience had led to sharp censure
at that point but not for the first time
Turkey was bitterly condemned in 2003
when the government had committed a
major crime it followed the will of 95
percent of the population and refused to
take part in the u.s. British invasion
of Iraq and that demonstrated it's very
weak grasp of democracy which led to
sanctions on the sharp century same
today after the 2010 Security Council
misdeed Turkey was warned by Obama's top
diplomat on European affairs Philip
Gordon that it must demonstrate its
commitment to partner
with the West follow orders in other
words a scholar with the Council on
Foreign Relations asked how do we keep
the Turks in their lane they're
departing something wrong in their lane
means following orders like good
Democrats our style Democrats Brazil's
Lula it was admonished in a New York
Times headline he was warned that his
effort with Turkey to provide a solution
to the uranium enrichment issue outside
the framework of u.s. power is a spot on
the Brazilian leaders legacy and brief
do what we say that's your function it's
kind of an interesting sidelight to all
of this which has been effectively
suppressed the Iran Turkey Brazil deal
had been approved in advance by
President Obama presumably on the
assumption that it would fail and that
would provide an ideological weapon
against Iran that was revealed by the
British Foreign Office which released
the letter of support for ad after
Brazil was censured when the effort
succeeded approval quickly turned to
censure and Washington rammed through a
Security Council resolution which was so
weak that China readily signed and is
now chastised for living up to the
letter of the resolution but not
following Washington's unilateral
directives which go far beyond it that's
the current issue of foreign affairs the
main establishment foreign affairs
journalist well while the US can
tolerate Turkish disobedience though
with dismay a China is harder to ignore
so the press New York Times warns that
China's investors and traders are now
filling a vacuum in Iran
as businesses from many other nations
especially in Europe pull out in fear of
the United States and in particular its
expanding its dominant role in Iran's
energy industries all of this is quite
in accord with the UN resolutions but
inconsistent with the more extreme US
demands they which have no legal
authorization other than what's granted
by power the it's it's interesting to
watch the Washington reactions reacting
with a touch of desperation so the State
Department warned China that if it wants
to be accepted in the international
community that's incidentally another
technical term that refers to the US and
whoever happens to agree with it at the
moment if China wants to be accepted in
the international community
it must not skrt skrt and evade
international responsibilities which are
clear namely follow us orders kind of
unlikely to be impressed I suspect this
led to some amusement than the Chinese
Foreign Office's there's also a lot of
concern about the growing Chinese
military threat pentagon study that
recently came out warned that China's
military budget is now approaching 1/5
of what the Pentagon spends to operate
and carry out the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan it's of course a small
fraction of the US military budget
China's expansion of military forces
points out might deny the ability of
American warships to operate in
international waters off its coast off
its coast
China's coast it's yet to be I haven't
come across a proposal that that the
u.s. might eliminate military forces
that would deny the ability of Chinese
warships to operate in the Caribbean of
course it's fundamental a symmetry that
China's lack of understand
the rules of international civility is
illustrated further by its objections to
US plans to send the advanced aircraft
carrier George Washington to take part
in joint naval operations a few miles
off
China's coast apparently allegedly with
capacity to strike Page Beijing with
nuclear weapons
in contrast the u.s. understands that
such operations are undertaken to defend
stability and us security and this is
discussed in the strategic analysis
literature that's pointed out that this
is what what they call a classic
security dilemma each side sees vital
interests at stake
off the coast of China the liberal New
Republic expresses its concern about the
hardliners who now run China's foreign
policy and the most severe charge is
that China sent ten warships through
international waters that just off the
Japanese island of Okinawa while Chinese
naval helicopters flew dangerously close
to Japanese ships and that is indeed a
provocation unlike the fact unmentioned
that washington has converted the island
into a major US military base in
defiance of vehement protests by the
people of Okinawa who are as irrelevant
as the people of the Arab world that's
not a provocation by the standard
principle that we own the world well
putting aside deep-seated imperial
doctrine there's good reason for China's
neighbors to be concerned about its
growing military and commercial power
and although Arab public opinion
supports an Iranian nuclear weapons
program I don't think we should do so
actually the foreign policy literature
is full of proposals
how to counter the threat of an Iranian
nuclear program one obvious way to do so
is not discussed namely work to
establish a nuclear weapons-free zone in
the region that issue is arisen
repeatedly it arose again at the
non-proliferation treaty review
conference last May
Egypt which was chair of the non-aligned
countries in their name it proposed that
the conference call for negotiations on
a Middle East nuclear weapons free zone
as indeed had been agreed by the West
including the u.s. at the 1995 review
conference nothing had been done
actually international support for this
is so overwhelming that President Obama
was compelled to agree formally while
insisting that this is not the right
time and insisting that Israel be
exempted and of course the US which is
self exempted from international
obligations as already mentioned so
Washington informed the conference that
it's got a nice idea but not now as to
wait for a comprehensive peace
settlement and furthermore no proposal
can call for Israel's nuclear programs
to be placed under the auspices of the
International Atomic Energy Agency or
fanic off or can call for release of
information about Israeli nuclear
facilities and activities other than
these conditions it's a fine idea it's
rarely noted that the United States and
Britain I have a very special
responsibility to work to establish a
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle
East when the US and Britain had tried
to concoct a thin legal cover for the
invasion of Iraq they appealed to a
Security Council resolution resolution
687 and 1991 which called under active
terminate its development of weapons of
mass destruction well we can put aside
the claim but the resolution does
committed signers the US and Britain to
work to establish a nuclear weapons free
zone in the Middle East so the US and
Britain have a special unique
responsibility for this parenthetically
parenthetically we can add that u.s.
insistence on maintaining nuclear
facilities in Diego Garcia undermines
another nuclear weapons free zone the
African one they regard that as part of
Africa Diego Garcia's you should know as
a particularly important case Britain
obediently followed orders and expelled
the population from the island so that
the United States could set up a major
military base which is used in fact it's
used for bombing the Middle East and
Central Asia it's been expanded under
Obama to accommodate nuclear submarines
and also deep penetration bombs aimed at
Iran and that's a program that
languished under Bush but was taken up
with enthusiasm as soon as Obama took
office and has been considerably
accelerated well well grand area
doctrine still prevails the capacity the
implemented has declined the peak of US
power was after World War two and when I
as I said the US had literally half the
world's wealth that naturally declined
other industrial countries reconstructed
from the devastation of the war
decolonization took it's rather
agonizing course and by the early 1970s
that your share of global wealth had
declined to about 25 percent that's
still huge but half the industrial world
had become what was called tri-polar
us-based North America Europe East Asia
and Japan based there was also a very
sharp change in the US economy in the
1970s
the name lead towards a financialization
and export of production no time to go
into the details but they're very
significant what happened is that a
variety of factors converged to create a
vicious cycle of radical concentration
of wealth that mostly in a top fraction
of 1% of the population it's a very
small huge concentration that means
mostly CEOs hedge fund managers and so
on that's the real source of the
tremendous inequality in the United
States it's like 1/10 of a percent of
the population has an enormous impact on
this that carries with it concentration
of political power and that in turn
leads to development of state policies
to increase the concentration include
fiscal policies tax policies designed to
that in the rules of corporate
governance deregulation and a lot more
meanwhile the same years the cost of
Elections skyrocketed and that has an
effect it drives both political parties
they're much deeper into the pockets of
concentrated capital it's increasingly
financial capital the Republicans for
them it's reflexive the Democrats who
are by now what used to be called
moderate Republicans they're not far
behind
well while wealth and power political
power has very narrowly concentrated
thanks to the vicious cycle for most
people the real incomes have stagnated
for about 30 years they've been getting
by but with a sharply increased work
hours way beyond Europe no debt and
asset inflation which is regularly
destroyed by the crisis that began as
soon as the regulatory apparatus was
dismantled there weren't any as long as
the New Deal regular regulatory opposite
apparatus remained in force through the
50s and 60s
and that's extremely serious
well none of this is problematic for the
super-wealthy in fact they benefit from
a government insurance policy which has
the name too big to fail and that's a
very important means the banks and the
investment firms which make virtually no
contribution to the actual economy as
far as anyone knows be finally beginning
to be studied by economists have been
looked at it before but the banks and
the investment firms can make very risky
transactions make a risky transaction
you get rid of rich rewards the system
is going to crash inevitably but when it
crashes they can run to the nanny state
clutching their copies of Hayek and
Milton Friedman and the taxpayer will
happily bail them out so that's been the
regular process and since the Reagan
years and each crisis is more extreme
than the last for the public that is and
the coming crisis which is almost
inevitable probably still worse real
unemployment in the United States is
literally at the level of the depression
for much of the population meanwhile
Goldman Sachs which is one of the main
architects of the current crisis is
richer than ever just a couple of weeks
ago it quietly announced seventeen and a
half billion dollars in compensation for
last year CEO Lloyd Blankfein gets 12
and a half million dollars bonus and his
base salary was tripled I should say
that he tripled his base salary because
the rules of corporate government's by
the government have been designed so
that CEOs can pick the panels that set
their salaries with obvious consequences
well same things happening in England
just I've been here a couple days every
day's front page describes another
comparable scandal well it actually
wouldn't do to focus attention on such
things as these and accordingly the
propaganda system has to blame others
the past several months has been an
interesting propaganda campaign blaming
public sector workers there are fat
salaries exorbitant pensions and so on
all total fantasy it's on the model of
the Reaganite imagery of some of your
old enough to recall of black mothers
being driven in their chauffeured
limousine to welfare offices checks and
so on in a culture where lying is
honored you can get away with this kind
of thing and it has its effects and
there are other models which I need not
mention not very pleasant ones the
conclusion is we all have to tighten our
belts not all exactly some exceptions
that teachers are a particularly good
talk target and they're the ones being
targeted now that's part of a deliberate
effort which i think is going on here to
to destroy the public education system
means from kindergarten right through
the universities by privatization in one
form or another that's again fine for
the wealthy it's a disaster for the
population and it's also a disaster for
the long-term health of the economy but
that's what's called an externality in
economic theory it's something that's
put to the side and decision making as
long as insofar as market principles
prevail well elections have become in
the United States almost a complete
charade and other countries are sort of
following a couple of decades behind in
the u.s. by now that completely run by
the public relations industry after his
2008 victory Obama won an award from the
advertising industry for the best
marketing campaign of the year
and they understood what was going on
you know no hope and change in the
business press the Financial Times
executives were were euphoric they
described that they had been marketing
candidates like toothpaste ever since
Reagan and this was the greatest success
they'd ever had they said it would
change the style and corporate
boardrooms and so on the 2012 election
is expected to cost twelve billion
dollars that's mostly corporate funding
of course there's no other source and
it's not surprising that Obama right now
is selecting business leaders for top
positions no other way to get the money
the public is very angry and frustrated
but as long as the mawashi our principle
prevails it doesn't matter
well I've barely skimmed the surface of
these critical issues but I don't want
to end without at least mentioning
another externality that's dismissed in
market systems that's the fate of the
species that's an externality as far as
decisions are concerned systemic the
financial system is plagued this well
understood by what's called systemic
risk namely it's going to crash if it
works the way I describe and systemic
risk is a problem but it can be remedied
it can be remedied by the taxpayer but
nobody's going to come to the rescue if
the environment is destroyed that it
must be destroyed is virtually an
institutional imperative it's worth
bearing that in mind business leaders in
the United States are conducting openly
announcing that they're conducting the
massive propaganda campaigns to convince
the public that anthropogenic global
warming is a liberal hoax the that's
having an effect you can see at the
polls the executives who are running
these campaigns know perfectly well that
it's not a hoax
it's very grave but
they have no option of following that
understanding in their institutional
role they must ignore that externality
and act to maximize profit and market
share if one of them decides not to do
it he's out and somebody else's dinner
does do it
these are properties of the
institution's not the individuals and
this particularly vicious cycle could
well turn out to be lethal just to see
how grave the danger is you should have
a look at the new Congress in the United
States which is propelled into power by
business funding and propaganda almost
all of them are climate deniers they've
already begun beyond to cut funding for
measures that might mitigate
environmental catastrophe and that's
likely to all disappear we're still some
of them are true believers so for
example one of the new heads new head of
one of the subcommittee's on the
environment he explained that the global
warming cannot be a problem because God
promised Noah that he wouldn't have
another flood so that takes care of that
problem well we can you know if this was
happening in some small remote country
you know we might laugh but not when
it's happening in the most powerful
country in the world and it's know
before we laugh we might also bear in
mind that the current economic crisis is
traceable in no small measure to a
fanatic faith in such dogmas as the
efficient market hypothesis and in
general to what Nobel laureate Joseph
Stiglitz Stiglitz about 15 years ago
they've called the religion that markets
know best
given that Dogma it was unnecessary for
the Federal Reserve in central bank or
for the economics profession with
extremely rare exceptions it was
unnecessary to pay attention to the fact
that there was an eight trillion dollar
housing bubble which had absolutely no
relation to any economic fundamentals I
was completely off the course of a
hundred years of statistics on this but
you didn't have to notice it because
markets know best so it'll be fine
of course it devastated the economy when
it burst well all of this is fine much
more can proceed as long as the washer
doctrine prevails as long as the general
population is passive apathetic diverted
the consumerism or to hatred of the
vulnerable then the powerful can do as
they like and those who survive can
contemplate the outcome
hi I'm I'm guy I'm a student here at UCL
and I took part last term in the UCL
occupation along with quite a number of
other students okay
you mentioned the the attack on public
education in this country in the the
privatization of education we were all
very happy to receive a message of
support from you last term the occupying
students so I just like to say thanks
for that firstly secondly I mean what
we're seeing I think is the kick-started
by the student movement is hopefully
what's becoming a much more broad-based
movement against austerity in this
country linking up with the trade unions
building to a big demonstration money
SiC now obviously there's parallels with
what's happening in Wisconsin where
there's the economic crisis is being
used to carry through a politics of wage
repression and you're seeing a fight
back against that there as well so I
just wanted to ask you what do you think
are the prospects for these kind of
emergent movements against austerity and
what do you think the lessons that can
be learnt from earlier sort of fights
for economic justice you know in
economic theory there's a name for the
policies that Europe is following
England too namely imposing austerity in
the middle of her session it's called
the Herbert Hoover principle that's
exactly what led to the world depression
it was reinstated again in 1936 under
the advice state business pressure you
led to another recession one well-known
economist observed that European leaders
might perhaps be charged with violating
unethical and in fact a legal principle
namely experimentation with human beings
that cannot be taken without their
consent okay this is an experiment to
see if the kind of policies which have
always been a disaster and
passed and which are likely to be a
disaster for good reasons again whether
these policies which have humans as
their experimental subject whether they
should be permitted well that's up to
people who don't believe in the washer
doctrine to respond to as far as
education is concerned I don't really
feel qualified to talk about situation
here you obviously know much more about
it than I do in the United States it's
quite interesting as I think I may have
mentioned in that letter of support that
you brought up about that I guess about
a year ago it by accident I happened to
be giving some talks in Mexico at the
National University and I went straight
from there to California the Bay Area
more talk these are kind of you know
they're not the exact opposites in terms
of the economy California should be the
richest place in the world Mexico is not
the poorest country in the world but
it's a pretty core core country the
National University in Mexico has a
couple hundred thousand students quite a
high level good facilities you know
engage students salaries of course are
much lower than the United States great
functions quite well it's free the ten
years ago there was an attempt by the
government to raise tuition slightly it
was a student strike national student
strike government back down it's still
free okay that's one of the poorer
countries in the world you go to
California one of the richest places in
the world
it had the greatest public education
system in the world it was excellent
it's being systematically destroyed has
been going on since the 1970s very
systematically deliberately for reasons
that in fact had been articulated it has
nothing to do with economic necessity
these two comparisons
suffice to show that there are many
others like them so it's not an economic
necessity but other reasons the reasons
having to do with the vicious cycle that
I described and it's having its effects
next year for the first year the public
universities like the great universities
Berkeley UCLA and so on they're getting
more of their income from tuition than
from the state and in fact that's true
of most of this state College state
universities in the country
Massachusetts well these are deliberate
policy choices designed they are
designed essentially to privatize the
major universities so very likely the
stars in the system like Berkeley and
UCLA and maybe San Diego they'll
probably be privatized there
they're almost like Ivy League
universities today huge tuitions big
endowments and so on so they'll probably
be privatized and the rest of the system
will just shrink that was a very good
system oh and of course that has dire
effects for the future economy but again
that's an externality in a so far as
market systems apply they do to an
extent you don't consider their
short-term gain is what mattered so
that's that's happening all over the
country and the same is happening with
the public schools so there's major
pressure which Obama is contributing to
as well to privatize the public school
system what are called charter schools
which still paid for by the public but
they're out of the public education
system there's plenty of studies of them
they they do roughly as well as
comparable public schools even though
they have many advantages like they
don't have to run the special education
programs that they don't have unionized
teachers and so on with no special
performance gains and that's a way of
undermining public education which has a
kind of a deep purpose behind it
it's very much like the effort to
destroy Social Security is a major
efforts been going on for years to try
to destroy the Social Security system I
said it's claimed open the newspaper so
you read the New York Times the
editorials will tell you we've got this
huge deficit problem and so we have to
deal with entitlements Social Security
Medicare and Medicaid and not waste our
energy on other things
Social Security contributes zero to the
deficit zero it comes out of payroll
taxes okay
it's got it first of all and furthermore
it's pretty well funded for decades in
advance a little tinkering would fund it
forever but that's it got to be killed
the Medicare and Medicaid it's true but
the reason for that is something that
they won't mention it's because of the
privatized health care system which is
extremely inefficient the u.s. spends
about twice as much per capita as every
other comparable country on health care
and the outcomes are among the poorest
and if you look at the privatized
unregulated health care system you can
see why but you're not allowed to touch
the financial institutions the insurance
companies and so on so that's kind of
like off the agenda if the United States
had a health care system comparable to
other industrial countries and not only
but they're not the a' deficit that
actually be a surplus the about half the
deficit in addition to that is military
spending but those things are you know
off the agenda you have to go after
Social Security Y Social Security it's
extremely efficient I'm an
administrative costs are crackly to
Europe but it has a couple of
deficiencies
it's no use whatsoever to privileged
people so you get it you know some
billionaire gets to another small amount
of money it don't make any difference
even notice it but it's it's assessments
for most of the population especially
those who've been wiped out by the
fiscal catastrophe and doesn't pay that
much but it pays enough to get you by
beyond that it has a ideological problem
which is never described but I think
it's quite crucial actually has to do
with that message from Kemal Abbas to
the workers of Wisconsin that I
mentioned Social Security is based on
the principle of solidarity
you're supposed to care if the disabled
widow across town has enough food to eat
and that has to be driven out of
people's heads
you're supposed to be concerned just
about yourself same defect in the public
education system like I don't have kids
in school anymore
so if I follow the rules I'm not
supposed to care for the public I don't
want to pay taxes for public education
but if you're infected by this disease
of the Solidarity you care if the kid
across the street can go to school now
that's got to be driven out of people's
heads same reason for the attack on
unions so you get these massive attacks
and I think that's what's happening to
the public education system you know
better than I whether that applies here
but I wouldn't be surprised thank you
another question - sir the front thanks
a lot for your tour professor you've
been a major inspiration for me so thank
you for your work as well I did have a
question to ask you with regards to
popular resistance in the Middle East so
correct me if I'm wrong but your
position regarding the BDS movement is
one of ambivalence or I think you
actually oppose certain aspects of it
and if I'm correct that's on the grounds
that you feel that if we should be
applying that standard to Israel we
should be applying it to American goods
as well and it appears to me that you
know there's a question of feasibility
that surely comes into play here I think
it's feasible to
boycott Israeli goods but you know life
would be practically unimaginable
without American goods and so I'd like
to know in in in in your opinion how how
you balance that aspect when you're
making you know the BDS movement and
okay some of you aren't tuned in as the
boycott divestment sanctions movement
about Israel okay there is a story that
circulates which is what you repeated
that I'm opposed to it and that's kind
of understand that's an interesting it's
an interesting fact about the popular
movements but we kind of live in a
Twitter generation where anything that
goes beyond 180 characters it doesn't
exist
and can't be understood literally
actually I was involved in the BDS
movement before I even crystallized 10
years ago about five minutes before it
started is extremely important I've
always supported it I always advocate it
I still do but any TAC it's a tactic
it's not a principle and if you're
serious about choice of tactics you ask
a couple of questions the one question
you ask is what's the effect on the
victims it's not the only question but
you certainly have to ask at least that
well in some cases the choice of tactics
is helpful to the victims for example if
the EU which is a major importer of
goods from the settlements if the EU
were to stop importing goods from these
early settlements which are illegal
uncontroversially if and hence
participating an illegal act they would
do that it'd be good for the victims
similarly if they would follow the
advice of Amnesty International and
declare an arms embargo in Israel they'd
be good for the victims even more so for
the United States so these are fine
tactics on the other hand suppose that
you say I'm going to boycott Tel Aviv
University well there's an obvious
response that's going to come to that at
lunch boycott Harvard Harvard at a much
worse record than Tel Aviv University
and that's going to be the immediate
response and it
unanswerable you know it's basically
correct and the effect is that you're
giving a gift to hardliners that's
harmful to the victims you don't pick
your tactics in such a way that it's
going to be a gift to the most hardline
advocates of repression and violence
that should be automatic and you know
these are debates that go on and
activist movements all the time let's go
back to say the 1960s in most of you
aren't enough old enough to remember but
some of you are in the United States in
the activist movements in the United
States in the late sixties there were
groups like the famous weather men who
decided that the way to express their
opposition to the war was to go out and
break windows and you know beat people
up and so on and so forth the Vietnamese
were very strongly opposed to that what
they advised all the time
is to carry out nonviolent tactics in
fact what they favored and they said so
with things like you know women standing
quietly in front of the graves of
American soldiers that's what they
wanted now those are tactics that help
but they don't make you feel good it
makes you feel good apparently if you
can go out and break windows and banks
but as far as the victims are concerned
that's just harmful well it does is
build up support for the war which is
exactly what it did so and those
questions were eyes constantly you have
to distinguish feel-good tactics from
do-good tactics if you can't make that
distinction don't even pretend to be
involved in solidarity movements I mean
that's kind of the minimum you know
didn't come other questions and I think
those questions arise in the BDS
movement too unless if you you know
they're kind of suppressed in a slogan
based system in which you have a
catechism and you repeat it but if you
think about the matter those questions
are always going to arise anywhere
whatever tactical choice
you could have debates about what the
consequences are but at least you have
to recognize that those issues arise and
I think that's critical in this case we
have time for a couple more questions
very lady they've the thank you yes you
[Music]
you mentioned the nuclear weapons free
zone as well as the situation with the
military bases in Diego Garcia
but obviously here in the UK and in the
United States the arms companies defense
industry is very closely linked to
defense ministries and I guess my
question is in light of this week Henry
Kissinger saying that deterrence is a
useless system obviously apart from the
United States maintaining their nuclear
weapons until everyone else gets rid of
theirs I guess in light of Kissinger who
is a very strong voice for previously
for military kind of intervention him
saying deterrence is a useless system
how does that fit with say the US or
potentially the UK adhering to their NPT
commitments and potentially diminishing
the link between the military and
defense industries well Kissinger is one
of several political leaders and George
Shultz the former Secretary of State
under Reagan Sam Nunn who in Congress
has been a conservative congressman
Beasley was now out of the Congress he
was the leader and one of the leaders in
trying to restrict nuclear weapons
proliferation there's three of them and
somebody else I forgot who have come up
with this repeatedly with statements
saying that we should think seriously
about honoring our own NPT obligations
the non-proliferation treaty obligates
signers of the five nuclear powers have
signed it to carry out good-faith effort
to eliminate nuclear weapons entirely
that's article 6 and this group
officials Kissinger and others who said
look we got to think about that
seriously I don't think that the issue
for them is deterrence the issue is
elementary rationality they understand
something which we all should understand
as long as nuclear weapons exist the
chances of survival of the human species
are quite slight there have been
repeated occasions over and over again
when we've come very close to nuclear
war in fact we have Declassified us
records Russian systems are obviously
much worse so whatever is true of us has
got to be worse for them but there are
literally dozens of occasions when
automated the nuclear weapons are on
automated response systems so you know
automated systems detect something going
on somewhere the computers calculate and
you get an order fire the weapons there
are literally dozens of cases where it
came up to within a couple of minutes of
sending off nuclear missiles it was
aborted by human intervention okay
that's the u.s. side Russian side
undoubtedly is a lot worse because they
don't have any systems are no good and
so on well you know that's just playing
with fire sooner or later there's not
trying to be a human intervention
furthermore there are explicit cases
where we've come
literally within instance of its
instance of nuclear war on the most
extreme case which would really be
studied carefully is 1962 missile crisis
that's been intensively investigated now
for one reason because the people
involved like Robert McNamara and others
who recognized how crazy it was Arthur
Schlesinger was in the government then
called it the most dangerous moment in
human history there was actually a
moment there when one Russian
submarine commander prevented what could
have been a nuclear war at one point in
the missile crisis Kennedy had
established an embargo of Cuba no ships
could come within a certain distance and
Russian ships were approaching that line
there were also a term that we knew it
at the time but there were Russian
submarines there which had
nuclear-tipped missiles they were
attacked by us destroyers depth charges
and the commanders of the submarines who
had authority to fire nuclear missiles
same is true of us systems they they
thought a word started there were three
commanders two of them decided to send
off the missiles okay the third possibly
arkhipov we should get 20 Nobel Peace
Prizes he he rejected the order and they
had to have all three agreeing firearm
I mean if they'd fired these are not
nuclear
you know big huge nuclear weapons but if
they'd fired nuclear-tipped missiles the
US reaction we know from the internal
plans with you know they'd do something
like that we take out Moscow they take
out London and there goes on from that
you should read the studies that we know
what they were came that close act it
was another moment in the missile crisis
which amazingly is described as one of
john f kennedy's great achievements i
mean maybe it's one of the worst crimes
in human history what happened the facts
are known and not debated at a peak
moment of the missile crisis you know
just coming to its peak first Jeff a red
letter to Kennedy in which he offered a
way to end it the offer was that Russia
would remove the missiles from Cuba and
in return the United States would remove
missiles
P now the missiles in Turkey are much
more of a threat to Russia than the
missiles in Cuba worked at the United
States but that's the usual asymmetry
we're allowed to do things that others
can't do now Kennedy was kind of
surprised when he got that letter
because he had already given an order to
withdraw them to the missiles from
Turkey because they were obsolete they
were being replaced by much more
destructive Polaris submarines than the
Mediterranean so he pointed out the
internal discussion this is gonna be a
hard offer to refuse you know it's not
gonna sell in Peoria who it but he
decided to refuse it I think just to
preserve the macho image and to show
that we run things so in fact they did
we throw the missiles from Turkey but
secretly that was part of the process of
humiliating Khrushchev and they reached
that goal he was willing to face what he
himself considered a probability of
about one third of nuclear war I mean
these are what goes on these are things
that go on in the minds of you know the
best and the brightest as they call
themselves just think of the rest well
Kissinger and Schultz and others have
been right in the middle of this and
they know that we're on the verge of
catastrophe so they're saying look we
got to do something to get rid of this
destructive capacity this really doesn't
have to do with deterrence so much I
mean as far as deterrence is concerned
there are interesting discussion that
one of the most interesting is a very
important book written by one of
Israel's leading strategic analysts my
name is EV Mo's it's in English it's I
think it's called defending the holy
land he goes through it's about you know
a thousand pages of detailed analysis of
Israel's strategic objectives since 1948
and he's very judicious he gives the
arguments on both sides it's careful he
knows what he's talking to
his basic conclusion is that Israel's
policies have been selected in ways
which harm at security actually that's
not unusual that's true of the policies
of most states including Britain in the
United States so if you bothered to look
at the Chilkoot Englert inquiry you'll
have noticed that the head of British
intelligence testified that when they
decided to go to war against Iraq it was
on the assumption that it would sharply
increase tech the terrorists risk to
Britain and she points out that the CIA
had the same assumption okay we already
sort of knew that from other sources but
this is the highest level confirmation
and that's correct and they decided to
go ahead anyway and the reason is the
security of the people of Britain in the
United States is not a high priority for
planners it's a low priority plenty of
evidence for that other countries are
similar oh well in the case of Israel
that's his conclusion when he gets to
nuclear he has chapter on nuclear
weapons which is worth reading and he
argues I think pretty judiciously and
convincingly that Israel's nuclear
weapons program has harms with security
it's a good argument and if security
were the top concern I think that
argument would be taken seriously
it's that kind of consideration that
Kissinger and the others have in mind
you know Kissinger in these especially
these guys have worked all their lives
on deterrence theory and they understand
that this does not contribute to
security and in fact it does contribute
very likely to long term maybe not so a
long term destruction incidentally not
so a long term if you take a look at
WikiLeaks and most of it doesn't tell
you much but there are things that
didn't tell you some interesting things
some of the most important they have to
do with Pakistan the American ambassador
in Pakistan ambassador Patterson she was
regularly warning Washington that US
actions in Afghanistan which
incidentally approved though but she was
warning them that these actions
are having a dangerous effect in
Pakistan they're contributing to the
possible fracture of Pakistan and it's a
radicalization now you have to reason is
that you know like drone it that's right
public opinion Pakistan is
overwhelmingly hostile to the United
States the military doesn't like what
we're doing they're being humiliated you
know when there when the US urges them
to attack the tribal areas that's
interfering with their prerogatives and
they don't like it they know it's not
the thing to do the drone attacks are
the same what she was arguing is that
there's morning Washington and the
cables that these actions in Afghanistan
and Pakistan are threatening the
stability of Pakistan now Pakistan is a
very dangerous country most dangerous
place in the world that Pakistan has a
huge nuclear weapon system which is
expanding rapidly expanding more rapidly
than any other country in the world it's
it has a radical Islamic element which
isn't a majority but it's real you know
if you remember when I saw imposter was
assassinated a couple of months ago for
you know objecting to the blasphemy laws
there was strong support for the
assassins and it wasn't just from the
Jewish tribes it was if you in the
pictures in the newspapers showed
black-suited lawyers young lawyers
demonstrating in support of the
assassins now this is the same lawyers
who were demonstrating to overthrow the
Musharraf dictatorship they're the
reformist but they were demonstrating in
support of the assassin all right these
are all consequences of actions that
were taken in the Reagan administration
with to to clear consequences one was to
allow package to help Pakistan develop
nuclear weapons Reagan was supporting zo
hawk the most awful of the series of
awful Decatur
Pakistan and the u.s. pretended they
didn't know that he was developing
nuclear weapons they could keep
supporting it of course it was the other
was radicalism ization with Saudi
funding Zia was carrying out a program
of changes in the educational system his
famous madrasah isn't rich people on he
studied the Quran become that was all
going on from the 80s it's extended it's
now had a big effect so you now have a
situation with a radical Islamist
movement nuclear weapons you're
provoking the military the only stable
force in the region which might crack
Punjabi mostly you know a lot of
problems and it might she warns lead to
fissile materials leaking into the hands
of jihadis
those are our actions in Afghanistan
okay there's actually an interesting
article by just came out a couple of
weeks ago and journal the national
interest kind of conservative national
affairs Journal in the US by Anatoly
Gavin is one of the special recognized
in Tunisia and Egypt today the popular
uprising has scored quite impressive
victories but as the Carnegie Endowment
reported a few days ago its research
group while names have changed the
regime's remain the as they point out a
change in ruling elites and the system
of governance is still a distant goal
maybe it'll be achieved maybe not it's
not going to be easy the report
discusses a variety of internal barriers
to such changes to democracy but it
ignores as usual the external barriers
which as always are quite significant
the United States and its Western Allies
are assured to do whatever they can to
prevent authentic democracy in the Arab
world
and the very simple reasons for that to
understand why it's only necessary to
look at the studies of Arab opinion
which are conducted by the most
prestigious US polling agencies released
by a major institutions like the
Brookings Institution they reveal that
by overwhelming majorities Arabs regard
the US and Israel as the major threats
they face the United State the United
States is regarded as the major threat
by 90% of Egyptians in the region
generally not much less than that
some regard Iran as a threat 10%
opposition to US policy is so strong
that a majority believe that the region
would be that security would be improved
for the region if Iran had nuclear
weapons in Egypt that's 80 percent other
figures are similar if public opinion
were to influence policy the United
States would not only not control the
region but it would be expelled from
Britain as well along with its allies
that would undermine fundamental
principles of global domination that
have been operative in their current
form since the Second World War and as
far as Britain's concerned back long
before then a general support for
democracy is the province of ideologists
and propagandists in the real world as
the more serious scholarship was
conceded the US and its allies support
democracy if and only if it corresponds
to strategic and economic objectives
actually Stalin could have said the same
thing
elite contempt for democracy was it
state the principles also clearly
license
military intervention at will
and that conclusion has been clearly not
not only implemented continuously but
also pretty clearly articulated that one
tends to think of the right-wing
administration's but that's misleading
one of the most expansive forms of the
doctrine was under Clinton in fact Bill
Clinton the Clinton administration
declared quote that the United States
has the right to use military force
unilaterally to ensure uninhibited
access to key markets energy supplies
and strategic resources and must
maintain military forces forward
deployed in Europe and Asia in order to
shape people's opinions about us and to
shape events that will affect their
livelihood in our security that's
actually much more expansive than the
much-maligned george w bush doctrine
they came later the clinton doctrine
doesn't even require the pretexts that
the Bush Doctrine insisted on but it was
presented politely so therefore arouse
much interest actually the antagonism
towards Bush was almost entirely style
not substance the substance is pretty
standard the I think that's one of the
reasons Obama was so welcomed in Europe
the style changed not the substance
the same principles governed the
invasion of Iraq that became clearer as
the u.s. failure to impose its will
became clearer at that as that preceded
the actual goals of the invasion
couldn't be concealed any longer behind
pretty rhetoric about you know democracy
and all sorts of nice things in November
2007 the White House issued what's
called a declaration of principles
concerning Iraq two main points the one
was that US forces must remain
indefinitely in Iraq big military bases
right to carry out combat operations and
secondly that Iraq must privilege us
investors two months later January 2008
President Bush informed Congress that he
would reject legislation that might
limit the permanent stationing of US
Armed Forces in Iraq or US control of
the oil resources of Iraq I'm quoting
the these are demand carry out
nonviolent tactics in fact what they
favored and they said so with things
like you know women standing quietly in
front of the graves of American soldiers
that's what they wanted now those are
tactics that help but they don't make
you feel good it makes you feel good
apparently if you can go out and break
windows and banks but as far as the
victims are concerned that's just
harmful well it does is build up support
for the war which is exactly what it did
so and and those questions our eyes
constantly you have to distinguish
feel-good tactics from do-good tactics
if you can't make that distinction don't
even pretend to be involved in
solidarity movements I mean that's kind
of the minimum you know then come other
questions and I think those questions
arise in the BDS movement
unless if you you know they're kind of
suppressed in a slogan based system in
which you have a catechism and you
repeat it but if you think about the
matter those questions are always going
to arise anywhere know whatever tactical
choices you
you could have debates about what the
consequences are but at least you have
to recognize that those issues arise and
I think that's critical in this case we
have time for a couple more questions
lady there the yes you mentioned the
nuclear weapons-free zone as well as the
kind of the situation with the military
bases in Diego Garcia
but obviously here in the UK and in the
United States the arms companies defense
industry is very closely linked to
defense ministries and I guess my
question is in light of this week Henry
Kissinger saying that deterrence is a
useless system obviously apart from the
United States maintaining their nuclear
weapons until everyone else gets rid of
theirs I guess in light of Kissinger who
is a very strong voice for previously
for military kind of intervention him
saying deterrence is a useless system
how does that fit with say the US or
potentially the UK adhering to their NPT
commitments and potentially diminishing
the link between the military and
defense industries well Kissinger is one
of several political leaders and George
Shultz
the former secretary of state under
Reagan Sam Nunn who in Congress has been
a conservative congressman Beasley is
now out of Congress he was the leader
and one of the leaders in trying to
restrict nuclear weapons proliferation
there's three of them
the dubious comparison in 1989 the
democracy uprising was supported by
Western powers in accord with a standard
doctrine that democracy is fine if it
satisfies strategic and economic
interest furthermore the democracy
uprisings were tolerated by the dominant
power in the region by Russia almost
exactly the opposite of what's happening
now there's no Gorbachev in the West
quite the contrary
and Western power remains a hostile to
democracy in the Arab world and for
quite sound reasons those that I
mentioned so a more irrelevant
comparison and one which is never drawn
but I think it is more relevant would be
two events that were taking place in US
domains at exactly the same time 1989 so
for example a few days after the fall of
the Berlin Wall an elite Salvadoran
battalion who was fresh from renewed
training in the John F Kennedy School of
Special Warfare in North Carolina
invaded the Jesuit University in El
Salvador and brutally murdered six
leading Latin American intellectuals
Jesuit priests along with their
housekeeper and their daughter all under
orders of the government which was very
closely linked to the United States
following direct orders that culminated
a decade of Horrors and which began when
the archbishop who was called the voice
for the voiceless that was assassinated
by much the same hands during that
period about 70,000 people were killed
in El Salvador overwhelmingly by the US
armed and trained forces about twice
that number were killed elsewhere in
Central America and the same years same
source
the primary targets were the people's
organizations fighting to defend their
most fundamental human rights those are
the words of the assassinated archbishop
days before he was killed while saying
mass pleading in vain and letter to
Jimmy Carter pleading for the end of US
military aid to the murderous hunter to
serious scholarship in the West and of
course to the victims it's well-known
I'm quoting now that between 1960 and
the Soviet collapse in 1990 the number
of political prisoners torture victims
and executions of non-violent political
dissenters in Latin America vastly
exceeded those in the Soviet Union and
East European satellites and if I'm
correct that's on the grounds that you
feel that if we should be applying that
standard to Israel we should be applying
it to American goods as well and it
appears to me that you know there's a
question of feasibility that surely
comes into play here
I think it's feasible to boycott Israeli
goods but you know life would be
practically unimaginable without
American goods and so I'd like to know
in in in your opinion how how you
balance that out when you're making you
know the BDS movement and okay some of
you aren't turned in as the boycott
divestment sanctions movement about
Israel okay there is a story that
circulates which is what you repeated
that I'm opposed to it and that's kind
of understand that's an interesting it's
an interesting fact about the popular
movements we kind of live in a Twitter
generation where anything that goes
beyond 180 characters it doesn't exist
and
literally actually I was involved in the
BDS movement before it even crystallized
10 years ago about five minutes before
it started is extremely important I've
always supported it I always advocated
that I still do but any tack it's a
tactic it's not a principle and if
you're serious about choice of tactics
you ask a couple of questions the one
question you ask is what's the effect on
the victims it's not the only question
but you certainly have to ask at least
that well in some cases the choice of
tactics is helpful to the victims for
example if the EU which is a major
importer of goods from the settlements
if the EU were to stop importing goods
from these early settlements which are
illegal uncontroversially if and hence
participating an illegal act they would
do that it'd be good for the victims
similarly if they would follow the
advice of Amnesty International and
declare an arms embargo in Israel that'd
be good for the victims even more so for
the United States so these are fine
tactics on the other hand suppose that
you say I'm going to boycott Tel Aviv
University well there's an obvious
response that's going to come to that at
lunch boycott Harvard Harvard at a much
worse record than Tel Aviv University
and that's going to be the immediate
response and it's unanswerable you know
it's basically correct and the effect is
that you're giving a gift to hardliners
that's harmful to the victims you don't
pick your tactics in such a way that
it's going to be a gift to the most
hardline advocates of repression and
violence that should be automatic and
you know these are debates that go on
and activist movements all the time
those go back to say the 1960s in mostly
aren't hostile to democracy in the Arab
world
and for quite sound reasons those that I
mentioned so a more relevant comparison
and one which is never drawn but I think
it is more relevant would be to events
that were taking place in US domains at
exactly the same time 1989 so for
example a few days after the fall of the
Berlin Wall

the Soviet collapse in 1990 the number
of political prisoners torture victims
and executions of non-violent political
dissenters in Latin America vastly
exceeded those in the Soviet Union and
East European satellites and I can add
of course the hundreds of thousands of
people who were simply slaughtered all
of this support that are tolerated by
Washington included many religious
martyrs such as those who framed the
horrible decade in El Salvador and mass
slaughter as well watch I'm quoting
well-known Latin Americanist John
cotesworth in the recently published
Cambridge history of the Cold War at
cotesworth picks the Year 1960 for good
reasons
big military bases right to carry out
combat operations and secondly that Iraq
must privilege us investors two months
later January 2008 President Bush
informed Congress that he would reject
legislation that might limit the
permanent stationing of US Armed Forces
in Iraq or US control of the oil
resources of Iraq I'm quoting the these
are demands incidentally that the United
States had to abandon shortly after in
the face of Iraqi resistance as it had
been forced to back off step-by-step all
the way through that's a major triumph
of nonviolent resistance that the US and
Britain have no trouble at all killing
insurgents they're very good at killing
people but they couldn't deal with the
mass nonviolent resistance the hundreds
of thousands of people were
demonstrating and protesting so I had to
back off and finally the basic war aims
were abandoned articulated pretty
clearly as they were being abandoned
that's a major defeat as Jonathan Steele
and other serious analysts have
recognized in Tunisia and Egypt today
the popular uprising
has scored quite impressive victories
but as the Carnegie Endowment reported a
few days ago its research group while
names have changed the regime's remain
the as they point out a change in ruling
elites and the system of governance is
still a distant goal maybe it'll be
achieved
maybe not it's not going to be easy the
report discusses a variety of internal
barriers to such changes to democracy
but it ignores as usual the external
barriers which as always are quite
significant the United States and its
Western Allies are sure to do whatever
they can to prevent authentic democracy
in the Arab world and the very simple
reasons for that to understand why it's
only necessary to look at the studies of
Arab opinion which are conducted by the
most prestigious US polling agencies
released by a major institutions like
the Brooking institution they reveal
that by overwhelming majorities Arabs
regard the US and Israel as the major
threats they face the United State
the United States is regarded as the
major threat by 90% of Egyptians in the
region generally not much less than that
some regard Iran is a threat adopted
what they called the preferential option
for the poor priests nuns laypersons
tried to take the radical pacifist
message of the Gospels to the poor and
the persecuted of the hemisphere people
who were and try to organize them and we
were called based communities and urged
them and tried to help them take their
fate in their own hands and work
together to overcome the misery of
survival and the harsh
realms of us power this was recognized
at once to be an intolerable heresy and
the reaction was very Swift the Kennedy
administration immediately helped
install vicious national security state
in Brazil plagued and spread throughout
the continent in ways which should be
familiar it culminated exactly when the
Berlin Wall fell these events have been
disappeared to borrow the terminology
used in Latin America they suffer from a
fallacy the fallacy of wrong agency that
we carried them out therefore they
cannot be in history and you don't study
him at school you know read about them
people write about him and so on we
write about our nobility and supporting
the Eastern European dissidents who
surely suffered but not even remotely
like what was going on in our own
domains and I should add that horrible
as these events were they're barely a
pee on a mountain as compared with other
crimes in that period notably the
Indochina wars that followed from
Kennedy's invasion of South Vietnam
almost exactly 50 years ago it's also
been disappeared for the same reasons
fallacy of wrong agency a careful look
reveals that the grand area doctrines
continue to apply to contemporary crises
take what's considered the main one in
western policymaking circles and among
political commentators the Iranian
threat is considered to pose the
greatest danger to world order and hence
must be the primary focus of u.s.
foreign policy
Europe's trailing along politely as
usual this year is called the year of
the grand because of the danger of that
enormous threat which does raise a
question what exactly is the Iranian
threat you read the
commentary you don't get much of an
answer but there actually is an
authoritative answer which is ignored
the authoritative answer is provided to
provide a solution to the Iranian
enrichment issue outside the framework
of us power is a spot on the Brazilian
leaders legacy and brief do what we say
that's your function it's kind of an
interesting sidelight to all of this
which has been effectively suppressed
the Iran Turkey Brazil deal had been
approved in advance by President Obama
presumably on the assumption that it
would fail and that would provide an
ideological weapon against Iran that was
revealed by the British Foreign Office
which released the letter of support for
a desk or Brazil was censured when the
effort succeeded approval quickly turned
to censure and Washington rammed through
a Security Council resolution which was
so weak that China readily signed and is
now chastised for living up to the
letter of the resolution but not
following Washington's unilateral
directives which go far beyond it that's
the current issue of Foreign Affairs the
main establishment Foreign Affairs
journalist well while the US can
tolerate Turkish disobedience though
with dismay a China is harder to ignore
so the Press New York Times warns that
China's investors and traders are now
filling a vacuum in Iran as businesses
from many other nations especially in
Europe pull out in fear of the United
States and in particular it's expanding
its dominant role in Iran's energy
industries all of this is quite in
accord with the UN resolutions but
inconsistent with the more extreme US
demands they would have no legal
authorization other than what's granted
by power the it's it's interesting to
watch the Washington reactions
with a touch of desperation so the State
Department warned China that if it wants
to be accepted in the international
community that's incidentally another
technical term that refers to the US and
whoever happens to agree with it at the
moment if China wants to be accepted in
the international community
it must not skirt skirt and evade
international responsibilities which are
clear namely follow us orders China
unlikely to be impressed I suspect this
led to some amusement than the Chinese
Foreign Office's there's also a lot of
concern about the growing Chinese
military threat had a gun study that
recently came out warned that China's
military budget is now approaching 1/5
of what the Pentagon spends the same
reason for the attack on unions so you
get these massive attacks and I think
that's what's happening to the public
education system you know better than I
whether that applies here but I wouldn't
be surprised thank you
another question - sir the front thanks
a lot for your talk professor you've
been a major inspiration for me so thank
you for your work as well I did have a
question to ask you with regards to
popular resistance in the Middle East so
correct me if I'm wrong but your
position regarding the BDS movement is
one of ambivalence or I think you
actually oppose certain aspects of it
and if I'm correct it's on the grounds
that you feel that if we should be
applying that standard to Israel we
should be applying it to American goods
as well and it appears to me that you
know there's a question of feasibility
that surely comes into play here
I think it's feasible to boycott Israeli
goods but you know life would be
practically unimaginable without
American goods and so I'd like to know
in your opinion how how you
that aspect when you're making you know
the BDS movement and okay some of you
aren't tuned in as the boycott
divestment sanctions movement about
Israel okay there is a story that
circulates which is what you repeated
that I'm opposed to it
and that's kind of understand that's an
interesting it's an interesting fact
about the popular movements we kind of
live in a Twitter generation where
anything that goes beyond 180 characters
it doesn't exist and can't be understood
literally actually I was involved in the
BDS movement before it even crystallized
ten years ago about five minutes before
it started is extremely important I've
always supported it I always advocate it
I still do but any tack it's a tactic

declare an arms embargo in Israel they'd

the United States so these are fine
tactics on the other hand suppose that
you the classical economists were quite
sound well going back to coming back to
today the democracy uprisings in the
Arab world are pretty commonly compared
to Eastern Europe in 1989 but that's a
rather dubious comparison in 1989 the
democracy uprising was supported by
Western powers in accord with the
standard
doctrine that democracy is fine if it
satisfies strategic and economic

well known I'm quoting now that between
1960 but only because he disapproved of
the invasion thought that was okay but
the timing was bad it interfered with a
u.s. planned coup in Syria and he didn't
like the disobedience Britain France and
Israel are supposed to understand who's
boss and not to carry out operations
like this without informing the master
so they were summarily expelled and you
might have guessed that our public
opinion would be favorable to the US
after this but and they perceived things
a little more deeply than Western
ideologist so yes there was a campaign
of hatred for the reasons that the NSC
National Security Council articulated
the current polls which I mentioned
indicate that how little anything has
changed in this regard not at all in
fact
well it's if we look back a little
farther to history there are some
lessons there too it's quite normal for
the victors to regard history as bunk
you know consign it to the trash can who
cares let's look ahead it's also quite
normal for the victims to take history
seriously for pretty good reasons there
just make a few observations it's a very
important matter I'll just barely touch
it but to be useful to think about it a
little today is actually not the first
occasion when Egypt and the United
States are in somewhat similar
situations the that was also true in the
early part of the 19th century economic
historians have argued that in that at
that time say around 1830 Egypt was
well-placed to undertake rapid economic
development at the same time the US was
beginning to do so
both Egypt in the US had rich
agriculture that included cotton which
is sort of the oil of the 19th century
the fuel of the early Industrial
Revolution though there was a difference
unlike Egypt the United States had to
develop cotton production and a
workforce by conquest extermination and
slavery the consequences are still very
much alive all you have to do is take a
look at the reservations for the
survivors of the extermination program
and also at the prisons that have
expanded very rapidly since the Reagan
years and far beyond any other country
and the needed there needed to house the
superfluous population left over by the
industrialization there's a pretty close
race class correlation so it ends up
being largely black it's not extent
Hispanic there was however one
fundamental difference between Egypt in
the United States at that time the for
Egypt on the other hand a comparable
course was barred by British power Lord
Palmerston declared that no ideas of
fairness towards Egypt or to stand in
the way of such great and paramount
interests of Britain as preserving its
economic and political hegemony he also
expressed we called his hate for the
ignorant barbarian Muhammad Ali
modernizing leader who dared to seek an
independent course and the Britain was
able to deploy its fleet and its
financial power to terminate to Egypt's
quest for independence and economic
development it's policies like these
incidentally that are substantially
responsible for the divide that
developed between what we call the first
in the third world they were not
very different in that period after
World War two the United States replaced
Britain as blue hegemon and the United
States adopted exactly the same stand
the u.s. made it clear that it would
provide no aid to Egypt unless Egypt
that hearing TV standard rules for the
week Adam Smith's prescriptions IMF
World Bank prescriptions the u.s. of
course continued to violate them but
that's according to the regular
principles as Wells of the u.s. imposed
high tariffs high tariffs on Egyptian
cotton to protect u.s. cotton production
and it led to a terrible dollar shortage
in Egypt that's the usual interpretation
of market principles going back
centuries market principles are kind of
like democracy you appeal to them when
they're useful disregard them when
they're harmful so it's not too
surprising that to see the campaign of
hatred against the United States that
concerned eisenhower over fifty years
ago based on the recognition that the
United States like Britain France others
with the power to do so the United
States supports dictators blocks
democracy and development and does so
for quite understandable reasons in Adam
Smith's defense I should mention that he
recognized what would happen to Britain
if it adhere to the rules of sound
economics there's what's now more or
less called in the other liberalism that
he warned that if British manufacturers
merchants and investors turned abroad
they might profit but England would
suffer however he felt that they would
be guided by what sometimes called a
home bias they'd prefer the home country
so as if it's the style and corporate
boardrooms and so on the 2012 election
is expected the cost
twelve billion dollars that's mostly
corporate funding of course there's no
other source and it's not surprising
that Obama right now is selecting
business leaders for top positions no
other way to get the money the public is
very angry and frustrated but as long as
the mawashi our principle prevails it
doesn't matter
well I've barely skimmed the surface of
these critical issues but I don't want
to end without at least mentioning
another externality that's dismissed in
market systems that's the fate of the
species that's an externality as far as
decisions are concerned systemic the
financial system is plagued well
understood by what's called systemic
risk namely it's going to crash if it
works the way I describe and systemic
risk is a problem but it can be remedied
it can be remedied by the taxpayer but
nobody's going to come to the rescue if
the environment is destroyed that it
must be destroyed is virtually an
institutional imperative it's worth
bearing that in mind business leaders in
the United States are conducting openly
announcing that they're conducting a
massive propaganda campaigns to convince
the public that anthropogenic global
warming is liberal hoax the that's
having an effect you can see the polls
the executives who are running these
campaigns know perfectly well that it's
not a hoax it's very grave but they have
no option of following that
understanding in their institutional
role they must ignore that externality
and act to maximize profit and market
share if one of them decides not to do
it he's out and somebody else's dinner
does do it these are properties of the
institution's not the individuals and
this particularly vicious cycle could
well turn out to be lethal just to see
how grave
the danger is you should have a look at
the new Congress in the United States
which is propelled into power by
business funding and propaganda almost
all of them are climate deniers they've
already begun begun to cut funding for
measures that might mitigate
environmental catastrophe and that's
likely all the disappeared we're still
some of them are true believers so for
example one of the new heads new head of
one of the subcommittee's on the
environment they explained that's
elsewhere right now the trajectories in
Cairo and Madison are intersecting in a
way but they're headed in opposite
directions in Cairo they're headed
towards eliminating towards gaining
basic rights that had been denied by the
western-backed dictatorships in Madison
they're heading towards trying to defend
rights that had been won in long and
hard struggles and are now under serious
attack they're sure to be far-ranging
consequences of what's taking place both
in the decaying industrial heartland of
the richest and most powerful country in
the world in human history in fact and
in what President Eisenhower called the
most strategically important area of the
world
a stupendous source of strategic power
and probably the richest economic prize
in the world in the few in the field of
foreign investment those are the words
of the State Department in the 1940s
that was a prize of course that the u.s.
intended to keep for itself and for its
allies in the unfolding a new world
order that was emerging from the ruins
of the Second World War the servant
plenty of changes since but the strike
despite all these dramatic changes
there's every reason to suppose
suspect suppose that today's
policymakers basically adopt the same
perspective they undoubtedly still
adhere to the judgment of one of the
most more influential advisors of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt a burly and
his words that control of the
incomparable energy reserves of the
Middle East would yield substantial
control of the world and correspondingly
loss of control would threaten the
project of global dominance that was
clearly articulated during World War two
by high-level planners and that has been
sustained in the face of major changes
in world order since that day these
common understanding is as is quite
often the case articulated most frankly
and clearly in the business press in the
u.s. in the Wall Street Journal where
their leading political correspondent
George old side I commented a couple of
days ago that there's a big problem in
the Middle East we have not yet learned
how to control the new forces that are
emerging the assumption is well of
course we have to control her of Egypt
mahalo center of the couple of years ago
and that was crushed by force but it was
April 6 and that gives the name for the
movement that erupted unexpectedly even
the organizers on January 25th he
Abbas's message of solidarity evoked the
traditional aspiration of labor
movements worldwide for solidarity among
the workers of the world and among
populations generally however flawed
their record labor movements have
regularly been in the forefront of
popular struggles for
both basic rights including labor rights
and democracy generally in Tahrir Square
and the streets of Madison and many
other places the popular struggles
underway right now that reached quite
directly to the prospects for authentic
democracy that means socio political
systems in which people are free and
equal participants in controlling the
institutions in which they live and work
and I stress participants and not mere
spectators that's the way democratic
theory has insisted is their function as
it's called the function of the public
the ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders to
quote walter Lippmann the most prominent
twentieth-century American public
intellectual wilson roosevelt
progressive these are in his highly
regarded progressive essays on democracy
and he was articulating a standard view
which actually traces back to the
founders of the US Constitution and is
upheld of course in much harsher forms
elsewhere right now the trajectories in
Cairo and Madison are intersecting in a
way but they're headed in opposite
directions in Cairo they're headed
towards eliminating towards gaining
basic rights that had been denied by the
western-backed dictatorships in Madison
they're heading towards trying to defend
rights that had been won in long and
hard struggles and are now under serious
attack they're sure to be far ranging
consequences of what's taking place both
in the decaying industrial heartland of
the richest and most powerful country in
the world in human history in fact
and in what president idol of Gordon
that it must demonstrate its commitment
to partnership with the West follow
orders in other words a scholar with the
Council on Foreign Relations asked how
do we keep the Turks in their lane their
departing you know something wrong in
their lane means following orders like
good Democrats our style Democrats
Brazil's Lula it was admonished in a New
York Times headline he was warned that
his effort with Turkey to provide a
solution to the uranium enrichment issue
outside the framework of us power is a
spot on the Brazilian leaders legacy and
brief do what we say that's your
function it's kind of an interesting
sidelight to all of this which has been
effectively suppressed the Iran Turkey
Brazil deal had been approved in advance
by President Obama presumably on the
assumption that it would fail and that
would provide an ideological weapon
against Iran that was revealed by the
British Foreign Office which released
the letter of support for it after
Brazil was censured when the effort
succeeded approval quickly turned the
century and Washington rammed through a
Security Council resolution which was so
weak that China readily signed and is
now chastised for living up to the
letter of the resolution but not
following Washington's unilateral
directives which go far beyond it that's
the current issue of Foreign Affairs the
main establishment foreign affairs
Journal well while the US can tolerate
Turkish disobedience though with dismay
a China is harder to ignore so the press
New York Times warns that
China's investors and traders are now
filling a vacuum in Iran as businesses
from many other nations especially in
Europe pull out in fear of the United
States and in particular it's expanding
its dominant role in Iran's energy
industries all of this is quite in
accord with the UN resolutions but
inconsistent with the more extreme US
demands they which have no legal
authorization other than what's granted
by power the it's it's interesting to
watch the Washington reactions reacting
with a touch of desperation so the State
Department warned China that if it wants
to be accepted in the international
community that's incidentally another
technical term that refers to the US and
whoever happens to agree with it at the
moment by the United States of course in
violation of the UN Charter but remember
that that doesn't apply to the United
States whether they are in fact the
developing a nuclear capability we don't
really know but perhaps so well the
Iranian threat is described in the
documents and the reports goes beyond
deterrence Iran is also seeking to
expand its influence in neighboring
countries and thus what to destabilize
the region as it's called notice that
when the u.s. invaded and occupied and
occupies Iran's neighbors
that's stabilization when Iran tries to
expand its influence a commercial
relations with its neighbors that's
destabilization that is absolutely
routine usage in foreign policy
commentary so for sometimes becomes
almost comical here's a prominent
foreign policy analyst James Chase
former editor foreign affairs rather on
the liberal side incidentally he was
properly using the term stability in its
technical sense when he explained that
in order to achieve stability in Chile
it was necessary to destabilize the
country namely by overthrowing the
elected I end a government installing a
vicious dictatorship sounds
contradictory but it isn't if you
understand the technical meaning of the
terms well other concerns about Iran no
time to go into they're interesting to
explore but I think they simply show
underscore what the guiding doctrines
are and they're continuing status and
imperial culture that's very much in
accord with the doctrines that were laid
down by FDR's planners back in during
the Second World War the United States
cannot tolerate any exercise of
sovereignty that interferes with its
global designs and the United States and
Europe are of course engaged and
punishing Iran for its threat to
stability and trying to get it to become
a more civilised country but it's useful
to recall how isolated the US and Europe
or the non-aligned countries which is
most of the world they have for years
been vigorously supporting Iran's right
to enrich uranium within the region as I
mentioned the irrelevant public even
strongly favors Iranian nuclear weapons
the major regional power turkey voted
against the latest US sanctions motion
in the Security Council along with
Brazil which is the most admired country
of the south is polls show then from the
state and in fact that's true of most of
this State College the state
universities in the country
Massachusetts and well these are
deliberate policy choices designed they
are designed essentially to privatize
the major universities so very likely
the stars in the system like Berkeley
and UCLA and maybe San Diego they'll
probably be privatized
they're almost like Ivy League
universities today huge tuition big
endowments and so on so they'll probably
be privatized and the rest of the system
will just shrink that was a very good
system oh and of course that has dire
effects for the future economy but again
that's an externality in a so far as
market systems apply they do to an
extent you don't consider their
short-term gain is what matters
so that's that's happening all over the
country and the same is happening with
the public schools so there's major
pressure which Obama is contributing to
as well to privatize the public school
system what are called charter schools
which still paid for by the public but
they're out of the public education
system there's plenty of studies of them
they they do roughly as well as
comparable public schools even though
they have many advantages like they
don't have to run the special education
programs they don't have unionized
teachers and so on with no special
performance gains and that's a way of
undermining public education which has a
kind of a deep purpose behind it it's
very much like the effort to destroy
social security there's a major efforts
been going on for years to try to
destroy the social security system I
said it's claimed open the newspaper so
you read the New York Times the
editorials will tell you we've got this
huge deficit problem so we have to deal
with entitlements Social Security
Medicare and Medicaid and not waste our
energy on other things
Social Security contributes zero to the
deficit zero it comes out of payroll
taxes okay it's got it first of all and
furthermore it's pretty well funded for
decades in advance
tinkering with funded forever but that's
gotta be killed the Medicare and
Medicaid it's true but the reason for
that is something that they won't
mention it's because of the privatized
health care system which is extremely
inefficient the u.s. spends about twice
as much per capita as every other
comparable country on health care and
the outcomes are among the poorest and
if you look at the privatized
unregulated health care system you can
see why but you're not allowed to touch
the financial institutions the insurance
companies and so on so that's kind of
like I say is an authoritative answer
which is ignored the authoritative
answer is provided by the regular
reports to Congress by the Pentagon and
US intelligence agencies come every year
reports on the global global security
and of course they include a section on
Iran most recent was almost a year ago
other reports make it very clear that
whatever the Iranian threat is it's not
military it's a little quote Iran's
military spending is relatively low
compared to the rest of the region in
fact it's less than a quarter of that of
Saudi Arabia and minuscule was compared
with the US of Koree its Iran's military
doctrine is strictly defensive that
designed to slow an invasion and to
force a diplomatic solution to
hostilities Iran has only limited
capacity to project force beyond its
borders they of course bring up the
nuclear option and say that Iran's
nuclear program and its willingness to
keep open the possibility of developing
nuclear weapons is a central part of its
deterrent strategy
well the brutal clerical regime in Iran
is undoubtedly a major threat to its own
people though hardly outranks US allies
in that regard but the threat lies
elsewhere
and it's ominous
one element of the threat is Iran's
potential deterrent capacity notice that
that's an illegitimate exercise of
sovereignty because it might interfere
with us freedom of action in the region
and it's of course glaringly obvious why
Iran would seek a deterrent capacity
just take a look at the disposition of
forces in the region including nuclear
forces seven years ago at one of
Israel's leading military historians
Martin von Krefeld wrote that the world
has witnessed how the United States
attacked Iraq for as it turned out no
reason at all had the Iranians not tried
to build nuclear weapons they would be
crazy particularly when they're under
constant threat by a constant threat of
attack by the United States of course in
violation of the UN Charter but remember
that that doesn't apply to the United
States whether they are in fact the
developing a nuclear capability we don't
really know but perhaps so well the
Iranian threat is described in the
documents and the reports goes beyond
deterrence Iran is also seeking to
expand its influence in neighboring
countries and thus what to was bitterly
condemned in 2003 when the government
had committed a major crime it followed
the will of 95 percent of the population
and refused to take part in the u.s.
British invasion of Iraq and that
demonstrated it's very weak grasp of
democracy which led to sanctions and a
sharp century same today after the 2010
Security Council misdeed Turkey was
warned by Obama's top diplomat on
European affairs Philip Gordon that it
must demonstrate its commitment to
partnership with the West follow orders
in other words a scholar with the
Council on Foreign Relations asked
how do we keep the Turks in their lane
they're departing you know something
wrong in their lane means following
orders like good Democrats our style
Democrats Brazil's Lula it was
admonished in a New York Times headline
he was warned that his effort with
Turkey to provide a solution to the
uranium enrichment issue outside the
framework of u.s. power is a spot on the

journalist well while the US can
tolerate Turkish disobedience though
with dismay that China is harder to
ignore so the Press New York Times warns
that China's investors and traders are

the outcomes are among the poorest and
if you look at the privatized
unregulated health care system you can
see why but you're not allowed to touch
the financial institutions the insurance
companies and so on so that's kind of
like off the agenda if the United States
had a health care system comparable to
other industrial countries that not only
but they're not the a' deficit that
actually be a surplus the about half the
deficit in addition to that is military
spending but those things are you know
off the agenda you have to go after
Social Security why Social Security it's
extremely efficient I'm an
administrative costs are crackly to
Europe but it has a couple of
deficiencies
it's no use whatsoever to privileged
people so you get it you know some
billionaire gets to another small amount
of money don't make any difference can't
even notice it but it's it's assessments
for most of the population especially
those who've been wiped out by the
fiscal catastrophe then pay that much
but it pays enough to get you by beyond
that it has a ideological problem which
is never described but I think it's
quite crucial actually has to do with
that message from Kemal Abbas to the
workers of Wisconsin that I mentioned
Social Security is based on the
principle of solidarity
you're supposed to care if the disabled
widow
across town has enough food eat and that
has to be driven out of people's heads
you're supposed to be concerned just
about yourself same defect in the public
education system like I don't have kids
in school
anymore so if I follow the rules I'm not
supposed to care if there's a public I
don't want to pay taxes for public
education but if you're infected by this
disease of the Solidarity you care if
the kid across the street can go to
school now that's got to be driven out
of people's heads same reason for the
attack on unions so you get these
massive attacks and I think that's
what's happening to the public education
system you know better than I whether
that applies here but I wouldn't be
surprised thank you
another question - sir the front thanks
a lot for your talk professor you've
been a major inspiration for me so thank
you for your work as well I did have a
question to ask you with regards
