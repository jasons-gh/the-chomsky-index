psychological balance rekt is really
existing capitalist democracy is a kind
of state capitalism with a powerful
state component of the economy but some
reliance on market forces but the market
forces that exist are shaped and
distorted in the interests of the
powerful by this by state power which is
heavily under the control of
concentrations of private powers of this
close interactions well if you take a
look at markets they are our recipe for
suicide period in market systems you do
not account it won't don't take account
of what economists call externalities so
say you sell me a car in a market system
we're supposed to look after our own
interests so I make the best deal I can
for me you make the best you can for you
we do not take into account the effect
on him that's not part of a market
transaction well there is an effect on
him there's another car in the road
that's greater possibility of accident
there's more pollution there's more
traffic cams for him individually it
might be a slight increase but this is
extended over the whole population now
when you get to other types of
transactions the externalities get much
bigger so take say the financial crisis
that one of the reasons for it is that
there are several the one is that
the in market trends that safe Goldman
Sachs makes it risky transaction of a if
they're paying attention cover their own
potential losses they do not take into
account flexible systemic risk that is
the possibility that the whole system
will crash if one of their risky
transactions goes bit that just about
happened with AIG the huge insurance
company they were involved in risky
transactions which they couldn't cover
the whole system is really going to
collapse but of course state power
intervened to rescue them state the task
of the stage is to rescue the rich and
powerful and to protect them and if that
violates market principles okay we don't
care about the market principles market
principles are essential to the poor but
systemic risk is an externality that's
not considered which would bring down
the financial system repeatedly if I
didn't have state power intervening well
there's another one that's even bigger
that's destruction of the environment
destruction of the environment is an
externality in market interactions you
don't pay attention to it so if you're
saitek parsons if you're a major energy
corporation and you can make profit out
of exploiting tar sands you simply do
not take into account the fact that your
grandchildren
a have a possibility to survive that's
an externality and in the moral calculus
of capitalism greater profits in the
next quarter outweigh the fate of your
gradual it's not just your grandchildren
but every
