I'm dick Gordon this is the connection
there are now two large movements of
Americans underway the thousands of
soldiers being assigned to the Persian
Gulf and preparation for an attack on
Iraq and the thousands of protesters
assigning themselves the task of
insisting that such an attack should not
happen the pace for both is picking up
next week the weapons inspectors report
to the UN President Bush makes his State
of the Union address and meets with his
comrade-in-arms Prime Minister Tony
Blair this against a backdrop of growing
criticism at home and abroad from people
determined to do what they can to
prevent a war our economy our
conversation with noam chomsky for close
to 40 years one of the most outspoken
critics of American foreign policy and
our question for you connectionless
nurse where do you stand on a us-led war
with Iraq what is the case for and
against and do the protests or can the
protests make a difference our numbers 1
800 for 238 255 it's 1 800 423 talk as I
mentioned my guest this hours Noam
Chomsky he's the MIT professor of
linguistics known around the world for
his prolific writing and speaking and
criticism of American foreign policy
first though a check in on the weekend
of protest and for that we turn to eli
Pariser he's director of international
campaigns for moveon.org hi eli i tell
me how you measure the importance of the
the long weekend of protests at this
time well I think it's extremely
important and perhaps what's most
important about it is that well we saw
literally hundreds of thousands of
people out in the streets that's just
the tip of the iceberg our organization
works with a group of 700,000 Americans
who are some of whom you know would went
to the protests on Saturday and Sunday
and some of whom didn't but they're all
very very concerned about this war and
they're get your numbers electronically
alive by people who sign up on the web
and then leave you with an email address
yeah
folks folks come into our list they sign
a petition or they make a phone call or
something like that and they say I want
to be a part of this and then we keep
them informed on all of the kind of
latest doings who are these people Eli
well it's hard to say because they're
you know what 700,000 folks you have
just about one of everything you have
multiple of everything but they tend to
be people who are not they wouldn't
consider themselves activists they're
not it some of them haven't been
politically active ever before and
they're joining up and signing up and
getting involved because they've never
felt this worried before about the
potential consequences for this country
and for the world if we go to war and so
they're they're ordinary mainstream
patriotic folks who feel like now's the
time that they have to speak up Chomsky
tell me how you're watching the protests
now and how you measure them at this
time well the most striking thing about
them i think is first of all that there
are worldwide there's never been a case
in history that i can think of where
there was such a whelming worldwide
opposition through a military action
that's being undertaken furthermore in
in the United States or in Europe there
simply is no historical precedent for
anything like this kind of opposition to
a war at the at a comparable stage
remember this war hasn't even begun yet
that's why I was asking you this you
have some experience here do you think
that means something at this point well
it certainly if history means something
yes it means something there literally
is no precedent so for example in the
case of the Vietnam War there was a
substantial protest but that was 67
years after the war had begun the the
u.s. actually publicly announced the
attack on South Vietnam
40 years ago 1962 that's when the public
announcement was made that the US Air
Force is bombing South Vietnam that
ultimately millions of people were being
driven and into what amount at the
concentration camps a chemical warfare
was initiated to destroy crops there was
no president it wasn't even a hint of
protest it wasn't until four or five
years later that protest began to reach
a substantial scale by that time South
Vietnam which was always the primary
target of the US attack had been
devastated there were saturation
bombings going on in densely populated
areas and so on and even then the
protest was mostly about the attack on
North Vietnam let me just go back to Eli
in terms of the protest and the people
that you're hearing from electronically
do you have any reason to believe that
the people who are checking in on the
website are are doing it and
participating because they believe they
can make a difference Eli yeah I think
you know the the the another difference
between this movement and some of the
some of the other anti-war movements
that we've seen in the last 10 or 20
years is that we have all sorts of
policy experts security professionals
you know the the the pub the security
elite many of those people are on our
side as well and so there's this feeling
i think that with as many members of
Congress as we have as many members of
you know many people who really know
their stuff that this isn't this isn't a
marginal concern and this is something
that comes from from sort of mainstream
America and that because of that we
actually stand a chance of budging the
administration you lie thanks for being
with us thank you for having me eli
Pariser is search of third shift of
International Affairs poor the
organization moveon.org and and Noam
Chomsky I've watched your writing in the
pages of the nation and across the
internet
this for a lot longer than people have
been marching in the streets in the way
that Eli is describing from the weekend
of protest do you see two types of
protests that go on as a matter of
course that there is the intellectual
argument the one involving political
academics like yourself and then they
the folks who will who will you know
pick up a sign and go to Washington or
do you see them as crossing over coming
together oh they're interacting and in
fact what Eli just said is quite
striking on the mainstream establishment
security elite that he was talking about
they did turn against the Vietnam War by
about 19 and 68 or 69 and then you had
them you know going to Washington and
criticizing Kissinger and so on now it
is just remarkable I mean the two major
foreign policy journals the Foreign
Affairs and foreign policy this month
both have articles condemning the war
pretty harshly the american academy of
arts and sciences which almost never
takes positions on controversial issues
is just published too long monograph on
on the war rather critical and this is
across the board this before it begins
let's talk about what's in the news
today there's a report from the BBC in
britain that tony blair testifying
before a parliamentary committee there
is saying that Iraq is rattled they're
weakening getting a massive amount that
Britain's getting a massive amount of
intelligence as to what's happening in
Iraq the headline on the story Saddam
regime crumbling we see from New York
the french Foreign Minister digging in
his heels going back to the UN Security
Council saying that even if the Security
Council meets again France will say no
the weapons inspection is working do you
draw link between that those kinds of
reports and they the measure of protests
that we've been watching well Tony Blair
is
almost unique among world leaders in
supporting Bush's war the opposition
internationally again is completely
without protest gets get stronger when
you get closer to the region so say take
turkey the major US ally you were there
just a week or so ago it's just there
and I but the latest poll results from
there indicate something like ninety
percent opposition to the war I just
can't find in fact the aired on the
basically the head of the governing
party just yesterday made another strong
statement opposing the war the u.s. is
trying to compel them to overrule the
will of the overwhelming majority of the
population and to participate in the war
and the US has weapons which may force
them to do that the financial and other
weapons but the the commitment of the US
government to override any kind of
democratic process is very striking what
what if rumsfeld and cheney and bush are
right what if the measure of the troops
being sent to the persian gulf the daily
reports and use papers around the world
about the build-up blair sang twenty six
thousand soldiers heading to the Gulf as
of as of yesterday is in fact exactly
what is required to intimidate Saddam
Hussein to the point where he says I'm
not going to have another confrontation
i will go into exile or or you know
dissidents in iraq will say we don't
want this we're going to overthrow
Saddam Hussein what if just the build-up
of force is precisely what's required to
remove this guy which at an amine you're
among those who calls him a monster of
course I've been saying that ever since
Rumsfeld was supporting him back in the
1980s right through his worst atrocities
oh yeah he's a monster we should get rid
of him but the threat the huge buildup
is not there in order to intimidate him
it's there in order to start a war
that's quite different certain certain
certainly may
should be taken any sensible measures to
help those who want to overthrow Saddam
Hussein but not inside the country
assisting Iraqis not using outside if we
turn to people who know something about
Iraq and unfortunately are pretty well
cut out of discussion here what they've
been for the most significant of them
are the the heads former and present
heads of the UN humanitarian mission
circle oil for peace mission these are
people who have these are distinguished
UN diplomats with years of experience
highly respected they have hundreds of
inspectors who've been traveling around
the country constantly they surely know
more about the Iraq that any Westerner
Dennis holiday and Huntsman splenic
another successor who have been pointing
out I'm in both of them resigned because
they regarded the sanctions as in their
words Jenna Seidel they say they've been
destroying the civil society
strengthening Saddam Hussein and if the
civil society could reconstruct Saddam
Hussein might be over easily ever thrown
from within that's happened with many
other monsters and dictators I mean
nobody would have predicted the
Ceausescu would have been overthrown or
the Suharto or that apart even that
apart height would have been overthrown
I mean these things happen when there's
a live functioning civil internal
society which we have destroyed through
the sanctions and any measures that
could be taken to support an Iraqi
overthrow of Saddam Hussein would be
very welcome and sending American troops
to the Gulf is not part of sending that
American troops to the Gulf role we
don't really know but it very likely
strengthens him just as the sanctions if

next week monday report from the weapons
inspectors tuesday state of the union
address from bush wednesday the UN
begins to bait on the report is it as
pivotal a week as it appears it's a very
pivotal week the question is whether the
US government will pay some attention to
what it knows perfectly well is
overwhelming popular and even
governmental opposition to the plans
that it is undertaking I mean in this
respect turkeys a rather striking
example turkey is the is a NATO ally
it's the major US base in the region
that's where the the US has major
military bases there with bombers flying
over Iraq and so on insert Atkinson
proximate according to the economy lund
economists the latest polls show ninety
percent opposition to the war now the
question is is that going to matter to
the US government what does it matter
that ninety percent of the population in
the country that's closest by and is the
closest US ally I think that this is a
an outrageous and horrible event that
tells us something that will tell us
something the answer to that question
will tell us something about the concern
of the of the Bush administration for
something as simple as democracy are
they going to pay attention and this is
not alone this is all through Europe
it's right through the region there
isn't it outside of Israel which has its
own interests there's no regional power
that supports the war in fact you have
to go very far to find any support even
in England Blair is pretty isolated even
in his own party in fact even in the
United States so if you take a look at
polls in the United States there they
seemed to indicate i stress seem higher
support for a war than you find anywhere
else like eighty eight percent according
well some that's not quite accurate
that's eighty percent if there is a
international support and a Security
Council yeah but even those figures
whatever they are are quite misleading
because the people are taking the polls
don't ask the necessary next question
namely why are you in favor of it and
soon as you ask that question you notice
something that distinguishes the United
States from the rest of the world it's
hard to miss the fact that although
Saddam Hussein is hated and reviled
everywhere he's feared only in the
United States it's only in the United
States that people fear that unless we
stop him today he's going to kill us
tomorrow he's feared in Iraq as well in
Iraq but that's of no concern to us
planners we know perfectly well how they
act the same people acted when he was
carrying out his worst atrocities they
supported him so that's not there okay
but if I follow that through but now the
question we ought to ask is why is he
fear why is the United States so
different from the rest of the world in
that it actually fears that he's going
to attack us well you know that's in
September there has been a drumbeat of
propaganda in the united states since
September trying to convince people that
Saddam Hussein is an imminent threat to
our existence is knowing a mushroom
cloud over New York why don't weren't
they afraid in Turkey or in queit or
Iran or other places why Europe why only
the United States well you banged heads
with the people in Washington often
enough look at their list of reasons why
Iraq needs why this this attack needs to
take place that any of a single reason
why he ran but the reason that they give
haven't changed protecting the US from
weapons of mass destruction combating
terrorism promoting democracy I mean no
amount of protest or in Turkey or France
as has said anything which would push
them off Oh a total on the contrary it
is only in the united states that there
is concern that he
might attack us which is a contingency
so remote that no one else in the world
even pays attention to it this is a
special fact about us propaganda and its
effect inside the united states since
September happens to be when the
campaign began it's also not
coincidentally the moment when the
midterm congressional election campaign
began and it was in fact specifically
clearly directed to the election and it
succeeded it succeeded in suppressing
people's primary interests and
socio-economic issues and making them
huddle under the umbrella of power now
going back to the polls if we extract
that different between the United the
United States and other countries I
think we'd find that opposition to the
war here is approximately like
everywhere else our number is 1 800 for
238 255 first to Norfolk Virginia and
Joe's calling in hi Joe hi thank you for
taking my call go ahead um I'm a
minister and I have definite pacifist
tendencies but I am torn because I do
have this fear that um a nuclear weapon
or another weapon of mass destruction
might make it through our porous borders
and be detonated and so I wonder given
that fact if war with Iraq isn't
something that's necessary well I think
your fears are very appropriate and it's
been pointed out by the CIA foreign
intelligence agencies a plenty of
analysts hears and you can read the
current foreign policy journals that the
way to maximize the fear that you're
concerned about is to attack your rack
there is no you know note neither the
CIA nor anyone else has suggested that
there's any likelihood of Iraq attacking
the United States with weapons of mass
destruction that would be a recipe for
instant incineration
however they have pointed out and it's
pretty plausible that if the United
States does attack Iraq it's possible
that they may set off some actions
either of revenge or deterrence and the
only ones really available to them are
just the kinds of things you described
maybe not a nuclear weapon but some
terrorist act that may already be in
place and is likely to be used if there
is an attack on Iraq you can actually
read that in the CIA report that was
leaked presented to Congress last
October but it's pretty obvious I mean
analyst has been pointing that out all
along what they've been pointing out is
that in order the argument that you're
giving it and that comes from the
administration is that in order to deter
a very low probability potential attack
we are going to carry out an action
which raises the probability of such an
attack to a rather high level there's a
piece of the puzzle though that's
missing which i think is part of joe's
concern I've heard have heard it before
on this program and that is that the
u.s. claims to know a great deal more
about what weapons are in fact being
hoarded away in Iraq that that this
information hasn't even been given to
the weapons inspectors the explanation
being that if if that information was
out the weapons would be moved but what
I mean isn't that in in large part where
the fear comes from that sense that
there's a great deal of intelligence
information out there that nobody's
privy to accept the people in this
notice the first of all they've claimed
that and there isn't the slightest
reason to believe whenever they've
presented any information it's proven to
be inaccurate furthermore if they had
such information they would precisely be
giving it to the weapons inspectors
secretly not so the weapons would be
moved secretly so they can then go
precisely to the places where those
weapons are the fact that they're not
giving the information suggests
something namely they don't have it but
even if they had it let's say they had
it i suppose that i'm saying is a
burying nuclear weapons somewhere and
though he's been able to find them
that's not the concern that the caller
raised he raised a serious concern that
is not a serious concern I mean even if
you know it's hopelessly unlikely but
let's imagine that Saddam Hussein had
nuclear weapons how would he wouldn't
use them against the United States or
against anyone if he even made a minimal
threat to use them Iraq would be
obliterated job a Vietnam but but the
the question that he did raise is
important what about terrorist acts in
the United States or in other countries
which may already be in place that has
nothing to do with nuclear weapons in
Iraq that has to do with the kind of
terrorism that is feared and that is
precisely what is likely to be elicited
by an attack on Iraq joheatherjo
terrorism in the United States as a
result of an attack rather than in
advance of it it's scary and the issue
is just really complicated and I'm I've
been trying to i get to wrap my mind
around it and figure out what's best but
it's very difficult these days I think
the logic is quite clear in the end the
CIA and other analysts are quite
explicit about this again both Foreign
Affairs journals this month if Iraq
isn't as the CIA pointed out if Iraq
although that they find no probability
of a very low likelihood of anything now
if if Iraq is attacked if Saddam
Hussein's back is to the wall if they
have no other choice yeah chances are
they'll pull out all the stops so Joe
who do you listen to where are you
getting your information um from here
from network news from cable news just
about everywhere that I can find it well
I'd really advise you to read the the
CIA the CIA letter to the Senate
Intelligence Committee that was I think
published in The New York Times I
believe in October 9th where they just
repeat what everybody knows that the
chances of a Iraqi attack anywhere now
are extremely low but they become quite
I if Iraq is under attack and if Saddam
Hussein's back is against the wall in
his desperate Joe thanks for your call
let's go to Revere Massachusetts ians
joining us hi Ian good morning thanks
for calling thank you I I have a
question for professor Chomsky which
goes as follows now and let me preface
this by saying that I am a left dish I
am a dove or possibly farther to the
left but anyway that said my question
goes as follows now I'd like to get a
more comprehensive and perhaps
comprehensible view of Professor
chomsky's foreign policy police now I'm
going to go back to a recent one I've
only got a one hour so here I more
specific question again here we go all
right I want I'm curious to note wyd
professor Chomsky came out so strongly
against the US involvement in the Kosovo
and also in Bosnia where as I see that
is one of the few legitimate uses of
American military power since World War
two actually I said virtually nothing
about Bosnia was more or less supportive
of the final actions that were taken i
thought that earlier steps should have
been taken in the early 90s to prevent
the atrocities that later take took
place but you didn't read anything of
mine about that you have read secondary
reports of it too they didn't write
anything about it on the cousin you know
sorry there was a publication called
masters of the universe and it was a
critique strong critique of u.s.
involvement military of in Kosovo yeah
but you talked about Bonnie let's take
to Kosovo Tory in the case of buzz of
Kosovo what I wrote is that the question
of whether the US should the US should
bomb Kosovo is unanswered I left it
basically unanswered I said I thought
there were diplom and I do think that
there were diplomatic options that could
have been pursued and i think is pretty
strong evidence for that in retrospect
but I said almost nothing about it I
talked about a different issue namely
what were the motives for the bombing of
Kosovo the claim
was that the bombing of Kosovo was
undertaken in order to put an end to
ethnic cleansing and as I pointed out
review them that is simply false there
is an extensive rich record of Western
documentation from the State Department
from NATO from the OSCE from the
international observers and what it
points out explicitly is that the ethnic
cleansing was a consequence of the
bombing not a cause in fact we now have
Wesley Clark the generals memoirs in
which he explains that he pointed out to
Washington a month before the bombing
that if the bombing was undertaken there
would be atrocities and ethnic cleansing
and NATO would be doing nothing to be
able to stop them well I went through
that whole record and I went through the
also the record of the positions
diplomatic positions that were taken by
the US and by Serbia on the eve of the
bombing and pointed out further that
after the eight days of bombing the the
a peace agreement was reached which was
a compromise between the two and I said
that raised serious questions about the
bombing and I think it does but that's
about all that but if we look back to
that time there were a lot of people who
listened to what you said about Kosovo
and said chomsky's gone too far on this
one that is so far by repeating the by
reviewing in detail the documentation
that was being given by Western sources
about what was happening no I don't
think so i think that if i reply recall
at the time and i'm not going to go back
into a bunch of documents that i don't
have in front of me you've got a better
recall of them that I do but that was
that is there ever a time when this type
of force biet nato-led Viet un-led be it
american-led can work on behalf of human
rights on the in principle it's
certainly possible in fact you can think
of cases where it might have been useful
the question was in the end here given
what we know and what we know is from
overwhelmingly massive Western
documentation
appropriate in that case was it
appropriate to carry out bombing with
the expectation that it would lead to
massive atrocities in ethnic cleansing
conscious expectation when in fact there
were diplomatic options on the table and
the ultimate result was a compromise
between them that was the question I
actually took no strong position on the
answer to the question but I did go
through that evidence and I think that
in retrospect we should rethink that and
I i I'd say the same about other cases
we should look carefully at the evidence
look the use of force you you never have
to have an argument against the use of
force whether its domestic affair you
know inter personal affairs or
international affairs you need an
argument for the use of force and it has
to be a very strong argument always
again whether its domestic abuse or
international relations you need a very
severe when you call for violence I'm
not a pacifist I think that sometimes
that burden can be met and I've given
cases but it is a very heavy burden in
the case of Kosovo in my opinion it
wasn't met for the reasons I just
mentioned and have reviewed in detail in
this case I think there is I didn't come
close to being met but yes there are
cases so for example you know I
supported us actions after the US was
attacked in World War two then there are
other cases where I think it's possible
however if we're really interested in
reducing the level of violence and
terror in the world there are many
things we can do short of the use of
violence the major one is to stop
participating in it it's kind of
interesting that that's never discussed
so for example I did just returned from
Turkey where some of the worst
atrocities of the 1990s took place and
much worse than anything attributed to
Russia which in Kosovo before the bomb
NATO bombing and that was carried out
with overwhelming us support millions of
people driven out of the devastated
countryside tens of thousands killed
just a couple of weeks ago I visited the
refugees living in miserable slums of
can't go back to the destroyed
countryside that's a way to stop
atrocities and you can run through many
such examples my guess is noam chomsky

let's go to Rocky Mountain North
Carolina Alan's joining us hi Alan hi
there thanks for calling thank you first
of all I just wanted to make a statement
number one I think we need to support
our president I think he knows you know
the details better than you know the
most people I think he is a lot of
people around him that can tell him you
know what is going on and what needs to
be done number two is we definitely need
to support our troops number three we
don't need another Vietnam where we have
a split country where you know they come
back and and you know they're getting a
bunch of hassle and everything else you
know we need to support our troops need
to let them know that we're behind them
and I don't I know I'm not for worried
and nobody's for war but if we have to
the job needs to be done now I'm hoping
that it will scare Saddam into making
some some Bob you know changes enough to
where we don't have to go to war maybe
he will see that this that you know that
were serious and before that happens
he'll stop but if he doesn't we idea we
have to make a change and if we have to
do it we do and he said the other guy
said something about the fact that I'm
media don't need to worry about them
attacking us but we've already been
attacked once and why not why not do
something about it when we can instead
of saying oh afterwards oh gosh I can't
believe that just happened we need to
get serious we need to protect our
country and even if nobody else agree
with us we have to do we have to do to
protect our country Alan I'm just going
to ask you to hang on a second and let
Noam Chomsky talk back to you here well
I agree with you certainly that we
should support our troops and I think
the best way to support them is to bring
them right back home so they won't go
into a war that nobody wants and doesn't
make any sense as for just following the
orders of the President I don't agree
with you that's what's done in
totalitarian States not in democratic
societies and democratic societies you
evaluate for yourself whether the
leadership is making the right decisions
or not you don't just follow them
blindly as to defending ourselves from
being attacked I completely agree with
that and therefore I also agree with the
US intelligence agencies foreign policy
analysts and others who point out the
obvious we were not attacked by Saddam
Hussein there is no known connection and
very unlikely to be a connection between
Saddam Hussein and al-qaeda they're all
monsters but the totally different kinds
of monsters and they hate each other the
best if we want to raise the probability
of an attack on the United States the
best way to do it is to invade Iraq now
that has been pointed out over and over
again even by the CIA yes it's very
likely that if we it's not very likely
but it's possible that if we attack Iraq
Saddam Hussein will use the only weapon
available to him namely attacks in the
united states otherwise there's no
probability that so sure we should
defend the United States by being
sensible you don't defend the United
States by increasing the probability of
an attack on the United States let me
point it make another point an attack on
Iraq even under the most optimistic
scenario of Donald Rumsfeld you know
over instantly no fighting everything is
wonderful it's still almost inevitably
going to spawn a new generation of
terrorists bent on revenge looking for
deterrence realizing only only way to
deter an American attack is either by
developing weapons of mass destruction
or by carrying out terror
that will seriously increase the
insecurity of the United States so yes
we should be definitely worried about
defending ourselves but we should do it
sensibly Alan yes what do you think you
what he's saying but at the same time
you know it seems to me that we're going
to act like a little scaredy-cat because
the fact that we're not going to do
because maybe more terrorists will come
about well I'm sorry but we need to be
an American country we need to be a
strong country and that's just a liberal
view that and he was I I just feel like
he's definitely a liberal because you
know we need to stand up for this
country we don't need to keep sitting
down and whining and and being a little
scaredy-cat we got to go in there and
kick butt and get it done now if it
increases the danger to us Alan even if
it increases the danger to the United
States I think we've lost to Alan there
who I think also that yeah image point 1
843 8255 Durham North Carolina Jane is
joining us hi Jane a good morning my
question is very specific I have not
heard it answered anywhere and that is
exactly what do we do about saddam's
flagrant throwing off of the regulations
and sanctions set down by the the
Security Council at the UN the
international community how do you
address what he is doing to just throw
that out and what is the precedent that
is set by that
the way in which you deal with his
violations of the Security Council
resolutions is exactly what is being
done namely enforced them by having
inspectors carry out the most intensive
by far the most intensive investigations
that have been ever been carried out to
sea to try to overcome those violations
and in fact we should generalize that
Saddam Hussein is not the only he's a
monster but it's not the only place in
the world where Security Council
resolutions are violated there's been a
good deal of discussion not so much in
the United States but everywhere else in
the world over the fact that the leading
US ally also happens to be the leading
violator of UN Security Council
resolutions namely Israel so those
should be enforced but all of this
discussion is missing here is a point
that no one has discussed and it's
extremely significant how many just ask
yourself how many UN resolutions would
Saddam Hussein have violated if he had
the veto power well the answer to that
is none if he had a veto he would have
violated no resolutions so therefore if
we're serious about violating security
council resolutions and about rendering
the UN irrelevant the first thing we
should look at is the veto that's the
way to violate security council
resolutions veto them well if we look at
the veto we make an interesting
discovery since the 1960s after
decolonisation said in the US UN was no
longer under control the leading far in
the lead in vetoing resolutions is the
United States second is Britain no one
else is even close that means the most
massive violation of security council
resolutions happens to be right here
Britain next and remember if Saddam
Hussein had that capacity he wouldn't
violate any resolutions the veto is the
main method for violating security
council resolutions and
that has not been discussed at all and
that's outrageous it's the major topic
but but the to follow that along you
bring Saddam Hussein in and give him a
veto that's not going to change anything
I should certainly I'm not calling for
that I'm just saying that if we're
serious about the question of violating
security council resolutions we should
first of all look at the major way of
violating them namely by vetoing them
our numbers 1 843 8255 Jane thank you
for that too where we going now to
raleigh north carolina and Leonard's
joining us hi Leonard hey how are you
fine thanks thank you for taking my call
I'm a former soldier from you know did
my 20 years and everything in the
military and as far as war comes up to
the point you know I think we better not
support our president we better start
supporting the fact and the question was
around about supporting the troops are
you one of the parties America designed
to support our troops coming back mangal
Gulf War Syndrome and the United States
government don't want to notarize that
as an illness so you got a lot of
soldiers walking around here they can't
get the benefits can't get the treatment
that this required form is that how you
support our soldiers we need to look at
Saddam Hussein is a serious threat and
ground war is definitely something we
don't want to deal with him on because
he has chemical agents he has nuclear
biological agents possibly we haven't
proven that but what facts have the
government given us if you if you're so
ready to go to war where is the fact put
it out in the open because you're asking
a lot of soldiers to go out there put
their life on the line and then what we
don't complete war so you're saying
bring everybody home or you're saying
that the president yeah okay go ahead
yeah bring everybody home because we've
we've started two wars your sama bin
Laden and where's he yet we haven't even
found him but we have fact that that war
was even completed we don't want America
to be attacked and attacking attacking
is one way we're going to get demolished
here because we don't know where the
little cells are where all the little
hate people are against America we're
not a well-liked country so you know why
are we so eager to go to war
have we did everything possibly to talk
this thing out have we sent the right
people to the talking because it's all
about the image if you send President
Bush over there well you know he doesn't
have a personality type person so
personality so okay Leonard let me let
me let me see if I can bring trouble I I
mean I agree with everything you said I
think the way to support the troops is
to keep Matt a danger yes it's perfectly
pockets I mean if I had to guess I would
say probably Saddam Hussein does have
chemical and biological weapons a fair
probability and if he had them and he's
in a Denny's being on the verge of being
destroyed and killed he'll probably use
them against American soldiers maybe in
the United States so yes you're quite
right all of this and I think you're
right that no serious reasons have been
given for this and remember before you
use violence you need very serious
reasons that should lead us to ask what
the real reasons are since they it's
almost certain that they're not the ones
that are being proposed let me ask you
if I can when you speak as you have so
often in this country and abroad about
the people taking into account American
misdeeds in the past they the Foreign
Affairs issues from Central America from
South America you talk about these
things a lot and use that to make the
case that the United States is in many
ways the leading terrorist power in the
world fair enough I yes I think that's
true and that and the point is that if
we want to stop violence and terror one
way of doing it would have whatever you
think the however you think the u.s.
ranks and they don't care where you rank
whatever it may be one way to reduce
violence and terror is to stop
participating in it that would already
reduce the level and sub islands enterar
very considerably now let's just take
the Middle East I mean it's perfectly
true as the last caller said that the
u.s. is very much u.s. polish not
Americans Americans are liked US
policies are very much opposed in the
at least why is this well we can find
the answers if we like we can find the
answers in the this is a very free
country the United States we have a lot
of information about us planning because
it's we've access do you go back to say
the 1950s when president from
Declassified but let's not let's go back
to September eleventh two thousand and
yes he is that everybody uses that
earlier that begins early and don't
start on September 11 but but what we're
talking about is American public
attitudes about a war today based on
attitudes which were formed in large
part on that day September in the United
States in the United in the United
States on September 11th the right
response is to ask the question why it
happened to to deal with the situation
that made it happen and to alleviate
that situation but so for do that from a
very clinical academic point of view and
I wonder academic I don't I don't want
to have other terrorist atrocities in
the United States and if you want to
reduce terrorist atrocities if you're
even saying the first thing you do is
look at their causes if you don't want
to look at their causes you'll just
increase the atrocities I mean that's
just alimentary it's nothin Ike adem
Ichabod it I mean that's for my
grandchildren I don't want them to be
attacked so therefore I want to know the
reasons why things like this happen if
we want to know the reasons why things
like this happen we're going to have to
search the record and there we will find
the reasons as I started to say you can
go back 40 years and find President
Eisenhower talking about the campaign of
hatred against us in the Middle East and
you'll find the National Security
Council giving the reasons namely the
u.s. support people in the region
perceive the United States rightly they
say as supporting oppressive harsh
governments which blocked democracy and
development and doing it because we want
control of their oil resources you can
find the same things when the Wall
Street Journal does analyses of opinion
there today
yeah we ought to pay attention to them
ask the questions connection dismiss
there's a challenge for you from my
guest Noam Chomsky thank you so much for
coming in yep noam chomsky professor of
linguistics at MIT longtime critic u.s.
