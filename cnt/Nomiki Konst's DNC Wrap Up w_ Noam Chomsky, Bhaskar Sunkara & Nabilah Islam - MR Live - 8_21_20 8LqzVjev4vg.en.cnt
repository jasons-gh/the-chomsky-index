the majority report with sam
cedar
welcome to the majority report and
the nomikee show our shows are
partnering up
to do a recap of the democratic
unconvention
and to discuss what's next for the
movement so for the next hour i am
honored to be in sam's seat
from my new york city apartment and
today we have
the infamous the great gnome chomsky
followed by a wonderful panel well this
was
the week a week we will look back on and
say that this was
the beginning of the end of donald trump
hopefully
just as joe biden was getting ready to
deliver his speech of his career
blasting through the low expectations
trump had set and laying out why trump
has to go
steve bannon was being arrested aboard a
100 million
dollar yacht off of the very
appropriately named gold coast of
connecticut
arrested by postal agents for profiting
off of donald trump's
great scam remember mexico was going to
pay for the wall
well it turns out private americans
kicked in millions to pay for the
dreadful wall
and bannon and his little cronies stole
part of it according to the charges of
course
which is by the way uh were brought to
you by the gutsy interim u.s attorney in
manhattan
she is interim because attorney general
barr forced her old boss for reasons he
still hasn't explained out
see the arc of the universe is uh
long and it does tend towards george
justice but
it might just be payback there is more
republicans in the senate joined
democrats in a report saying that
russia did help trump in the 2016
election
msnbc must be losing its mind right now
with excitement someone to go check on
rachel
maddow so facts do matter trump's faux
reality is collapsing around him but if
we all stand together
he will be out in just a few weeks
hopefully but as progressives it's
important for us to say that this is not
the election we hoped for
or believe is best for the country trump
must go
fascism must be stopped no doubt there
but was it right to move focus
on expanding the democratic vote to its
right
this convention doubled down on appeals
for what mayor
c.i.a pete called future
former republicans we all see the plan
build a coalition anchored in the middle
so we progressives can't go too
far on breaking down corporate power
delivering medicare for all
launching a green new deal instead of
worrying about
future formal republicans bless their
hearts i say we go for
present working people here is a stat
that every progressive
should post on their wall in the last
presidential election
election in 2016 the vote for the
democratic ticket by working people
people with incomes under 50 000 shrink
dramatically
obviously we all want trump out but i
say we can have it done
by getting back to who we are and
getting working people back
to vote on where it was better right
especially in the midst of this pandemic
especially with
unions under attack especially with
climate change impacting working people
more
especially with an exacerbating housing
crisis especially with these uprisings
especially with the economy on the verge
of collapse
we could have done without so many
republicans
and instead heard from some of the most
amazing union leaders like sarah nelson
for flight attendants mark demons
diamondstein from
postal workers bonnie castillo of the
national nurses union
or even someone who who has spoken at
the democratic convention before
randy weingarten of the american
federation of teachers
frankly focusing on working families not
republicans is likely to bring in
working republicans
too okay i didn't get the convention
that i wanted
but we can still have the election we
progressives need
the working people deserve let them
focus on the middle of the road and
bring in those future former republicans
and
and dead armadillos our job is to bring
working people back
the turnout of working people will send
a message that will be heard loud and
clear in the
biden white house and in the new
congress biden did leave that door open
wide for us he said obide administration
will have
four top goals containing the virus
rebuilding the economy establishing
racial justice
and controlling climate change that is
the progressive agenda
our challenge is to make sure he really
gets that job done
containing the virus can't just be about
a profitable vaccine for drunk
drug companies it must mean a robust
system of public
health so working people get regular
preventative care
build the economy back better of course
that's what we've been saying all along
before this crisis
the old economy with its grotesque
inequities
helped create this crisis building a
better one isn't a slogan to us
it's an urgent necessity it's life or
death
purging racism from the system can't
just be
good speeches and taglines having our
heart
in the right place won't do it we need
to break down and defund
corporate legal political and government
systems and put them back
together in a new way and on climate
change
of course we want good american jobs in
clean energy
but it isn't close to enough we must
break our addiction to fossil fuels and
fracking
and do it fast rejoining the paris
agreement is not enough
the green new deal is our compromise
biden has a duty to go further and we
have a duty in the general
to push him further so working people
vote it's not our
job to get people to vote it is his job
we are the working people people and i
am not here to tell you
how to vote i won't shame you but i will
urge you
to push the biden campaign and the
administration when he is hopefully
president
we've seen this movie before and
hopefully after the election when the
biden white house
looks at the voting results they will
see it was working
people not future former republicans who
gave them power
and donations in 2016 hillary won a
pathetic
53 percent of voters with family income
under 50 000
that was down from barack obama's sixty
percent
but it is actually even worse than that
in two thousand forty seven percent of
the voters
had incomes under fifty thousand dollars
and in
2016 they were only 36 of the electorate
i wish i could say that was because
incomes had soared so much that
there were just fewer families making
under 50 000 a year
but we know that isn't true working
people are walking away
biden needs to bring them back urgently
in this election
and show that the democratic party is
really the party of the future
now we have a terrific show up up next
is the
iconic professor noam chomsky and then
later
we have a panel discussion about the
movement with bosco

of the
progressive list nibila islam but first

[Music]
oh
[Music]
well welcome back to the majority report
slash the nomikee show we are partnering
up on this show today
uh doing a recap of the dnc uh before we
get to professor chomsky we're dealing
with some technical stuff here because
obviously everybody is filming from
their homes now so it's not easy
we know we know the jam um and thanks
for your patience with with the show and
i hope you got to learn
relearn uh the macarena which i
think i know it was middle school um
let's just let's just talk about a
little bit what's going on in the world
uh if you watched the dnc at least the
night of aoc's speech
uh there was a bit of controversy over
how she only
spoke for 60 seconds and why is it that
other folks like michael bloomberg and
christine todd whitman
and congresswoman molinari exactly i'm
sure you don't know who they are because
they haven't been in office in years
um why is it that they were able to
speak and she of course as a squad
member being progressive
uh was not and nbc uh
did not report accurately on this and uh
because she did not say joe biden's name
uh they called her out for it and of
course you know she does not she stands
up
to to anyone pretty much uh so she
called them out and called out their
reporting
um matt do you want to join us to
discuss this a little bit i know we have
a clip of
bernie sanders finally responding to
this controversy over
how you know aoc didn't mention joe
biden's name yeah yeah
uh you want me on video too i'll join
the video but just
video everyone misses you matt come on
give me just a second to join you on
video but uh yeah i mean i thought aoc i
would have gave aoc and
frankly ilhan omar a uh a prime speaking
slot
um if i was in charge of these i mean
it was actually ridiculous it wasn't
just that they didn't get spots many
members of congress
let's remind everyone aoc is the
youngest woman ever elected
to congress ever so you want to talk
about the night of the women
and and history that is history
um but also as i mentioned in my opening
we didn't have any union leaders speak
we had some union members
but we did not have any leaders who have
traditionally had spots at the
convention even
with with hillary clinton so um
can we roll that quick clip with bernie
and how and and what he uh
had to say representative ocasio-cortez
should she have been given a longer
speaking slot at the convention
well i think there is some confusion
about that and i think the reason for
the confusion
has to do with the dnc and it has to do
with the media
uh so let me tell you what happened
because it's not complicated bob as you
are well aware
uh at conventions people who
ran for president who received a certain
minimal number of votes
are entitled to have their name brought
forth and have their delegates
vote for them you know i won a number of
states uh in this
in in this uh democratic primary and
the people who supported me have a right
to say well you know i voted for bernie
sanders
uh and that's all that we this is kind
of perfunctory this is what is done
in every convention it's done in normal
republican conventions democratic
commencement
i asked alexandria uh we were told by
the biden campaign which was fine
uh that y'all you can uh you'll have two
one-minute slots uh ones to nominate you
and ones who
uh second you and we had bob king who's
the former president
of the united automobile workers one of
the you know great unions in this
country from michigan
uh bob nominated me and alexandria
secondly
i think what the dnc was saying is oh
you know she's speaking
no i mean they didn't invite her i think
they should have that's the whole other
story
they should have what's that what's the
what's the story there
well i mean the story is they should
have had more progressives speaking
giving them speaking spots
spots but uh this was just a
perfunctory uh nomination and and
seconding of me
of which there was one minute that's it
and she was accused of not
you know saying she's supported by she
was nominating me she is of course
supporting barton so i think
the confusion there rests with i think
what the dnc was saying
and certainly media not understanding uh
what happens at a convention
i totally get that senator but it's also
a choice to give her that one minute
nominating speech versus
six minutes or so yeah that's right i
gave her the one minute
and that was my choice okay i love how
it's like
presented by a t business yeah i know
that's the
most dystopian thing about this it's
just covered in ads but uh
exactly i okay so this is infuriating to
me because
um i know i know that bob costa knows
how the dnc works a lot of reporters
don't a lot of reporters
are covering the like the drama of the
day they're covering you know the horse
race whatever it is
um i think the big issue here is that
they're
using the fact that like the rules are
complicated to set bernie sanders up
and i think this is a perfect example of
of
manufacturing just just just this is
this is exactly what name chomsky talks
about so um with that
we do have professor chomsky thank
goodness we figured out the technology
here
uh so um just let me know when he goes
goes up next because i think um here he
comes he'll join us now
matt yep and he's connected to audio and
we should have the video
shortly hopefully great chomsky are you
with us
yes i am can you we can
hear you we can hear you but not see you
okay perfect
excellent oh there he is hello dr
chomsky it's nice to see you
am i in the screen i can't tell you look
great
you sound great and you're in tucson
which i was
was for the last five months so uh dr
chomsky thank you for joining us uh
this on the nomikee show which is being
aired let's get it really confusing here
on the majority report we're doing a
special
uh co-show today so thank you for
joining us for the special
glad to be here uh we just showed a clip
of
uh senator bernie sanders talking with
bob costa from
uh from washington post and and he uh
was discussing how senator
senator sanders when he was nominated at
the convention by aoc alexandria
ocasio-cortez
uh she was called out by nbc news for
um not saying joe biden's name and it
illustrated
an example of how nbc which does know
the dnc's rules of nomination
uh tried to use the fact that that
alexandria ocasio-cortez did not say
joe biden's name at the convention
against her
and we were just discussing right
beforehand this is a perfect
illustration of manufacturing consent
in which the the corporate media surely
knows how the dnc conventions work if
they know anything
but they still wanted to pit uh
progressives against central so what do
you think of that just from the start
well there's a clear conflict between
the uh
democratic convent between the dnc
the democratic national council and the
uh
liberal constituency uh the uh
you can see it in the debates over the
program
click the blue add to chrome button then
click add extension
to continue oh we have a little
technical
sorry i didn't hear that uh we had a
little bit of a technical glitch there
uh go ahead keep going technical problem
there was a pop-up sound but i think it
passed i think so yeah
it's what happens when we're doing this
from home so so you're saying that there
was a
uh there is a clear divide right now
uh between the progressives and the
future clearly in the
program so for example the uh
the both uh
both actually both even between
biden and the dnc so joe biden
and kamala harris both of them
each of them separately said that they
wanted to
have to end subsidies for
fossil fuel companies that was part of
the democratic party program
when the dnc management saw it
they cut it out they're thinking about
the donors in the fossil fuel donors in
pennsylvania and ohio so they cut out
the program of their own
nominee not just sanders and aoc
biden and harris they cut it out at the
last minute
and they did it behind closed doors
which um you know
it happened behind the scenes it didn't
happen with a vote
uh it surely didn't happen in front of
any cameras and
and it also happened while everybody was
paying attention to this
this uh this i guess well-crafted
uh convention so i i mean
i guess what we're trying to figure out
right now is
is if joe biden is elected and and
he uh takes office and effectively he
will take over the democratic national
committee
are progressives going to be in worse
shape in that
the the democratic establishment in
terms of the movement
pushing forward the democratic
establishment will have the reigns again
it's not like we're going to have an
election over dnc
chair anymore suddenly it will be joe
biden's party
center for american progress will be in
power again
uh you know all of the institutions that
surround
how do you see this playing out it's
very hard to say
there's this there's not only a democrat
republican
conflict there's a conflict internal to
the democratic party between the
clinton new democrats
donor-oriented wall street oriented
and the base of the party which is
basically social democratic wants uh
wants to move on issues like health care
ending fossil fuels so on that's a
conflict
same one in the labor party in england
in fact the what you saw in england was
a real
power play when the parliamentary labor
party the blair party
uh along with the media mass media
almost
uniformly uh really destroyed the
popular labor party
they destroyed corbin who had turned the
labour party into a
participatory party with mass popular
involvement they couldn't take that they
killed it
if you take a look at that 800 page
report that came out on shenanigans
inside the labor report
you can see the extent to which they
went to destroy
the threat of a popular based labour
party
they wouldn't tolerate that and they
managed to
destroy it basically and i think we're
seeing
something of the same conflict here so
for example the
dnc and where they control the states
were able to purge sanders voters
in 2016 they probably did it this time
too we haven't got the figures yet
but now we see it even more sharply
because it's even between the
clintonite dnz establishment
and their own candidate that's
who's one of them actually who went a
little too far
in uh threatening the donor class
professor chomsky um what american
elections
american elections are bought you can
predict the outcome of an election
for congress or president
with remarkable precision by just
looking at
the campaign funding thomas ferguson
the known political scientist has
studied this
over a century and it's remarkably
predictable
you have to laugh when people talk about
russian influence in the election which
is
undetectable and what is not only
detectable but overwhelming
is simply the funding of elections
by the corporate sector and private will
there's an overwhelming effect
you know over the last uh 45 years since
since the new democrats and new labor
and and really the consolidation of
media
um it's been very hard for progressives
to build a boom bin of course it's all
broken apart with
the internet and um income inequality
soaring and you know all the movements
that have grown in the last uh
decade or so so have you been surprised
by how long uh the new dems the new
labor
have been able to stay around uh you
know the bill clintons of the world
maintaining their power well after their
presidency and
and control of the white house and the
party
they've pretty much controlled the same
basic group
has largely controlled the government
since
the country was found that's taking
different forms of different times
now when there is a an enormous
popular upsurge of the kind that took
place say in the 1930s
when the labor movement revitalized
massive strikes sit-down strikes and
popular parties storming demanding
change
and a sympathetic administration
it yielded to their pressures and he got
the new deal
and the united states moved to a
mild level of social democracy
to recognize how remote the united
states is
from the major uh
developed societies so take the sanders
program
uh which is called in the press radical
left
this is a radical lift program two main
planks one is universal health care
can you think of another society that
has
universal health care you think of one
that doesn't have it
but that's radical left in the united
states
really scary the other major plank
there are only two is free college
tuition
everywhere but the call for what's
everywhere in the united states is
radical left we have articles in the
new york times in the washington post
saying
maybe it's a good idea but americans
just aren't ready for these
radical left proposals that you have in
every other country in the world
i mean that's a sign of business power
enormous business power now is the
public opposed to
universal health care of course not
right
take a look in fact what happens when it
comes up on the
ballot is very interesting i lived most
of my life in massachusetts
the most liberal state uh
the universal health care regularly came
up on the state val on the state
for a referendum in the state all showed
support then you start getting the
flood of ads they're gonna take your
doctor away from you
you're gonna have such huge taxes you
won't be able to
buy food you know poor and you know
nice couples like harry and louise
talking about how
terrible our lives are be when we won't
be able to see a doctor and the state
will be controlling us
and so on watch the polls the numbers
decline
and finally it gets to a vote it's voted
down
that's business power
and you're not going to confront it
inside the government
only way you can confront it is by
making people's power
greater worked pretty well in england
2017 corbin swept the elections biggest
vote that labor had ever gotten two
years later they'd killed
with a massive campaign
claiming uh anti-semitism you know
somebody said a critical word about
israel their
nazis and so on and it was all over the
media
all the way to the to the guardian you
know the
critical meeting and they he's not a
fighter he just
stood there and took the battering and
there was no answer that was it uh
you're
seeing another version of it now
and until there is a energized
active engaged popular movement
it's going to be hard to combat thatcher
and reagan
or their advisors knew exactly what they
were doing
when they came into office first thing
they did when they came into office
both of them was crush the labor
movement
that's critical as long as you don't
have an engaged labor movement
there isn't going to be a solid
continuing base
for progressive programs so it's
very important to kill the labor
movement now this was
done thatcher did it by smashing the
coal mine stripes
reagan did it right away by bringing in
scabs which is illegal in every country
in the world
except south africa at the time bringing
in scabs to break up strikes
as soon as the government did it the
corporations got the idea they started
doing
uh pretty soon you had what you have now
practically no labor move
then of course you have the courts which
are business run of course
which institute what are called right to
work
laws right to work means right to steal
it means that a worker in a union
can say i want union protection but i'm
not going to pay dues
that's right to work takes real
good propaganda to put
you're in arizona which is a
right-to-work state uh right now
and and if you look at the map
uh back to the reagan era and before
um so much of this was was empowered by
the koch brothers
uh which you know too well and and and i
think what's so interesting about
their strategy is clearly the republican
party demographics were
were shifting away from them um they had
to start appealing to new voters or
or taking control of
of the power um so whether it's you know
uh through actual challenging of
incumbents
or uh controlling the media astroturf
and lobbying
um redistricting of course later on
it seems like the democrats the new
democrats the establishment democrats
are are operating with the same tactics
right now against progressives
uh because the demographics are not in
their favor clearly
i mean the ideas of senator sanders the
ideas of
of aoc and the squad and and so many
other uh progressives that are now
rising into power
are really reflective of a generation of
you know millennials
and below and of course you know uh
working people who who haven't been
coming to the polls at at the rate
needing to win so
knowing that they're all there's all
this power around us you have
monopolized media
uh you know barely any investigative
reporters left barely any state house
reporters left
um you know the parties that are
extremely concentrated
towards corporate power how can
the progressive left so many of who are
new to this movement because they're
younger
really fight off and not fall for the
same um
tactics that they they can fight back
against um
moving forward i mean what what tips
would you have for
for younger people who are now part of
this movement
keep at it they've already had successes
now the
uh you know the the program of the biden
the biden program was compelled
by popular activism to move
farther towards what's called the left
mild social democracy than any previous
program
since roosevelt and it was done by
constant
activism so for example on
the most important issue of all
the doing something about environmental
catastrophe
party didn't go far enough but i way
beyond the clinton
uh way beyond the dnc didn't like it but
we're forced to accept it the
program calls for two trillion dollars
of investment in
something like a green new deal it
supports a green new deal which is
essential for survival and it uh
it even called for advancing the date
for uh net emission neutrality
okay now the next thing will be to see
if they'll do it
it's one thing to put it on paper it's
another thing to implement
they're not going to do it on their own
they'll only do it if the same forces
that made them write it on paper
will keep their feet to the fire and
make them implemented
and that's what young people can do keep
banking at the doors how did a green new
deal ever make it to the legislative
agenda
okay sunrise movement right
group of young people who were not only
agitating
but went to the point of taking over
congressional offices
nancy pelosi's office they got support
from
aoc other young
young legislators who came in on the
sanders wave
there was a progressive democratic
senior senator
at it he joined in and they managed to
put it on the legislative agenda
now the democratic party nominees
have been compelled to accept it the nca
doesn't want it
we'll see what happens but that's the
answer
it's i mean real politics is not
pushing a lever once every four years
right
that's what they try to tell you the
standard view of politics is
your take the leading intellectual
public intellectual of the 20th century
walter lippman liberal wood
wilson roosevelt kennedy liberal one of
the
major writers on political philosophy
his position was supported by many
others is
the population are spectators not
participants
they're supposed to show up every couple
of years
push a button go home let other people
run things with them
that's the line it's also the corporate
line
corporations are concerned not just the
dnc
corporations are concerned with what
they call reputational risks
they're starting to hate us they're
going to get they're in trouble
actually domination is very
thin it's only by consent
people withdraw consent the whole thing
collapses
and they know it so you take a look at
the davos meeting last january it's very
interesting
every january as you know the rich and
powerful
gather at uh a ski resort fantasy ski
resort in switzerland
davis congratulate each other on how
marvelous they are
ceos at hollywood stars media
figures and so on go skiing this year
was different
the theme this year was they're coming
after us
we're facing reputational risk
we've got to do something so the line
that they
projected was uh we've been doing
wrong things we know it the last 40
years we
haven't been working for you the way we
should be
but now we're reformed we realize we've
made mistakes we apologize
now we're dedicated humanists
you can put your faith your faith in our
hands we'll take care of you
we hear this periodically in the 1950s
it was
we're going to be soulful corporations
we're going to be soulful corporation
now we had 60 years of that now we're
going to be
deeply humanitarian corporations so just
go home put your faith in us and push
the lever
go home be spectators not participants
and we'll make sure that everything
works properly for you
because we're so dedicated to your
welfare well people can
either accept that or not you don't
accept it keep hammering away
you make progress that's how every
positive change has ever taken place
the power doesn't give you gifts right
they grant you something that they're
forced to
when it's taken when they can't have an
alternative
uh jp morgan chase biggest bank in the
united states
a leaked memo pure secret internal memo
a couple months ago it was warning that
they have to stop their
funding of fossil fuels because
it's causing reputational risks
people are going to withdraw okay
that's the answer yeah until you manage
to dismantle the system
it's in it's a system that shouldn't
exist
but we're not gonna dismantle it by
snapping a fist
it's gonna take a lot of work meanwhile
you can force it
to accommodate your needs just as
social democracy developed in europe
just as the new deal
developed here not just as
civil rights developed and women's
rights
the environmental movement
anti-war movement anything you can think
of
so professor chomsky before before we uh
wrap up
uh you you were part of this letter uh
that was addressing free speech and it
was i think interpreted in
uh the public as a letter fighting back
against what
is now called cancel culture um
and i'm curious because i know you've
had asked this answer this question a
lot but
uh cancel cultures or
or the attack against folks uh for you
know
transgressions past transgressions
apologize transgressions or nothing at
all
just plain old smears um
it seems to be have become a weapon of
of of the powerful
i guess it's always been but um we're
seeing it especially in this election uh
you know
alex moore's campaign in in um
in massachusetts uh right now against uh
neil representative neil
and we see it with shahid bhutah against
nancy pelosi there
and there are many many other races
where um they're using
a cancel culture quote to to break apart
uh you know campaigns the momentum that
they're gaining
is this new but what's happened is
that segments of the left have
taken up the standard procedures of the
mainstream establishment
which are never discussed because
they're just what you do to the left you
repress it
but segments of the left have picked it
up it's wrong in principle
it's tactically ridiculous it's a gift
to the right wing
if somebody comes to campus who you
don't like
say charles murray and you break up his
meaning
that's a gift to him and to the right
wing
they love it they can then portray
themselves as the good guys who are
standing up for freedom of speech
against these
radical thugs who want to destroy
everything so if you want to
if you want to commit suicide it's a
perfect tactic
what you should do if somebody comes to
campus who you don't like
is organize a meeting in which you
discuss
you bring people together expose who it
is
what the background is what we should do
about it
that drives them off campus in
embarrassment
because it's kind of like reputational
risk
that's the way you do it and it's an
educational achievement
now it's a lot easier to go into a
meeting screen
than to take a constructive educational
approach
like a radical activist would but
just because it's easy doesn't mean it's
right
it's kind of like saying uh i'm against
the establishment so i'll break a window
on main street
that's which happens no yeah so the
weather underground we're seeing
something now
a gift to the right thing that's
basically what the letter was about
actually it was kind of amazing that
there was any reaction at all to the
letter
because if you read it it's so mild yeah
there's almost nothing it should have
just been a
slow tap on the wrist nobody should have
noticed
the reaction shows that there really is
a problem
that's that's that's exactly it it
really pushed
people uh from all sides uh whatever
you know the far right the centrists um
even the left and it was
yeah i think that's exactly it it shows
that there's a real problem uh dr
chomsky
i wish we could sit down and talk for
hours uh
hopefully we'll be able to do so in
tucson in the future you i
am i'm an alma mater of of
university of arizona so i wish i was
able to to be taught by you but um
professor chomsky uh it's been an honor
having you on
thank you for your commitment for
teaching us and uh
we we we hope to have you on again soon
thank you
good to talk to you thanks take care
sorry we have to leave
me too take care
all right guys up next we have a great
panel with bhaskar sankara and nabila
islam
to just discuss some of the ideas that
professor chomsky mentioned
so stay tuned we'll be right back
[Music]
uh
[Music]
so
[Music]
welcome back to the nomikey show slash
the majority report uh we're in
partnership today
covering the dnc the wrap-up from the
week where the movement goes from here
uh whether
uh joe biden is our president or uh
donald trump
remains and fascism basically takes over
uh
we have a great panel we have bhaskar
sankara and nabila islam
are they coming in are they ready to go
all right technology
it's working today hello hello
hey how are you is here great basketball
thanks for joining us bhaskar sankara is
of course the
founder of jacobin editor-in-chief
you know i caught the end of the chomsky
interview on the youtube and i saw the
greatest
interlude music and video ever
i mean i don't know if that was matt's
work or your work or
who is responsible for that but that
that deserves some sort of daytime emmy
or something
thank you i um i found i mean i knew
about it i'm a convention junkie and
it's kind of been making the uh
the rounds but um baskar let's just
start off with the big question here
where where do we go what's our what are
our next steps as a movement
um from now until election day and then
and then if hopefully i can't believe
i'm even saying that joe biden is
elected president
well i think to begin with it's worth
saying that
you know we're in an incredibly
constrained situation on the left by
virtue
of things beyond our control the us
political system
the fact that even though we seem to
have at the very least
30 35 maybe more of the population
behind us as a coalition
um and many more when it turns it comes
to policy preferences
medicare for all a jobs program and so
on
we don't really have that much political
power
so we need to be thinking in slower
terms about how we build that long-term
opposition and that means in the short
term
we won't really be writing policies
but we'll be changing the conditions in
which policy
is written and the delicate balancing
act is
how do we form this radical opposition
without alienating many working class
people who
rightly see biden as a lesser evil
for than over trump and
i myself do not advocate the socialist
canvas or go out and expand our finite
institutional resources for biden
i think we'd be much better off
campaigning for things like medicare for
all
uh pressuring and primary bad incumbent
uh democrats and replacing them with
people who
might actually be worth galvanizing and
turning people out to
to vote on the ballot box i think that
this strategy does not help trump
but it does help build our independent
distinct
political profile fighting for things in
the interests of of working-class
people um and
besides for that i mean we need to just
think about where we were five years ago
and the fact that
we're not where we want to be but we've
made tremendous progress
and if we really think in strategic
terms
if we think about exploiting the
electoral opportunities and the social
movement opportunities we have
you know we're going to be in a much
better place in 2025 and at that point
we might actually be
able to take over the democratic party
or
at the very least to to push it from the
outside and realign it into something
that actually does represent the
interest of working people and isn't
just
the lesser of two evils um
well said uh nabila islam she she just
joined us
she recently ran for congress in georgia
in a red district
was i believe the closest district in
last election
uh in which a democratic democrat won
you came so close to making the runoff
uh but she got right to work and she
started an organization called
progressive list you're the national
organizing director for
matriarch which is uh an organization
supports working-class women running for
congress
so nabila um i mean you you you are very
strategic about this in terms of
of what boscar just said
operationalizing
uh this movement and and really hitting
on i'd say key power uh pressure points
whether it's um challenging incumbents
uh
or or you know really running
progressives
in even conservative districts that we
thought were unthinkable because that's
what the democrats told us
uh so nabila i mean what do you think is
next for
for us what should we what's the first
policy item you think we should be
focusing on
uh if joe biden takes the presidency
assumes the presidency
well i think we should be focused on a
couple of things uh
mainly we need to be operationalizing
the left
uh right now the the main talking point
i hear from moderates is you know the
moderates one back
of the house and that's because you know
we don't we don't we didn't have
institutions on our side to help uplift
progressive candidates and which is why
um i'm now the founder
of an organization that's going to help
progressives from the beginning
in the when they really need the push
and the money and the resources
and i really feel like right now uh
it's look i i know that for progressives
biden was an ideal
and i i think i caught the tail end of
what you were saying
um in terms of uh you know if we elect
him
we're gonna have time to organize um
he's not going to seek
a second term so we'll have uh the
ability to
put a strong candidate a progressive
candidate uh in 2024 to run for office
probably prior to that to actually run
um
but i mean i think look we should be
able to push him on medicare for all i
know he said he wouldn't you know
he would wouldn't sign a a bill if it
came to his desk but
i think in light of everything that's
happened uh we should be able to
keep pushing him okay so i
there's this thing happening right now
with the democrats though and i asked
this question to
dr dr chomsky earlier is that you know
there is a concentration of power
happening they're all
uh what used to be the the if you can
even believe the obama wing and the
the clinton wing they used to spar you
know they've united they united under
clinton
um the dnc has effectively pushed out
any progressives or dissent
out of the party out of any of the
decision making in the party
um the media coalesced behind uh biden
right after south carolina they're
flexing their muscles right
and even further they're they're
actually up you know we saw with
with alex moore's situation um they're
smear
campaigns the ones that we see you know
that was leaked i'm sure
i have no doubt actually that this is
happening all across the board with a
lot of progressive candidates where
um they'll find folks to like join dsa
and like
uh you know put out um create some sort
of dissent or
or questions about a progressive
candidate based on purity or
cancel culture or nothing um so
basketball i mean you i'm both of you
actually but bhaskar in particular like
you you
you've studied these social movements uh
for decades across the world
this is not a new thing um but this is
in our
it's a younger movement in this country
a lot of zoomers a lot of millennials
who
really are learning as we go what can we
learn in terms of fighting back
and staying focused what we learned from
previous movements in which this has
derailed
um as chomsky said you know
the uk labor movement is a perfect
example well i think
the first principle is to assume good
faith um
assume that if somebody's in the room
saying that they're fighting for things
that they actually believe it
and obviously if someone behaves
improperly if they take the wrong
position
if they're uh personally you know
hostile or
or or doing bad acts or whatnot
obviously you try to correct that
behavior but i think assuming good faith
is the foundation block for solidarity
or for any sort of
uh movement it's how we prevent agent
provocateurs or or people who are just
plain you know idiots and and not even
uh you know
if anything you could probably be more
forgiving of agent provocateurs because
they actually have a mission that
they're trying
the same way when nancy pelosi is
opposing uh
candidates that we support or she's on
the war path against us or
certain parts of the establishing media
against us well that makes sense in
ideological terms right
it wouldn't really make sense if they
were just laying down and letting us
uh primary them or they were just laying
down and letting us
reshape a political discourse that's
fundamentally not in their class
interests and not in their own
personal uh political interest so i
think a lot of these fights
that that seem unfair that seem dirty
are perfectly fair in
in the grand scheme of politics and we
need to just
be aware though of separating
uh the base of the democratic party from
a lot of the leaders
that they'll vote for you know my
parents like like many
uh brown people america are loyal
democratic party voters they also love
bernie
so they love the clintons and they love
bernie and that's something that doesn't
exist on twitter but it does exist in
the real world
and they love bernie because he's an
honest guy
they think he says what he thinks they
like his demeanor
they like medicare for all and they also
particularly have no great animus for
nancy pelosi and they think that
you know she's a woman fighting donald
trump and that's that's the little sound
bites of media
like i don't even think they read the
newspaper just like sound bites they
pick up on cnn or msnbc
and whatnot and we need to in other
words
make our distinct policy profile explain
how we're different than establishment
democrats
but do it to win over a lot of the
people particularly
the the multiracial working-class base
that is still voting for a lot of
democrats now the ones that aren't
staying at home but are actually voting
we need to win over those people too
and that means a level of tone that's
able to
to convince and persuade even while
we're uncompromising to those
establishment leaders and the pundits
uh behind them it's kind of this
delicate balancing act but it's really
important for
for doing mass politics and not
sectarian politics and
and that's the evolution of our movement
in the next few years we need to keep
going
from the margin into the mainstream
without diluting our program we need to
mainstream our program
avila um i have
so i had an idea i'm sure many people
thought about this too
but um as far as you know there's a lot
of politics in politics and so
the establishment you know plays every
trick that they can
um but i'm pretty sure tom perez is
probably not gonna run for another four
years at the dnc
why not have a progressive candidate run
to be chairman
or chairwoman of the dnc and you know
take a piece of that electoral power
away from them
and so that we have a voice at the table
look keith ellison almost won
his first round in the second round he
had some people make some phone calls uh
and
he he unfortunately did not make it but
i think that we can grow our electoral
power in the next four years
um through through congress uh by you
know attacking seats that
where you have uh um incumbents that
with no
low name recognition our candidates are
interesting
they're transformational they don't need
the most money they just need enough
money and we just we just saw what
happened this cycle like
the people are excited about progressive
candidates and if we can get them the
resources to be competitive
i don't see why we don't have a bigger
sweep come next uh next cycle
uh midterm so i'm excited in in terms of
our growing power that's interesting you
say about the dnc because
the first election for dnc chair
happened uh
under you know after after 2016. so
maybe that's something that we demand
that that's the norm now um
okay so just just wrap around right now
before we wrap up i wish this panel
could go on for another half hour
so many questions um i guess the
the the questions are leverage i i
really think that the progressive left
um you know there's there's a lot of
power there's a lot of energy
but where is our leverage now boscar
well i think that i know this is a very
predictable
answer from from a socialist and
especially if people know my
my work but i i think that our our
leverage is still
largely in our workplaces and that's
such an important element that we
shouldn't underestimate
even organized labor which of course is
only
eight nine percent of the the population
is still the largest single progressive
block in the country and it has the most
strategic
weight you know ten thousand long-share
workers on the west coast
can shut down the nation's economy
behind demands
we've seen when it comes to even retail
workers just 1.3 million retail workers
were able to bring about restrictions
from places like target to even
non-union shops like walmart
uh mass you know restrictions and other
things that have saved
lives of not only retail workers but by
customers
as well and i think getting organized
labor behind
more insurgent candidates getting those
those
those activists um really involved with
struggles of medicare for all i think
the postal workers union is a great
example
uh apwu of a union that backed bernie
backed medicare for all
backed out agenda but is also able to
really galvanize his members behind both
shop floor interests but these broader
social causes as well
you know i think that's a really
important spot for us to
break off organized labor from
establishment democrats and to say that
listen even if you're not 100 behind our
program the only way you get anything
is if you have a credible exit option
and in the us political system it's
probably not going to be a third party
so what it is though is this new round
of anti-establishment
primary challenges so at the very least
even if they're staying neutral in a
race uh they'll be able to exert more
more power and leverage and get behind
this unified
agenda that i think sixty percent of the
country we can imagine even in places
like the southwest
and and others that don't really have
deep footholds for progressive politics
can get behind fair trade medicare for
all
jobs and and good funding for for
education and child care i mean these
are things that that
can be the the bread and butter of a
program that wins over a majority in
this country and we need to be really
ambitious
even though it's going to take five ten
years to probably get there
great uh nebila leverage
leverage so i think um all politics is
local
uh what i've seen in georgia especially
is that the progressive movement is very
it's growing at the local level um our
voices are being heard more and more
and i feel that uh you know our elected
officials are listening and so
not only that um we're seeing more
candidates at the local level you know
putting themselves
um you know at the table to run for
office so i think it's very important
that
uh we continue to have our voices heard
on the campaign trail
uh making sure that we're you know
constantly
you know being on you know on the in in
the media talking about
what's important to us what what the
policies that we need to
actually uplift our communities and so
um i think it's so important that
we continue to run for office not just
at the federal level but the state and
the local level and
grow you know continue to grow our
voices from there
great thank you guys so much bhaskar

next week
hi sam cedar here of the uh majority
report with sam cedar
uh next up we have a guest we're gonna
play
a clip of the trailer for his new album
um
i uh had booked this because i thought
that the album was going to be something
different than it was we've had this
guest on before
um he's um people know him as a
voice actor and uh
probably his most prominent position is
he the uh voice of the majority report
his name is uh john benjamin or h john
benjamin he likes to um
because i guess i don't know it makes
you seem more important if you have an
initial in front of your name
but let's um take a quick break and then
we come back we'll play a clip of
his promo for his album
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
um
ah
[Music]
and that is the um promotional
video from the album john benjamin
jazz daredevil the soundtrack collection
um are you are you mad
no i'm not mad i'm just in the middle of
of
doing your uh intro on the phone
is john benjamin apparently the jazz
daredevil
i mean it's just not like you the intro
was like
uh like like filled with
stain well i don't it's not a question
of disdain i i just
found like you just saw something you
didn't like and then you had to
do an intro about it after that's what
it sounded like
well all right i mean i'm not going to
argue with you about that
uh john welcome to the show i guess
thanks for having me
thanks for that wonderful intro i i
really appreciate it i usually do better
when the guest actually lets me speak
when i'm in the middle of the intro
and that is the um promotional
video from the album john benjamin
jazz daredevil
i i just found like you just saw
something you didn't like and then you
had to
do an intro about it after that's what
it sounded like
well all right i mean i'm not going to
argue with you about that
uh john welcome to the show i guess
thanks for having me
thanks for that wonderful intro i i
really appreciate it i usually do better
when the guest actually lets me speak
when i'm in the middle of the intro but
that's okay well maybe
it would be nice to let guests speak
during their intro so that they could
comment on how you're introducing
well people can do that after i intro
they can do it on twitter or other
mechanisms i guess most people would
just move on but i guess i didn't so i
don't know that was just a
decision i made in the moment okay
well that's fine i respect that but that
decision was based on the way
you were sounding after you watched
something that i did
i you know maybe there were other things
going on in my life today
okay that are difficult do you want to
talk do you want to talk about those
no i don't so john um
you have been on the program before
talking about your first album
which was that was it was a long time
ago but that was in 2015.
was that in 2015 yeah wow has this thing
really been
five years in the making geez yeah so
the last time that
i made an album you were in your 40s
um that's probably that's probably
accurate
um i think you probably were too john
did you not want me to talk about your
age
because it's some
other like uh my point is is that this
is your
second musical album your first
album was something to the effect of
jazz daredevil
i should have well it was actually
well well i should have well i should
have
okay yes then an ellipsis uh
and then an asterisk and then the
asterisks
referred to the lower part of the album
which said learned how to play piano
right and right technically technically
the whole title was
well i should have learned how to play
piano and that was for your 2015
album where you actually paid
professional jazz musicians
to sit in a room and essentially uh have
to
endure you're playing the piano without
any ability
to play the piano i mean is that well an
accurate description
that's one way to frame it i'm not sure
they were playing the jazz music they
always play
and i was playing with them that would
be another way to put it
and just to round that out you didn't
know how to play the piano but they were
professional musicians
that's correct it was my debut jazz
album and i didn't know how to play
jazz at that time uh or didn't know how
to play the instrument the piano at that
time
uh but i did play along with them i
think one of the things that you just
said really actually
you know it struck with me as i as i
prepared for this
um interview and that was
you know i guess i i thought it was
three years ago but maybe it was five
years ago
uh when you did your album it was 2015
so i don't know why you're
well whatever three or five years ago it
doesn't really matter
because i thought oh this will be
interesting
i'll check in on john benjamin jazz
daredevil
he's done a soundtrack collection and
um his first album was about how he
didn't
well i should have learned to play the
piano or whatever it was
let me play a clip from your your your
next album
this is uh the theme from chariots of
fire which is a
beautiful composition whenever i hear it
almost ever whenever i hear it i can
still
imagine i tear up a little bit because i
still like
recall those um british
runners running through the beach on
some type of british uh
coastline and it is incredibly moving
and then here is your rendition
[Music]
bye
[Music]
okay all right i think i mean i think
we've heard enough you never
you never well i mean no you could uh
yeah i mean you get the idea from that
oh yeah we get the idea
the i'll tell you what the idea is
version of chariots of fire the way i
can play it all right yes the idea is
that despite the fact that you've had
five years to prepare for your second
album
when in your first album you were so
aware that you should have learned to
play the piano that you called your
album that
five years later you don't seem to have
done
anything to learn to play the piano in
fact i listen to that
and instead of like the beautiful image
of these
these the the human form running so
desperately with so much joy
in it across that beach i see them
stumbling
i see them like falling and hurting you
like really into
you're like really into sports or no it
was a beautiful movie it was incredibly
inspiring
it's one of the movies that i think
about whenever i'm low or down
and i listen to this thing and in many
ways it ruins it for me
well i mean my intention was not to ruin
the movie i've like the movie holds up
i guess i'm not i wasn't a big fan of
trying to fire the movie but i
i did like soundtrack um that's why i
picked the song
and i i tried to play it the best way i
could and there are
a lot of differences between the first
album and this album
and i get you point out one thing that
just happens to be the same which is
that i did not learn how to play
but i i do play now on uh electronic
piano and not on acoustic so that is a
big difference
i made that decision going into it i
picked the music based on that
and um so that's a huge difference
and also i did i'm doing all covers of
soundtracks which is also different than
uh doing original compositions which you
know like so
there's there are differences
right uh there are differences uh that
is true
i also notice uh here on the um
but i guess if you're helping on the one
your album cover uh
is you're no longer wearing a daredevil
outfit you're wearing an astronaut
outfit i'm not quite sure i understand
that
well um i think it's some it has
something to do
with the you know the the
the the sci-fi or electronic element
that i
that i started to fire took place in the
early 1900s there was no
um we were decades away from any type of
space exploration program i don't even
know that people i mean surely people
could have imagined at that time but
i don't understand yeah but the
soundtrack was not made
in the when the movie was when the movie
took place
that's not how soundtracks work they're
not like
when like if you do a period movie like
um
room with a view right music was made
contemporary to the making of the movie
they don't pull
uh they didn't have the soundtrack ready
to go from
the period in which the movie took place
well i mean they didn't have
soundtracks probably i mean well maybe
they did probably in the uh
at the contemporaneous time in which the
movie uh the film takes place but
nevertheless
i mean it's like automatically it
doesn't make any sense
what's so dare devilish about going to
uh in the space program it is
um it's almost diametrically opposed to
that if it was it would be horribly
irresponsible to send people into space
if it was a
daredevil mission well i think every
probably space mission is a daredevil
mission in a sense
i don't think it has anything to do with
my music but i think you keep
i think people think well i'm just
making the point because i've got this
uh you know this this
i guess i'm just still a little bit
upset about
the emotional being mad it's like being
mad at madonna for wearing a
bustier i guess or something
no yes because it's like oh that was
from a different time
that was from like the old west why is
she wearing that
then why would it have this music like a
virgin has nothing to do with the old
west
well certainly i mean one could say it
has to do with the bustier
i mean look but that's not the point
john the point is is that
why did you do a soundtrack collection
let's just talk about that let's just
zero in on that
on that and that aspect of it you did a
soundtrack why a soundtrack
tell me why soundtracks well like i said
i
my jazz uh interest moved a little bit
toward electronic sound and the use of
the moog synthesizer
uh that's the the the
synthesized piano that i worked with and
a lot of soundtracks from when i was you
know like probably
in my uh it was in the 80s like movies
that i appreciated a lot of the movies
were in the
80s on the album i wanted to do covers
so
that's that's how it came about and and
that is the thing i guess
that i i find interesting about
soundtracks because it's so evocative
of films that may be very important to
you that may have hit
a chord uh for you uh or one
uh at a particular time in their life
maybe they watched it uh with someone
you know like chariots of fire i really
have very
very strong visceral associations with
that movie
like that up until now have been
incredibly positive uh and now
it's it's almost it's it's almost like
you're desecrating the film
in a way did you like have an experience
with chariots of fire that i don't know
about like that that it's this important
to you
i mean i mean i didn't i don't mean i
didn't mean to like
ruin a movie for you but i you know the
it's
uh like anything there's another like
really important movie in your life love
story
i mean i think for a lot of people um
our age
john uh love story was
um a uh a lovely story was made in like
1975 or seven
right yeah so you would have been what
like uh
less than 10 years old and you that was
a movie that was important to you
yeah it was one i think that that that
um
was foundational in my
uh sense of what love meant yes
i think the uh the sacrifice and the
mutual respect
uh between um uh the the two leads
um was uh was in many ways
like i say foundational for me and
became a a model
uh for really in many ways
what i imagined my um
my so you based all your relationships
on his love story well look
look at this it was a tragedy
but yeah um as you know
um i even at a very young age
was contemplating going to law school in
boston
this is a story about a harvard uh
law student i did not get into harvard
uh but that's okay
um i certainly based on the way you're
arguing i'm not
not surprised about that well that's the
case and
it was uh uh to see um oliver barrett
who was played by ryan o'neill um
just looked it up so that's that's good
i i didn't
uh just look it up john it's it's like i
say it it's a very
uh your head well i just i like i say i
i remember the movie it was important to
me alan mcgraw
of course i had a massive crush on uh
and
um let's let's just did you have the
like did you have the same kind of crush
you had on all those runners
and in charge of fire or is it a
different kind of crush it was a
different kind of crush
oh okay yeah yeah i've no nothing wrong
with
any kind of crush i was just asking well
it was different
okay here is uh your rendition
and i should tell people there's a well
here here's your rendition of
love story the theme from love story
[Music]
[Applause]
that's not now
i mean i guess the uh uh yeah i guess
the good news is
we're not gonna get uh a copyright
strike because that is
indiscernible well that's how i made the
album
i mean i would have never been able to
make the album if i could play
it would have been too expensive
because he would have had to license uh
the the rights and
to actually play the music yeah but that
doesn't as opposed to
licensing the rights to butcher the
music
that doesn't take away from the artistry
of what i did i don't think
um it uh it certainly doesn't
i i don't know how you could take
artistry away i mean like you know what
what
you know what what could you possibly
take away from the null set
as it were i'm not sure what
you're referring to well my suggestion
is is that
uh it doesn't take away from the
artistry because
i think frankly i i think it's a very
hard
you'd be very hard-pressed to suggest
that there's artistry there
i think i don't know whether you're the
like uh
you know the gatekeeper for art i didn't
know that
well i mean i think this is you don't
have to really be much of a gatekeeper
uh
to you know make an assessment like when
you take
songs that are so involved
and really in many ways sever
the relationship between um
the listener and all of the emotional
investment they had
in a song in a film in this case because
they're uh soundtracks
i mean i i've been i've been in your
apartment and i've seen your art and
most of it's like motivational posters
and stuff like that
well i mean that's what i choose to to
motivate myself one of the other ways
like two cats and one one's like wearing
a hat
and it says like you go girl like stuff
like that
let me let me tell you something else
that used to uh motivate me john
it was axel f it was the um
it's not as easy as it looks nobody
excuse me one second here we go
it was um it was axl f
you so your favorite movies of all times
were
character fire love story
beverly hills cop was a lot of fun and i
would watch that movie
and and sometimes like it was just
whenever i felt
i mean honestly can i just say something
that that
i think is the like iconic
version now like based on i and that's
this is my opinion it is it's the
version i did
i don't like to i'm not like just
bragging it's this is not just
braggadocio
i think it was like actually better than
the original version
well i mean i i don't you know i'm
looking at it it's on youtube
people can go to um they can search john
benjamin
jazz daredevil um
the soundtrack collection it is
uh via subtopic it's very very hard to
find
frankly uh well i mean it's not getting
uh the
attention that i think think that i that
i thought it would have but i
you know i music is very subjective
people can search for it john benjamin
jazz daredevil the soundtrack collection
and your what you call is now
the iconic version of the
of axle f the theme to the beverly hills
cop has received
just over a thousand views and
two comments one is holy cringeworthy
batman
okay all right that's all right that's
fine i get
i get that people might not get it well
how could it be a while i mean i like
iconic version
and people don't get it van gaach
wasn't famous till uh till after he died
posthumously his work was not
respected van gogh
i think you find it van gogh oh
well like i i pronounce it the way it's
supposed to be pronounced but
you you go you go girl
uh john um now apparently subpop
records put this out dude
they did they did put it out it's out
it's
it's out it's available and it's
actually an album that people could buy
yes on orange vinyl it's a collectible
this is on
orange vinyl and there is
the my my version uh with the sheet
music
included of charge to fire so you could
play my version of charts fire at home
if you can play piano you can play it
the way i did it and
uh there's also a free patch
that's on the album if you're interested
in patches
there's a free patch like yeah like a
patch
like you'd stitch on patch that you
could put on your
on your uh you can't put it on your car
because it's stitch on
so you could put it on like your clothes
or you you could stitch it on something
where
that you could put a needle into let's
talk about your
um your promo video you um
people can see that we will link to that
as well on the majority.fm
yeah not a lot of people watch that one
either no
um it is i have to say like i said it's
ahead of its time a little bit maybe so
it's not doing as well as i thought it
would
you know it uh depicts you um
i'm not going to ruin it uh but it
depicts you
going into a musical um practice
session where where exactly was that i
was in budapest
budapest yeah in hungary
uh we flew to budapest where we recorded
uh with the real orchestra i think 75
piece orchestra where i entered
without them knowing the the way i
played
and they uh played along with me so that
was a live
session that we recorded um
i wonder if any of those musicians
have recovered from that situation but
john when was that
when did you shoot that little video
that was pretty pandemic so it was in
uh i believe in january or december
of pre-pandemic when in fact
actually covet 19 was
within europe at that time and
the way that it got to new york was
people
traveled from europe to new york
which i believe is where you live and
one of the key vectors
for covet 19 has been music
halls that are closed in
where people are exerting um efforts
in a almost like a sound proof
room john well that's true
uh there was not great ventilation in
hungary
in the studio there were a lot of people
in one room
uh has it occurred to you that you
videotaped
inadvertently perhaps the uh
the primary vector for the
uh for covet 19 to reach uh the united
states of america
i mean it's an interesting conspiracy
theory i don't i don't like
is it a conspiracy what's the conspiracy
i i can tell you this uh rudy giuliani
was there at the same time meeting
with uh what i believe to be the
ukrainian
uh mobsters uh to gin up
some other conspiracy theories within
the trump administration
he was there simultaneous with me i did
not see him i had nothing to do with
that
how did you know he was there
i had dinner with him
uh so john um what what
what inspired you to do this
well uh like i said i
wanted to uh for many years to do a
follow-up
uh and i wanted to explore uh
jazz in a new realm uh using electronic
uh music i
follow in the footsteps of the great
jazz
artists who've had all who have done so
miles davis in particular i think
am i comparing myself to him but he did
do what i did
uh you know he went i mean you you you
are
comparison uh comparing him to you and
um i mean thank you very much if that's
what you're
you're inferring i appreciate it uh
maybe contrasting is really what you
should be doing
i mean i i almost think that frankly
it's an insult
to contrast you with miles davis because
it
implies that you are similarly situated
enough to be contrasted when in fact
it would be like i don't know um
i mean if i if i have to if i if i can
be as honest as possible
i i did think that maybe if i use a
synthesizer uh
or a moog synthesizer it might sound a
little better than when i first played
on acoustic because acoustic really does
expose
all your mistakes and uh with the
synthesizer
i thought that it might uh do a little
better at disguising some of those
mistakes but i'm not sure
it did um have you heard
from any of the um
the people in the community uh people in
the jazz community i imagine have
already learned their lesson
but in terms of any of the people who
actually
wrote or composed any of these songs um
i imagine it was um
disturbing for them to see you actually
present this in some form of
professional way
uh i mean so far i
like i haven't heard any anything from
any of the
people who who wrote and performed the
originals
not yet but like i said it's only been
out there
a few weeks and maybe i don't know maybe
um
harold faltermeyer would would want to
email me
if he's listening to your show
well uh john so what's next for you
well uh i certainly will keep uh
you know plugging away at my jazz i and
you know like
albums you wouldn't know this but they
take a long time
uh and a lot of thought goes into them
um so i i wouldn't expect
another album within the next five or
ten years but
hopefully if things go well i will put i
will
put out a third album i can continue the
canon
i guess uh for the fans all
280 of them i am going to
mark this down uh 2025.
we can anticipate your next album that's
very
very exciting i'm sure yeah and like i
it's like i like to say i i yeah yes it
is true
that i can't play uh piano
but i do assert that i am
the best at not being able to play piano
well and i would also suggest that comes
that also includes
the uh electronic organ uh john benjamin
the jazz daredevil
soundtrack collection is out on subpop
we will put a link
to that and to your promo video
at majority.fm uh thank you for coming
on and
uh thank you appreciate it i'm sorry i
made you unhappy and
maybe you know it's just i i was
okay with bringing you on you know we
are um
certainly friendly
and i
to be honest with you i was looking
forward to it these are a lot of like i
said
movies that were very important to me
when i was younger
and uh in times like these sometimes
it's nice to sort of just
it's like comfort food and then it's
like going down and sitting
in front of your favorite comfort food
let's say macaroni and cheese and and
finding that the cheese has gone bad
that it's rancid and so yes
it it it threw me off a little bit but
i'm sorry if that came across in this
interview i apologize
um no i mean i i hope that you
you know go watch charts fire and have
some macaroni and cheese
now all right well thank you for coming
on
john benjamin
it might take all the strength i got
to get to where i want
but i know somehow
i'm gonna get
[Music]
won't make me feel any better
yeah i know the clock is
[Music]
breaks you
[Music]
do you know how far
takes you
yeah i know the clock is
