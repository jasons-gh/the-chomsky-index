they do permit and insist upon capital
mobility but they don't allow labour
mobility so you have free capital
mobility over the world countries are
not allowed to control their own capital
resources other end people can't move
that's golden immigration crisis this is
entirely contrary to the principles of
free trade if anybody bothered to read
Adam Smith for example he insists that
free circulation of labor free movement
of working people is a foundation free
trade otherwise you have something but
it's not free trade so these agreements
and in many respects this is not the
only one they're designed for investor
rights and not for the rights of people
does not matter and you can see the
effects one of the effects over time is
a concentration of wealth in management
ownership or submitted some of the
professional classes and so on but a
deterioration in the status of working
people almost everywhere China is one of
the examples well you can gain some real
insight if you want to really understand
the Cold War the natural place to look
is what happened in 1989 in 1989 Soviet
Union collapsed a cold war is over so
what happened well that's quite
interesting first thing that happened is
the bush it this is President Bush the
first was in office at the time his
administration immediately came out with
a new national security strategy and the
budget to reflect the fact that the
Soviet Union was collapsing them or cold
war well it turns the the elements of it
or ever revealing and never discussed
but very really maybe never discussed
because they're very revealing but you
can check the the basic principles were
that everything's going to remain the
same
but the pretexts will change so we must
maintain a huge military force and not
to protect ourselves against the
Russians anymore because they're not
there but because of what they called
the technological sophistication of
third world powers now nobody left
you're not supposed to laugh at serious
things so now we need a huge military
force to protect ourselves from the
technological sophistication of third
world powers when a massive intervention
forces directed at the Middle East and
not because the Russians are coming but
for a different reason because of those
of radical nationalism independent
nationalism and in fact the most
strategy said that the problems in the
Middle East the serious problems of us
faced in the Middle East I'm quoting
could not be laid at the Kremlin store
they were not going through the Russians
so apologies we've been lying to you for
50 years but now we have a new world
can't lie about that anymore so we have
to tell the truth the problems are
independent nationalism as they always
were in fact and so they remain we must
retain what was called the defense
industrial base that's a euphemism which
means high-tech industry contrary to
neoliberal free trade principles of the
US economy like other advanced economies
depends crucially on the state sector
dynamic state sector the IT revolution
computers the internet airplanes of
commercial airplanes go on and on much
of it depends on state sector and a lot
of it was developed under the pretext
that its defense so the Pentagon was
the basic the hard costly risky parts of
the high tech revolution meaning the
taxpayer was praying for it on the
pretext that its defense against the
Russians okay Russians are gone but we
must maintain the defense industrial
base meaning high-tech industry meaning
the state sector of the economy and so
it continues essentially what they post
for that planning said is well
everything's the same without the
Russians now we need new protects and
the pretexts were not long and coming
while NATO was interesting if you
believed cold war propaganda NATO should
have been disbanded NATO was there to
protect us from the Russians the
Russians so what happened may to expand
it it didn't disband and in an
interesting way Gorbachev Russian
Premier he made an amazing concession in
1990 he agreed to let a unified Germany
join NATO a hostile military alliance if
you think of the history of the 20th
century that's pretty remarkable the
Germany alone had almost destroyed
Russia twice in the center and here
Gorbachev was agreeing to let NATO be
reunified rearmed and joined hostile
military alliance well there was a quid
pro quo the United States promised that
NATO would not expand as they put it one
inch to the east meaning it would not
expand to East Germany and of course
there was no fault of its expanding
beyond now the Bush administration was
clever enough not to put that into
writing those were verbal promises very
clear and explicit verbal promises i
might say that the diplomatic history of
this period has been very well
researched we know just what happened so
they made a gentleman's agreement and
Gorbachev I
we took it took it literally he assumed
that you could take the word of you the
gentleman who you're dealing with and he
didn't pay attention to the fact that
they didn't bother to write it down on
paper so very quickly especially under
Clinton later began to expand to the
east of East Germany and then beyond the
Eastern Europe and the Russians of
course bitterly complained but the u.s.
objected them accurately that they'd
never written it down on paper so it's
just a gentlemen's agreement on you if
you're naive enough to take the word of
the gentleman you're making agreements
with well that's your problem but we're
within our rights to expand native so
NATO expanded to the east and it's
expanded far beyond now by now it
carries out military actions and areas
lower here Europe and I hear boos metal
being condemned by the United States
it's goodbye Europe because they're not
participating eagerly enough in u.s.
invasions elsewhere like in Afghanistan
furthermore it goes beyond the Secretary
General of NATO happen to be Dutch and
he informed NATO that it must expand
globally to cover pipelines and sea
lanes for for the Attic for the world
energy system so NATO must become a US
intervention force which controls the
world energy system no more defense
against the Russians that was a pretext
we can forget about and it's sort of
known from history I want to about
don't fit doctrines very well in the
newspapers this morning you will read
that there's a new proposal from the
United States to extend maybe even
beyond but now the reality the world is
being recognized more accurately the
clouds kind of lifted after the Soviet
Union disappeared and you can if you
want see more clearly what what drives
policy well without going into many
examples let me turn to the Middle East
they
within this context this global context
that the US relations with Israel which
are another element of exceptionalism
their unique in the world in which this
is a context in which they developed the
primary shift was in 1967 in 1967 Israel
performed gave a major a gift to the
United States and to its primary allies
Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia's of course
because that's where the oil is
effective one very good Middle East
scholars you'll be rushcard as a new
book in which he observes in passing
that the US relations with Saudi Arabia
will remain of primary significance as
long as one drop of oil remains in the
Saudi desert after that it's finished
and thats essentially captures the
relationship the as you know Egypt and
Saudi Arabia were effective at war at
that at that time in the end
