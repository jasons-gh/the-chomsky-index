starting down here hi could you talk
about the u.s. participation in the
recent coup against the Venezuelan
president including us participation in
the coup against the Venezuelan
including the active involvement of auto
rice and alert Abrams back from the
Reagan years and also about the removal
of the Brazilian ambassador to the
organization against the proliferation
of chemical weapons let's take one if we
can I couldn't hear out of it as far as
Venezuela is concerned I mean you know I
don't know any more than you do just
what was in the newspapers the everyone
was expected four years everybody's been
expecting a military coup in Venezuela
and kind of like the coup in Chile the
only question is when know that there
have been plans for it don't think we
can seriously doubt when the military
coup took place it was immediately
welcomed in Washington all the public
and in the editorials and everywhere
else you know a wonderful thing however
something very surprising happened there
was a upsurge there was a popular
upsurge and the the generals and the
president they deposed had to back off
meanwhile the Latin American countries
had condemned the coup I think Canada
went along with the United States will
not mistaken but the Latin American
countries went along opposed the coup on
grounds that it was unconstitutional and
attack on democracy they don't like
Chavez but they were in favor of
democracy however the northern
democracies and certainly the United
States and I think Canada thought that
the overthrow of democracy was just fine
and then when the when it was restored
they were kind of embarrassed and then
comes the cover-up you know in which you
read that the United States was secretly
telling the generals this is not nice
and you have to follow constitutional
procedures but so secretly you can't
find any record of it well you can make
of that what you like the US is
embarrassed by its open opposition to
democracy in comparison with
America and it has to cover up and
they'll be a cover-up but my suspicion
like everyone else is there will be
another coup unless Chavez's really
tamed you know unless he's willing to
follow us orders okay over here hi
professor Chomsky Oren Leonard to two
questions and I'm actually more
interesting the second if you choose to
answer only one first the first raise is
just the issue of I did take a look at
the maps I'm sympathetic to most of what
you say but I'm just curious I read a
long analysis by shlomo ben ami of the
talks and it seems that like by the
point they reached tava there was with
exchange of territories and something
something between ninety seven percent
to a hundred percent with compensation
on the table and bananas complained
there was that arafat refused to come
back with a counter proposal well
there's one problem with that yeah I
read the same things first of all
remember that taba is six months after
Camp David it was january two thousand
one it was informal discussions and what
happened to the tub we can talk about
what the tava agreements were and we
know a lot about them because there's a
report by the european observer
Martino's approved by both sides which
describes in detail what the report what
they were talking about so i can go into
that if you like but it's kind of
academic because they were called off
not by arafat but by Barack Barack
called them off okay so there were
informal meetings in Taba which did make
some progress beyond Camp David but if
you take a look the major issues were
still there are years really my mother
is ok but you know you re know this
business you know the country and that's
or anything okay well the main thing the
main issue was what happens to that big
salient east of Jerusalem that breaks
the West Bank into two and includes the
city of malad de meme which was
established by primarily the Labour
Party in clinton in order bisect the
west bank and they were still divided
over that one of several issues the end
the exchanges of territory were
meaningless who was pieces of the desert
however I agree with the point I mean
there could there
was progress in the informal meetings in
Tubba there were huge problems and they
might have maids gotten somewhere if
Barack hadn't called them off okay and
the wouldn't forgive me if I if I move
to another microphone there a number of
people and I'm not sure we'll even get
to the people who've taken the time to
line up all right hi consistent with the
u.s. foreign policy there seems to be a
two-faced policy in regards to China on
the one hand we're becoming closer and
closer to them as a trading partner and
on the other hand we're beginning to
demonize them as our next great
superpowers to build up our arms race
against I'd like to hear what you have
to say on that subject yeah policy thank
you right i mean policy towards china is
kind of ambivalent they're a major
investment a region for investment and
trade as china moves into the World
Trade Organization the West hopes that
it's going to subordinate itself to
Western investors kind of like Mexico
which would be a huge boon to us
agricultural exporters to you know
financial institutions which expect to
take over the Chinese direction of the
Chinese economy this is probably going
to wipe out about couple hundred million
Chinese peasants nobody knows what will
happen to them so there are those that's
the upside you know on the other hand
the downside is that they remain a
nationalist country which with their own
concerns and might pursue their own
objectives they're not going to invade
anybody but it's a it's a powerful force
that might be part of an independent
Asia China and Japan together especially
Japan and its surroundings but now also
China in principle could be the dominant
economic force in the world they
probably have the largest financial
reserves in the world right now and they
don't they're not a military force but
that can change so yeah that's concern
just like there's a concern over Europe
going its own way so it's mixed pretty
much like you said thank you
