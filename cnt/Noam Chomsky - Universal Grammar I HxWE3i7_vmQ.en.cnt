in advance of experience the child is
already equipped with an understanding
of the basic structure of any human
language so we know even in advance to
think work that there's going to be a
fundamental and very Oracle language
linguist have common to use the term
universal brand it's a notion that
there's some underlying set of
characteristics that I carry along
languages all over the world all human
languages have something that is sort of
now need and something that is sort of
verb' they all do all human languages
have a way to make things negative all
human languages have a way to ask a
question if I'm asking a question
I'll lower my eyebrows where are you
from what's your name who is that person
all human languages have a way to
indicate a difference between just one
and more than one in the s floor
languages you have not only the singular
for example guyot one rabbit will gyq
two rabbits will guide three or more
rabbits and so with those each language
has a list of obligatory distinctions
male/female definite indefinite singular
plural past present this is the stock of
categories that the human mind uses to
schematize experience and Chomsky asked
the question why is this why our
language is so similar why are they all
cut from the same mold and his answer
was there are fixed invariant principles
fixed invariant structural principles
which are simply part of the human
biological endowment and that determine
what counts as a human language it's
because the human brain is pre-wired to
accept only certain kinds of languages
and that the grammatical properties of
the languages of the world have those
properties that they do because the
human mind as those properties those
things which are true of all languages
are the candidates but what the child
comes into the world knowing about the
nature of the language to which he is
being exposed the child might very well
have a plan for what is a possible rule
in human language so languages can have
verbs then objects or objects and verbs
but those are two possibilities that
every language has one or the other of
and the child can simply worry about
which of those two versions his language
has what he's got to pick up are the
particular versions of the rules that
everyone else in the community is using
