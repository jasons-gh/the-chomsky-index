you will like them and some others are
about misinformation sure it's okay so
we can start yeah okay okay and so we
had this opportunity to meet you as a
comparator of the magazine exactly
efully and this is why first of all we
would like to thank you on behalf of the
defect italy include severe exit right
and the ops associate and we would like
to start are going to do asking your
impression of the evolution of the
occupy movement and about the net and i
hope so as tool of two awake some of the
99 dorman percent i mean is this a tool
this could be a tool to help them to
understand what's going on or or or
maybe we are just trying to do something
but it seems less we took each other I
mean I mean the same you can ask the
same question about the Occupy movement
and I was in heaven I Alps to what
extent can they reach out beyond the
already committed sections so take
occupied I was pretty startling
development I mean when a wouldn't be if
they'd asked me fortunately they didn't
but if they'd asked me it was a good
idea where's that's crazy because it
didn't seem to be any possibility that
it could succeed but it lit a spark
spread all over the United States very
quickly Occupy movements in many cities
spread all over the world I've been
talks of occupied in Sydney Australia
through the England continental Europe
and it significantly changed just the
general discourse in the United States
parts of the world thanks to occupy the
crucial questions move to the center of
the national agenda for much of the
population even for the media the
concepts like the ninety-nine percent
the one percent or just get common
discourse know the mainstream media
actually had some support from the
business person but it just kind of lit
a flame it's evident that things were
waiting and it did that those of course
occupies a tactic it's not a strategy
you can't occupy for very long
especially in the northern United States
we can sitting over two feet of snow
trees so it was finally a tactic could
go on for a couple of months tactics
have a kind of a half of you know they
work for a while and there's
effectiveness declines that it has to
move on to something else like moving
into neighborhoods and organizing and
turning to the concerns the concerns
that people have they're like in the
United States would be say foreclosures
or unemployment or immigrant problems
and so on reconstitution after the
Sunday sandy hurricane things like that
and to an extent that's happened would
be nice if it went beyond but it's it's
happened and that's the way movements
develop and take a look at the civil
rights movement I was going on for at
some ways for a century through the
1950s in the united states have began to
spread a little bit montgomery boycott
really took off with the sit-ins at
lunch counters in 1960 and then prison
get freedom riders and mess that's
movement succeeded a lot of things a lot
but not all if you listen to the
speeches on Martin Luther King Day a
couple days ago they end with his I have
a dream speech on 1964 but Martin Luther
King didn't stop there he went on to
raise class issues and to talk about
racism in the north and it's connection
with class he was organizing the poor
people's movement so when he was
assassinated but it was supporting a
sanitation workers strike public service
workers strike organizing a march to
Washington to establish a poor people's
movement of course race and class are
pretty closely correlated in the United
States but obviously not linear one
hundred percent well soon as they
started condemning the word Vietnam soon
as King moved in those directions he
fell off the radar screen northern
liberals were perfectly happy to see him
condemning racist sheriff's in Alabama
to talk about us please what we do so
that part of his life which was most
important for it for him as out of the
commemorations the same with Nelson
Mandela was just enormously praised
forget for eliminating apartheid a
couple of things are missing and they
won't be discussed the one is that as
soon as Mandela was released from prison
I was able to speak the first thing he
did was express his tremendous praise
for Cuba which was an inspiration for
the word for some times quoted nobody
knew he was talking about but what he
was talking about is that Cuba liberated
south of this Africa played an enormous
role in defending Angola I'm South
African aggression competing back it
even had a psychological role you know
black soldiers defeating famous white
invincible South Africans at a
dependence the first in South Africa out
of Namibia and forced apart at the end
you can't talk about that in the united
states are probably here either but
that's a major but that's indella not
that it's kind of like Kim's later years
got into unacceptable area as well
here's where movements make a difference
they have to go on after Babbage Evans
so the end of apartheid major
achievement with Jennifer black South
Africans and changeable
tracy Jordan the civil rights movement
the United States is an achievement many
there is progress but if it hits
barriers that that take much different
kind of work to overcome so so take
occupied it it did bring questions of
inequality Wall Street criminality and
so on right to the floor but they're
worse than they were inequalities gone
up big banks of Richard they were for
powerful so there's plenty of the boob
well okay that's where ever seen that
and I ops come in they're supposed to
what they aim to be at least as waste
carry the struggle for reversing that
goes for back and it's been a it's had
its successes its international of
communication that education system
material comes out people to communicate
there's a debate discussion groups look
around the paragon issues and other
issues okay well that's important but it
has been priest it steady so we take a
look at the subscriptions to Z magazine
they substantial for a small magazine
but haven't gone up that's right that's
right that's what happened yes and I
hope it's the same did it's a good idea
of interesting possibilities but it
hasn't lit real sport kit okay that's
what activists are for
to try to vary distance ourselves okay
and making a reference to the change in
communication the way of communicating
the universe to communicate what do you
think of the real meaning in future of
the world making Bengali embellishment
in the past it was something from the
Army from state trying to overdo other
states the imperialism which we can see
to be Richard with the media with the
information with information what do you
think would be really the intent of you
know that immediate give plenty of
options but the question is who's gonna
like the internet gets plenty of options
but who's going to use it in how is the
question so if it turns out to be
dominated by say cults or you know that
fox news sometimes we'll all be harmful
so the opportunity is there but it's
very much the same as the other
questions I mean they were there with
print media to say Zenith 20 years ago
zeemagazine was print media print media
had opportunities they they were used an
effect it hasn't had the effect of
bringing about major social changes in
fact the past 30 years have been a
period of regressions but it's not the
first time that's were social struggles
about I would take civil rights again
that literally goes back hundreds of
years that women's rights that was an
issue they some groups in the early 19th
century it wasn't really until the 1960s
that's I mean to take the United States
until 1975 literally I women were not
considered peers they couldn't bend a
federal right circle federal jury
because they've not for human beings 30
years ago things take time and you gotta
keep looking they make you reference
question fuel hello me your corrected
considerate person very brave and many
of us invite such quality of your
personality do you have any tips on how
to build up the courage for those people
who do not have it I don't think I have
any particular qualities that every
person doesn't have if they want to use
them if n if there's any tips it's been
kept a deep dark secret for thousands of
years even it's not something
spontaneous but it's kind of something
that once you are involved whether you
may as something that everybody has I
mean sometimes people use them as they
don't you know there are people who I
mean if there's if you pass by an
accident in the street somebody is lying
on the ground bleeding and there are
people he'll go over to help there are
other people who
fast okay I got something else to do
well okay that's these are personal
choices but there are no special tricks
are magic or personality characteristics
it's just the way you decide to act like
a human okay he originally we see that
the communication system very often make
distorted or questionable use of the
real meaning of the words if we were to
discover the reality only on the basis
of what all mainstream show the public
would just believe and trust what they
they propose without putting any
question and consider that there is no
alternative that is not a way to do
things then what they are doing there is
not a way to approach politics or
ecology or on do you think that there
are many people who are aware to be
subject with instrumental media bombing
which exploits the psychological and
scientific knowledge over the human
brain only not only for commercial
reason but particular for political
purpose do they understand or not or
they just the general population well I
can't talk readily frame study is the
United States work i have studied it it
turns out that a people firstly they are
kept in ignorance but on the other hand
if you look at attitudes their attitudes
are not those that are presented by the
establishment propaganda system looting
the media so for example
