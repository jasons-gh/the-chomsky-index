it's
almost the other way around
there is a true
the ECB European Central Bank the
European Union the International
Monetary Fund and they are busy
destroying Greece in Greece has plenty
of internal problems question they go
way back they got to be dealt with but
the policies that the truck is proposing
simply make them worse and make it
impossible to pull out now if you had a
capitalist system that you can say look
you let any money i'm not paying it back
you can't go to the government say i
want you to pay me but that's what
happens in our system because it's a
gangster suspect as even there's even a
name for it by now I'm sure stiglitz
must have talked about it it's called
too big to fail which which is a way of
describing a government insurance policy
the government ensures Tassili ensures
the big banks investment firms it says
you make risky loans risky transactions
make a lot of money and when it
collapses which it will a will ensure
you will pay you back we didn't accept
that weren't given a choice nobody said
here's what we're planning and designing
say the IMF do you like it that was
never you never chose that you never
chose it was designed and imposed is any
country a country of just you don't ask
is a state morrow I mean there are moral
people individuals can be moral they can
compel our systems to act decently but
to expect the system of power to act
morally just doesn't mean eight how do
they act according to their own
interests and principles and that's as
as old as history well when he was
elected I had no expectations for him
and I think he has almost no principles
I think an opportunist with no
principles but I did write that having a
black family in the White House is a
historic achieve that means it's just
true what it symbolizes and represent
and what it means for the
african-american community and for the
culture generally Dale Misawa zine oh
yeah it was close friend for 40 years
actually the families were
and well I'm going to like to talk about
personal things but over the four of us
his wife and Howard and Ron's my wife is
the only one alive so yes it's difficult
to think that everyone's going much more
significant is what young people are
doing and always ask me if Howard were
here he would say the same thing it was
teaching it a black university in
atlanta in around nineteen sixty and
howard supported them so he was thrown
out of the university but one of his
first books was about them I mean that
was the driving force of the civil
rights movement that Martin Luther King
was extremely important great man
