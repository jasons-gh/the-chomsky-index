you're bothered by dirtiest slides and
you're not bothered by the lives of
Holocaust deniers on our country I'm not
I'm not the but I'm not saying I'm
bothered by dirt that's why I say yes we
should insist on the freedom of speech
for dedicated liars and in the case of
say the Holocaust denial yeah that's of
course outrageous just as it's
outrageous to deny what we did namely
wiping up millions of Indians but you
know the number one I think argument
against what you preach for is the
double scan double standard saying that
you know from talking of freedom of
speech and countries where freedom of
speech is does not exist you're going to
Lebanon tomorrow or when you go to even
here in Jordan I don't think it's
limited to compared to Israel is Israel
as bad as other countries did I ever say
that you spend so much time targeting
Israel did Amnesty International asked
me to give a talk that they could use to
criticize human rights violations in
Israel no they did it for Syria but you
said you have limited time looking in
the map in the world there are so many
problems why is Israel in the center
Israel still if you look around is you
know is trying and struggling is trying
to give democracy away and it has gay
rights and human rights if you started
by asking why is Israel in the center
answer it isn't not for me
what's in the center for me is the
United States and for a very elementary
moral reason the the moral principle is
we are responsible for our own actions
and their consequences every crime that
Israel commits is because of us
participation and authorization so any
decent American citizen even without a
special interest in Israel as I have
should have these in the center of their
attention because those are the ones
we're participating in we're responsible
for and we what is worse than your eyes
the actions in Israel and in the
territories or for example what's going
on in Afghanistan how do you how do you
prioritize these two
there's no weight to it because I talk
about both of them all the time but is
Israel as what's going on in Israel as
severe as what's going on in Darfur
Afghani stands for food in the case of
Darfur yes the crimes are worse but
there is much less that I could do about
them much less was nothing in fact so
yes it's fine to sign petitions
criticising them but there's no moral
value delete it and you feel moral value
because you're a citizen of the US and B
you have connections to Israel and you
feel that you're part of the let's put
aside the personal connection to Israel
which is there but if I had no
connection to Israel at all as simply as
an American citizen okay it would be of
prime concern because the u.s. is
decisively involved Israel for example
could not attack Gaza could not carry
out the occupation and so on without
decisive and direct US diplomatic
military and economic support you know I
think you're taking a lot of
responsibility here a person should take
responsibility for what they are
responsible for yeah but you are so
convinced for many years in your
theories you obviously don't see an
existent
danger to Israel there is a danger it's
posing a danger to itself you see only
from that you're asking Israelis Israeli
government to take a risk you're saying
for I'm going back to the nuclear issue
because let's take the nuclear issue
okay there's a way to what if you're
wrong that's what I'm asking look you
have to make judgments on the basis of
your best assessment of the facts
available so there's shouldn't we learn
from history there were voices before
the world war who didn't take Hitler
that serious and history unfortunately
proved us wrong how can you be so sure
that how many jawed is not going to
widen is really damaged sure so
therefore what you should do is take
steps to mitigate the threat to the
extent that it exists the obvious step
to take to mitigate the threat is to
move towards instituting a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East
region okay
that will mitigate the threat that is
not that excuse me that's important
no Israelis who don't want to do that or
harming Israel but in your eyes you're
quite sure that this there is no
immediate threat on Israel from outside
of Israel the Israeli what if you're
wrong what if you're wrong and people
are using your argument to have the
international community look the other
way suppose those who claim there's a
threat are wrong and in fact by making
that claim they're harming Israel
yeah that's perfectly possible in fact
it's true so whatever position you take
there's a possibility that it's wrong if
you have the interests of Israel at
heart then what you would want to do is
reduce the possibility of any nuclear
threat in the region and there is an
immediate way to do that which is
supported virtually by the entire world
and that is to move towards establishing
a nuclear weapons-free zone with and so
let's let's do that well Israel's
refusing and the United States is
refusing now they repeat the words they
say oh yes a nice idea but they say we
can't do it until there's a
comprehensive peace settlement well
that's saying we can't do it period now
what's blocking a comprehensive peace
settlement well we know the answer the
United States and Israel are opposed to
the world on the exists on a political
settlement on the international border
with maybe along the lines of the table
negotiations which would lead to a
comprehensive peace settlement everyone
in the world is supporting that now by
opposing that world and then you go on
it is it is questionable of people it's
not that sure that the Palestinians can
go through with this agreement they have
the Hamas on one hand they have the
front I'm just saying that look every
relevant actor is in favor of this now
Israel in the United States are not only
opposed to it in words they're blocking
it in deeds furthermore international
law is in favor of it okay that's that's
of course your opinion I don't my
that's where the look the occupied
territories Israeli actions in the
occupied territories with us crucial us
backing are first of all illegal Israel
recognized that in 1967
they're illegal and they're harmful well
unfortunately we can't solve that
problem we can't agree though it's a
complex situation it's not black and
white but I understand that while your
parents were were alive it was you were
more cautious in making those arguments
against against Israel I don't make
arguments against Israel okay making
these arguments for Israel as you say
was it was it a factor I mean was it
hard for you because I didn't I was
unhappy about the fact that they were
subjected to a series of Tantrums from
hysterics in the United States but I
said the same things and in fact they
approved of them so when you when in
Israel they consider you to be on
someone who is harming Israel does it
hurt you personally Jews I mean that the
public opinion I mean the public opinion
is reading what you're pretending to
what I'm asking are you there's a defend
you personally are you upset but that is
the situation set by the fact that
people in other countries in the world
think I'm the greatest danger to their
country is it tiring tiring yeah I
expected any dissident and critic can
anticipate that they're going to be
subjected to hysterical tirades if
you're a Soviet dissident did you expect
to be treated nicely in fact do you
think of it this it in any country is
treated nicely let's go back in history
let's take Israel okay you go back to
the Bible you studied the Bible I'm sure
yeah in the Bible there is someone who's
called a hater of Israel the prophet
Elijah King Ahab you know the epitome of
evil in the vine so no way you see
yourself is about saying that no I've
seen the prophets as intellectuals so
it's it's your life mission and
therefore even at your
life's mission it's the mission of any
decent human being take Elijah or
Jeremiah or Isaiah any of them where
they treated nicely they're treated very
badly Elijah was called a hater little
Harry's rail hater of Israel
centuries later he was honored but not
at the time there were people who were
honored at the time
centuries later they're called false
prophets centuries later
that was my rhyme laughing because that
was funny because that was my next
question how do you think history will
judge you that's up the history depends
who wins the Jewish history it depends
who wins the battles if you had taken
the other path in nineteen in the 1950s
and stayed in Israel where would you
think we would find you I would be with
my friends in Israel who say the same
thing and you can read them in the press
every day and if you wouldn't live in
the States where would you live anywhere
else
five years ago you were asked the
question I was asked the question in an
interview in Haaretz and I said well I'd
certainly go to Israel but now I
wouldn't say then it's changed in the
last few years it's changed in ways
which are extremely harmful to the
country you can see it harming itself
day after day it's it's undertake it's
in a mood of not the whole country but
leading sectors including the government
are in a mood of paranoia and
irrationality which is harming the
country very seriously I mean you know
my own case is so trivial it doesn't
matter but just take this trivial case
if the Ministry of Interior had not
refused entry and I'd gone to give it
didn't have to be the end of this nobody
would ever heard of it just as nobody
heard of other talks I've given in verse
eight but that's minor on the other hand
purposely humiliating the Turkish
ambassador
that's not minor but it takes a the
reaction of the Goldstone report which
is quite interesting Israel has turned
it into an international incident if
Israel had acted rash
they would have responded to the
Goldstone report by saying Thank You mr.
Goldstone for your careful work thank
you particularly for giving us a great
gift as he did if you're concerned about
the safety of Israel should be concerned
about these matters because in case
after case the irrationality and the
paranoia is very harmful and destructive
and in the long term it could be of lead
to very serious consequences
professor Noam Chomsky thank you very
much Baba it's been Jay planted ABBA
