hello my name is Jason Lee isatis globe
of his radio I've got the great pleasure
today of very lucky to have a fantastic
guests who won't show you all know his
name's mr. Nam Chomsky thank you very
much for coming on the round the Global
Peace program now I very much appreciate
it glad to be with you it's great you
know fantastic inspiration to so many
many many people you're one of the very
few people in my opinion and to have the
great courage to actually talk about the
real dilemma if you like that humanity
is currently in and I suppose we could
say has been in for quite some time
lately but it's a big subject I know we
haven't got a tremendous amount of time
obviously and i'm all about as you
probably know i'm all about finding
peace I talk about I total ethics morals
empathy all the things that as humanity
we seem to be compromising with an
ethical compromises for me is one of the
greatest dangers we face and which is
beheaded obviously by governments
generally with you know operating
without vision and wisdom to a great
degree and not looking down the timeline
to see those feedback loops which had
come in backtick to hit us even though
we can't see them reaching fruition
quite yet what you feel about that could
you say a few words about that subject
it's a very live subject and it has
dramatic implications so instead of
talking about it abstractly let's talk
about a specific case yep while back of
the United States sent highly trained
Special Forces baby seals to invade
Pakistan to break into the compound
where one of their enemies of Samba
Laden was holed up of a jolt of people
broke
his apartment was unarmed defenseless
wife was with him on instructions from
the White House they murdered him
through his body into the ocean without
autopsy that has obvious consequences
throughout the Muslim world infected
Trude everywhere but it's much more than
that the Navy SEALs who were sent in
there were under orders to fight their
way out if they were trapped they could
have been Pakistan has a advanced army
dedicated loyal army committed to the
offending sovereignty the country very
well armed theft lots of nuclear weapons
and if they found him in time they
wouldn't just let them walk out well the
US forces would never have allowed them
to be trapped the whole forces the u.s.
formants would have been used to
extricate them and it almost happened
very close to happen the chief of staff
of the Pakistani army Joan Kayani was
informed that there had been an
intrusion into Pakistani airspace he's
first assumption was it was from India
Pakistan India ends relationship ordered
the Air Force's other forces to
immobilize to prevent to respond to this
intrusion meanwhile at the same time a
general david petraeus commander of US
regional commander in Kabul Afghanistan
ordered the US Air Force to start
scrambling jets get ready for an action
this means we were very close to war
with Pakistan which could have easily
turned into a nuclear war which put it
destroy all by now it's well understood
has been for a while
time that a a major nuclear war would
destroy the attacker even if there was
no response even a first strike the
effects of it would be so enormous
leading to a kind of puts both global
manner that probably destroyed the
attacker as well well we were close to
that the Obama administration was
willing to take that chance though there
were other ways of finding and
apprehending bin Laden who remember was
a suspect not guilty of anything
presumably was responsible for 911 but
that's a little different than
demonstrating it in a quart quart of
laws has been required by anglo american
law for 800 years since Magna Carta but
they were willing to risk a nuclear war
and it gets worse the technique by which
bin Laden was identified in his location
has identified was at CIA operation
which carried out a fake vaccination
campaign in a bottle odd towards the
areas of the photon where they thought
he was that's a very serious violation
of principles that go back as far as the
Hippocratic oath you know thousands of
years and they cut off the vaccination
campaign in the middle because they
found he was somewhere else which is a
further crime but it goes on in much of
the world third world people are pretty
skeptical about the white men I'm in and
start sticking things in their arms and
what are they up to I've seen it myself
any penny and you can understand it
after where they have some experience
with the white invaders common things
that very
so what are these guys doing coming in
here and sticking needle in her arm and
talks a lot of work convince people they
should undergo vaccination campaign well
this there happens to be a major that
was its now ended a major vaccination
campaign in Pakistan polio has been
almost eradicated in the world it
couldn't go the way of smallpox totally
eliminated and it's a dread disease
Pakistan is one of the few places where
polio is still endemic very alive and
there were there were UN vaccination
teams working in in Pakistan to try to
overcome eliminate this dread disease
well as soon as the fake vaccination
campaign was exposed the fears that
people already have were given assault
invasive and soon he when health be
abduct some of them killed you went had
to pull out the whole vaccination team
of one the effects were felt in fact as
far as Nigeria I've also with polio well
the estimates are buy us medical
specialists that maybe a hundred
thousand people in Pakistan will
contract folio as a result of this
operation and one specialist on the
University professor added acquainting
to this child sitting in a wheelchair
crippled and say you did it you
Americans did and that has consequences
and in fact quite generally the US is
engaged in a terrorist manufacturing
campaign and create errors this is one
it people who quote errors if his
revenge
other examples drinking example right at
time lost marathon bombings pretty close
to young police officer was murdered was
killed right outside my office on
everyone you're a lot of people here
felt it personally it was a real tragedy
same time two days later there was a
drone attack ins of in Yemen the should
be recognized that drones they're
presented to us as devices that
surgically eliminate a particular person
it's not true their terror weapons they
terrorize towns villages or regions and
you can see why I mean suppose you're
walking down the street and your
neighborhood then you don't know if five
minutes from now there's going to be a
sudden explosion from some unknown
source that'll kill the guy standing
across the street and every one happens
to be near him well that's your
terrorized the lift it's a major terror
weapon and the drone campaign to huge
care I have a fact so what happened
after that right at the time of the
Boston Marathon bombing well there was a
drone attack in a village in isolated
village and Yemen most of these we don't
know about but this one we happen to
know about because the young man from
the village was studying here and he
took justified to the Senate about it
and he pointed out that there had been a
thing Johnny's life radically ments and
Yemen had been trying for years to turn
the villagers against the United States
and they'd fail because all these people
knew about the United States was what he
wrote to them and he liked in the United
States wrote favorable things but he
added that this one dropped achieved
what the jihadis had failed to several
years now the people just with you this
let's go to home get this they ever is
generating system and it carries with it
threats as far as the threat of nuclear
war and just gave an example as well as
all kinds of side effects like maybe a
hundred thousand polio victims and Chris
now thankthank you know me it's a very
good example and thank you very much for
that I feel always feel very emotional
when when people talk about these things
because I talk like yourself about these
things along I'm talking a lot at the
moment about so I wrote a piece yes the
other day called I call they kill them
just in case so what we're seeing now is
ethical compromises to such a degree
that it's murder without trial as you
said like with someone like bin Laden he
was only a suspect murder without trial
for the victim and the perpetrators and
it's the same with the drones it's all I
see it it's almost like and you see
someone who think you might who might
get a gun so you kill them just in case
or someone who might be a terrorist you
can i'm just in case and this is
terrorists accusing other people of
being terrorists there's no doubt the
greatest terror threat in the in the
whole world now is israel in the US
there's no doubt i mean they talk about
you know near a nuclear threat from Iran
and meanwhile they've the abuse depleted
uranium as you know and themselves with
with their almost a genocide Jenna soy
de la fete sin in Iraq and it's in the
lawmakers of the law breakers and
they're almost like magicians with
amnesia I think normally they sort of
they're like children and a nuclear
reactor they can't seem to help but to
fight and kill people and we're getting
used to it and i will get in used to use
to it that's the problem isn't it
I'm not getting used to it but accepting
it in the most astonishing ways so it
was kind of interested in some it's
shocking to see how educated liberal
progressive intellectuals are reacting
to these things yep so lonely
towards the more gin doest chauvinist
end you ever example what the go that
was a drone attack in Yemen which
happened several little girls and a
well-known American commentator the
rural commentator client was asked if
you didn't think that was something
wrong with this and what he said is it's
better that their little girls should be
killed than our in other words time for
us to kill someone who we suspect may
ultimately on the Armas and the
collection of yours who know it's the
dickless and fine words no it ain't
roses it is incredible and I think
that's the greatest danger at the moment
well as you well know BP in a gentleman
who talks about what you talk or I'm the
greatest threat to humanity at the
moment is our own minds I mean that's a
pretty sweeping statement bro I think
that's pretty much true because our
minds create and manifest our thoughts
create a manifest most of the things we
see around us be a tin of beans a you
know a block of flats or war or peace
and this is what we forgotten I think as
human beings is that the people who are
running this world and actually those
feedback loops and those consequences
without wisdom of vision are already
like a tsunami is like kicking a bucket
of water it's going to come back and get
us and we only got to look what's going
on in them in in quantum at current
Guantanamo know that they are so
possessed with controlling people and
being the top dog is they won't even
allow someone to kill themselves I'd
like to hear your comments on in a
minute
they won't allow anyone injured and want
Elmo to kill themselves that's so that's
so sort of controlling there and like
you said about people unknown I think
there's an intrinsic fear of punishment
within most people and that's why I
respect you so much because in your
position you could quite easily not talk
about this you know and I really respect
you for that to actually say as it is
and most people fear punishment and
intrinsic fear of government punishment
if they speak out they'll be punished
and and actually they will that's
another thing I'd like to ask you about
is like you know they talk about Assad
being brutal to his people and magic and
this kind of thing and they were had war
crimes against humanity of hladik but I
mean Tony Blair Bush and Obama and these
people Sarkozy they've killed by far
more people in rat clone Maddock and
they're not being tried for war crimes
against humanity so I'd like to ask you
about Guantanamo what you think about
the white man like you said early on he
certainly speaks with forked tongue and
he thinks he's the top dog is um it's
definitely a part it-it's I've been in
South Africa I got shot out so I know
what the part oh it's all about in the
80s so it's that thing that they just
can't help but to keep punishing people
it's almost like they're almost sadists
you know when their sugar those pipes
down people's knows it's almost a
sadistic masochistic symbiosis people
are let in letting them do these things
and I think people feel helpless how can
people change can you speak without a
bit numb please what we have to actually
a sadistic is the right word when you
read the yet testimony people who've
been through these experiences it is you
know it's just utterly devastating the
one book that I really urge that people
read I think it's very persuasive by an
Australian as his name is David Hicks he
was picked up in afghanistan by the
Northern Alliance forces on the ground
operating the United States he know he
wasn't doing anything as and straighten
hitchhiker up there he was picked up he
was sold to the Americans for bounty
they do that and then he was in the
hands of the American army for I think
about six years at first that the Bagram
base in Afghanistan which is huge
torture chamber then several years in
Guantanamo he describes it chilling
detail the ways he was treated and it's
just can't believe that human beings can
do this and I think anyone reads it will
realize it's a very credible account and
reinforced by many others know plenty of
evidence of that joint but he also makes
out something which I found rather
striking he says that the American
soldiers who were firing out these
sadistic the brutal I were terrified of
their captains they had been so
indoctrinated that they regarded the
people they were imprisoned as
superhuman I said soldiers would come to
his cage you know he's can't move chapel
and ask him to perform some of his
amazing tricks for them no they climb on
the ceiling whatever and if they ever
took a prisoner out shackled you know
and cuffed barely move practically
destroyed but mystic tortured they'd
have to have a whole array of heavily
armed soldiers and police just to make
sure that he didn't that the cap is
didn't turn on meningioma yeah he says
really were frightened chief and
probably correctly that that's the
result of intensive and dr.
asian and it extends in the whole
society it's a very frightened society
yep I mean take the gun ultra the United
States it's pretty interesting why do
people feel they have to have fun well
for a lot of people it's is because they
are genuinely frightened of things like
of possibilities like say that the UN
will come and take over the country and
commit genocide or eliminate our
sovereignty or the federal government is
suddenly our break in you know and birth
control them these things are beyond
paranoia you know but it's it's not
uncommon in the country next in a
pregnant country since its origins which
stuck with this but now it's taking on a
really almost psychotic form and a lot
of it is driven by the build up hysteria
recall for example the right before the
Iraq invasion when the bush
administration was trying to organize
mobilized popular support for the
planned invasion the other were all
kinds of hysterical pronouncements of
Condoleezza Rice and others about how
the next thing we see is a mushroom
cloud over New York we got to defend
ourselves from these crazed Arabs were
trying to all of them want to kill us
order what can we do over there invade
them and terrorizing well you know
that's a win a mood like that spreads in
a country that has extraordinary power
means of violence that vastly exceed
anyone else in the world
then you're in it that you're dangerous
situation no I do your night dangerous
for your right world I think we are run
by said we're running out of time
unfortunately don't why I think Oh God
but we are definitely our condition is
without conditioning is one of our
dangers and we'll run by psychotic
people they've gone insane there's no
doubt about and it's infectious to the
population and you know I think we've
got to trying them operate some are
without government control over the
Czar's our own systems or were in big
big trouble we can't rely on them
anymore to test for the future can we
really you know better think through
things for ourselves and federal way out
of it indoctrinations it yep exactly
norm exactly now I'd like to speak to
you for another two hours oh I'm
unfortunately when all the time and I
know you're a very busy man and I'd love
to speak to you again sometime if we
could in them I really appreciate you
coming on global peace radio and thank
you for all your fantastic commitments
of sanity and peace and an unstable ax t
in the woods and we need more people
like you thank you very very much yes
and I'm very glad about what you're
doing it's really important thank thank
you no thank you very much indeed yeah I
thank you bye now thank you very much
