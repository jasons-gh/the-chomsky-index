turkey is grateful for us support for
the support that you and I gave decisive
support for its campaign of murderous
state terror as incidentally it was
called accurately by turkeys minister of
human rights and by very courageous
Turkish intellectuals among them
prominent sociologists who spent much of
his life in prison for recording the
facts he actually rejected an award from
the fund for free expression here
because of us support for turkeys
murderous state terror in gratitude for
Clinton's enormous contributions to
massive international terrorism Prime
Minister Javad was the first to offer
troops to fight the war on terror in
Afghanistan and now turkey has just been
selected to serve as the Force to
protect Kabul from terrorism funded by
Washington there are others too who
happily enlist on the war on terror so
no one's more enthusiastic than the
Russians who are eager to have us
support for their own monstrous crimes
in Chechnya where the brutal dictator of
Uzbekistan is also our kind of guy right
now well again or will would have been
open mouth and astonishment as all of
this proceeds evoking little comment but
if we want to break convention and have
a look at what we're doing we can learn
a lot about the war on terror and more
generally about the effects of September
11th on policy well let's move to
today's headlines right now so take
Israel sharen is a man of peace as the
president just described them despite an
impressive record of terrorist
atrocities includes large-scale
massacres of defenseless civilians back
in the early 1950s brutal expulsion of
thousands of veterans 20 years later
under the Labour government destroying
their lands mosques cemeteries driving
them into the
desert to clear Northeast Sinai for
Jewish settlement the background for the
1973 war and including of course the
1982 war fought in Lebanon killing
20,000 people in order to secure Israeli
control over the occupied territories
and other atrocities all of them
international terrorism because they
rely crucially on us support since the
1970s and the last few weeks horrible as
they are are nothing all that new I
personally saw similar things firsthand
in the West Bank during the First
Intifada 1988 in this attack the most
ferocious and destructive weapons that
destroyed the Janine refugee camp and
the ancient kasbah the old city and knob
loose in ways reminiscent of the Taliban
if you look closely the most ferocious
weapons were us helicopters supplied in
the full knowledge that they're going to
be used for those purposes no doubt
about it and it's a pretty ugly story it
bears retelling involves Clinton come
and the US media including ours right
here I'll come back to it if you like
furthermore the US government remains
active right now in enhancing terror
they're on borrowing the president's
words so in December last December the
Security Council debated a resolution
calling for the implementation of the
Mitchell plan and the dispatch of
international monitors to oversee the
reduction of violence that's the most
effective means as is generally
recognized such efforts are routinely
blocked by Washington again this was
vetoed in on December 14th that
particular veto happened to be taking
place during a 21-year a 21-day period
of calm that means that only one Israeli
soldier was killed along with 21
Palestinians including 11 children and
16 incursions into areas under
Palestinian control
10 days before the US veto the there was
conference in Geneva important
conference at which the u.s. boycotted
and therefore undermined conference that
once again concluded that the fourth
geneva convention applies to the
occupied territories that entails that
virtually everything that the United
States and Israel do there is a grave
breach of the Geneva Conventions meaning
a war crime of unusual severity grave
breach under US law the conference which
included the European Union even Britain
went along specifically declared that
the us-funded Israeli settlements are
illegal and it condemned quoting it now
condemned the practice of wilful killing
torture unlawful deportation willful
depriving of the rights of fair and
regular trial extensive destruction and
appropriation of property carried out
unlawfully and wantonly they're not
talking about the last couple of weeks
this is December 5th the United States
is a high contracting party of the
Geneva Conventions and therefore it is
obligated by solemn treaty to prosecute
those who were responsible for such
crimes including the US leadership going
back 30 years the United States has not
officially withdrawn its recognition of
the applicability of the Geneva
Conventions to the occupied territories
nor has it it's it withdrawn its
official censure of Israeli violations
as the occupying power I'm quoting
George Bush the first when he was UN
Ambassador in October and that remains
official policy in october two thousand
the Security Council reaffirmed the
consensus on this matter it called on
israel quoting called on israel the
occupying power to abide scrupulously by
its legal obligations under the Fourth
Geneva Convention remember that excludes
just about everything that's happening
there as a work run the vote was 14 20
means it becomes international law the 0
is because of one abstention Clinton
abstained presumably not wanting to veto
one of the core principles of
international humanitarian law
particularly in the light of the
circumstances in which it was enacted in
1949 in order to criminalize formerly
the atrocities of the Nazis in occupied
territories well all of this is another
significant contribution to enhancing
terror all the more so because it's
scarcely reported the Geneva Conference
in fact wasn't reported and very quickly
consigned to the memory hole which is
already amply furnished with their own
quickly forgotten crimes the none of
this however is forgotten by the victims
well yes September 11th with a
horrifying atrocity unfortunately it's
not new what's new is the direction in
which the guns are pointing for the
first time in the history of Europe and
it's offshoots that is us they were the
victims not the perpetrators of
horrifying crimes of this nature and
that's a historic event why was it
carried out second question well here we
have to make a distinction between two
groups one is the actual perpetrators
assume as everyone else does that it's
either al-qaeda or something very like
them and why they did it is there's no
one who knows that it the answer to that
any better than the CIA which recruited
them armed them trained them directed
them to cause maximal harm to the
Russians and not to help the Afghans
which would have been a legitimate
objective the same special forces that
are chasing them around in Tora Bora a
few years earlier were training them to
carry out terrorist atrocities and they
did the they carried out during the 80s
they carried out terrorist acts within
Russia which were pretty serious almost
led to a Russia Pakistan war
one point that all ended in 1989 when
the Russians withdrew they didn't stop
there terrorism against the Russians
because they love Russians they hate
them but rather because they had
achieved their objective which was clear
and explicit the objective was to drive
the infidels out of the Muslim lands so
that they could initiate their own reign
of terror as they immediately did in
nineteen ninety they turned against the
United States for essentially the same
reasons from their point of view of the
United States is occupying Saudi Arabia
even much more significant than
occupying Afghanistan for them their own
terrorist record goes back 20 years to
the time when the CIA and British
intelligence and its allies organized
and trained them in 1993 they made their
first attempt to blow up the world trade
center actually had much more ambitious
plans the sure you know there was a
Dutch government inquiry into these
river nietzsche atrocities is just
released last week from it we learned
that at the same time that they were
trying to blow up the world trade center
us c-130s were flying radical Islamist
Mujahideen from Afghanistan to the
Balkans also iranian-backed Hezbollah
fighters and also a huge flow of arms
going through Croatia which took a
substantial cut they were there to
support the US side in the Balkan wars
while Israel Ukraine and Greece were
arming the other side which explains why
unexploded mortar bombs landing in
Sarajevo sorry avo sometimes had Hebrew
markings quoting a British political
scientist reviewing the report that was
published last week by the Dutch
government
