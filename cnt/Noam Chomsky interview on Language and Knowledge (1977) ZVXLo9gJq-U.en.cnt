Noam Chomsky has made two international
reputations in unrelated or apparently
unrelated fields the widest is as one of
the national leaders of American
resistance to the Vietnam War the
deepest is as a professor of linguistics
who before he was 40 years old had
transformed the nature of his subject
he's something of a joker in the pack as
far as philosophy is concerned many
professional philosophers would insist
quite sincerely that he isn't a
philosopher at all that linguistics is
simply a different discipline albeit a
neighboring one well I'm not going to
argue about that it's little more than a
question of definition anyway the fact
is he was trained as a philosopher his
work has enormous implications for
philosophy and in the writings of
philosophers today I should say his name
probably occurs as often as that of any
living person the central point really
is this
if one problem more than another has
dominated much of twentieth-century
philosophy it's that of the relationship
between language and the world Vidkun
Stein to give no more than a single
instance was in thrall to this problem
throughout his life well now along comes
the linguist Chomsky and argues that the
way we actually acquire the use of
language and therefore its relationship
to experience and therefore its
relationship to the world are radically
different from what the anglo-saxon
tradition in philosophy has always
maintained he pursed he first put his
ideas forward in the late 1950s as part
of the critique of behavioral psychology
it's not too unfair to say that the
behavioral psychologists attended to
talk as if the human individual came
into the world as an undifferentiated
lump of malleable stuff which was then
molded and shaped by its environment
through processes of stimulus and
response they said penalty and reward
the reinforcement of rewarding responses
and the association of ideas the
individual developed and learned
including the learning of language now
Chomsky argued that this could not
possibly explain how virtually all human
beings regardless of their intelligence
do something as fantastically difficult
as master the use of a language even
when they're not deliberately taught it
as most people probably aren't and they
do this at such an extraordinary young
age and in such an extraordinary short
space of time he argued that for this to
happen at all we must be genetically
pre-programmed to do it and therefore
that all human languages must have in
common a basic structure that
corresponds to this pre programming now
this also has some very important
negative implications the chief of these
is that anything that can't be
accommodated to this structure anything
so to speak that can't be caught in the
mesh of this particular network is
linguistically inexpressible and
unintelligible to us so the general
principles common to all languages set
vital limits to our capacity to
understand the world and communicate
with each other put like that it sounds
like a translation into linguistic terms
of some of the basic ideas of Immanuel
Kant and I must say that's always how
its looked to me but even if so it's
Chomsky has carried it out and no one
else and it's proved an enormous Lee
stimulating and fruitful thing to do a
professor Chomsky one of the
difficulties about discussing your ideas
is that in an obvious sense they are
hybrid in part their linguistics in part
their philosophy and in part their
biology and in fact you yourself first
put them forward in what was really a
dispute with biologists with with
behavioral psychologists how did you
come to start at that starting point
well the reason was the that this
picture of the nature of language and
the way in which language is acquired
was of such enormous prevalence over
quite a wide spectrum of thought
including not simply psychology but but
philosophy and linguistics as well the
view that was dominant
say at the time when I was a student
2530 years ago the dominant picture of
language was that it is essentially a
system of habits or skills or
dispositions to
act and that it is acquired through
extensive training over training through
repetition
perhaps through procedures of induction
or generalization or Association and
that one's knowledge one's system of the
system of habits the one developed
simply grows through accretion
incrementally as experience is subjected
to these processes of generalization and
analogy and in fact this this picture
which plainly is a factual assumption
was presented as if it were virtually an
a priori truth which it certainly is not
I mean it's obviously not necessary that
language is a system of that sort or
that it's acquired and anything like
that way one thing that you pointed out
which is in fact very obvious once it's
pointed out is that most people probably
aren't actually taught language at all
that is to say that most parents don't
give any systematic instruction of any
kind to their children yet the children
nevertheless learn well I wouldn't want
to even go beyond that I think it's
certainly the case that languages in
only the most marginal sense is taught
and the teaching is in no sense
essential to the acquisition of language
but in another in a certain sense I
think we might even go on to say that
language isn't even learned at least if
by learning we mean any process that has
those characteristics that are generally
associated with learning for example the
process of the the the characteristics
that I mentioned it seems to me if we
want a reasonable metaphor we should
talk about growth language seems to me
to grow in the mind rather in the way
that familiar physical systems of the
body grow we begin our interchange with
the world with our mind in a certain
genetically determined state and through
an interaction with experience with an
environment this state changes until it
reaches a mature state which we call a
state of knowledge of language this
sequence of changes from the genetically
determined initial state to the final
state in which we really have a quite
complex system of mental computations
this series of changes seem
to me very much analogous to growth of
organs and in fact I think it's not
inappropriate to regard the mind as a
system of mental organs the language
faculty being one each of a structure
determined by para biological endowment
with interactions also generally
determined by the nature of our
biological endowment growing through the
triggering effect of experience which
shapes and articulates the organs as
they develop in the individual through
the relevant period of his life so as I
said it seems to me that the not only is
it wrong to think of languages being
taught but it's at least very misleading
to think of it as being learned if we
carry with the notion learning the
association's that generally go along
with it
in other words we are pre-programmed to
learn a language in the same way as we
are pre-programmed to grow arms and legs
and reach puberty in our early teens and
all sorts of other sometimes delayed
processes of growth yes and reaching
puberty is a good example since that's a
case of biological development of auto
genetic development that's plainly
pre-programmed in its essence but takes
place after birth and in fact we might
say that something that even death for
that matter is genetically determined
that is it's we are biologically
constructed so that at a certain time
our life processes stop but and in fact
the fact that some development takes
place after the organism has begun an
independent existence in the world has
nothing to say it tells us nothing about
whether it's a genetically determined
development or not now one thing that
follows from your view is that if if we
set out as you have done in the course
of your professional life to investigate
the language Faculty of human beings
then what you are investigating is as
much a biophysical system I mean
something that actually exists in matter
in stuff in human tissue as would be the
case if you were investigating human
vision or human digestion or the
circulation of the blood well I think
that that's certainly true in at least
we believe it to be true
in principle we are not at a stage now
where in the study of the neural basis
for higher cognitive processes where
it's possible to identify the physical
structures that are involved in these
operations correspondingly the the
actual study of this organ remains at an
abstract level that is we can try to
investigate the principles by which it
functions but there's very little to say
right now about the ways in which these
principles are physically realized in
structures of the brain quite
correspondingly one might study the
visual system let's say as was done for
a very long period knowing say nothing
about how it's physically how the
principles that we are led to attribute
to this system the let's say analyzing
mechanisms that we are led to attribute
to the system knowing nothing about how
these may be physically realized in our
neural structures and I think it's quite
appropriate to think of the contemporary
study of language as being analogous to
a study of a vision at a period when
it's remained impossible technically or
through the limitations of understanding
technique and so on it was impossible to
determine the actual physical elements
that entered into these systems which
could be studied only in an abstract
fashion there seems to be a special
difficulty yeah I mean we accept the
fact that I can't by introspection
however hard I try say observe the
workings of my own liver
I can't observe it in the act of
secreting bile or whatever it does and
similarly presumably I can't observe
these these language formation faculties
of mine at work
but nevertheless there is an important
difference because if we want to if we
want to investigate the workings of the
liver we can observe other people's I
mean you can bits of live peoples or the
whole of dead people's or animals livers
you can experiment with different inputs
and see what difference they make to the
output and so on and so forth but we
can't do that with animals as far as
their language using faculty is
concerned because they haven't got
which using faculties now doesn't that
shut off from us what is in fact the
chief mode of investigation with all the
other biological faculties that we have
it does very definitely set a stop a
very natural mode of Investigation that
is we are not for ethical reasons we do
not conduct intrusive experiments with
human beings so for example there are
very natural modes of investigation that
suggests themselves at once suppose for
example I propose that language has some
general property and that every human
language must have this property as a
matter of biological necessity if we
were dealing with a defenseless organism
that we were allowed to study say the
way we study monkeys or cats what we
would do is employ the method of
concomitant variation that is that we
would design an artificial environment
let's say in which this principle was
violated and asked whether the system
develops in a normal way under those
conditions first to take one case well
that we can't do in the case of humans
we can't design artificial contrived
environments and see what happens to an
infant in them just as we don't conduct
ablation experiments with humans and
this it's important to recognize that
this limitation imposes no raises no
philosophical issue it what it means is
that we have to be clever in the kind of
work we do because a number of modes of
inquiry are simply excluded there being
as far as we know nothing analogous to
the language faculty in the case of
other organisms but that doesn't mean
that we can't study the problem we can
have to study it more indirectly we
often can't directly move to the
experiments that would give us clear and
precise answers the questions that we
raise but if you think about the model
that I put forth that is that the model
of a of an organ beginning in a
genetically determined initial state and
growing to a mature state of knowledge
then it's obvious that that mature state
of knowledge will be determined by
really by two factors one the initial
genetic endowment and secondly the the
impinging experience
so when and as far as the final state of
knowledge is concerned what's called the
grammar the language the system of rules
and principles that determines what is a
sentence and what it means and how it
sounds and so on that's as far as that
system is concerned we really can get
tremendous amounts of evidence in fact
every utterance that's produced is an
experiment if you like every reaction of
a person to an utterance is an
experiment so there's no shortage of
information concerning the mature state
of knowledge achieved if we can wicket
if we can then discern in the mature
state of knowledge principles and
properties which are in no way presented
in the experience that is present that
is available it's very plausible to
propose those as properties attributable
to the initial state the main thing I
want to do in this discussion professor
Chomsky is go into the implications of
your work for philosophy I don't want to
go pursue you into the nature of the
work itself because that's highly
technical obviously and it's not really
feasible to discuss it in a in a
television program of this kind
let us now as it were assume the truth
of your theories and start looking at
the wider implications of them because
this I'm sure is what will interest our
audience most one consequence of your
theories is that we are as human beings
very very rigidly pre-programmed there
are certain things we can understand
certain things we can communicate and
anything that falls outside that we
simply can't is that so that's certainly
correct so I mean in a way this is a
rather alarming doctrine I mean it it
certainly contravenes the way we want to
feel about ourselves well that may be an
immediate reaction but I think it's it's
not the correct reaction in fact well
it's true that our genetic program
rigidly constrains us I think the more
important point is that the existence of
that rich of that rigid constraint is
what provides the basis for our freedom
and creativity and the reason I mean
it's only because we have pre-programmed
that we can do all the things well and
exactly the point is that if we really
were plastic organisms with
an extensive pre-programming then the
state that our mind achieves would in
fact be a reflection of the environment
which means it would be extraordinarily
impoverished fortunately for us
we're rigidly pre-programmed with
extremely rich systems that are part of
our biological endowment correspondingly
a small amount of rather degenerate
experience allows a kind of a great leap
into a rich cognitive system essentially
uniform in a community and in fact
roughly uniform lism which would have
developed over campus evolutionary ages
through a solution represents the basic
system itself developed over long
periods of evolutionary development we
don't know how it really but for the
individual its present as a result the
individual is capable of with a very
small amount of evidence of constructing
an extremely rich system which allows
him to act in the free and creative
fashion which in fact is normal for
humans we can say anything that we want
over an infinite range other people will
understand us though they've heard
nothing like that before we're able to
do that precisely because of that rigid
programming but short of that we would
not be able to at all what account are
you able to give of creativity if we are
pre-programmed in the way you say then
how is creativity and possibility for us
well here I think one has to be fairly
careful I think we can say a good deal
about about the nature of the system
that is acquired the state of knowledge
that is attained we can say a fair
amount about the biological that the
basis the the basis in the initial state
of the mind for the acquisition of this
system but when we turn to a third
question namely how is this system used
how are we able to act creatively how
can how do we decide - how can we decide
to say things that are new but not
random that are appropriate to occasions
but not under the control of stimuli
when we ask these questions we really
enter into a realm of mystery where
human science at least so far and maybe
in principle does not reek
we can say a fair amount about the
principles that make it possible for us
to behave in our normal creative fashion
but as soon as questions of will or
decision or reason or a choice of action
when those questions arise human science
is at a loss it has nothing to say about
them as far as I can see these questions
remain in the obscurity that in which
they were in classical antiquity would
you also accept this or not that that
having arrived at our present situation
across millions of years of evolution we
must have been going through us a
continual process of innovation and new
adaption and development of new
abilities dispositions organs etc might
we not still be as it were plastic at
the edges might we not still be
developing and evolving genuinely
evolving if only on the margin well I
think one has to be again very cautious
here because well it's true at a very in
a very vague sense to say it's correct
to say that the systems that we now have
have developed through evolution through
natural selection it's important to
recognize how little we are saying when
we say that for example it is certainly
not necessarily the case that every
particular trait that we have is the
result of specific selection that is
that we were selected for having that
trait in fact there are striking
examples to the contrary at least
apparent examples to the contrary say
take for example our capacity to deal
with abstract properties of the number
system now that's a distinctive human
capacity as distinctive as the capacity
for language any normal human effect of
found of pathological levels can
comprehend the properties of the number
system and can move very far and
understanding their deep properties but
it's extremely difficult to believe that
this capacity was the result of specific
selection that is it's hard to believe
that people who were a little better at
proving theorems of number theory had
more children let's say that didn't
happen in fact through most of human
evolution if I can accentuate all of
human evolution this capacity wasn't it
would have been impossible to know that
this capacity
existed the contingencies that allowed
it to be exercised never arose
nevertheless the trait is there the
capacity is there the mental organ if
you like has developed presumably it has
developed as a concomitant of some other
properties of the brain which may have
been selected for example we can
speculate say that you know that the
increase in brain size was a factor in
differential reproduction it's an
evolution and it may be that for
physical law because of physical laws
that we presently don't know that an
increase in brain size under the
specific conditions of human evolution
simply leads necessarily through a
system which has the capacity to deal
with properties the number system well
then that's a matter of physics
ultimately and then the mind that
evolves the brain that evolves will have
this capacity but not because it was
achieved through a selection now I think
it's at least likely that something of
the sort is true of human language and I
mean surely if it if it were
dysfunctional it wouldn't have been
maintained it's obviously functional but
it's a long leap to claim that that the
specific structures of language are
themselves the result of specific
selection and it's a leap that I don't
think is particularly plausible what you
say there about the limitations that
this imposes on us prompts in me the
following thought we are all very used I
think to the idea that in social life
each one of us as individuals tends to
construct a picture of the world around
his own experience and indeed we it's
difficult to see how we could do
anything else we're bound to do that
we've got no alternative but it does
mean that each one of us forms a
systematically distorted view of the
world because it's in because it's all
built up on what accidentally happens to
be the particular and really rather
narrow experience of the individual who
does it now do you think that something
of that kind
applies to man as a whole because of the
reasons implicit in your theory that is
to say that the the whole picture that
mankind has formed of the cosmos of the
universe of the world
must be systematically distorted and
what's more drastically limited by the
nature of the particular apparatus for
understanding that he happens to have
well I think that is undoubtedly the
case but again I would question the use
of the word limited which carries
unfortunate suggestions that is I assume
that one of our faculties one of our
mental organs if you like is let's call
it a science forming capacity a capacity
to create intelligible explanatory
theories in some domain and if we look
at the history of science we discover
that time after time when particular
questions were posed at a particular
level of understanding it was possible
to make very innovative leaps of the
imagination two rich explanatory
theories that presented an intelligible
picture of that sub domain of the
universe often wrong theories as we
later discovered but there's a course
that's followed and this gives this
could have been the case only because we
do have and we in fact share across the
species a kind of a science forming
capacity that is that limits us as you
say but at the same in the same but same
token provides the possibility of
creating explanatory theories that
extend so vastly far beyond any evidence
that's available I mean it's it's very
important to realize that there should
be some obvious say but it's worth
saying that when when it's when a new
theory is created and I don't
necessarily mean Newton I mean even a
small theory what the scientist is
typically doing first of all he has very
limited evidence the theory goes far far
beyond the evidence secondly much of the
evidence that's available is typically
disregarded that is it's put to the side
in the hope that somebody else will take
care of it someday and we can forget
about so at every stage in the history
of science there's even normal science
not you know kuhnian revolutions there's
a high degree of idealization that Joe's
own so their selection of evidence and
distortion of evidence creation of new
theory a confirmation or
or modification of that theory further
idealization these are all very curious
steps and we're capable of nevertheless
we can often make them and make them in
a way which is intelligible to others
doesn't look like some random act of the
imagination and where that's possible we
can we can develop intelligible theories
we can gain some comprehension of the
nature of this aspect of the world now
this is possible only because we are
rigidly pre-programmed again because we
have somehow developed through evolution
or however the specific Faculty of
forming very particular theories of
course it follows at once sir please
follow it's reasonable to assume that
this very Faculty which enables us to
construct extremely rich and successful
theories in some domain may lead us very
far astray and some other domain for
example there may be some you know again
I'm a Martian scientists looking at us
and observing our successes and errors
from a higher intelligence let's say
might be being used to discover that
whereas in some domains we seem to be
able to make scientific progress in
other domains we always seem to be
running up against a blank wall because
our minds are so constructed that we
just can't make the intellectual leap
that's required we can't formulate the
concept we don't have the categories
that are required to gain insight into
that domain do you think that if our
study of our language forming capacity
and hence our cognitive capacities as
you call them our abilities to know and
understand and learn if these studies
that you're pioneering results in an
enormous amount of increased knowledge
of all these human faculties do you
think it's at all likely that that
increased knowledge will enable us to
change and indeed expand the faculties
that I think is extremely unlikely
because I think the faculties are a
biological given we may study the
structure of the heart but we don't do
so because we think it's possible to
replace the heart by another kind of
pump would say which might be more
efficient similarly here I think you if
we ever did gain a real comprehension of
the mental organs
we would not we might that might help us
in cases of pathology marginal cases in
other words but I wouldn't see how that
could have any way at least with our
present science of you know plausible
science of modifying these capacities
what we might do however is games I mean
at least it's in theory imaginable that
we might discover something about the
limits of our science forming abilities
we might discover for example that some
kinds of questions simply fall beyond
the area where we are capable of
constructing explanatory theories and I
think we even maybe now have some
glimmerings of insight into where this
delineation might be between
intelligible theories that fall within
our comprehension and areas where no
such theory is possible well the case
that we discussed before may be one take
take the question of but if you go back
to the you know take back to the early
histories of science of history of
science early origins of science
speculation and people were raising
questions about say the heavenly bodies
and about the sources of human action
well we're asking exactly the same
questions now about the source of human
action there's been no progress we have
no idea how to approach this question
within the framework of science we can
write novels about it but we can't
construct even forth scientific theories
about it we simply have nothing to say
when we asked the question how does a
person make a decision in a certain
manner and not some other manner when
it's a free decision that we just have
no way of dealing with that issue on the
other hand the history of physics let's
say has had substantial advances and
very it's very likely I think that that
super massive difference in progress in
one domain and an absolute blank wall in
another reflects the specific properties
of our science warming capacities we
might even be able to show that someday
if it's true so far we've been rather
talking in this discussion as if all
organized thinking is done in language
but of course that in fact isn't so is
it I mean one can take all kinds of
examples in music is one that appeals to
me very much if you get a composer like
Stravinsky conduct composing a fantastic
complicated and original and needed
revolutionary score like that of the
Rite of Spring for an enormous Orchestra
then he's celebrating at an original and
complicated and very sophisticated level
and he's probably celebrating in as
elaborate away as anybody else's who's
doing anything and what's more he's
creating a structure which is publicly
articulated and so on
and yet words don't come into this
process at any point as far as one could
gather does that fact and other facts
like you lose any threat to your
theories well not really I mean I
in fact quite the contrary my assumption
is that the mind is not a uniform system
that it's a highly differentiated system
in fact like the body it's essentially a
system of faculties or organs and
language is simply one of them I don't
it we don't have to go to the level of
Stravinsky to find examples of thinking
without language I'm sure that everyone
who introspects who thinks about what he
himself is doing will know at once that
much of his thinking doesn't involve
language or say well the thinking of a
cat let's say plainly doesn't involve
language there are other modes of
thought there are other faculties and I
think that the musical faculty is one
one which is particularly interesting I
think because it's extremely likely in
fact here's an area in a sense like
physics that is where very rapid and
rich development took place in a way
which was over a long period of say
Western history in a way which was very
intelligible to others I mean not
immediately but after a short period and
strikingly well there is a striking
feature of the 20th century in this
respect that is that the the the musical
creation of the 20th century I think is
qualitatively different from that of say
the 18th century in that it lacks that
that immediate axis or short term access
that was true of the past I one would
have to do an experiment to prove it but
I have no doubt that if we took a child
of today to children of today let's say
two groups and taught one of them say
Mozart Haydn and Beethoven and thought
the other one Schoenberg and post Ron
Burgundy's 'ok that there would be very
substantial difference in their capacity
to comprehend it and deal with it and
that may reflect in fact if that's
correct it would reflect something about
err err innate musical capacities points
of this nature have been discussed for
some time I remember Paul Hindemith the
about 25 years ago I think and lectures
argued that to violate the tonal
principle and music would be something
like an effort to violate the principle
of gravitation I take it he meant by
that that it was an innate property well
we might say in his prep I don't pursue
the musical analogy too far because I
was using that really only as an
illustration what it illustrates is the
fact that you think we're pre-programmed
in fact a lot of things don't you I mean
no doubt to use gesture or recognize
faces or a common sense view of the
world and so on well every area of human
existence that's even worth studying is
worth studying because rich and complex
structures are developed in a uniform
way otherwise it's not worth studying
and those are precisely the cases where
we expect to have wood to discover
pre-programming that makes possible
these great achievements so in other
words you think that everything that we
do makes manifest our pre programming
games institutions the way we dress the
way we eat everything well here again I
think some cautions necessary for
example take games I'm speculating
obviously but it seems to me reasonable
to suppose that games are designed so as
to be in a sense at the outer limits of
our cognitive capacities we don't make
up games that are in which we are as
skilled as we are in using words let's
say that wouldn't be an interesting game
everybody can do too much what we do it
we make up games like say chess which is
an extraordinarily simple game that has
its rule system it's utterly trivial but
nevertheless we're just not we're not
very good at it as in the case of using
language we're all extraordinarily good
and we're essentially undifferentiated
the borders of our cognitive capacity
than individuals a very similar
intellectual makeup will nevertheless
diverge very significantly in their
ability to deal with these exotic
problem
that's what makes it an interesting game
and in fact I think there are also tasks
that can be constructed that are really
outside our cognitive capacities and in
fact I think there's even a field that's
devoted to the developing such tasks
it's called psychology much of modern
psychology has been concerned to
discover tasks which would yield species
uniform laws that is laws that are
essentially hold across a number of
species or to construct good experiments
that is experiments that have slow
learning curves with regular increments
and so on and so forth and there are
such tasks a maze running in which rats
are about as good as humans and both are
quite terrible and these I think are in
fact precisely tasks that do lie outside
of our cognitive capacities that we do
proceed by trial and error and by
induction and so on but centrally your
whole approach represents a rejection of
the empirical tradition in in philosophy
it doesn't it because I mean the very
fact that you think that the empiricists
are wrong about how we learn must mean
that they're wrong about knowledge and
the nature of knowledge and the nature
of knowledge has been the central
problem in the whole empirical tradition
of philosophy well the classical
empiricist tradition which I think was
the traditions represented let's say
perhaps in its highest form by Hume
seems to me to be a tradition of extreme
importance in that a particular theory
of the origins of knowledge fact of the
science of human nature in humans phrase
was put forth an empirical theory and I
think Hume for example would regard it
as an empirical theory did regard it so
when we investigated I think we discover
that it's just completely false that is
that the mechanisms that he discussed
are not the mechanisms by which the mind
reaches states of knowledge that the
states of knowledge attained are
radically different than the kinds that
he discussed for example for Hume the
mind was in his image a kind of a
theater in which ideas paraded across
the stage and we it therefore followed
necessarily that we could introspect
completely into the contents of our mind
if an idea is not on the stage it's not
in the mind and the ideas may be
connected and associated in fact he went
on and say there isn't even any theater
there's just the ideas in that respect
the image is misleading well that's a
that's a theory and in fact it's a
theory that has had an enormous grip on
the imagination throughout most of the
history of the history of Western
thought for example that that same image
dominates the rationalist tradition as
well where it was assumed that one could
exhaust the contents of the mind by
careful attention you know you could
really develop those clearer and
distinct ideas and their consequences
and so on and in fact even if you move
to someone let's say like Freud with his
a vocation of the unconscious still I
think that a careful reading suggests
that he regarded the unconscious as in
principle act accessible that is we
could really perceive that theater and
stage and the things on it carefully if
only the barriers of repression and so
on could be overcome well if what I've
been suggesting is correct that's just
that's radically wrong I mean even wrong
there's a point of departure
there is no reason at all that I can see
for believing that the the principles of
mental computation that enter so
intimately into our action or our
interaction or our speech to believe
that those principles have are at all
accessible to introspection any more
than the analyzing mechanisms of our
visual system or for that matter the
nature of our liver is accessible to
introspection it seems to me that over
and over again you come back to the same
point that is to say that many of the
particular problems discussed and
theories put forward by philosophers in
the main but also psychologists and
you've just mentioned Freud and in your
writing as you mentioned many others are
in fact theories about physical
processes they are therefore open to
checking by investigation and when you
check my investigation you'll find out
that the theories are wrong and
therefore you are as it were radically
subversive of a lot of very
well-established theories in our
tradition it seems to me that what you
put forward in their place over and over
again in fact as parallel
a rationalist tradition I said in my
introduction to this program that what
I'm always reminded on by your work is
the theories of Kant you seem to me to
be almost redoing in terms of modern
linguistics what Kant was doing do you
accept any truth in that well right not
only accept truth in it but I've tried
to bring it out in a certain way however
I haven't myself specifically referred
to Khan but rather to the primarily to
the 17th century tradition of the
Continental Cartesians and the British
neoplatonist who developed many of the
ideas that are now much more familiar in
the writings of Conte for example the
idea of experience conforming to our
mode of cognition or the well
particularly in the British platanus
Cudworth for example there are I believe
is a rich mine of insight into the
organizing principles of the mind by
which experience is structured in fact I
think that some of the richest
psychological source of psychological
insights that I know and that's the one
it's this tradition that I think that
can be fleshed out and made more
explicit by the kinds of empirical
inquiry that are now possible of course
I think we also have to diverge from
that tradition in a number of respects
I've mentioned one namely the belief
with the contents of the winder open
introspection similarly we there's
certainly no reason to accept the
metaphysics of that tradition to believe
that there's a dualism of mind and body
I mean you can see why the Cartesians
were led to that it was a rational move
on their part but it's not a move that
we have to follow we have other ways of
approaching that question another thing
that I say I mentioned in my
introduction was the fact that you've
made two international reputations the
other one besides linguistics being as a
political activist and it does seem to
me that there is a connection between
these two careers of yours and I want to
put this to you really in the form of a
question
liberalism grew up in the history of
European thought in very close
relationship to empirical philosophy and
scientific method
the battlecry really in all three was
don't accept anything on the say-so of
established Authority look at the facts
and judge for yourself and this was
revolutionary in politics science and
philosophy and because of this
liberalism has always been regarded in
the Western tradition as the main
anti-authoritarian political Creed but
just as you've rejected empiricism
you've also rejected liberalism and you
now say in your writings that whatever
may have been true in the past
liberalism has now become the ally of
authority would you accept that there is
this underlying connection between your
work in linguistics and well to put it
dramatically your opposition to the
Vietnam War well this raises quite a
welter of questions let me begin by
saying something about liberalism which
is a very complicated concept I think
it's correct surely that liberalism grew
up in the intellectual environment of
empiricism and the rejection of
authority and Trust in the evidence of
the senses and so on
however liberalism has undergone a very
complex evolution as a social philosophy
over the years if we go back to the
classics or at least what I regard as
the classics say for example unbolts
limits of state action which inspired
nil and is a true libertarian liberal
classic it was like the the world that
Humboldt was considering which was
partially an imaginary world but the
world for which he was developing this
political philosophy was a post futile
but pre-capitalist world that it was a
it was a world in which there is no
great divergence among individuals in
the kind of power that they have and
what they command let's say but there
was a tremendous disparity between
individuals on the one hand and the
state on the other consequently it was
the task of a liberalism that was
concerned with human rights and equality
of individuals and so on it was the task
of that liberalism
to dissolve the enormous power of the
state which was such a an authoritarian
threat to individual liberties and from
that you develop a classical liberal
theory and say Humboldt sir Mills sense
well of course that is pre-capitalist he
couldn't conceive of an era in which a
corporation would be regarded as
individual that's it or in which such an
enormous in which enormous disparities
and control over resources and
production would distinguish between
individuals on a massive fashion now in
that kind of a society to take the
Humboldt in view is a very superficial
liberalism because while opposition to
state power in an era of such divergence
conforms to Humboldt's conclusions it
doesn't do so for his reasons that is
his reasons lead to very different
conclusions in that case namely I think
his reasons lead to the conclusion that
we must dissolve the authoritarian
control over production and resources
which leads to such divergences among
individuals in fact I think one might
draw a direct line between classical
liberalism and the kind of libertarian
socialism which I think can be regarded
as the as a kind of an adapting of the
basic reasoning of classical liberalism
to a very different social Europe now if
we come to the modern period here
liberalism has taken on a very strange
sense if you think of its history now
now liberalism is essentially the theory
of state capitalism of state
intervention in a capitalist economy
well that is very little relation to
classical liberalism in fact classical
liberalism is what's now called
conservatism I suppose but this new view
I think really is it in my life my view
at least a highly authoritarian position
that is it's one which accepts a number
of centers of authority and control the
state on the one hand agglomerations of
private power on the other hand all
interacting with individuals as
malleable cogs in this highly
constrained machine which may be called
democratic but given the the the actual
distribution of power is very far from
being meaningfully democratic and cannot
be so so my own feeling has always been
that to achieve the classical liberal
ideals for the reasons that led to them
being put forth in a society so
different we must be led in a very
different direction
oh it's superficial and erroneous to
accept the conclusions which were
reached
for a different society and not to
consider the reasoning of it led to
those conclusions the reasoning I think
is very substantially I'm a classical
liberal in the sense but I think it
leads me to be a kind of an anarchist no
I an anarchist socialist and well I'd
love to pursue you down that road and
professor Chomsky but that would be a
new discussion a new program so I think
we must alas in there thank you very
much
