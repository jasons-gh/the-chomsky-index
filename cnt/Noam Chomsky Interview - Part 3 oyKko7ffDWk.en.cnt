Peter bird you should ask your question
hello as a linguist do you think texting
and emailing a dumbing down are methods
of communication and could they have
negative long-term effects well if I can
drop the first three words as a linguist
I have nothing to say about this
linguistics doesn't tell you anything
about it I mean in general the sciences
just don't tell you very much about
matters of human concern they're not
that advanced but as a human being I
have an opinion and I'm sure you do it
texting emailing Twitter and all that
it's obviously been very effective for
all kinds of reasons like what Jane just
described or the January 25th movement
in Egypt that was a to a substantial
extent a you know Twitter type movement
and there are many other examples I mean
that's the way people get organized
communicate and so on that's the way my
daughter talks to her daughter in Japan
let's say that kind of thing I don't
like it very much frankly for exactly
the reason you mentioned it one of the
consequences is that there's a kind of a
cheapening of discourse you know things
that you can't say and whatever it is
200 characters they don't exist well you
know any serious thought about any topic
it's going to take some attention
thought qualifications you know looking
at various aspects of it and so on and
that's excluded by the medium so what
you what tends to happen is you can see
it with activist movements they which
are using these methods very effectively
but there's attendance is kind of like a
pressure there
inherent for them to turn into cults in
which you repeat catechisms you know
things that you can say briefly and
quickly and that don't have
qualifications and don't consider the
opposite you know the considerations
that might might be to the contrary of
the conclusions and so on in general
that's not a good thing and it's it's
not just these new technology I think
that's been happening much more
generally I can see it you know I've
been teaching for sixty years and then
you see differences a young people don't
read anywhere near as much as they used
to
I have friends who teach undergraduate
histories and they tell me that they
simply cannot use the texts that they
used to use thirty years ago students
can understand them you know they look
at the long paragraphs and eyes glaze
over it's not what you're used to
I can see with my own grandchildren you
know they're the stimulus hungry like I
have grandson something far away
high-school student
my daughter brings them over often
Sunday night and he's he's supposed to
do his homework
of course he hasn't done anything all
weekend so he sits down Sunday night
carrying out the activity that he calls
doing his homework he's got a laptop
he has earphones with all kind of
whatever
is going in there alongside the whatever
he's doing on the laptop he's
communicating with about 10 friends you
know about nothing
you know like I'm standing up I'm having
a sandwich or something
and all of this has got to go on at once
no and if it's anything less than that
he gets kind of nervous and jittery well
I think the Twitter texting effect is
contributing to that but I've noticed
that say with my grandchildren emailing
is no good because that's too slow and
too you know too extended so it has to
be something much shorter and when I
said that my daughter communicates with
her daughter by texting or Twitter or
something it's just her daughter won't
my granddaughter won't look at anything
longer than that like emails out you
know and these are negative I think
these are harmful effects that go along
with the very useful effects of the new
technology that's kind of back to the
hammer you know it can be helpful or
harmful and say you I'm sure you know
younger people here are all familiar
with this way weird I am but we're
really moving around on the on these
questions and we're moving from language
and communication next we have Ian Roth
and his question on war crimes Thank You
professor Chomsky my question relates to
politicians and war crimes is it a war
crime when a democratically elected
leader creates a false prospectus for
war you should take a careful look at
recent British law English law after
seven seven you know the attack in
London new laws were passed which are
worth reading carefully
they make it a crime to intentionally
glorify or encourage possible ultimate
acts of terror actually somebody's being
tried right now who runs a bookstore
because in the bookstore there are
there's material from jihad 'is a
material that we all read you want to
understand them you better know what
they say but the charge is it's rated
last night that yeah and by having this
material and distributing it he's
violating British law because it might
encourage somebody to think about
entering into terrorist activities or it
might glorify them and so on well let's
go back to the democratically leader
constructing a false prospectus for war
I mean the aggression if anybody cares
about the Nuremberg Tribunal aggression
was to find their war as the supreme
international crime different from all
other war crimes in that it includes all
of the evil that follows so say take
Iraq the crime wasn't it's just straight
outright war crimes crimes of aggression
but the crime of invading Iraq includes
everything that happened afterwards the
secretary in warfare the destruction you
know the robbing of the museum the
rebels the the millions of people who
fled because life became impossible all
that is part of the Bush Blair etcetera
war crime well did they create a false
prospectus for war you may recall that
when the US and Britain went to war
there was what they call what bush and
Blair and the rest
called a single question there was a
single question later they made up all
kind of other stories but the single
question was will Saddam Hussein give up
his weapons of mass destruction well you
know if you I don't know if that's what
the questioner was thinking of but
that's like a paradigm example of a
false prospectus for war and if you
accept British law at least that's in
calmly worse than distributing books on
terrorism that's laying the basis in the
public mind for major war crimes which
were then executed
is that a were crime I mean I don't
think there's a statement and
international law that says it's a war
crime but if it should be morally
criminal whether it's legally criminal
or not and it's the kind of thing that's
the kind of reason why people should be
participants not spectators why say
WikiLeaks if it helps tell you what
leaders are up to is a very good thing
and why democracy is a good thing real
democracy in which you participate so
you can't be led around by the false
propaganda of leaders who have other
goals in mind
speaking of terror I don't know how many
of you looked at that jokate inquiry but
one of the interesting revelations there
from the forgot her name the woman who's
the head of bridge intelligence whatever
her name is she testified that Britain
and the United States when they were
planning for the war both were aware
that invading Iraq was going to increase
the threat of terror okay actually it
did much more than anyone anticipated
and by about a factor of seven the first
year but what that tells you is that the
leaders who you're electing don't care
about the secure
the population they're willing to
undertake actions which they know are
going to endanger the populations okay
it's not the first time in history that
that's been the case that what I
mentioned about the leaks from the
Ambassador and Pakistan are the same
kind of thing they're taking actions
which they have reason to believe might
lead to a nuclear bomb in London but
they're taking them for other reasons
and in general security of the
population is not a high priority for a
political leadership they have other
things in mind the same on the global
warming issue what the priority is
making profit in the next quarter not
the fate of the species well these are
all reasons for having a functioning
democracy and I think that it comes up
in all of these questions but it comes
up here to our next questioner is Ghaith
LJ you see now before gave us this
question we just want to say thank you
gay because without gays no one would
not be here in Cardiff since gate was
that one I think you asked him to come
and speak and and there will be in soon
David's Hall sold-out with a massive
audience tomorrow but in a very
different kind of environment to the
opportunity to ask these questions
so gate wherever you are the floor is
yours
how can the British academic and
intellect and the ordinary business
person tackle the current political
crises in the UK in the presence of a
right-wing conservative government when
the only credible alternative is a
Labour government that also has
right-wing policies and unfortunately
has got the blood of many Iraqis and
Afghani is on its hands
it's you know it may be the only
political alternative but it's not the
only alternative I mean take a look at
your counterparts and Tahrir Square the
young people who organized the January
25th movement they faced problems much
harsher that a right-wing conservative
government they were facing a brutal
military dictatorship with murderers
security forces torture in prisons you
know no political options and so on
they didn't just sit there they did
something about it and under the much
less harsh conditions a much more benign
conditions at people like us face
there's a lot more that we can do there
are plenty of options it takes effort
you know it's costly anybody who does
become involved in serious activism for
social change reform and so on will
probably pay a cost but their enormous
gains that are possible so what can
reduce an academic intellectuals do
almost anything they feel like they they
may not be praised but they're not going
to be put in prison and tortured it's a
big difference
and Jamie's knee your next question I
know I think you've already kind of
touched upon this but over the course of
your illustrious career have world
affairs being become increasingly
familiar are there are still areas that
seem alien to you about areas that can
still shock and surprise take Twitter
for example totally it's a kind of
depressing question because the answer
is virtually everything
I mean even in the fields in which I've
worked all my life say professionally
the more you learned the less you the
more you realize the less you know I
mean as you what happens it's standard
in the sciences but everywhere else too
you know you you know you you you learn
more you think you're approaching some
kind of a horizon but in fact the
horizon is receding and the more you
learn the more you see that horizon is
very far away that's true and I could
give you examples from my own field but
it's true in the core sciences now it
takes me physics you know the star of
the sciences and they got some problems
like one problem is they can't find 90%
of the mass energy in the universe it's
it's postulated because otherwise
nothing works but can't find it and you
can't find any evidence that is there
I'm a pretty serious problem I remember
about 10 years ago this one was finally
overcome about 10 years ago the big the
Hubble telescope you know which is out
in space it was bringing in tons of
information about outer space and there
was a time when it turned out that the
that had very powerful evidence that the
universe was considerably younger than
its oldest stars that's pretty serious
problem and anyway in any field you are
that's what you find all the time when
you turn to human affairs
you know our understanding is extremely
thin almost everything is you're
learning all the time from other people
from you know your children your friends
your enemies so depths of human
possibilities and capacities that we can
barely perceive
when you look at different fields I mean
sometimes when I'm having a boring
interview on the telephone and I'm
trying to think about something else
because the questions are too boring and
I start looking around the room where I
work you know full of books piled up to
the sky and so and I do all different
kinds of topics and then start
calculating how many centuries would I
have to live reading 24 hours a day
every day that week to make a dent in
what I'd like to learn about things it's
pretty depressing so the answer to the
question I think is you know we have
little bits of understanding glimpses a
little bit of light here and there but
that tremendous amount of darkness which
is a challenge you know it being life
would be pretty boring if we understood
everything better if we don't understand
anything and know that we don't
that's the and our last question for
this evening comes from Lynne Reynolds
what advice would you give to the
members of a young democracy such as the
National Assembly for Wales well I think
the I'm sure you have better advice than
I do but I mean the best advice would be
to try to make those words real make it
a real functioning democracy a democracy
in which the population participates in
which people understand in which they
deliberate in which they work things out
they develop a sea of the view of the
future they implement their own
decisions through their representatives
elected recallable representatives those
are ways of becoming a real democracy
and I can make a huge difference and the
stakes are very high
I mean we're at a point of human
existence which never existed in there's
nothing like it in the past there really
aren't decisions now
that will determine the fate of the
species that's never been true in the
past I'm there were plenty of problems
you know famine the wars destruction but
we're now at the point where whether the
species will persist is a question
that's quite a heavy burden and it has
to be undertaken quite seriously if you
want a final grim forecast one of the
great modern biologists grand old man of
American biology Ernst Meier died
recently at age 100 he he was once in a
debate with Carl Sagan you may know the
astrophysicist they were in debate about
the chances that there's intelligent
life elsewhere in the universe and Sagan
approached it from the point of view of
an astrophysicist he said you know we
can kind of calculate how many planets
there are out there that are kind of
more or less like ours and how long
they've been there and we understand a
little bit about evolution so chances
are they've developed intelligent life
admire appointed approach different
point of view biologist he said look we
have one example earth it's the only
example we know there have been tens of
billions of species on earth we and we
can we know something about their
history and their fate and he said
they're a couple of generalizations we
can draw one generalization as he put it
is that it's better to be stupid than
smart and what he meant is but there's a
notion of biological success means
basically how many of you are there a
species is successful if there's a lot
of them you were around so who's
successful
well bacteria which mutate very quickly
and beetles which are stuck in a
particularly
they're doing great on the other hand if
you
look up if you go up the scale of what
we call intelligence they're fewer and
fewer creatures and the species lives it
has a much shorter lifespan so there
very few big mammals around partly
because humans killed must them but even
apart from that the only big mammals
that of which there are many are the
ones that are domesticated by humans in
fact there are a few humans around until
pretty recently times ten thousand years
ago it was sparsely a sparse population
and that's nothing in evolutionary terms
so his point is well look intelligence
is apparently a lethal mutation it's
what we call intelligence it's it's it's
harmful biologically he then ended by
saying that if you look at the species
we know about on earth or roughly their
average survival span is about a hundred
thousand years that's a it's getting to
about a hundred thousand years so we
have a choice as to whether to falsify
that generalization or not but it's a
real generalization and we're thinking
about right Noam Chomsky thank you very
much I think it's interesting just on
that analogy the only climate change
joke I know is actually and it does mix
with your your astrophysicist and your
biologist it's two planets talking to
each other
and one says I feel really itchy and I
don't know what's wrong and the other
says what is it do you know what it is
and the first one says it's called homo
sapiens and the next planet says don't
worry it won't last
so on that note on your behalf
can I thank Noam Chomsky for an
extraordinary evening
we've ranged from climate change to
WikiLeaks Pakistan small countries
leadership Arab world Egypt Tunisia
Bahrain religion nuclear weapons oil
language tools for communication a
short-term versus long-term ism in
politics Aristotle's politics inequality
war crimes British laws on terrorism how
many of you knew about the British laws
on terrorism the Chilcott inquiry it's
been a real privileged it's been
immensely enlightening and we're very
proud that you chose to join that this
evening ladies and gentlemen professor
