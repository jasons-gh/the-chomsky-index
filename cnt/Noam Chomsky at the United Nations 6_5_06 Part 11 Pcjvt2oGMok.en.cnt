what will happen to Hamas in the long
run I don't know I mean they have a lot
of popular support undoubtedly but
there's a whelming popular support
within the Palestinian territories for
something like the international
consensus to state settlement on the
international border of the kind that
the PLO formally accepted in December
1988 I mean we might remember what
happened then you know the people who
hold the club's dislike history for them
history's bunk you know it's antiquated
boring let's go on the people are beaten
by the club's generally think that
history is important and it is and
people want to understand the world
should be with the victims on this yes
history is important you can understand
why the powerful want a ticket dustbin
but we should so what happened when the
Palestinian national council accepted a
two-state so basically the international
consensus the overwhelming international
consensus in December 1988 well there
was a coalition government in Israel a
seaman Paris and you suck show me your
coalition government they came out a few
months later I think was May 89 with an
official statement in which they said
there can be no additional Palestinian
state between Israel and Jordan the word
additional means Jordan is a Palestinian
state so there can be no additional
Palestinian state between them and the
fate of the territories will be settled
in accord with the guidelines of the
State of Israel okay that was their
official response to the Palestinian
acceptance of the international
consensus what did the US do this is the
bush number one administration the Bush
number one administration reacted by
accepting it completely in what's called
the Baker plan State Department's Baker
plan James Baker plan of December 1989
which is which endorsed the Israel
a government proposal completely the
only reporting of this year that I get
fined was that they said the State
Department said well there can be free
there should be free elections there
should be free elections in Palestine
with most of the educated sector in jail
and the elections should at place only
within the only topic that can come up
in the elections is the Israeli plan
that'll be free election so that shows
we're interested in democracy promotion
and there was a lot of applause to the
Bush administration for promoting
democracy a see if you can find
something else I mean as I wrote at the
time and I'll repeat it now it's as if
someone were to propose that there can
be no additional Jewish state in the
former Palestine because already is a
Jewish state namely New York City with a
Jewish mayor and you know a lot of rich
Jews and so on and so forth and if
somebody were to say that we think it's
a reversion to Nazism but when we say it
it's very forthcoming and shows our love
of democracy and so on professor Chomsky
you've several times referred to the
Israeli barrier wall I've seen the maps
of that wall and goodness does it's got
some funny little squiggles in there but
you don't have it here on your map on
page 180 I've certainly never seen this
whole corridor straight to the Jordan
east of alia do min how is it you
omitted the root of that barrier wall
from this map sir because that's not a
root of the barrier wool that's if you
take a look at the caption you'll see
that that is the Israeli government
proposal at Camp David in the year 2000
that's the Israeli government proposal
final proposal at Camp David in the year
2000 I took it from an article by the
leading israeli specialist on the topic
run boondock who's the director general
of the Paris
foundation on international peace in Tel
Aviv this happens to be an article in
English which is why i quote took the
map it's an survival the british
international affairs journal he and
show re le who's one of the top
negotiators for israel they published a
very long article about it but that
one's in hebrew so i paraphrased it in
the same chapter and you know didn't
didn't cite it because i can't cite a
hebrew article i mean i cited it but
couldn't quote it literally so i
paraphrased it so yeah that's discussion
it's that is in the context of the
discussion of the us-israeli proposals
at Camp David in 2000 which were being
held as magnanimous and magnificent than
Palestinians don't accept them shows the
terrible and so on and so forth on there
is discussion if you read further in the
book of the later maps that are proposed
I didn't actually give the map but
there's a reference thereto a long
article and Haaretz which did give a map
if you look it up on Google it's in
Hebrew you will find the proposed nap I
think as of I think it's october two
thousand five but if you look further
you'll see the reference there and all i
have to do is go to the internet and
you'll find the map it's not identical
with the proposal in the year 2000 but
it's basically the same principle except
more extreme because it not only breaks
palestine occupied territories through
the model there two major salience
remember there's the MA Adam msel
salient the one that goes east to
Jerusalem that's the one that in
boondocks map goes all the way to the
Jordan Valley which Israel's going to
keep as they've announced so that's one
that centrally breaks the southern part
from the rest and there's a second
setting in that goes through Arielle the
city of REO farther north and the
separation will now goes around that and
farther to the east and that effectively
separates the central ghetto the Enclave
whatever you want to call it from the
northern one so you get three on clays
if you have a look at the
their implementations of the separation
wall you can find them if you look at
the b'tselem reports for example they're
all in the internet you'll see that it
also separates all of them from some
little corner of East Jerusalem so it
basically breaks the the outcome is
exactly what I described it a lot of
Israeli and other authorities on the
outcome may run benveniste Harvard
University's Sarah Roy and others and
yeah that's a description of where the
situation stood as of the time that the
book went to press but you can find the
maps I the map that I included was in a
discussion of the Camp David proposal
and the falsification of them here so I
didn't see a single newspaper anywhere
which reported the Israeli maps in fact
I'll tell you something work more
interesting neither it's very hard to do
a LexisNexis search for maps you know
it's a no easy way to do that it takes
resources which I don't have but nobody
in the United States and a lot of people
were looking could find any map in the
press at the time of Camp David any map
which showed exactly what is being
proposed there was a lot of effusive
rhetoric about how forthcoming it is and
magnanimous and wonderful well it's an
easy way to determine that look at the
map but the trouble is to look at a map
you had to do it carry out a research
project so i actually did I looked at
the Israeli maps at the time and wrote
about them but for the population of the
United States there's no way to do that
I don't know about other countries but
as far as I can tell they weren't
published elsewhere either and this one
was published but it was in a in a
strategic analysis journal serious
strategic analysis journal in England
