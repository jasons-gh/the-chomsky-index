be cautious about trying to sketch out
the nature of a future society and too
much detail it's not that it can't be
done it can be done it can be done in
interesting ways
different ways and has been done but I
think the real question is to what
extent is it important to do it at the
what extent is it important to just try
an experiment and chip away at existing
structures and so on actually another
problem which I think must be faced is
that at any particular point in human
history people have not understood what
is oppression it's something you learn I
mean I get back to my say parents and
grants that they my grandmother she
didn't think she was oppressed by being
in a super patriarchal family where the
father would walk down the street and
not recognize his daughter when she came
because he not supposed to not consider
nothing she was is you know not that
your daughter she didn't feel like a
pressure that just felt like the way
life works I mean what psychic effects
it had internally that's a complicated
question but as anyone involved in any
kind of activism notice say that when
it's moving I mean one of the first
tasks is to get people to understand
that they're living under conditions of
oppression and domination it isn't
obvious no and who knows what forms of
oppression and domination you're just
accepting without even noticing them and
at some further stage of self
enlightenment and communal understanding
we'll recognize those are things we have
to do we can't plan for them we don't
know that link to that and Emma Goldman
a seeker older and feared the thought we
may not be enemy
in resolution what became very
influenced by I think Gustav Landau who
talked about that the state isn't just
out there is inside us that we have to
become ourselves as free as we can be
in capitalism that in fact that them she
was always worried that there may be
chance that people won't be ready for
revolution and that there is a way of
developing the politics of the personal
so maybe more people could be ready to
experience that life as possible it's
quite true and then people in fact there
are you know the people understand this
the best are those who are carrying out
the control and domination in the more
free societies like the United States
and England where popular struggles have
won a lot of freedom of leaders in the
state has limited capacity to coerce is
very striking that it's precisely in
those societies that elite groups the
business world state managers and so on
recognized early on that they're going
to have to develop massive methods of
control of attitude and opinion because
can't control people by force anymore
and therefore you have to modify their
consciousness so they don't perceive
that they are living under conditions of
alienation and oppression subordination
and so on in fact that's what I mean you
know probably a couple of trillion
dollars a year spent on this in the
United States very self-consciously I
mean from the framing of television
advertisements for two-year-olds to the
neck to what you taught in graduate
school economics programs it's designed
to create a kind of a consciousness of
subordination and also it's also
intended specifically in
obviously to suppress normal human
emotion so normal human emotions are
sympathy in solidarity I mean not just
for people and if it's all stranded
golfing it is it's there's just a normal
reaction of people if you go back to say
the classical political economists
people academ Smith this was escape of
Randall's the core of human nature and
societies going to deal with this well
you know one of the main concentrations
of advertising and education is to drive
that out of your mind
