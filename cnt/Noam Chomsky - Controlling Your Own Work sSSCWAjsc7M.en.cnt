okay I mean the principle as far as I
can see goes right back to the
Enlightenment you know like if you go
back to classical and lighten months
thought I'm not talking about Adam Smith
and you know Jefferson and those guys I
the sort of core idea is people have a
right to control their own work you know
okay that the that if a person here I'll
quote some standard formula back in an
18th century you know leading heroes of
the Enlightenment is if a person works
on it if a person does beautiful work
under external command meaning for wages
we may admire what he does but we
despised what he is because not for
human being okay that goes all the way
through classical liberal thought and
lighten men thought I mean you know
Alexis de Tocqueville says under wage
labor the art advances the artisan
declines now you find this going right
into the working class movements and
Lowell and Lawrence I think that's just
natural I wouldn't try to convince
anybody oh but it seems to me if you
think about it yeah why should you work
on command I mean if you work on command
you're some kind of slave now why not
work because it's coming out of your
needs and interests I mean like cheap
for me to say I'm going to fancy
University in a science department and I
can do that one of the nice things about
being in the Sun in Sciences
offense/defense universities you really
do have workers control I'm to a very
large extent we control what we do you
know want to work on this topic I work
on that topic I mean you got to sell it
to funders and this and that but the
degree of workers control at the elite
level is quite substantial I mean that's
why it's such a privilege to be in a
science department you know enormous ly
privileged existence forget the money if
they pay you one-tenth the amount of
money it would still be a much better
existence than working on command now I
think people do know that
you know I don't think that these
enlightenment ideas are hard to grasp I
think people know that if you work on
under external control you may despise
admire what the person does but despise
what he is because his labor you know
the sort of central part of your life is
being done at somebody else's orders and
you're not controlling the way it's done
or why it's done or how it's used or
anything else well you can't have every
individual controlling every single
thing but that's why you have democratic
structures because people control things
together you know okay I I don't know
how to I wouldn't try to convince
anybody of this because I frankly just
don't believe that everyone doesn't know
it I think maybe I'm sentimental but it
seems to me if you sort of cut away
waves of you know layers of distortion
and delusion these things that we're
considered pretty obvious 200 years ago
still obvious
