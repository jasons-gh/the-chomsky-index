to be very great and it seems really to
to have deep roots in in the American
psyche what do you think the basis for
this is well from my perspective I think
it's in a kind of conditioned reflex
it's been building up in this country
ever since the Bolshevik Revolution in
Russia in 1917 1918 there may be some
legitimate reasons why people object to
communism but I think that the broad
kind of fear that we have in my view is
it as a conditioned reflex that sort of
covers up what our own country's been up
to during that period it seems to me
it's pretty obvious that the rationale
of the American government for pushing
through more and more money to buy
weapons you know the influence on
Congress is that quote fear military
fear of the Soviet Union actually there
- as far as I can see there are two
forces in the world that are attempting
to carry out the in my view quite
ludicrous attempt to identify the Soviet
Union with communism one is the Soviet
leadership itself which is trying to
exploit the the positive image of the of
the egalitarian communist tradition for
their own benefit and the other is the
United States the American propaganda
system which is which also would like to
undermine that egalitarian vision by
associating it with Russian
totalitarianism but I don't think that
we should and you're right I mean this
leads to a situation in which the values
of the egalitarian socialist tradition
the libertarian egalitarian socialist
tradition are associated in the American
mind with the brutal and repressive
Soviet state which in my view has
nothing whatsoever to do with communism
or anything no connection with it and
these things I think very much should be
dissociated so I wouldn't think that I
don't for example I think the American
people are very good reason everyone has
good reason to fear the Russian state
which is a violent and
brutal autocracy no I don't know that we
should spend our time trying to argue
about the definition I would agree with
Noam in a pure sense but I think in
practical political terms they're still
as seen as a threat of Soviet Communism
in terms of American military informed
yeah you're right but I think we have to
separate out the various strands in that
threat it's perfectly true that the
United States or at least you know the
American leadership from the American
ideological system have been very
strongly opposed to what they call
socialism but of course they're opposed
to many other things too for example
they've often been opposed to fascism
you know we went to war with fascist
States they were opposed to national
capitalism in Europe I mean they were at
the United States has been opposed to
democracy for example we were opposed to
democracy to a moody overt style regime
in Guatemala and in fact there's a
general principle of which the
opposition to so-called socialism is
just one special case namely the United
States as opposed natura Lee to any
attempt on the part of any society to
use its resources for its own purposes
instead of to integrate itself into what
we call an open world system which means
a system that's open through American
economic penetration and political
control if any society deviates from
that whether it's capitalist fascist
communist you know democratic or
whatever the United States will be
opposed to it it's very handy to use the
quote Soviet threat or the phrase
communist threat to cover up their
efforts to protect American hegemony
everywhere in the world we got our we've
got some 2,000 bases all around the
world the Russians have nothing like
that if you came down from Mars it would
be our country would be seen as the
expanding power but the American mindset
is just the opposite of that we see the
Soviet Union there the threat out there
and we're just minding our own business
we've brought up a number of times the
question of life in the Soviet Union
repressive Society various words have
been used to describe it is this a given
in other words are we all in agreement
that the Soviet Union is a very
repressive Society descent is totally
stifled its authoritarian totalitarian
absolutely no freedoms
you know in that society is that an act
I don't think it's it's it's a very
difficult kind of question if you're an
ordinary worker and you know then then
things may not be quite so bad but if
you try to go beyond that and you run
into a bureaucracy you run into all
kinds of constraints on what you can do
if you're prepared just to be an
ordinary John Doe or not cause too many
problems you may be alright what because
one of the things the Russians do do
which which is important to them is to
say there are a different set of Rights
in their country whether this question
of medical rights whether the treatment
is good or bad it has to be judged
differently but at least they espouse
that they say full employment now of
course there are some people who are
unemployed if you're a dissident you can
be unemployed and then there's an
unemployment compensation because by
definition there's no unemployment so
what you need unemployment compensation
for so for you that can be bad so in
those areas the Russians indeed are kind
of there's like a social contract which
says we'll take care of your elemental
economic needs now we don't do that too
well in this country and you know one of
the biggest strains that Russians keep
throwing up to me is how can in such a
rich country like the United States
tolerate unemployment and that's a hard
that's not an easy question to answer if
there's an answer at all but when you go
beyond that I mean the Russian system is
a very strict one and you're not allowed
much deviation and if you if you want to
step out of line you're going to find
that that's you're subject to all kinds
of pressure and possibly a jailor you
know it's not to say that things are
free in this country but but in the
Soviet Union there's much much greater
fear if you go to this at somebody's
home and they don't have authorization
before and you walk in you don't talk
because they're feared that somebody
will hear you speaking English or
Russian with an accent it's a very
frightening kind of thing so I mean that
that is a problem that exists in every
way every one of these criticisms have
some validity from my perspective the
nuclear arms race is just going to make
matters worse I mean I think there's
there's historical reason for the Soviet
Union to be fearful on the West there
was as I said earlier there was the
counter-revolution in the beginning
there was a whole period and we had the
atom bomb they didn't have it and they
felt they were being intimidated you
know whole series of incidents where
there is this fear
the West and I would say that there
could perhaps be a solidarity movement
as in Poland in the Soviet Union in 15
years if we had genuine coexistence in
d'etat because I imagine Soviet workers
like polish workers you know it sort of
fed up with the top-down stuff so I I
don't know that we need to argue in
basically that things are most Americans
would not like to live in the Soviet
Union
maybe you're a black teenager in Detroit
out of work you know it might look
pretty good to be in a place where
there's no unemployment and you can go
to school and out join the army and so
forth but be that as it may I would say
that that that what the problem we run
into is the Soviet Union has been on the
defensive that the repression the
possibility of intervention along its
frontier all of that is aggravated by
the American initiatives in keeping the
arms race going because it seemed to me
the initiative of the arms race has come
from the West from the beginning and
continues to come from the West and mr.
Reagan criticizes the Soviet Union for
all preps of good reasons but this
policies in my view are almost
calculated to reinforce and aggravate
and make the situation worse well I
think rust has made has distinguished
things properly that ought to be
distinguished on the one hand there's
the question of what kind of society the
Soviet Union is and I think we were I
doubt if either of us would disagree in
any serious way with what marshal just
said you know it's a highly repressive
society which has a kind of social
contract that puts a floor under certain
kinds of suffering okay that's the kind
of society it is separate question is
what kind of a threat it poses those are
separate tirely separate questions I
mean you could have the most brutal
murderous Society internally which just
wouldn't happen to be a threat out
outside you have the freest it's in fact
it through history there has been no
correlation between but I can detect
between the internal freedom of the
society and its violence and aggression
abroad for example England was the
freest country in the world in the 19th
century and in India it acted like the
Nazis didn't you know the United States
is the in my view the most open
politically speaking for getting social
issues and so on it's the most open and
free society in the world and it also
has the most brutal record of violence
and aggression in the world now these
things are just uncorrelated now if you
look at the Soviet Union
it seems to me yes it is a repressive
and
that you know the scent is suppressed
and it my view to dungeon kind of a
dungeon with a certain degree of social
services not and it is also a threat
it's a threat to it to the government
it's a threat to its own population it's
a threat that in fact anyone within its
reach but its reach doesn't happen to be
very long I mean it reaches far shorter
than we claim it to be so for the
population of the Soviet Union for
Eastern Europe for Afghanistan the
Soviet Union is a real threat and I
don't see how anybody can question that
now the other hand the United States has
created the image of a Soviet threat
just for the same reason that they
create an image of an American threat as
a way for us to justify intervention and
aggression in our own domains and in
fact if you look over the history of the
Cold War I think this is transparent
take any incident of the Cold War you
know from the American intervention in
Greece in 1947 up to today in the
choreography and you will find that
every single time a Soviet threat has
been created and usually fabricated to
justify American intervention and
incidentally they play precisely the
same game we started off though talking
about the internal system in the Soviet
Union the degree to which it's a
repressive society because that's
certainly the perception of most
Americans but in what sense if any does
that is that related to its behavior
these are the other nations as well as
its own people because for example I
think many people believe you can't
trust the Russians they never they never
abide by treaties they never keep their
promises they're really not a nation
like other nations they're not part of
the community of nations there there is
about trying this the the Russians don't
keep their promises because they are a
nation like other nations in fact the
fact is anyone who believes the promises
of any nation state is out of their
minds or just doesn't know anything
about history and that includes us and
every other one thinks I mean you know
States follow their promises if it's in
their interest to do so and the the
point is to try to create a system of
shared interest which will bring about a
certain degree of observance through
international
now if we look at it that way then it
seems to me the Russian record is
certainly no worse than air it's in fact
it's pretty good in terms of arms
control because I think the Soviet
garment seized that's in its interest to
observe those treaties and the salt one
trade even salt - so mr. Reagan's anyway
the other day maybe they weren't keeping
some of the salt two provisions even
though it's not been formally ratified I
think both sides you know for pragmatic
prudent reasons have been living up to
it I think norm is absolutely right in
fact mr. Reagan right now is violating
our solemn agreements to both the
Organization of American States and the
UN with this business in Nicaragua which
is just typical of how big power states
operate I would say that that the Soviet
position is to argue a point from the
very beginning has been a defensive one
essentially that they from the very
beginning felt under duress from the
West that they insisted after World War
two of occupying all those countries
around their European perimeter and
they've been very tough there as they've
been pointed out in Section Avakian
Hungary Afghanistan is on their frontier
and that along that line there's no
doubt there's must have be criticised if
we criticize the internal repression but
both of those things I think get
confused in the American mind with this
idea of a Soviet military threat the
United States you know can watch the
arguments go back to Afghanistan for
example or Poland and I think you could
admit all of the negative things and
still argue that their whole position
militarily has been one of reacting and
responding to the West even today their
leaders say we will never first use a
nuclear weapon and mr. Reagan says no
mr. Reagan brings up the whole Star Wars
concept now about ER space they have
been pressing against that so I doesn't
mean we should need to discuss this
issue as to whether or not it isn't true
that the threat and the initiative and
the arms race has come from the United
States rather than the Soviet Union but
that I don't think that's the only issue
involved I mean but I don't so the
Russians indeed do tend to be defensive
about their perimeter although
Afghanistan is again another issue but
but I don't think it's fair to say
they've only been concerned just about
their perimeter I mean the the best
illustration of my mind was Khrushchev's
attempt to put the missiles in Cuba that
I think Americans look
as going outside but that's not to say
that we haven't been done the same thing
to them it's a question of how do the
Americans perceive it in other words the
Russians are not innocuous there's
another problem involved and that is
that that is as concerned as I am about
our military-industrial complex
I'm equally or even more concerned about
the Soviet military industrial complex
because I think it's more powerful let
me just make introduce a qualification I
don't agree with you about the Cuban
Missile Crisis I think that was a
perfect example of a defensive move and
maybe could go into that but let's
okay well that's defensive because in
fact what the Russians were trying to do
is to counter an overwhelming advantage
and missiles that that they knew that we
knew there was after penkovsky's maybe
we should put that aside but aside from
that I think your point is not only
right but it's exactly what we ought to
be talking about if you look at the
history of the arms race there's just no
doubt that the United States had the
initiative but I don't but the reason
for that I think it's very simple we're
a more powerful and more technologically
advanced country so of course we're
going to always have the more advanced
military technology now the important
point that you made Marshall I think
that I'd like to but I certainly agree
with you thought you were going to be
isolated but you're not I think that the
the main thrust the main pressure for
militarization and the arms race in the
Soviet Union comes from the internal
dynamics of the society and I think once
we dissociate our discussion from what
in my view are kind of irrelevant
considerations like whether nations
abide by their States abide by their
treaties and so on no of course they
don't and we ask ourselves what are the
concrete situation what is the concrete
situation today I think what we see is
that the United States is deeply
committed to a massive program of
domestic militarization for the same
kinds of reasons that drove it in 1961
and that drove it in 1950 and that have
nothing to do with any perceived
international threat we ought to
understand that if we want to know I
mean I think it's very clear I think
it's the Reagan administration came is
the programs that the Reagan
administration is following were in fact
proposed in late 1978 but they couldn't
be pushed through Congress at that time
Reagan extended them and accelerated
them and they're absolutely classical in
the American system when there is a
domestic repression in the United States
when there's a domestic reset
in the United States yeah the standard
reaction is to is to turn to the any in
fact let me make it more general any
modern industrial society it racket has
recognized since the 1940s that the way
to deal with internal economic problems
is through state intervention I mean the
institutional structures of American
society happened to be such that there
is no coordinated state planning we
don't have the system that they have in
Japan where there's a government
ministry which deals with you know with
highly centralized foci of Industry and
brings them together and makes a
long-term economic plan we don't we
don't have the institutional structure
for that we have a different
institutional structure our
institutional structure as its developed
since the Second World War is that the
technique by which the government
stimulates production is by creating a
state guaranteed market another
perception I think that the great many
Americans have is that the goal of
Soviet foreign and military policy is
really world domination and that's
really what it's all about and it's a
fear that Americans have that this is
indeed the the goal of Soviet policy is
this true
I think that one of the things one of
the misperceptions that our americans
have is that they were soviet union is
just quit and like a vacuum cleaner
running over one country after another
but they do the same kinds of things and
big powers do that we've done but that
doesn't mean again that that people sit
back and saying well whatever they do is
ridiculous
look I mean the fact of the matter is
that the Russians and their
international behavior behave very much
like any other power including us I mean
every Power greater small tries to
extend the influence of its the extent
of its degree to coerce and control and
penetrate markets and so on and so forth
get resources we happen to be the
world's most powerful force in the early
post-war period we were overwhelmingly
the world's most powerful force and
therefore the United States did in fact
we can easily document this both in the
documentary record in the historical
record the United States did in fact set
forth on a policy of global domination
and it succeeded to a surprising extent
since that period the and the Russians
did so also in their much smaller spirit
now since that period this bipolar
system has in fact eroded I mean other
powers have developed Europe Japan
element to the third world and in fact
the degree of the two super powers to
coerce and control us in our huge
domains and them and they're smaller
domains that has declined one may
readily agree the Soviet system is
totalitarian but that there's a lot of
illusions among the ordinary Americans
that if we go somewhere in the world
we're out to promote democracy this is
the Reagan line I would say that from
what I've observed in living in Asia and
in observing what's going on in Latin
America this is simply not true this is
another one of those rhetorical
statements that helps to build up
support for US policy that should be
challenged that that the wall street
journal had a report an article urging
us corporation to invest in East Asia
and you know what the rationale was is a
beautiful youthful ism that Korea of
Thailand Philippines they have firm
political management this rationale of
the American mission in the world is
being benevolent and democratic I think
that has to be also taken issue with
well we could point out that every again
it is quite general every society
perceives itself or tries to make it
public perceive itself as benevolent I
mean the British were carrying the white
man's burden and the French had a
civilizing mission and the Russians are
doing their internationalist duty when
they endured when they invade
Afghanistan and the United States is
preserving democracy and all of this and
we're as much interested in democracy as
the Russians are interested in socialism
in fact we you know over and over again
have overthrown democratic regimes if
they didn't do the kind of thing we
wanted them to do I mean there has study
after study has revealed the obvious
namely that American support and aid
correlates with essentially with
improvement of the investment climate if
a country is willing to open itself to
air penetration and control our access
to resources allow our corporations to
repatriate profits and so on we will
support them doesn't matter what kind of
regime they have given what we've said
about you know the goals of Soviet
foreign military policy
how how do you how do you respond to the
situation in Central America in terms of
Soviet either influence or Soviet active
involvement
you know this discussion reminds me of
you know the standard joke about have
you stop feeding your wife
I mean there's a presupposition here
which is so grotesquely false that even
answer your question is impossible I
mean it's as if there was a discussion
going on in the Soviet Union where they
asked what's the extent of American
intervention in Eastern Europe well okay
maybe they have discussions about that
and if we looked at them we would laugh
I mean okay maybe there's some
intervention in Eastern Europe but
that's not the problem in Eastern Europe
and the problem in Eastern Europe is
Russian domination now take a look at
Latin America
I mean Latin America has been subjected
to American supported us supported
terrorism and violence to a degree that
is I mean unspeakable you know I mean in
in 1916 was to forget about history in
in 1961 the Kennedy administration made
one of the most important decisions in
modern history which almost nobody in
the United States knows about namely
they changed the mission of the Latin
American military from hemispheric
defense presumably against the Martians
the internal security meaning war
against their own populations and that
decision led to a spread of a plague of
bloodshed and repression and torture and
violence over Latin America that has no
no precedent in the whole bloody history
of the continent as country after
country was turned over to national
security faced with a kind of a Nazi
model and I mean that quite literally
under with constant American
intervention and support now that we
look at that history and then we asked
what is the extent of Russian
intervention in Latin America one of the
things that it's true that we've done
all these other things which really
deserve to be criticized at the same
time we've done some other things which
you know you simply overlook with which
indeed are are worthwhile we have tried
some economic aid and then sometimes yes
for example in Afghanistan
with anything then we talk about Russian
aggression
you're not the fact that they have on
the side done some decent things to try
to win people over of course they do
sure okay but I mean the point is that
there was there was a view of Russian
interference in Latin America and and in
South America itself against in some
cases the legitimate regimes which
weren't always wrong I mean you know
that these countries have problems they
have economic problems and indeed any
kind of society in the third world
generally has problems almost by
definition this is they're not strong
democracies they've got economic growth
problems and they lend themselves to
curricular criticism and pressure on
either side let me just raise one or
that one other thing that that you know
as Americans we really do give our
country a hard time deservedly so for
the most part wish that were true
what the problem in the United States is
that we failed to criticize American
policy the amount of real critic to
critical analysis of American policy is
minuscule in the United States and what
there is can never reach a mass audience
one of the the the perceptions that is
being suggested at the present time is
that that one way to demonstrate that
the Soviets do have as a goal in their
foreign military policy world domination
is the size of the military that it's
not just a defensive type military it's
also offensive and in fact we're told
that the Soviets are really militarily
superior to the United States at the
present time so what about the the
Soviet military first of all is it true
would you say that the Soviet military
capacity is superior to that of the
United States and the president asked
the Joint Chiefs were asked at every
session of Congress constantly they
asked them well would you trade the
American military system for the Russian
military system and the answer is a
horse left we should tell the truth
about the Russians we should understand
how repressive they are we should
understand how brutal they are and how
aggressive they would be if they could
get away with it which they can't in
most places but if you look at the
Russian military system the fact is that
it's it's it's character is wildly
exaggerated American propaganda and in
fact all of this has been exposed it's
been exposed over and over again and has
any exposure has no effect so for
example take the way in which take the
wave
for one thing taketake the way in which
the the United States determines the the
character of the Soviet military system
this is this is such a you know this is
so farcical that people know about it
just laughs I mean what we do is the CIA
calculates what's called the dollar
equivalent of the Russian military
expenditures that means we ask how much
would it cost us to produce the Russian
military system and the answer is on a
huge number the reason that some huge
number is that they're so hopelessly
inefficient I mean that's a
labor-intensive system backward
labor-intensive system and for us to
create a backward labor-intensive system
would be extremely expensive I mean for
example if you ask the question what
would it cost the dollar equivalent of
the Russian agricultural systems suppose
somebody asked that what would it cost
us to duplicate the Russian agricultural
system well the answer is it would
bankrupt us you know if we had if we had
to pay you know 100 million peasants to
the farm and efficiently
it would just be bankrupt but without
excuse me we don't conclude from that
that the Russians are more better are
ahead of us in agriculture not the fact
that suppose you were to ask what is the
ruble equivalent of the American
military
we do just but you know what the answer
is the answer is that it's infinite yes
yeah because the Russian simply cannot
duplicate our military system if they
could spend every cent every ruble they
have in Russia and they can't duplicate
our military system is just too advanced
for them well at the very least then
there's this adversarial relationship do
either superpower want to change this or
is each of them benefiting from this
present situation so much so that
they're willing to escalate things even
further I don't think either side
benefits in any long-run sense but I
don't see any any any indication that
either side is going to do something
take any unilateral action that may very
well be that I that the Russians could
use the resources that are going to the
military sector they could certainly use
them to if they could be converted which
I don't think will be easy so III don't
see any answer your
I don't see any action at our level I
don't see any action at their level and
I think it comes motion that I do see is
coming from a kind of citizen activity
and I would only hope that there would
be something comfortable in the Soviet
Union room about that I'm not very
optimistic either we can't create we
cannot create initiatives in the Soviet
Union so it's pointless to discuss it we
can ask what can we do here now what we
do here if we want to be logical about
it has to be directed at two ends at
cutting down the American commitment to
the arms race and cutting down the
Russian commitment to the arms race and
fortunately the very same actions
contribute to both of those and not just
consider for a minute the dynamics of
the system we know that every time the
Russians do something aggressive it
supports the Hawks on our side
and every time they back off somewhere
it hurts the Foxman air side and the
system is mutually symmetrical so the
fact of the matter is that the best way
in which we can contribute to the
reduction of aggression and militarism
in the soviet union is by constraining
arin militarism and aggression which
there Hawks news just as arrows do as a
way of mobilizing their own population
and in fact in my view is that's why the
Cold War persists in fact it is highly
functional for the more brutal and
militaristic elements in both societies
it would also be helped we pointed out a
number of Marshall pointed out most
strongly and I agree with him that one
of the problems in the contemporary
world is there is no content
corresponding discussion inside the
United States so inside the Soviet Union
sorry yeah and that's correct and I
think we ought to also recognize that
what is a fact that there is very little
discussion in the United States the
spectrum of discussion in the United
States is extraordinarily narrow and
it's not narrow because the government
comes and throws in a concentration camp
it's narrow for other reasons but for
example well the things that I just said
a few minutes ago which Marshall doesn't
agree with fine that's his right not to
disagree but the point is the things I
have said cannot literally cannot be
expressed to any larger audience in the
United States there if there is no way
for those views to be expressed to
anything more than a marginal audience
in the United States so nobody stops me
from getting
let's say at a college meeting called
back up with students and saying these
things but everything stops me or anyone
else who believes these things from
approaching any large audience now what
that means is that in effect almost the
entire discussion in the United States
and this is literally a hundred close to
hundred percent is within a very narrow
framework of assumptions and people who
think that those assumptions are wrong
like me simply have no access to any
large audience Marshall keeps ringing up
well I wish they had a movement
comparable to ours
well given their history given the fact
they've never had any experience of
popular democracy as we have it or
voluntary organization I think this is
almost irrelevant that's not going to
happen the same way but on the other
hand from my experience there which he
agrees with there's no denying the
Soviet people across the board are feel
furled another war and I think there's a
lot of criticism of the bureaucracy
there are letters to the editor
criticizing the bureaucracy so if there
was coexistence and there's pressure
from the bottom for a more open society
wouldn't it seem reasonable that the
government as long as it doesn't feel
threatened would make some concessions
to these pressures to me that is a
common sense perspective and I just wish
that we had enough strength in our own
system you know to move in that
direction and away from this idea of
name-calling and military threats and
it's a risk either way I just remind us
again it's their risk either way because
each day that the present situation
continues there is a risk of war through
accidents so let's take our risks on the
basis of our own heritage in our belief
in human beings is having this capacity
to act reasonably in our own interest
