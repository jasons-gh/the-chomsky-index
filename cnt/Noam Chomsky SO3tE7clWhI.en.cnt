hello and welcome to our Alenia vivo
linguists online I am Miguel agreed
president of the Brazilian linguistics
Association of Dublin this is a project
of a berlin in co-operation with with
the permanent International Committee of
linguists the association of linguistics
and the philology and Association of
linguistics and flawless of Latin
America the Argentinian society for
linguistic studies and the linguistic
Society of America we are living in a
very challenging world where the way we
do and promote promote science we
probably change forever these of course
will not stop us from doing what we
believe that science in particular and
in particular the study of human
language is fundamental for dealing with
the challenges that the world presents
at this time of lockdown in society
these flow of linguistic associations is
engaged to promote a collaborative
approach gathering together some of the
most influential linguists from all over
the world in a platform designed to give
students and researchers free access to
state-of-the-art discussions of the most
diverse topics related to the study of
human language we had the honor to start
this series with distinguished linguists
no professor Noam Chomsky who very
kindly accepted our invitation I now
turn the floor over to Professor David
Bradley president of the permanent
International Committee of linguists we
will welcome you as well and right after
- professor Marcus Maya who will
moderate this first lecture thank you
for your attention and for your
engagement in our projects thank you
very much Miguel good evening potage as
president of the committee international
permanent a linguist I am extremely
pleased to welcome you all to the first
in a series of operably
and simple linguistics online Aladin our
weeaboo presentations on major topics in
current linguistics CIPA was established
in 1928 and we have organized 20
international congresses of linguists
the next is in 2023 and the location
will be announced shortly of course in
2013 professor Chomsky was the major
speaker in our Congress in Geneva we
also organized the linguistic
bibliography published by brill and we
lead various initiatives reacting to the
major linguistic inch issue of our
century lingua a twitches in my opinion
language endangerment suppose honored to
be involved with our alien in this
series and it gives me very great
present to welcome professor Noam
Chomsky at MIT to deliver the first
lecture professor Chomsky needs no
introduction he has been the leader in
advances in syntactic theory since the
middle of last century and continues to
inspire over us
Thank You Meechum agog and i now turn
the floor over to professor marcos maya
to give a further introduction for
professor Chomsky thank you
good evening Miguel good evening
professor Chomsky good evening David the
Divini all viewers professor ever known
Chomsky one of the most cited his
scholars alive does not really need a
presentation he's a 100 linguists a
philosopher a political scientist and
activist if you did not invent
linguistics at the very least he
reinvented it in the 50s having had an
important role in the so called
cognitive revolution it's an honor for
all of us to have professor Chomsky do
the first of a series of arborlon lives
after the talk professor Chomsky agreed
to answer a few questions so this
evening professor Chomsky will deliver
the lecture the Delphic Oracle her
message for today thank you
and let us turn immediately to the talk
professor Chomsky
thank you very much sorry I can't be
with you all in person but we all know
the reasons the most famous maxim of the
priestess that the Delphic Oracle is
know thyself that was extended by
Socrates to the dictum that an
unexamined life is not worth living now
the thought has force but does not go
far enough we are of course social
beings we should also know the world at
which we live and beyond that the
societies and the cultures that humans
have created in a richness and variety
found nowhere more vibrantly than where
this meeting is taking place the world
is not a happy place to put it mildly
right now it is plunged into a severe
pandemic crisis it's likely to drive the
global economy back to the back to the
days of the Great Depression my
childhood and to kill untold numbers of
people but that's only the beginning
there will be recovery from the crisis
that severe cost
there will be no recovery from the
melting of the polar ice caps a
producing feedback effects that
accelerate the rate of global warming
and the sea level rise that will be
devastating
along with other lethal effects that
place the survival of humanity at risk I
borrow that phrase from a
leaked internal memo of America's
largest bank JPMorgan Chase which warns
that the survival of humanity is at risk
if we pursue our present course
including the fossil fuel investments of
the bank which they specifically
condemned the nor will there be recovery
from the destruction of the Amazon
forests expected to reach a tipping
point in the non distant future when the
forests will turn irreversibly to
scrubland recent scientific study
estimates that in 15 years 2035 the
Amazon is likely to shift from a net
carbon sink to a net co2 emitter it's an
indescribable tragedy for Brazil and for
the entire world
considering the central role of the
Amazon than the global economy the
tragedy for Brazil done for the world
has a horrific human cost right on the
scene it's yet another genocide Allah
salt on the indigenous population also
wiping out the rich cultural reserves
that they have developed nurtured over
millennia not a problem for brazil's
president who criticized the military
for not following the u.s. model and
exterminating them long ago we are now
in the midst of two major crises makovan
19 crisis coronavirus crisis which is
quite naturally consuming almost total
attention and a much more profound
crisis that the
literally placed the survival of
humanity at risk and not in a distant
future countries are responding to these
crises in various ways there are two
countries that are alone in the world in
their reaction unlike virtually everyone
else their governments are dedicated to
escalating both of the crises in my
country and yours the Colossus of the
North as it's known and the country
that's long been expected to become the
Colossus of the self but has sometimes
come close to fulfilling this promise
notably than with the World Bank and
retrospect calls the golden decade both
Brazil's history the first millennium of
this first decade of this millennium
when Brazil was perhaps the most
respected country in the world and now
descending to the most ridiculed I do
not have to review the ways in which jr.
of bolson ro is devoting his efforts to
destroy the environment that sustains
life and magnifying the deadly impact of
the virus his partner in crime in
Washington is far more dangerous because
of us global power it's no secret that
in president Trump's single-minded
devotion to private wealth and corporate
power he's seeking to ensure maximal use
of fossil fuels including the most
deadly of them while tearing to shreds
the regulatory system that has
restricted its grim fake fight effects
on human life perhaps less familiar is
Trump's
action to the coronavirus I won't run
through the details which are spelled
out extensively elsewhere but thanks to
his malevolence the United States has
the worst record in the world in
confronting the plague which rages on in
sharp contrast in countries where the
government has some concern for its
citizens the flag is coming under
control now this is happening despite
the incomparable advantages enjoyed by
the United States and wealth power and
resources I say president Trump's
commitments and moral level were
revealed with great clarity in the
budget he proposed for the coming year
On February 10th
that's while the pandemic was raging and
the Trump Bowl Senora do over dismissing
it as a common cold throughout his four
years in office the Trump has been
systematically cutting back funding for
the center of Disease Control and other
health-related components of the
government that leaving the United
States singularly vulnerable to the
predicted endemic the budget calls for
further defunding of the Center for
Disease Control right in the midst of
the pandemic it also calls for increases
elsewhere in particular increased
subsidies to the fossil fuel industries
that are destroying the world and of
course more for the bloated military and
for his famous wall to protect Americans
from miserable refugees fleeing from the
wreckage of us terrorists crimes
now the significance is loud and clear
to make matters worse in his desperate
efforts to conceal his massive crimes
against Americans Trump is clearing
about to find scapegoats the most recent
target is the World Health Organization
which Trump is now seeking to destroy on
the riser he grounds the most immediate
effect will be to slaughter many poor
people in Africa in Yemen scene of the
world's worst humanitarian crisis of
these they depend on the World Health
Organization for survival from many
diseases so they can be lost in both
scenarios famous phrase who cares
well maybe they can turn again to the
country that played an essential role in
liberating black Africa Cuba which isn't
it once again providing the world with a
rare model of true internationalism by
sending doctors to stricken areas in
Europe where the rich countries of the
so-called and union are unable to help
one another the two major countries in
the Western Hemisphere are now vying for
the lead
in destroying the environment that
sustains life and exposing their own
citizens to the grim effects of the
virus mostly the poor of course but
their ambitions are higher they are also
competing to uphold the banner of
Franco's companion the fascist general
mulain astray
Abajo the intelligentsia viva la muerte
result both Senora is destroying
Brazil's rich scientific institutions
the one trembles to see if the ax will
fall on the Osvaldo Cruz Foundation
which is in the forefront of efforts to
prevent and overcome pandemics perhaps
while Senora Botha Nora will follow the
path of his tutor in the White House who
just removed the doctor in charge of
developing vaccines because he dared to
warn against the quack medicines
recommended by our dear leader like both
anoro Trump is trying hard to undermine
science he's following the dictates of
his favorite journalists Rush Limbaugh
to Amin recently awarded the Medal of
Freedom
according to Limbo quoting there are
four corners of deceit
government academia science and media
those situations are now corrupt and
exists by virtue of deceit so all salute
general astray science reporters deplore
the fact that quoting now the Trump has
diminished the role of science in
federal policy making
while halting or disrupting research
programs nationwide marking a
transmission transformation of the
federal government whose effects experts
say could reverberate for years the main
targets of Trump's mimicry of the
fascist General Center on the
environment and climate quoted again
concerns that Trump has dismissed
despite aid
global scientific consensus but the
targets go well beyond reaching to
effects of chemicals on pregnant women
crop science for more specialists warned
that the disregard for expertise in the
federal government is worse than it has
ever been it's pervasive so it comes as
little surprise that the two main hot
spots for the pandemic are the United
States and Brazil also the two main
centers for the campaign to enhance the
risks for the survival of humanity well
let's leave the gutter and come up for a
breath of fresh air let's return to the
Delphic Oracle and the injunction to
know thyself not just as an individual
but as a member of a species Cheri
essential characteristics with others
and a very unusual species unique in
many ways the core of human uniqueness
is what Anthony Wallace the co-founder
of the theory of evolution called the
intellectual and moral nature of humans
these are attributes with no meaningful
a deluxe in the biological world
sometimes simply called the human
capacity the Faculty of languages quite
naturally taken to be the core element
of the human capacity its appearance in
the evolutionary record which we can
know fairly confidently confident that
confidently dates in Krupps two or three
hundred thousand years ago its
appearance in the evolutionary record at
that time is plausibly regarded as the
sudden
an emergent event that was the releasing
stimulus for the appearance of the human
capacity in the evolutionary record
that's the summary by the noted
paleoanthropologist Ian Patterson of
current thinking the great leap forward
as Jared Diamond called it
what happened apparently is that some
small rewiring of the brain yielded the
basic property of human language with
the rich syntax that yields human
thoughts for requisite for social
development and the sharp changes of
behavior that are revealed in the
archaeological record on to the
spectacular changes since some of them
magnificent some of them which
threatened the survival of humans and
much of the rest of life on earth so
what is the basic property that appeared
in one branch of hominids youth a few
hundred thousand years ago though we can
take it to be an operation coded in the
brain which yields an unbounded array of
structured expressions each of which
constitutes the linguistic articulation
of a thought each of which may or may
not be externalized in some sensory
motor system enabling others to access
our innermost thoughts this is quite a
remarkable phenomenon these remarkable
properties of language deeply impressed
the founders of modern science in the
17th century with insights that all
returned to
moment but first it's worth noting that
that period beginning of modern science
was in some respects like our own in
some parts of the human sciences in
particular linguistics and took the
cognitive sciences may be approaching
something like Galilean Revolution there
is a move from careful often quite
insightful description of phenomena of
nature to genuine explanation of some of
the core principles one step in the 17th
century great leap forward in
understanding the world was an enhanced
willingness to be puzzled by ordinary
phenomenon so why does an Apple fall to
the ground then at what rate does it do
so why do P we perceive the figure as a
distorted triangle not as the exact
image of whatever it may be in general
what are the basic principles that
underlie what happens in the world well
at the time there were accounts in the
dominant neo scholastic philosophy of
the day but they were often count
couched in mystical terms invoking what
the Galilean scientists called occult
properties that were unexplained
sympathies and antipathies forms
flitting through the air and implanting
themselves in the brain I'll turn to
some analogs in our own day well in
their effort to reveal the secrets of
the universe abandoning mysticism the
founders of the Scientific Revolution
did not overlook and ignore language and
thought Galileo and
this contemporaries expressed then
quoting expressed their awe and wonder
that the fact that language permits us
to construct from 25 or 30 sounds an
infinite variety of expressions which
although not having any resemblance in
themselves to that which passes through
our minds nevertheless reveals all of
the secrets of the mind that makes
intelligible to others who cannot
penetrate into the mind all that we
conceive and all of the diverse
movements of our souls of that crucial
insight critical insight opposes a
challenge and sometimes called the
Galilean challenge we now know that the
formulation requires some qualifications
but the challenge is very real
and should I think he recognized as one
of the deepest insights into language in
mind in the rich history of inquiry of
the past several millennia these
insights were pursued in the tradition
of general and rational grubber general
because it sought principles that hold
for all languages rational because it
sought explanation these efforts had
important results but they faced
empirical and conceptual barriers
empirical evidence was quite limited
that conception at the conceptual level
it was unclear how to capture go home
fun huh mumbles aphorism that language
makes infinite use of finite means and
indeed does so in a creative way that
remains today a total mystery
now this tradition was swept aside in
the 20th century structural and
behaviorist Torrance it was completely
forgotten it was revived with no
awareness of antecedents in the mid 20th
century it was by then possible to
overcome some of the barriers that had
blocked the earlier efforts to address
the galilean challenge anthropological
and structural linguistics have had
provided far richer data and important
no ideas though mostly concerned
concerning the externalization of the
inner language coated in the brain and
major discoveries in the mathematical
sciences creating the theory of
computation provided the intellectual
tools to capture the infinite use of
finite means the only part as I said the
normal creative use of language remains
today a mystery the so called generative
Enterprise grew from these roots and at
once confronted problems similar to
those that arose in the 17th century in
both cases it had been thought that the
basic issues were understood and that
all that remained was to apply available
ideas to broader domains but with the
new approaches that sought genuine
explanations it was quickly understand
quickly discovered that almost nothing
was understood and that many standard
beliefs were wrong and that puzzles
abounded as soon as one took a close
look so the new science of the 17th
century was unsatisfied
with many conventional beliefs that for
example the universal belief that heavy
objects full faster than light ones as
exactly that's what we see in the world
of experience so why and in fact is it
even true turns out that it's not as
Galileo demonstrated by clever thought
experiments for experiments remember he
couldn't have possibly carried them out
much else fell by the wayside well
turning to our day and our topic it's
common it was commonly believed that
quoting language is a matter of training
and habit phrases Leonard Bloomfield's
the great American linguist of the first
half of the 20th century but the idea
was very widely held in one or another
form thirty years later 1968
Bloomfield's student Charles pocket who
was one of the most sophisticated
theorists in the general structuralist
tradition revised Linfield's
characterization quoting him an
individual's language at a given moment
constantly changing is a set of habits
that is of analogies where different
analogies are in conflict and it is
unmitigated nonsense to think that there
might exist some internal system encoded
in the brain that determines the
language similar notions are quite
prevalent today particularly in Silicon
Valley based linguistics but elsewhere
as will well let's put aside the
question whether these ideas are even
coherent and let's adopt the 17th
century stance of puzzlement so take an
allergy central concept
no one tells us what it is but we have
some general grasp of the concept so
let's take a simple sentence like John
ate an apple and suppose we delete the
object forming John eight which means
John ate something or other now there
are actually further constraints which
we can put aside now let's take a look
at an obvious analogy and take the
sentence John is too angry to talk to
Bill okay and let's delete the object
forming John is too angry to talk to
which by analogy should mean John is too
angry to talk to someone or other
unfortunately it doesn't it means John
is so angry that someone or other
won't talk to him the simple analogy
fails and as we know quite interesting
questions arise when we look further
much as in the case of falling bodies we
find this everywhere so what about habit
no one tells us what it is but we have a
general idea so what habit then yield
the interpretation of John is too angry
to talk to him that does the question
even make any sense
well in the 1950s when the generative
Enterprise began it quickly became
apparent that accepted ideas fall apart
that so does your willing to be puzzled
and examine them carefully which
interestingly doesn't keep them from
being held with all their incoherence
long after which happened to be true in
the 17th century as well more
interestingly new problems
immediately arise take another simple
sentence the men who worked carefully
packed their tools the men who worked
carefully packed their tools
it's ambiguous could mean they worked
carefully or they carefully packed
suppose the adverb is an initial
position carefully the men who worked
packed their tools the ambiguities gone
it means carefully packed can't mean
works here there's a puzzle fact a
double puzzle why is the ambiguity
resolved and why is carefully construed
with a more remote firm not the cliffs
closest one in fact as soon as we impose
structure on the sentence we see that
carefully is construed with a
structurally closest verb not the
linearly closest one so the puzzle is
rephrased why do we attend to structure
not linear order the example illustrates
the principle of structure dependence
which holds of all constructions in all
languages to deep Universal and that
poses even more serious puzzles first of
all the actual computation using
structure is far more complex than the
rejected one that uses linear order so
why is it universally chosen second how
does anybody know this in fact
experiment by now has shown that this is
known by infants as early as they can be
tested by now most weaken recent worked
out the thirty months old as soon as you
can test an infant they know this
well that means that the infant with no
relevant experience is ignoring
everything in here's namely then your
order that's what you hear and it's
attending only to what it never hears
namely structure and it's doing so in
all constructions in all languages
though these are very serious puzzles
and they abound as soon as we look at
language from a 17th century perspective
well in the case of structure dependence
there's only one possible answer namely
that linear order is simply not
available to the computational system
coded in the brain that is used to meet
the galilean challenge to construct
thoughts and to convey them to others
who are similarly endowed so that they
can comprehend the thought but why well
this is training and habit analogy
conditioning any of the similar ideas
that are commonly used plainly not it
seems to me that we can consign these
ideas to the category of neo scholastic
occult properties they may have some use
around the periphery of language use but
they seem to have no relevance at all to
the basic nature of language well after
many years of searching we have found
what seems to be the best possible
answer to the conundrum the system of
language coded in the brain uses the
simplest possible computational
operation binary set formation these
days called
merge that means evolution took the
simplest path the biological endowment
for language was
yuuji in modern terms determines that
the brain codes the simplest
computational operation won't run
through the details but it's easy to
show now they're still an unresolved
question if the computational operation
that yields language with the basic
properties that I described if that
operation is order free how come the
expressions of language are literally
ordered it must be that this property
derives from some source other than
language and it clearly does it says
property of the articulatory system
articulatory system cannot produce
structures forced to linearize and in
fact when externalization of language
uses a different output system say sign
strict linearization is not necessary
but because visual space offers
additional options which are in fact
used in signing now the sensory motor
systems have nothing whatsoever to do
with language they were in place long
before language emerged than any
modifications under language use or that
most extremely marginal they exist at
all so we conclude then that linear
order and other surface arrangements do
not strictly speaking belong to language
they'd rather belong to some amalgam of
language and some other system that has
nothing to do with language the good
deal follows if you think it through for
one thing you would expect that the
parent complexity diversity easy
mutability of language probably finds
its locus
mainly in this complex amalgam is a
complex process to relate the inner
system to other systems unrelated to it
and it may be that the internal system
which does meet the Thiele Lane
challenge is very close to uniform maybe
even totally uniform among humans hasn't
been shown but I think work is
converging in that direction
and it does seem as if the complexity is
diverse diverse apparent diversity
mutability or essentially in
externalization to sensory motor systems
well this means that the internal
language is something like your laptop
the internal coding can be fixed but it
can be externalized with different kinds
of critters sensory motor systems well
you can you've got to make your own
judgments of course but in my view this
is the first genuine explanation of a
fundamental property of language in the
rich and instructive millennia of the
research into language years and perhaps
an indication that we are indeed
approaching something like a Galilean
revolution in the study of language in
mind now that conclusion is fortified by
the fact that a very interesting range
of puzzles succumbed to the same
analysis receiving genuine explanations
it's discussed in recent literature that
many of you are familiar with its
currently expanding in new directions
raising new and difficult puzzles that
remain unanswered and really puzzling
it's a sign of a field that's very much
alive and exciting now that in fact is
even true of the one example that I gave
much was a lot followed from
Galileo's demonstration that we're all
wrong about falling bodies so consider
again the example that I gave carefully
the men who worked past their tool
packed their tools
the adverb seeks the structurally
closest verb pact ignores the linearly
closest for work but the situation is
more complex sometimes the adverb
ignores the structurally closest verb is
will so suppose you hear me say
carefully the men who worked on
beginning a sentence and I say carefully
the men who worked there's only one verb
worked so it's there for the
structurally closest verb too carefully
but you can't construe it with carefully
it's inaccessible to computation not
only in this case but quite generally
that raises new and very interesting
puzzles they're only partially
understood as a very general condition
it's now called the phase
impenetrability condition which renders
the verb inaccessible and has many other
complex consequences well that raises
new puzzles among them why does the
phase impenetrability condition hold to
provide a general explanation a genuine
explanation we must show that this
follows from merge the simplest
computational operation along with
language-independent conditions that are
called in the lurch or third factor
conditions along with ug and external
data the two other affection factors in
language design and use among these
third factor conditions
is the principle of computational
efficiency which we can take to be the
natural law outside of language which is
used in language like other natural laws
and it has been shown in recent years
that this combination of the simplest
computational operation merged and
universal conditions of computational
efficiency have quite interesting and
surprising consequences for language
well that offers some promise in
providing a genuine explanation for the
phase impenetrability condition but
there are open questions remaining well
coming back to the priestess of the
Oracle we finally have some responses to
the challenge that she posed but are
nowhere near plumbing its depths which
makes the study of language a
fascinating and exciting enterprise
one of the problems of sequestering is
that my dog wants to get into the act
you have the questions available sorry I
can't hear you you know I think he wants
us to passing some questions so should
be able to announce to the people if
they want to ask questions right I don't
see any questions in the YouTube life
yet but let's just announce that if
there are any questions we can select a
couple and pass them to Professor Noam
Chomsky now so I'm looking at the chart
at the live chat and if someone has any
question to ask professor Noam Chomsky
I'm out because I sent to you some some
questions to your fall over your phone
okay thank you gotta get rid of my dogs
hey professor
so can you hear me okay so there's the
first question here about the political
part of your talk which is elections in
the United States are soon so can we
consider that a new political scenario
in the u.s. safe politics could actually
change or influence a change in Brazil -
what do you think change in the
political system in the United States
might induce a change in Brazil that's
right no I think that's quite possible
we should recognize that the current
situation in Brazil in the United States
is really without precedent we've had
all kinds of presidents in the last 200
plus years but nothing like this there
has never been the president who is
sorry to be literal a sociopathic
megalomaniac who is concerned with
nothing but himself willing to kill any
number of people destroy the planet
whatever it may be electoral politics in
fact the one example I gave illustrates
that now what is it why did he defunded
World Health Organization well because
he has to try to find blame somebody for
the crimes he's committed against
Americans in fact if you notice he's
flailing around all over the place to
find somebody so let's define the World
Health Organization
now that appeals to a sector of the
electorate which doesn't like
international institutions now they
think we're so great we don't have to
have international institution so at
place in the electorate maybe improves
his electoral prospects for the next
election what are the immediate
consequences well unless I mentioned
Yemen is the worst humanitarian crisis
in the world largely due to him
incidentally providing his sooty friends
with advanced aircraft to carry out
massacres now the people are surviving
because of help from the World Health
Organization health workers cut that off
kill them what about Africa it's
happening all over Africa it's happening
in parts of Latin America so let's just
kill them I know numbers we don't know
how many so like well never says who
cares that's an unusual form of sadism
there's plenty of horrible things happen
in the world it's a tourism of this kind
is unusual and you cannot find a figure
in history who has been working with
eyes open to destroy the prospects for
ordinary
human life on earth in the near future
and he knows it
I know people around him knows it but
who cares we can enrich our sponsors
that way so who cares I could go on but
this is unique if the United States goes
back to a normal system that won't be
great in my opinion there's a lot wrong
with the normal system but at least it's
you know it's back in the civilized
world in fact it's quite striking to see
how far to the right the pinion has
drifted during the neoliberal period the
last 40 years so let's take Bernie
Sanders no he's he's criticized for
having a where he's lauded or criticized
depending what side you're on for having
a revolutionary program let's take a
look at it his two main planks or
universal health care and free higher
education have you heard of any other
country that has universal health care I
mean have you heard of any country that
doesn't matter I suppose you can find
some somewhere can you find any other
country that has free higher education
all over the place like the United
States that it back in the 1950s it's
called the GI Bill which provided free
education subsidies the huge number of
people so a Sanders are saying let's
rise to the level of other countries
even of ourselves in the earlier years
why now that's regarded as revolutionary
maybe too much for Americans to accept
it's quite an interesting reaction but
to go back to the question if the United
States moves back to something like at
what it was from the 1930s up until
Ronald Reagan that would have a big
effect not I can't go way beyond that
there's a meant much for the progress
possibly plenty of activists working on
it but that would be certain to have an
effect on Brazil in every world simply
because of us power if school Senora
couldn't count on support from
Washington he wouldn't be able to do
anything is doing you okay thank you
very much professor there's an English
six question now what are your current
thoughts on the nature of unit millage
in language acquisition else
there are many recent findings on
statistical learning indicating that
maybe stimuli are not so poor after all
well actually there are essentially no
results on statistical acquisition you
take a look you find they don't use any
statistic so for example there are
recent studying very reason showing that
something we're familiar with that if
you compare english-speaking communities
and Japanese speaking communities and
you look at infants that age roughly
nine months they begin to be their
perceptual capacities begin to become
different and the or L range so Japanese
infants begin to lose the capacity
discriminating or Mill English infants
retain it that's described the
statistical learning take a look at
what's happening if you look at the data
you get two peaks in the R for English
speakers what they're hearing gives two
peaks in your range and in the old range
you look at the Japanese speakers
they're getting one peak in the RL range
no statistics this is just what's called
numerosity something that any animal
does
you can pick big quantities is to
things from small commodities now
there's one versus the several results
on statistics one is the first careful
statistical analysis of the actual data
the children receive in the first couple
of years of life is done by Charles yang
fine computational linguist linguist at
the University of Pennsylvania what he
found using what's called Zipf's law the
universal law about frequency and
frequency in length
he found that almost all of children's
speech consists of short what they hear
consists of short words if you look at
you try to find by grams you know two
words in sequence you can find them but
they're not very frequent and when you
get to try grams you almost never find
them which means that the data coming to
children is extremely sparse much less
than we thought before which means that
the the problem of what's called poverty
of stimulus is far deeper than what is
what had been thought before that's an
important statistical result now the
other one which caused quite a lot of
furor and still being pursued as an
interesting experiment by the Castleman
and others I think about 20 years ago
maybe which showed that if you take
eight or nine month old infants and you
give them artificial something like
artificial speech they can detect
probabilities that certain which have
word boundaries they can detect current
the transitional probabilities at word
boundaries they can detect that if
there's a high probability for the next
segment it's not going to be a
not gonna be a unit if there's a low
probability for the next segment chance
that it's a word okay a unit in other
words okay that made a big splash and
it's of some moderate interest what it
actually shows that what was believed in
generative grammar for 60 years
might be true if you go back to the
mid-50s say my own work on logical
structure of linguistic theory that's
argued there that maybe word boundaries
can be detected by looking at
transitional probabilities this was a
modification of a proposal by zelich
Harris that maybe morphemes can be
detected this way it's not going to work
for morphemes except for highly
analytical anguishes and morphemes don't
have the beads on a string property
that's necessary but words do so it's
conceivable that words are identified
that way well that was finally
investigated in recent years actually
first by Charles yang again found that
it doesn't work if you take English and
you use the transitional probabilities
of word boundaries you pretty much get
syllables not words not this if you add
some ug principles you get closer so if
you add the principle that a word the
word is going to have a single tonality
peak you know pitcher speak if you add
that gets closer Janet your Humbert
showed that if you had some fun atactic
information gets even better there's
other work by some others so it was a
nice it was a possible guess doesn't
have to be true but and it has been
shown that in an artificial speech or an
artificial production the children can
detect some statistical properties which
may be used somewhere it's perfectly
possible but essentially they there's
almost nothing there
okay thank you there's another
linguistics question what do you think
if someone would stablish that a
language let's say a Brazilian
indigenous language would not show a
self embedding in the in clause
constructions how do you think this
could call them to question the basic
property of the language faculty just in
his case now Khurana
it tells you absolutely zero if you look
at the papers on this then you livers
initial papers which made a huge splash
every paper that he cites explicitly
says that recursion is a property of the
Faculty of language of Eugene not of
particular languages it's as if you
found a tribe in the Amazon that where
everybody happens to wear a black patch
on one I will tell you nothing about
binocular vision why not they all have
binocular vision then of course the
speaker's of karana have the same
language capacity is all of us to know
they all learn Portuguese okay so
whether the facts that he's describing
are correct or not which is disputed but
well it's even if they're correct what
they tell us is we found a curiosity
like a tribe that wears the black patch
of the one does that tell you anything
about the theory of vision and of course
nothing it's a minor figure it's like
lining that English shirt doesn't use
the emphatic consonants that they use in
Arabic that's interesting doesn't mean
that they're not part of you gene thank
you there's a last question a French
researcher if Stanislas Dehaene e has
argued that every learning operation is
actually similar to language acquisition
in the sense that there are general
parameters of mind organization which
interact with data from the experience
do you know the highness
research and if so could you comment on
the hypothesis that marriage is
generative not just for language but for
learning in general well the man is a
very good scientist his work is worth
looking at carefully and indeed mergers
used elsewhere there's interesting work
on that for example one crucial puzzle
that bothered Charles Darwin and anthing
Wallace to aalverson derivation strange
puzzles and that was how come all over
the world every culture people know
arithmetic lucky they didn't have
evidence for that they just assume is
true and in fact we know have good
reason to believe it is true so how do
they know arithmetic Britax never been
used
it's been used for a tiny recent very
recent portion of some cultures
throughout the couple hundred thousand
years and one long sapiens
so if obviously wasn't selected so how
does everybody know it in fact how does
anybody know it how do you know it when
you weren't exposed to the fact that
numbers can go on indefinitely
they just somehow know it so how well
could be an awful that could be because
it turns out that the most simple merge
has been many sub cases and the simplest
sub case actually the one that yields
the ubiquity of displacement in natural
language happens to give you elementary
arithmetic if you have a lexicon of one
element just one word in the lexicon
then you run this operation that gives
you the successor function and something
like addition and with a little tweaking
you can get subtraction then you have
multiplication or everything so it's
possible that that's the answer to the
door when Wallace conundrum maybe it's
Justin Oh
language there's some evidence that
musical traditions music seems to be
another like the cultural Universal you
find something like it every year and
there's some work suggesting that the
core of tonality other kinds of musical
creations actually involve something
like the contain the combinatorial
operation there's even some working that
moral Universal there's some evidence
now on Universal moral principles myth
man-wolf something like the same
operation so it's possible that this
it's very hard to find it elsewhere it's
very possible that this operation
appeared in the linguistic case it gave
you language but then what happened well
of course we know nothing there's
absolutely no evidence to carry a beyond
them so we can speculate it's fun just
to speculate with no evidence one
possibility is that once language
presumably turned out to be useful you
know so people used it so it
proliferated everybody had it we have
good reason to believe that very good
reason nothing language faculty Eugene
that was fixed at least 150,000 years
ago the reasons are that we now have
genomic analysis that shows that the
earliest groups that separated from the
rest the Sun people in Africa separated
about 150 thousand years ago maybe more
so that means the separation took place
almost when homo sapiens emerged this is
an evolutionary time these are tiny
period so way back then since then we're
apparently all the same no could be that
know we all have language so it's
possible that once language was
available the basic operation of
language was then extended to other
domains that's a possibility another
possibility is that somehow merge
developed not only one system made use
of it
and then later maybe arithmetic that's
very hard to distinguish these ideas
there's no empirical difference between
them and we should remember anybody who
speculates in these areas and thinks in
them should better remember a very
important article that was published
about thirty years ago I think by
Richard Lewontin fine evolutionary
biologist it appears in the there's a
for vaad known he was in three now for
volume
it's called invitation to cognitive
science published by MIT with some
outstanding editors tick Lewontin has an
article there now what she tells
cognitive scientists that don't expect
too much about learning about the
evolution of cotton of cognition with
cognition you're never gonna find
anything the reason is not that it
didn't happen but that the tools that we
have for investigating evolution don't
get you anywhere in this domain I mean
obviously you don't have direct evidence
nobody took tape recorders now you have
artifacts but very you know something
they say it looks like symbolic behavior
may have been maybe there were big
groups and the other tools like
population genetics and so on tell you
nothing whatsoever
these were tiny groups of people up till
very recently so as he ends up by saying
he says nice question but tough luck you
can speculate as much as you want you
can say maybe there were proto languages
maybe maybe their work doesn't seem to
do any work maybe any other thing you
want
but you never gonna find out anything in
fact what we can find out I think is
very little hears about what we know one
thing we know is that humans began to
separate
not long after Homo sapiens appeared
that's genomic evidence so we can take
it to be fixed we know that before Homo
sapiens appeared there's virtually no
evidence of in the archaeological record
of any symbolic behavior I mean some
very simple things like a you know more
kind of stolen or something and not long
after Homo sapiens developed remember
this is evolutionary time so like around
hundred thousand years ago now you start
getting complex symbolic materials the
Palumbo's cage bombo's cage in southern
spain others pretty soon you get the
amazing productions of you know
Paleolithic art which are absolutely
fabulous
I was I was able to get into the Lascaux
caves in France before they were closed
off and it's just stunning
I mean much better than the roof of the
best reproductions that you see it's
claimed that when because I've got there
he said we haven't learned anything in
40,000 years but what happens is that
very roughly again evolutionary time
these are tiny periods Homo sapiens
appears language appears people separate
small groups for a long long time and
you start getting amazing a cognitive
achievements magnificent orcas all kinds
of symbolic behavior and so on well
that's suggestive it's one thing it
suggests is that whatever ug is
it must be very simple because it's
developed in a short period of
evolutionary time and doesn't seem to
have changed since there's no evidence
that has changed in a hundred and fifty
thousand years some people have the same
far as we know same ug we do now there's
another little twist to this which was
studying and a very important work by a
fine language Dutch linguist Rini Hybris
he studied the click languages and he
was able to show very convincingly that
all and only the languages which make
serious use of clicks or the languages
of the Sun people voice on languages
they make extensive use of them and
nobody else does there are other
apparent cases but they seem to be
borrowing or you know some marginal
thing it's an overwhelming
generalization so it looks as though the
externalization of language might have
taken place after the separation and
some somewhat different ways you know
it's not decisive but suggested I try to
go beyond this to find some evidence
about evolution of language I think you
don't find much you find a huge
literature but ask how much of it goes
beyond speculation I don't think much
not because of the inadequacy of the
experimenters but because of what the
Walton pointed out the methods of
inquiry for theory of evolution just
don't get you anywhere I mean there's a
lot of work on the evolution of the
articulatory system okay you've got
fossils and all sorts of things but
that's not language your ticket or
system has nothing to do with language
you just as well you sign you can use
touch I mean sound as convenient now you
can use it in the dork can use talking
to somebody behind you but it's we know
very well by now that sign is virtually
identical to spoken language
in its acquisition and its structural
properties all sorts of ways even its
neural representation so it looks as if
there's just something inside there that
has this ug thing coded and it can have
many manifestations and the
manifestations you can study the can
study the evolution so for example it's
been a lot of talk in recent years about
a gene called fox p2 you can't talk
about that well first of all it's very
doubtful that it has anything to do with
language it seems stuff to do with fine
motor operations but whatever it is it's
just do the articulatory system it's
about something if it if it has any
effect you know maybe it facilitates
some particulate or juice or something
but it can't it certainly has nothing to
do with say phonemic analysis and it
turns out that Fitch has shown one of
the good theorists of evolutionary
biology that he's worked a lot with the
it comes a Fitch with other primates and
has found that say chimpanzees have
about the same auditory system we do in
fact they even pick out the same
features that were used in phonemic
systems in a child an infant you know -
Dale chill infant even an infant in the
womb here's speech noises its speech
chimpanzee can listen them forever it's
noise it's like when I listen to
Portuguese just noise the child the
infant has the same problem listening to
something has even a worse problem when
I listen to Portuguese at least I have a
language so if some idea what a language
might be but still it's mostly noise the
infant doesn't even have a language to
start with
not it's noise I mean it was believed at
one time that there's something called
mother reads that mothers talk in a very
special way to infants and maybe in some
upper middle-class privileged societies
but most of the world that doesn't
happen they learn exactly the same way
and furthermore experiments on mother
reading equipment and others sure that
just didn't seem to have any effect kid
doesn't even listen it's listening to
the ambient language with all of its
possibilities in fact you do real
experiments on say perception of your
own language turns out that you you
think you're hearing words but it turns
out that you're actually identifying
them after something comes along later
in the sentence that makes sense of it
what you're hearing is just noise then
you've imposed structure on it that's
the problem for the infant and it
doesn't even have the words so all of
this just has to be something deeply
built in at every level and that can be
very striking to be able to show if we
can but the internal language the one
that does code thought enable it to be
externalized the one that meets the goal
and challenged we could sure that that's
uniform though it'd be a very striking
discovery that's but is a traditional
view that was thought for hundreds of
years during the channel and russell
brown the grammar tradition they
couldn't show it of course but we're
sort of itching towards that I think not
there by any means that looks like an
increase of you thank you very much
would you have time for an last question
now thank you
you mister in your talk tonight about
the concept of third factor in the year
2005 article
you define first factor as ug the second
factor as experienced and third factor
is actually characterized in terms of
economy of computations however ever
since people have expanded on this third
factor program let's say and for example
in Frayser and colleagues have proposed
that processing in itself could be seen
as a third factor and also what do you
think
like for example symmetry and locality
symmetry in the symmetry in locality as
candidates thousand little faculty I
think is an economist a minimal search
which is all over the place in languages
valuation examples no that's a
computational that's oppressive
computational efficiency actually I
should go back to a 2005 article I think
I may have given computational
efficiency as an example of the third
but at least what I meant by it is
anything else so maybe some cognitive
principle that somebody will discover
someday anything that's not specifically
linguistics not specifically language so
there's some things that seem to be
specifically language ug of course a
native language they've gotta be there
for any kind of development then there's
natural laws other things that are even
the structure of the brain may be such
there only certain kinds of systems can
develop fuck it's probably true we don't
know enough about the brain to say
anything but maybe someday neuroscience
will discover that the brain has to be
of a certain kind a certain order for
language to be embedded in it's probably
true if it is true that be a third
factor property so as far as processing
is concerned
certainly processor deletes the
processing is very closely related to
language acquisition I mean by
definition in fact know that the infant
who's acquiring language is processing
the noises that come in and whatever we
find out about processing will obviously
at the core of the study of language
acquisition exactly see how it could be
some interesting relations to the design
of language so let's just take the
examples I was giving let's take another
one which I didn't you so one of the
consequences of merge is that
displacement is ubiquitous in language
that's always been a puzzle I mean why
is there displacement why are there
sentences like what did you eat where we
have to have to figure out that what is
the object of eat the which can get
pretty complicated when the sentences go
up why not just say you ate what that's
some languages do now why do you ever
use displacement okay with the strength
properties events that's always been
considered a problem
that's why myself everybody else who
worked on it
thought it was a very strange puzzle
that there are transformations but there
are you know composition seems kind of
obvious put things together into phrases
and so on but why do you get
displacement whatnot turns out now that
the opposite is the case
displacement is the null hypothesis the
simplest form of merge is displacement
it's called internal burn what's called
external runners putting things together
turns out to be a much more complicated
operation not furthermore displacement
leaves copies automatically so when you
when your mind generates
what did you eat it's Jerry what did you
eat what
now why don't you pronounce that well
because of an economy principle well in
fact you'd be much more complex than
that the copies can be all over the
place
why do you pronounce only one because it
takes a lot of effort mental cut neural
computation physical computation to
Britt was all of it so and you have to
use one there's no evidence please so
you have one and get them through any
more than that but notice a consequence
of that it makes communication very
difficult in fact one of these people
who work on parsing programs are aware
that one of the toughest problems is
what's called filler gap problems your
word and then you have to find out where
you interpret it that's very tricky well
what's happening language design is
optimal language externalization is
optimal it gives you a system which is
bad for communication there are lots of
examples of that so take structural
ambiguity that flying planes can be
dangerous know that it's what these
things follow just from letting the
rules run free they harm communication
take what are called islands you know
they were they follow just from making
things as simple as possible but they
require paraphrases so in english and
attack you can say it in Portuguese but
not in English in English you can't say
how many mechanics do you wonder if fix
the car in English is not a null subject
language so you can't say an island for
good reasons that means you have to try
to say it yes they make up some
paraphrase okay
why does language do that I think the
reason is language just doesn't care
about communication have no interest the
language is designed on principles of
computational efficiency simplicity
that's the way evolution works that's
the way the brain works if it turns out
the harm communication just to bid that
this is we're thinking about because
there's a traditionally language is
regarded as an instrument of thought but
in the modern period it's been regarded
as an instrument of communication with
everything else on the side I think
that's an influence of behaviorism and
the misunderstanding of Darwinism you
just have to look at the data you know
that's what you see you see
communication so that must be yes if you
ask yourself what underlies it turns out
not to be true of course language is
used for communication so is everything
else you do gesture or whatever that is
a very good means of communication but
the fundamental structure of language
just seems not to care about
communication this is also relevant to
evolution it's very widely believed that
human language must have evil from
primate communication or some other kind
of communication very hard to believe
it's radically different in every
imaginable respect and there's actually
no reason to believe it because even
though of course language is used for
communication there's no indication that
it somehow derived from the radically
different forms of communication used by
all animals I mean every animal has some
kind of communication of course but you
know down to bacteria but nothing to do
with human language thank you very much
it's been almost 90 minutes and that we
could easily spend twice as that here
listening to you and but I think it's
about time we and we would like to thank
you very much
for your wisdom for your analysis for
all the things you shared with us today
you're beautiful talk about the message
of the Delphic Oracle thank you very
much professor clear diligence you talk
David thank you too for your presence
