the question will two questions one how
could I call myself with libertarian
socialist was a contradiction in terms
given the meaning of the term
libertarian in the United States and
secondly if I'm opposed to state
subsidized capitalism what about Lizzie
fair capitalism the kind advocated by
Adam Smith right well you're right that
the terms that I'm using are
contradictory in the United States but
that's a sign of the perverse perversity
of American culture hear the term
libertarian means the opposite of what
it meant everybody else all through
history so what I was describing was the
real Adam Smith and the real Thomas
Jefferson and so on who were
anti-capitalist and called for equality
and thought the people shouldn't be
subjected to wage labor because that's
destructive of their humanity and that
and the real Adam Smith who said that
you government in in any civilized
society something has to be done to
prevent division of labor because it'll
turn people into creatures as stupid and
ignorant it's possible for a human to be
and who advocated markets only on the
grounds that under perfect Liberty it
would lead the perfect equality okay
that's the traditional libertarian
tradition that I've been talking about
and in that sense yeah I'm a libertarian
the u.s. sense is quite different here
every word has become has taken omneya
not the opposite of its meaning
elsewhere
so here libertarian means extreme
advocate of total tyranny that's what
libertarian means here it means power
ought to be given into the hands of
private unaccountable tyrannies even
worse than state tyrannies because there
the public has some kind of rule the
corporate system especially as its
evolved in the twentieth century is
purity completely unaccountable you're
inside one of these institutions you
take orders from above you hand it down
below you're outside the institutions
under what the libertarians want there's
Noth nothing you can say tyrannies do
what they feel like they're global and
scale I mean this is the extreme
opposite of what's been called
libertarian everywhere in the world
since the Enlightenment and that's
what's called libertarian here so yeah
it is hard to talk
here because like you can't use words
like libertarian or conservative or
anything because they've all come to
take their opposite meaning as for Adam
Smith and wealth of nations well you
know first of all the idea of the
unsubsidized not state subsidized
capitalism we don't even have to bother
talking about that it it has existed
that exists in a good part of the third
world which is why the third world looks
the way it does it has never existed in
any developed society for a very simple
reason the Roth in the powerful won't
wow just as Adam Smith understood they
will use the levers of power to make
sure that state power subsidizes them
that's why the England developed that's
why the United States developed that's
why France developed that's what Germany
developed that's why Japan developed and
in fact every developed society has
developed just that way that's one of
the cliches of economic history the so
we don't talk about that because it's
non-existent it never will exist except
for people who have it rammed down their
throats not am I in favor of it that's
another question like in some mythical
world what I like to see less a fair
capitalism well only under the
conditions described by Adam Smith the
real item Smith you know the one who
wrote Wealth of Nations not the one you
worship before but the one who wrote it
and if you look at his argument for
markets it's pretty clear I mean maybe
the arguments right maybe it's wrong
that's clear what it was the argument
was I repeat that under conditions of
perfect liberty markets will lead the
perfect equality
that's why markets are good he said they
will lead to perfect equality and they
will not force people to subject
themselves to outside orders so they
become less than human so that you know
the artisan receives well the art
improves is the Tocqueville put it yeah
if that were possible maybe so but it's
not in the cart and I don't know if that
argument works anyway it probably
doesn't you know the argument was
fallacious but if but the goal was clear
the goal was a society based on
Enlightenment values which is just
radically opposed
- what today are called libertarian
values here in the United States so
there you have to be clear about what
you're talking about
but you're right as I use the terms it
sounds contradictory in the United
States like it also sounds contradictory
in the United States when people ask me
what I think about conservatism and I
say I think I'm probably one of the few
conservatives around because I actually
believe in traditional values I don't
know anybody on public arena who does so
I don't know the extent to determine any
meaning I'm probably conservative but
that doesn't mean much we have to start
by decoding a whole system of the you
know intellectual distortion before you
can even talk that's that itself is a
big achievement
you know if terms have lost their
meaning well you know becomes impossible
to thought
