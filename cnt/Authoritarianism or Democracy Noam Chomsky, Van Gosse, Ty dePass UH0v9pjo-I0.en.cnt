good evening and welcome to our webinar
on
authoritarianism or democracy sponsored
by massachusetts peace
action and the campaign for peace
disarmament and common security
my name's jackie king i'm a board member
of mass peace action
and editor of its newsletter i'll be
your moderator tonight
we come together at a key moment in our
nation's history
the coronavirus pandemic has turned our
society inside out
it has not only exposed the inadequacies
of our privatized
fragmented health care system but has
also laid
bare the deep racial and class
disparities in access to decent health
care and economic security
at the same time the police murder of
george floyd
caught on camera by a brave teenager has
captured the attention of the whole
world
and fired a nationwide uprising against
police brutality
and systemic racism unlike anything
we've seen in decades
these events come against a backdrop of
a president who is propelling our
country
in a direction that goes beyond the
forms of governance that have prevailed
for most of our lives
and toward a more openly authoritarian
form of rule
we see armed militias descending on
state capitals to threaten lawmakers and
demand reopening
we see suppression of voting rights in
states across the country
firing of inspected inspectors general
from
federal departments stacking of courts
with young right-wing judges we see the
continued
brutalizing and murder of unarmed black
men
and women by the police and the
president calling on federal troops to
attack
peaceful demonstrators and quell
protests
we see a president who has threatened
not to leave
office if he is defeated in november
we have three speakers with us tonight
who have a long history of shining a
light on injustice
first is noam chomsky laureate professor
of linguistics
at the university of arizona and
professor emeritus of
mit he has long been a leading critic
of u.s foreign policy neoliberalism
and political corruption at home and
abroad
van gaas is a professor of history at
franklin and marshall college
after writing about the new left
movement of movements for some years
he now studies black politics between
the revolution and the
civil war he has been active in peace
and solidarity work since the 1980s
working with sis pace peace action and
united for peace and justice
he has helped found historians against
the war
now h-pad in 2003.
ty de pass born in new york was an
anti-race activist
in boston in the 1970s and 80s
he is now a member of simple justice in
columbus
in columbia south carolina and dj's
latin caribbean dance music
drawing inspiration from cuban
independence fighter
antonio maseo
each of them will speak for about 15
minutes
and if you have questions or comments
during their talks
please put them in the q a tool near the
chat
box on your screen after all three have
spoken
will open up for just discussion and
questions for the last 45 minutes
cole harrison our executive director
will moderate that discussion
and now i'll turn it over to noam
chomsky
thank you very sorry i
can't be with you in person but i have
to live with what
the way the dice roll
uh this particular conference is
focusing on an issue that arises against
uh
complex and uh threatening
background we happen to be living at a
moment of human history which is not a
remarkable
but in fact unique that we're living at
a moment of
confluence of this
significant range of crises all
converging
uh at least four major ones
other less major uh each of them
deserves
extensive discussion there's no time
i'll
only be able to barely mention them and
touch the surface
and try to place the issue of
authoritarian authoritarianism
within that context let's begin with the
least dangerous of the four
the pandemic which is now wrecking the
economy
killing already 130 000 people
the united states is almost alone in the
world
become a pariah state and that it's out
of control
other states are containing it one way
or another
uh it's uh it's surely going to have a
major impact on the nature of the
society
it's very likely that another pandemic
will come
unless you take steps to prevent it
and that means looking at what caused
this pandemic
and in fact we are now in a situation
somewhat like 2003 after the sars
epidemic
when uh scientists warned
that there'll be another one probably
more serious
it was a coronavirus epidemic and
sketched out the means that we
should use to prevent it they were not
pursued for reasons which still
obtained and we should pay some
attention to them
one was simple capitalist logic
the drug companies aren't interested in
their they follow the rules that say
try to make profit tomorrow and don't
spend money
don't waste money on some tragedy that
might occur in a couple of years
so they're out by capitalist logic which
still prevails
then comes the neoliberal
assault on the society for 40 years
following reagan's slogan famous slogan
government is not the solution well
actually government does most of the
work basic work on
creating vaccines and drugs but it's not
supposed to be involved in the uh
area of marketing and profit-making
that goes into the private sector so
government was blocked
then comes the malevolence and
incompetence of particular leaders what
happened in the united states since
2016 is shocking no time to go through
it but the us was singularly
unprepared all of these factors remain
unless we deal with them another
probably worse pandemic is coming
and those who have created the system
from which we are now suffering are
working hard
relentlessly to try to ensure that it
remains
even in a harsher form with greater
surveillance
and control that's happening before our
eyes
well let's take a look at the other
three now to take a look at those let's
go back to last january
as you know every january the
scientists political analysts assess
the world security situation and
encapsulate it in the setting of the
doomsday clock
uh every year since trump has been in
office
the the minute hand of the doomsday
clock has gone closer to midnight
every year two years ago it reached the
closest point it has ever been since
1947
dropping after the dropping of the item
bombs
this year analysts gave up
on minutes they turned to second 100
seconds to midnight
and they gave the same three reasons
they had in the past
one is the growing threat of nuclear war
which is terminal for the species second
the growing threat of climate change
global warming which is re threatening
to reach
catastrophic dimensions basically the
end of organized human life on earth
and the third the deterioration of
democracy
why does that belong there because it's
only
if we have a vibrant functioning
democracy in which people can informed
population can become
engaged in affairs of state
in public affairs of the matters that
concern them
it's only under those conditions that we
can hope to deal
with the existential crises so what has
happened to these three crises
since january they've all been made
worse
coming from the white house the
arms control trump has continued on his
program
of dismantling the arms control regime
which has offered some degree of
security
against terminal war open sky's treaty
dismantled the
inf treaty had already been destroyed uh
the
administration is now providing entirely
frivolous reasons
to try to prevent uh negotiation of the
new start treaty the last major treaty
of the three which is due for
negotiation in february that'll probably
go
if they're in office the administration
is now
considering the first nuclear tests
to break the since 1992 breaking that
agreement
all of this is raising complete euphoria
and the arms industry they're
delighted with the public money that's
pouring into them the
chances to produce new weapons to
destroy us all
to encourage advertisers to do the same
so down the road they get even bigger
contracts to try to
create some protection of course in vain
against the
uh the weapon systems that they're
creating and encouraging adversaries to
create
that's what's happening in the arms
control what about
global warming same thing on the
every in the president's february 2020
budget
pandemic is raging president presents
its budget
continued defunding of the center for
disease control
and every other health related element
of the of the government
has been doing that every single year it
continues
in the course of the pandemic and it's
compensated by
increased spending for the military
and for fossil fuel industries to try to
accelerate the race to destruction on
all fronts
that's the federal budget meanwhile the
corporate executives he's appointed to
supervise destruction of the environment
are hard at work very quietly changing
regulations
deregulating eliminating controls
on that somehow mitigate
part of the harmful effect of pouring
co2 into the environment
and also that protects the population
some of them the
malice is almost indescribable
so very quietly regulations were
eliminated
that limit air pollution this is in the
middle
of a respiratory crisis
which is greatly extended by air
pollution
in particular places in the places where
people live near polluting plants
because they have no choice who are they
blacks puerto ricans uh people who don't
matter
they vote the wrong way we can get rid
of them tens of thousands are put at
risk
all very quiet uh what about
deterioration of democracy
well as jackie pointed out it's
preceding
the pace the executive branch of the
government has been
totally neutralized barely exists it's
down to a group of
psychopaths cowardly psychopaths who
don't dare to offend the master
the latest step has been to fire the
uh the district the federal district
attorney for the southern
region of new york because he was
starting to get too
close to investigating the swamp
that trump has created in washington he
was continuing the work of the
inspectors general
who were totally purged a couple of
weeks ago because they're pursuing the
same objective
not a peep from concord from the
republican congress
nothing even when trump went out of his
way
to humiliate one of their senior members
charles grassley who had spent his
career in trying to establish the
inspector's general
office next step which is already
reported
may will take place is a pending purge
of the military
of the top military there are some of
them are speaking out of line
trying to get rid of them they're
supporting the protests
so let's purge them and make sure that
the military
is completely in the hands of loyalists
this is not a minor matter
for reasons that jackie mentioned before
about what might happen in november
well all of this is happening well
on the streets of the country there's an
astonishing
event taking place completely without
precedent
there have been protests over police
killings before
nothing remotely like this and the scale
level of public support which is
overwhelming
uh solidarity black white solidarity
and the fact that it's looking beyond
the specific crime of police killing
to its roots in 400 years of
vicious repression that have left a grim
legacy that
has to be dismantled if there's any hope
for a revival of democracy now this is
against another background
white supremacy is a very serious issue
in the united states
enormous issue uh to go back to 2016
uh 20 percent of terrorism-related
threats and actions were attributed by
the
federal authorities to white supremacy
2018
it was 98 that's three years of trouble
2019 according to christopher wray
fbi director it went even higher
almost all white supremacy
terrorist threats and actions
stimulated by rhetoric from the white
house
constant this is a situation we're now
facing
uh contending forces or what will emerge
from the pandemic is going to determine
the fate of human society
there are sharply contending forces
those that are seeking to impose partial
a harsher regime
of the kind that has led to these crises
those who are struggling against it
the outcome of this struggle is going to
determine
whether the human experiment can
continue
down the road
thank you uh
thank you for that cogent and sobering
analysis um
all right but the path forward
we'll get to that later um
all right um van gaas
you are up thank you
um we should be clear at the outset
the united states has never lived up to
the core premises
of liberal or parliamentary democracy
which are
the rule of law applied equally to all
citizens
and majority rule through free and fair
elections
majorities do not rule in this country
basic citizenship rights whether the
right to vote
or to be secure in one's own person are
routinely violated
instead of automatic voter registration
and a single national register
3 000 county authorities administer
elections as they see
fit we have locked up millions of black
and brown men and women for minor
offensive
offenses and as bad as national police
forces can be we have something even
worse
eighteen thousand separate policing
agencies
most of which require hardly any vetting
or training
before authorizing someone like derek
chovin
to use deadly force and yet
since the 1960s we have made advances
towards actual democracy on many fronts
we
have something to protect which is why
this present conjuncture is so fraught
in an essay this spring i argue that the
united states was on a tipping point
towards outright authoritarian rule
and that in the second trump
administration the u.s will move sharply
towards
ill-liberal democracy which is the
self-description
for a new model of authoritarian
governance sweeping large parts of the
world
from india to brazil turkey russia and
various central european states
in an illiberal democracy a temporary
electoral majority uses its grip on
power
to subvert the main institutions of the
state and civil society
the independent media the judiciary
the police the civil service all the
while
a facade of electoral democracy is
maintained with multi-party elections
a parliament that debates in some
toleration of dissent
but the essence of democratic rule is
regularly regularly violated
in each case the winning party has
polarized popular sentiment via appeals
to xenophobic
nativist religious or ethnoracial
phobias
muslims are the target in india roma and
sinti
in hungary jews and lgbt people
in poland the indigenous in brazil
kurds in turkey a whole rainbow of
foreign people supposedly
in the us and russia what form will a
liberal democracy take here if trump
wins again
pundits have sketched many bad things
that might happen but those scenarios
presumed the basic structures of the u.s
state
continue functioning under republican
rule
my presumption is different i think
those structures will be
pulverized and a fundamentally lawless
regime will set about maintaining itself
in power
while pretending to democratic norms
indeed this assault on democracy is
already happening
so far it is aimed mainly at people who
are not trump loyalists
but hold some real power the governor of
michigan
or officials in the so-called deep state
meaning the federal civil service
in a second trump administration
democratic functioning will be attacked
in four stages
one complete the takeover of the
judiciary
two plant loyalists in all decision
making posts in the state apparatus
three green light paramilitary violence
fourth seize control of the state's
monopoly on legitimate coercion via the
police
implementing this progression does not
require the tropes of dictatorship
tanks in the streets and thousands
jailed overnight
trump would let the new york times
publish and the mechanisms of
parliamentary representation would
continue
democrats would remain in congress in
some state houses
because their impotent voices would
legitimize republicans staying in power
by any means necessary let's start with
the judiciary which has been a bulwark
against early trump excesses
any basic reading of u.s history teaches
that the modern federal judiciary
will at least guarantee rights even as
the burger
rehnquist and roberts courts turned
rightward the warren court's precedents
were presumed to hold
in part because new rights were
sometimes added as in decisions
extending protections
to lgbtq people but meanwhile a long
series of rulings enabling racialized
mass incarceration escape notice these
go back to the 80s
so that by the time michelle alexander's
the new jim crow appeared in 2011
the damage was already done now the
court has turned to eviscerating
democratic rights
shelby v holder in 2013 ruled key parts
of the 1965 voting rights act
unconstitutional
the 2019 ruchov v common cause
decision stipulated that i quote
partisan gerrymandering
claims partisan gerrymandering claims
present
political questions beyond the reach of
the federal courts
unquote these were huge setbacks
to democratic protections we have
counted on for half a century
and then came the court's april 2020
refusal to block
wisconsin republicans attempted mass
disfranchisement
which clarified that we are in the
middle of a judicial counter-revolution
we now have a court like that which
permitted jim crow's apparatus of
disfranchisement
from the 1870s to the 1940s during which
the 14th
amendment's guarantees of equal
protection and due process
explicitly did not apply to the states
as long as poll taxes and literacy tests
were nominally
non-racial they were permitted similarly
in the 21st century
it seems voter identification laws
purges of voter rolls
and blatant gerrymanders will be
permitted under almost any circumstance
the second trump administration the
supreme court
already under right-wing control will be
further undermined
retirement of the remaining liberal
justices
two more of his own to appoint trump
will not have to worry about john
roberts protecting his legacy as he has
done lately in a few cases
that judicial purge will be extended to
the entire federal bench
as signaled by mcconnell already
pressuring judges
lots of them to retire so trump can
replace them
in this new world there will be no
possibility of judicial review or
restraint
and the remaining independent judges
will be subjected to public and private
intimidation
once mcconnell has consolidated this
takeover we will move
back to a world of constant quasi-legal
repression
grand jury indictments tax and fraud
prosecutions
weaponizing the irs against political
group groups and individual activists
a barrage of injunctions to block
protests strikes
and efforts by local and state
governments to resist trump
moving on to the state apparatus since
2017
trump has steadily undermined structures
of government that benefit ordinary
people
whether osha the centers for disease
control the national labor relations
board
the departments of housing and urban
development education and labor
the national park service or the epa all
have been corrupted
current attempts to destroy the postal
service and politicize the census are
the most visible illustrations of this
attack
trump's special targets however are
those government agencies
that enforce laws domestically and abide
by norms and agreements internationally
he has moved to turn the fbi the justice
department the state department in the
entire
intelligence apparatus from institutions
accountable to congress
which at least gives us some purchase on
them
to enforces of his personal agenda until
now the fbi has tried to maintain its
legitimacy
but if trump games november they will
become his personal police
with trump acting as the new j edgar
hoover any individual organization
will be fair game for infiltration
disruption suppression and blackmail at
the white house's
behest trump's enemies and the
democratic party the press and the state
apparatus will be the first priority
targets many people will disappear from
public life
and the campaign that will make nixon's
enemies list look small scale
once the mainstream is knocked down the
left is next in line
and then of course there are the police
violent policing aimed at people of
color and political dissenters
is a deep-rooted feature of u.s history
but the systemic impact of that coercion
has been curtailed
by the dispersed structure of our
policing system
a national paramilitary police force
directed from the white house
and armed with extremely advanced
military weaponry would be new and
exceptionally dangerous
this potential was signaled in february
when trump sent what is essentially a
military force
the border patrol tactical unit or
bortak which has
tanks into sanctuary cities to work with
ice
beyond that what will happen if ice or
fbi agents start arresting his most
outspoken opponents
do not presume the blue states are safe
would new york
or chicago police departments actually
disarm federal officers
who started rounding up black and latino
city council members or members of
congress
in this scenario trump would appeal to
the thin blue line to come to his aid
and armed men in uniform answer his call
in the blue states
while red state governors and
legislatures respond enthusiastically
at that point it will not matter that
there is no constitutional for a
president
constitutional authority for a president
seizing control of local police he will
just
do it the final possibility signaling a
dissent
into actual fascism would be outright
political violence condoned from the top
we have not seen that kind of politics
since the routine floggings and killings
of black and white republicans during
reconstruction
the bundys occupation of federal lands
nazi gangs marching through
charlottesville
and gun rights rallies at state capitals
featuring men in body armor with
automatic weapons
are now escalating into armed parades
and streets and legislative chambers
we need to take this systematic
aggression seriously
every day i get emails from websites
like conservativedaily.com
calling schumer and pelosi traitors all
the time
trump rose to power suggesting that his
opponent should be locked up
last year he regularly stoked crowds
chanting send her back
against representative ilhan omar
how long before zealots act on that
language and give traders what they
deserve
all of these possibilities are already
moving forward
regarding the judiciary look at the past
month trump has appointed his 200th
federal lifetime
judge mcconnell has put an unqualified
protege justin walker onto the dc
circuit court
on june 24th a trump appointee to that
court naomi rao
issued an opinion preemptively freeing
michael flynn
finally in advance of a possible defeat
mcconnell
is continuing to push all of the bush
one and two appointees to retire
so he can replace them with federalist
society apparatchiks
this is a creeping coup with
consequences that will last decades
trump's desire to use armed force
against americans is unslate
it took exceptional interventions by his
secretary of defense
and the us's chief military officer
general mark milley
to block trump from invoking the 1807
insurrection act
and send elite units like the 82nd
airborne onto the streets of the capital
he did deploy hundreds of unidentified
heavily armed men from various federal
agencies
while 11 republican republican governors
sent their national guards to his aid
then we have the police the weeks since
george floyd's murder
have clarified to all the extent to
which the police minneapolis and
philadelphia and new york
are a hyper-militarized law unto
themselves
authoritarianism right in our midst all
the time
as for the rising danger of armed gangs
every day in small town papers or on
twitter you can find
pictures of white nationalist militias
parading where i vote in lancaster
county pennsylvania
the carlisle light infantry so-called
invaded peaceful elizabethtown on june 6
during a black lives matter rally
they took up firing positions on
rooftops while the police stood by
behind each of these present days and
future threats lies a single fact
which is that the republican party has
consolidated around
white nationalist obscurantist even
nihilist politics
four years ago that party's rightist
based
swept away all the other candidates to
put trump into nomination
but really telling was how respectable
upper middle class republicans
rallied to trump even faster than they
had lined up behind romney in 2012.
in any political universe before 2016
the world of dole the bushes mccain
romney even reagan
few would have imagined such a
development but it was percolating under
our feet all the while
the republican party has become
functionally a party of the far
hard right obviously massachusetts
governor charlie baker and what's left
of new england republicanism
are a different breed but it doesn't
matter because neither governor baker
nor his voters have demonstrated any
willingness to break with their national
party
and until they do that it doesn't matter
how moderate they are
so here's a painful conclusion too many
of us
i include myself on the left thought we
had banished our nation's specters of
violent lawless cruelty
and naked authoritarian rule over
captive peoples
but those ghosts did not accept their
defeat they weren't ghosts at all
they simply remade themselves into a new
institutional form the
today's republican party as the
successor to the old southern democrats
the party of white supremacy
as they call themselves which controlled
the states of the confederacy from the
1890s to the 1960s with no opposition
perverting democracy certainly
there are grounds for hope right now on
a wide range of issues
the u.s is shifting to the left not only
the sea change among whites regarding
black lives matter
and the realities of systemic racism but
also the well of support for a socialist
presidential candidate
and thoroughly social democratic
policies a green new deal
medicare for all finally confronting the
great idol of u.s politics the military
budget
looking around the world however
authoritarian regimes usually come to
power because the left is surging
posing a real challenge to existing
elites whether in italy or the 1920s
or brazil in the 1960s conservatives who
formerly abided
by the norms of parliamentary rule
allied with the authoritarian right with
the generals
to preserve their own social and
economic power
is that not what we have been living
through not just since january 20th 2017
but for decades which is the right which
is to say reagan republicans joined by
southern white people
foresaw the nation shifting towards a
functioning multiracial democracy
obama's presidency was the red flag for
them
for the first time since 1964 a democrat
won majorities of the popular vote
not once but twice as the hip-hop group
public enemy prophesied back in the
reagan years
it was fear of a black planet that drove
them then and drives them now
what is to be done right now trump's
election seems unlikely
and there are too many sighs of relief
being breathed all around us
but we cannot ignore ignore that he
might again pull a rabbit out of the hat
meaning an electoral college majority
his unique campaigning skills plus a
real or manufactured crisis could pull
the phalanx of republicans back into
line
his party is planning to mobilize fifty
thousand monitors
so-called recruited from police and
veterans
to intimidate voters at the polls the
covet 19 pandemic is generating massive
confusion in electoral administration
and could suppress in-person voting
millions may find the untested
procedures for vote by mail a stumbling
block
in the end all trump's needs is perhaps
44
of that those who actually vote and that
assumes
that um they don't proceed to a
combination of legislative and judicial
coups
so i will wrap by up by offering my
opinion on what we need to be doing
i think all of us need to focus
intensely and sharply on election
protection
in every possible instance and that
includes
confronting in a respectful but really
serious way
the republicans we know if i was in
massachusetts or maryland i would
organize delegations bipartisan
delegations to talk
to your moderate republican governors
and say you must speak
up you must put yourself forward you
cannot say
i won't vote for him you need to move
your party away from this
threat myself this is where i will end
i'm part of a new organization called
wait can you see it is it not
faculty for voting rights
is it reversed you can see it looks
right
it's good faculty for votingrights.org
faculty for votingrights.org we're
organizing hundreds of faculty
around the country to support an ally in
solidarity with our students to protect
their right to vote
after african-american students are the
most suppressed group in the country and
they will be under special duress
because of massive closing of colleges
so if you're a faculty member
you know faculty members send them to
facultyforvotingrights.org
i'll end on that note let's go out and
defend democracy
yes here here thank you for that rousing
end
after uh given what we're confronting
um all right we'll we'll wait for
further discussion later um so now i'm
gonna turn it over to you ty
uh welcome from south carolina
thank you i'm hearing a red state
where it isn't the heat it's the
stupidity
um so i'm glad that nom and van
kind of picked up a lot of stuff that
set the frame for this discussion so i
don't have to do it
so i'm just going to go ahead into where
what i've been doing and what
really has been um shaping my life for
the last
50 some years uh
simple justice for people's information
is the
black lives matter chapter here in
and the midlands and right now we're
working on a uh
no bail no pre-trial detention campaign
or at least we were until covered here
so
let me kick off on an early morning in
july 1980
14 year old levi hart was shot and
killed by boston police officer richard
brooke jr
following a police chase of the stolen
car
two other black youth were arrested at
the scene
epd officials claimed that hart
attempted to grab bork's gun
and was killed when the gun accidentally
discharged during the scuffle
however in addition to the gunshot wound
in his head
hart's autopsy disclosed another injury
a skull fracture from a blunt object
at the july 28th inquest judge richard l
banks found that hart's death
was the result of quote an unlawful act
sending the case to the suffolk county
grand jury which then declined to indict
work on any charges
likewise a federal grand jury convened
by the u.s
justice department could find no
probable cause to indict ork
now charged with violating heart civil
rights
now in the day of hearts inquest i was
among the hundred or so
roxbury residents gathered outside the
district court in dudley square
at one point i was hovering at the edge
of the crowd surveying the scene
less than 10 feet away overheard two
cops commenting on the gathering
you have to understand that these people
all live in a garbage can
the older cop said sourly and our job is
sitting on the lake
sadly this revelation wasn't shocking at
all
not at all believing the outcome
absolving him of culpability
work was not only unrepentant but
feeling aggrieved
cops have no civil rights or complain
bitterly
in an interview with boston globe
following the acquittals
people care more if someone like this
kid gets killed
they've immortalized him the kid is a
hero to some people
it doesn't matter that he was a punk
of the nine police shootings of unarmed
teenagers in boston's past
one resulting in prison time wrote globe
contributor
eric levinson in 2015 of the nine
teenagers shot in these accounts
three were white one was hispanic and
five were black eight of these shootings
were fatal
and three led to criminal charges
against an officer
but just one case resulted in a prison
sentence
now in a state of similar incidents
since levi hearts murder
unarmed black men women and children
have been gunned down
tasered choked out or brutally
manhandled in parks
parking lots on the street and in their
backyards or bedrooms
in most instances officers involved
either
evaded prosecution or granted acquittals
or in rare instances received shamefully
minimal
sentences and contrary to police
testimony the victims were unarmed
and posed no clear or immediate danger
to police or bystanders
so what is a reasonable person to make
of a legal system that seems incapable
of dispensing justice
for black people or other people of
color
perhaps these tragedies aren't a glitch
the regrettable
excesses of rogue cops bad apples but
represent an essential feature
baked into our criminal injustice system
from its very beginning in the colonial
period
indeed given a sober examination of u.s
history
that reasonable person might conclude
that the police and courts are less
invested in protecting
human life in serving communities than
preserving long-standing
disparate arrangements of wealth social
status and political power
arrangements that have conspicuously
benefited the nation's white
capitalist elite at the expense of all
other classes and social groups
a deeper dive into the history of u.s
nation building
the u.s nation building project reveals
that racism and global capitalism
emerged as conjoined twins
in the early 16th century as evidenced
in the infamous triangular trade
sugar manufactured groups goods and
slave africans it's serial wars of
conquest
displacement and cultural erasure in the
name of manifest destiny
the legal and extra-legal enforcement of
the color line
through fugitive slave laws black codes
and jim crow segregation
and its enthusiastic embrace of a white
man's burden
in pursuit of global empire at each step
to along the path to global domination
u.s military and local police forces
have defended
the racist and an oppressive status quo
from all
enemies foreign and domestic and thanks
to the military equipment funneled to
local pds through the federal
1033 program and the cultivated warrior
mentality
it's getting increasingly difficult to
tell the forces apart
because even the u.s department of
education has its own heavily armed swat
team
if you're currently in default on your
student loan
be afraid be very afraid
now as a black man active in peace and
justice movement since the social summit
of the 1960s i've come to view history
of racial justice as a perverse dance
one step forward two steps back
emancipation
black codes jim crow civil rights laws
law and order white backlash a black man
in the white house
the tea party donald trump each hard-run
concession was followed by a violent
pushback
often aided and best embedded by police
forces in the courts
in the past civil rights era white
america's position on racial matters has
largely reflected a
new consensus a liberal conservative
accord reached during the clinton
george h w bush presidential contest of
1992.
at the time both political parties were
seeking support from the emerging
white suburban middle class majority
some of whom
were the blue collar reagan democrats
interviewed by democratic pollster
stan greenberg these people
based their middle class identity on the
ability to avoid living near
socializing with or working beside black
people
this new consensus became the official
bipartisan narrative
of the post civil rights era actively
and aggressively building on positions
promoted by
the nixon reagan bush and clinton
administrations
indeed even a casual observable note
that bill clinton did more to dismantle
the tenuous social contracts of the new
deal
in great society in six years than
reagan and bush had accomplished in 12.
echoing the positions previously
championed by neoconservative
intellectuals and successive
republican and democrat administrations
adherence to this consensus assert
one that liberal social initiatives of
the 60s
were not only ineffective but
destructive of the black community
and were still unfair to innocent whites
two that black urban unrest and rising
incidents of blood
drug use and street crime justified
strong measures to restore law and order
measures resulting in the blanket
criminalization of the african-american
community
that is in any random police encounter
black people were to be presumed guilty
three that the black community was
essentially
two nations separate and unequal which
pitted
the deserving black middle class against
their pathological cousins
also known as the predatory and
pathological underclass
and lastly four that redeeming this
deviant black underclass would involve
quote changing their values turning to
the black
bourgeoisie for solutions and applying
hard-nosed
policing and punishment this comes from
an article
by uh historian and social critic
michael dawson
and i suggested folks follow his work
some historians refer to the civil
rights movement of the 1950s and 60s as
a second reconstruction
building on the long ignored guarantees
of the 13th
14th and 15th amendments demanding that
the nation
finally live up to the four pr
the four freedoms posed by fdr in his
1941 state of the union address
freedom of speech freedom of religion
freedom from want
freedom from fear in 1963 king alluded
to these qualities as part of a balanced
promissory norm and by 1967 king
insisted that we should remain
dissatisfied
until these promises were redeemed
posing the inevitable question what is
to be done
raises a host of other more fundamental
questions
we live in a society where our
understanding of law and justice is
shaped by the three r's
revenge retaliation and retribution
driven by the need to pursue solutions
preserving power over
rather than embracing the notion of
power with
a widespread culture fear stoked by the
cynical partisan motivations
and junk food journalism contribute to
the weaponization
of 9-1-1 and the frequent instances of
casually violent and abusive police
behavior
for trivial offenses the growing cause
to defund the police
recognizes the sad fact that
most of the reform measures proposed by
the political establishment
from body cams to use of force
guidelines to civilian review boards
have been tried before and ultimately
circumvented or diluted to the point of
uselessness
meaningful change will bubble up from
the streets rather than trickling down
from the political establishment
and will require a sober and thorough
re-examination of the mission
tactics and composition of law
enforcement
and judging by the findings of numerous
recent studies
of police forces in major cities the
time
and effort normally devoted to
suppression of violent crime
constituting almost negative negligible
portion
of most cops everyday activities
indeed given the fact that policing is
inherently reactive
and rarely involves responding to some
violent offender
a strong case can be made for
transferring many 911 calls
to community-based social services or
medical professionals
it certainly strongly suggested
departments can
safely demilitarize and redeploy
without any appreciable spike in violent
crime
and because policing consumes a huge
portion of most municipal budgets
cost savings can be readily redirected
towards services that affirm and build
community
rewriting the three r's to now read as
respect
redemption and reconciliation good sense
suggests that what's most needed is
greater appreciation for the attributes
of trust and respect
each of which ideally serve as social
lubricants
combined with the values of mutual
obligation accountability
the social glue that holds everything
together notably our 40 years under
neo-liberalism
has attacked each of those values in
turn
today the demand from the street is for
a third reconstruction a comprehensive
dismantling of
all systems of arbitrary social control
class and racial oppression
led by a broad multi-issue multi-racial
united front
that makes no apologies and accepts no
excuses
by the way uh as we
pursue our defunding of the police
demand
we should expect we'll soon be dropping
the other shoe defunding the us military
and that's neat
thank you
okay um
thank you very much for all of those
comments
um so before
i turn this over to cole uh i thought i
would
use my prerogative as moderator and
ask one question myself which
uh was prompted by something i read
in an interview with noam chomsky um
uh recently uh but it's really
could be a question for all of you which
um
gnome you you had said that the
the sanders campaign should be viewed as
a great success
because it shifted the entire national
conversation
and brought to the four ideas which had
previously been marginalized like the
green new deal
and health care for all and free public
higher education and um
uh mass peace action endorsed sanders
and worked
worked on his campaign um
uh in a recent interview you uh
you agreed with sanders decision to um
to support biden and worked for his
election and um
i'm just wondering what what you
have to say about that and what advice
you might have for people
uh along those lines
you know there is a traditional
left tradition which has been
unfortunately pretty much forgotten
uh that is uh we can contrast
two views about elections there's an
establishment view
which says elections are the
he all and end-all of politics
you show up every four years you pick
one or another person of the ruling
class
then you go home and you're finished
that's one view the other view is that
politics
real politics is constant dedicated
activism every day to change things
uh just take the green new deal that
didn't get there by
voting somebody it was uh
a lot of young environmental activists
particularly the sunrise movement
sat in on congressional offices uh
got support from some of the young
representatives especially alexandria
ocasio-cortez who'd been
swept in on the sanders wave managed to
get ed markey to agree find it moved to
the legislative
center of legislative attention some
form of new
green new deal is essential for survival
but we can duplicate this in case after
the case
but what about elections uh every couple
of years something comes along called an
election
so you take 10 minutes uh you take a
look and see
is there a significant difference
between the candidates
if there is you take another 10 minutes
and vote against
the worst one rarely for anybody
you try to get the worst one out then
get back to real politics
that's essentially what sanders is doing
he uh
his campaign is an activist campaign
he inspired and brought together uh
activist groups that have been
developing for years inspired others
kept at it uh their activities and
his he and his associates have joined
the campaign have in fact
oppressed the democratic program
uh farther to the left than
any in in memory maybe back to fdui
not because the dnc or joe biden decided
on it because they were pressed too
and if that real politics continues you
can press further
uh so that's those are our choices
you come november you basically have two
there's no choice of not participating
in the campaign
but that's just not a choice like if you
decide i'm not going to vote because i
don't like either of them
that gives trump an extra vote takes one
away from the opposition
same as what extra vote for trump uh so
you
make your decision uh can you spend 10
minutes trying to get rid of the worst
guy
and in this case i should say the
difference between the candidates is an
absolute chasm on every front
from military destruction to destruction
of the environment
to packing the judiciary to
destroying the political system
to encouraging white supremacy everyone
there's
the difference is a chasm so decide
whether you want to spend
10 minutes blocking the real horror
if you manage to do it then get to work
on
real politics which doesn't mean showing
up every four years
it means working constantly all the time
the way
for example sunrise mother did it and
many others who've
changed the world that's what it looks
like to me
yes uh tai
or van would you like to respond to that
or hold off for i see we have many more
questions
in the chat box so
i just say that v-o-t-e isn't the only
way to spell
politics
yes indeed okay cole
take it away
okay so we have a number of questions
thanks to everyone
and as a reminder please put your
questions in the q a tool which is in
the bottom of your zoom window
kevin costa richard rytan and
steve schnapp all ask in different words
that particularly gnome and van paint a
bleakly ominous picture
how are we going to turn this around we
need strategic suggestions
to be able to implement our theories of
change that center on broad-based
multi-racial mass movements what are the
elements of a strategy
to turn back the authoritarian right
that could be to any one of you three
well why don't you pick it up then
thank you if you're muted on van
okay but one of the people asking that
is is a colleague of mine in lancaster
and i think that in lancaster
pennsylvania you have an extremely good
example of what you can do
lancaster stands up as one of the
strongest grassroots multiracial
working-class base left organizations in
the whole country
um intensely radical and intensely
pragmatic
not having pointless debates about being
in or outside or
the democratic party just moving forward
and the lesson i've learned from them
from lancaster stands up and which is
now pennsylvania stands up
is you have to do this all the time
you cannot get focused on one single
charismatic or moving presidential
candidate
on the rare occasions when the left in
my lifetime is mobilized around
elections and they have been rare
that's what it's been as much as i
remember with great
appreciation reverend jackson that's
what we did
the model should be doing politics all
the time and that includes actually
doing electoral
and legislative politics all the time
the republicans have gained us
from here all the way because they do it
all the time they go for every office
we the left the left needs to compete at
every level
all the time school boards city councils
line officers as we call them in
pennsylvania not because elections are
the sum of politics but
these are all spaces where we can claim
room
and then move on out and link up with
social movements and the people in the
social movements
need to go into office but remain
accountable to the social movements
we need to start acting more like left
parties in europe and many other parts
of the world i don't mean to focus on
europe
where the person put into office by the
movement party
is accountable to that party their
salary goes to the party and this party
pays them what they think is reasonable
and they can be replaced so that's
that's what i think we need is we need a
full court press at every level of
government
in close and constant contact with
mobilized communities not separate from
them
not individualized um candidacies that
rely on personal charisma and integrity
which may be real but will not carry us
forward
i just think after that i agree with it
that
real politics not only includes
uh making sure that you take over city
councils
legislatures everything that the
republicans have done and
we haven't been doing but also fighting
on other
in other areas like unless
traditionally the labor movement has
been in the forefront
of struggles for social justice
reagan and thatcher knew what they were
doing when their first
acts were to try to destroy the labor
movement
and for us our one major act should be
to help revive it
now that can be done there's been a
dramatic
increase in strikes the last couple of
years
in very interesting ways in red states
like arizona where i am very anti-labor
state
the teachers organized to try
not to just get salaries raised
which is important because they're
rotten but to get better
education for students for kids to get
funding for the schools you know
decent programs uh and they had enormous
public support
and have gotten somewhere uh same in
west virginia
that's led to labor actions elsewhere
uh i'm old enough to remember the 1930s
the depression hit in 1929.
took about five years for the labor
movement to get revitalized
when it did with cio organizing
sit-down strikes led to a huge change
and i think we're beginning to see that
in many different ways
not just by strikes and labor actions
but even by
building work enterprises
which offer opportunities for workers to
essentially
not only run their own lives but to
change consciousness
about the nature of something as deep as
the labor contract
so why should anybody be compelled to
rent themselves
for most of their working life at smoke
working hours
to tyrants i mean you'll go back to the
early 19th century 19th century early
industrial revolution workers regarded
that as
an abomination okay i think that can be
recovered
one of the things the green new deal
will do it's carried out properly
is offer a wide range of opportunities
for uh popu for worker
based enterprises to do things ranging
from
weatherization to solar panel
installation
to all the way up to we should seriously
think about this to socializing
the fossil fuel industries and
moving them towards termination because
if they
continue we're not going to survive all
of these things are possible
and in fact some of them will become
pretty close if i go back to
2009 president obama
virtually nationalized the auto industry
took it all over well there were choices
and if the left had been active it could
have been a different
outcome one choice the one that was
taken
was for the public to pay for it
and then to hand it back to the former
owners maybe
new faces but the same basically the
same people
and to continue with activities that are
devastating life and destroying the
environment like jamming the road with
cars
there was an alternative turn it over to
the workforce
and the communities let them run let
them turn into things that the country
really needs
like efficient mass transportation which
not only will have a very important
effect on
curtailing the race the destruction of
the environment
but also make a much more livable life
it's no great fun to sit on the
southeast expressway six hours a day uh
trying to get the workman back home
much better ways to do it that was a
possibility
if the left had been organized with
those
goals in mind and those can be carried
out
from a small scale to a much larger
scale
like tech massachusetts some of you may
remember about
seven or eight years ago there was a
factory in taunton mass near boston
where uh owned by a big multinational it
was pretty successful factory they were
making
parts for aircraft and so on now for the
bankers in new york and chicago there
wasn't enough profit
so they decided to close it the union
offered to buy it
and run it have the workforce run it
which they could have done
the multinationals would have made more
money out of that than closing it
but they have class consciousness they
don't want these ideas to spread among
people
that you really don't need the bosses
you can run the thing by yourself
if there had been any public support for
the workers in taunton
they might have won okay that's a step
towards the kind of thing that can be
happening on every issue
whether it's supporting the nurses and
doctors and
health care reform or workers in the
factories
anything else as uh
van said that they work on all fronts
all the time
okay ty you want to take a crack to the
strategy to fix this
yeah i noticed that does steve swapp is
one of the folks
that responded to oppose this question
and uh steve will remember the
popular ed education network from back
in the 90s that we were both part of
and um i'm still using that crack that
practice
and i take a leaf from ella baker's book
uh godmother snick she was fond of
saying that
strong people don't need strong leaders
and i take that not to say that
leaders aren't necessary but that
everybody has the capacity has the
potential
to take a leadership position on things
that they're passionate about
and that activists seasoned organizers
should be about developing the capacity
of ordinary folks
to lead around the struggles that
they're engaged in
uh that
than anything else tenants healthcare
whatever
but the main thing that i've always
emphasized is i'm not the star on the
stage
it's the people that are actually going
to have to live with what happens after
i
leave that need to have the confidence
that
they could actually pull things off and
that's always the biggest struggle
of any organizing project is convincing
people
that they can change things that it's
not written in stone that they'll fail
and that other folks have been there
before them that they could take lessons
from
so for me right now uh
at this stage in in my career
um focusing on developing the capacity
of the movement
to actually operate as effectively
as the right wing has done they have
um a whole infrastructure developed
uh where part of it is the electoral
work that they do
their whole ground game there and
working from the smallest elective
office from dog catcher to president
but they also have think tanks endowed
chairs and universities
uh they have an um
a publishing infrastructure that pumps
out garbage but they still
pump out a lot of stuff that affects a
lot of folks
we don't seem to have any of that or
what we do have is so
disconnected that we can't really take
advantage
of the resources that we have in hand
so i would focus like i said on
developing
the capacity of ordinary folks to lead
in the struggles that they're most
passionate about and
you know if if i take a page from sun
tzu
where you know you don't try to attack
your enemies troops
you attack your enemy's strategy and the
enemy's strategy is to keep us
fragmented
struggling with each other over scarce
resources
and uh being convinced that we really
can't change anything
and that's what we have to challenge
thank you
okay next we got three different
formulations of a question
trying to relate class and race and i'll
just
you know say you know my own version of
this is that the two major movements
on the progressive side this year have
been the bernie campaign
and the movement for black lives and
so how do we put those together into a
powerful people's movement
jordan weinstein asks bernie seem to put
issues of racial discrimination into a
class frame he eventually had to start
talking about race separate from class
but i still understand how to unify
those two ways of looking at race
and then michael coffin says how do you
think race and racism will interact with
class and working class struggle
while defending against the right-wing
push towards authoritarianism
and claire gosselin points to the poor
people's campaign which is a project
that tries to unify race and class
struggles and asked tai particularly do
you see any hope in the base building
efforts by the poor people's campaign in
the south and across the country
well i'm involved in the south carolina
poor people's campaign
group so and for me
um i can't separate race in class one of
the problems that we run into
is folks say working class and it's
implied in parentheses
oh my white folks were in a working
class
but a huge portion of the working class
as folks who look like me folks who
speak other languages
that's the working class as well so i
don't make this
artificial separation because the
struggle
against struggle for better working
conditions
better pay and now protections
in the workplace the bulk of the
essential workers are people of color
so that's their struggle is clearly a
working class struggle
the left needs to wake up and understand
that
there's not a white working class a
black working class and a latino working
class
it's just a working class capital sees
it that way
they don't make those separations except
in a sort of cynical way
to keep folks pitted against each other
but the reality situation is we're all
in in this capitalist pot
and we got to get out of it and helping
each other out of this pot
is the only way it's going to work let
me just add to that that a large part of
the work encloses women a growing large
part of the world causes women
and if you look back at let me go back
to the early 30s again
there was a tremendous amount of racism
within the working class
one of the ways it was overcome was by
organizing
when cio organizing began black and
white workers were working together
for the same goals the racism declined
it had happened before often soon as the
as you're working together to achieve
your your goals
happen to be class goals because you're
fighting a class war
just like the other side is unrelenting
then the divisions disappear you're on
the same side
you're working for the same things we
all want decent health care
decent working conditions control over
our own lives control over our working
lives
uh doesn't matter what color you are
what what gender you are
ben you want to crack at this or you
want to let it go
you are muted so i don't know what
you're saying
one small comment i am perpetually
uh frustrated by how
the lame stream media to use trump's
term
um you know the the quasi-liberal pundit
class
used the as as ty already said they say
working class they mean white men
and that's profoundly mistaken i mean
the the most representative working
class person
would be a single mother um
of color working at walmart that would
be honestly the most representative
person
in the working class today but there's a
lot another issue
when they talk about with this code and
it means white man
many of those men are not working class
they are if you want to be precise petty
bourgeois
they are lower middle class they have
um remember joe the plumber okay
the one who confronted obama and you
know he was portrayed as white working
class he wasn't working class at all
he didn't sell his labor power for an
hourly wage
which is what working class means so
there's a tendency to take people who
are
you know angry small businessmen um
quasi-professional cops and turn them
into working class because of a set of
cultural
signifiers that frankly um
educated elites seem to confuse with
actual class standing
because someone wears a trucker cap
their working class so i just wanted to
make that point let's pay attention to
what
what people actually do the jobs they
inhabit their relation to the relations
of production
not how they dress or how they talk that
does not actually indicate someone's
class standing
okay um there's a couple of questions
that i would call about the process of
the
upcoming elections or or or the
anti-trump
uh so uh ray amy
asks why is the legal profession their
professional associations not more
active
in taking on donald trump and his
sycophants and lieutenants with legal
credentials
like attorney general barr what is their
motivation to stay silent
teresa brooks asked any thought about
groups such as the lincoln project
and jojo jabanaski asked what is the
likely chain of events that will happen
when
trump declares the election of fraud and
tells republican secretaries of state
and republican members of congress not
to certify the vote
or refuses to leave the white house
it's kind of interesting that by now
that kind of question which
a couple of years ago would have sounded
like a lunatic conspiracy theory
is being discussed right at the centers
of power
now there are organizations of what are
called respectable people
working on it right now what do we do if
trump just invalidates the election
in fact when i heard the report
about the plans to purge the military
that's the first thing that came to mind
who knows what the these guys are
playing for serious goals
uh the republican leadership knows they
are a minority party
they cannot win a fair and free election
in fact
trump said virtually that those words
they have to find ways to maintain
power as a minority force
which will be able to perpetuate
a very reactionary agenda that's
not only harmful to people but it's
going to destroy the prospects for human
life
and they'll do almost anything to do it
so
what do you do if it comes to the point
where say
trump says the election was invalid
was too many illegal immigrants voting
and he calls out what he calls his
tough guys to come to surround the white
house you know the
same old militias who attacked
who took the michigan state legislature
house or
attacked peaceful demonstrators in a
little village in ohio the other day
you may have seen that bethel ohio
little village couple thousand people a
few
people decided to have a quiet peaceful
demonstration about 700 or 800
angry men came with guns and baseball
bats and started smashing the place up
to try to break this up trump's
tough guys as he calls him well what do
you do at that point
i don't really think this is going to
come to that but if it does
you take to the street you have to
overwhelm them
that's the only thing that would be
possible
what it's worth i want to respond very
quickly
to one concern that someone said about
repub secretaries of state reporting
i've been trying to dig down into this i
just put into the chat
i today annotated the 2017 congressional
research service report
that um covers all of the legal ground
of how an election is actually certified
a presidential election
so there's a may be good news it is
governors who certify a state's electors
governor and their certification
overturning their certification
would require joint action by both
houses of congress
i will leave you to reflect on that
possibility
where things will get very messy and why
i made a reference to
judicial legislative coups would be if a
republican legislature
in a state with a democratic governor
like wisconsin or pennsylvania
or north carolina decided to
ignore the federal law it's in the code
that says it's the governor who
certifies
and simply sent their own um
list of electors and claimed the right
to name the electors
which is in the constitution by the way
that the state names the electors
then we would have a constitutional
crisis but it would actually have to
congress would have to consider you know
that there are in fact two lists of
electors
so this could get extremely messy but
the fact that that it's governors who
certify the electors in each state
is i think um good news
ty do you want a piece of that
uh i don't know the lincoln project i
find amusing
and entertaining i love their ads
besides that they're still snakes uh
that whole never trump movement
that um the liberal establishment
elevated as if these guys had suddenly
been rehabilitated to the human race
i found really puzzling um
but like i said i i do enjoy
uh seeing their uh ad their anti-trump
ads are very amusing
uh i wish to some degree that
the democrats would get as nasty
down and dirty sometimes but um
they're too much into virtue signaling
yeah
and uh tone policing i guess
okay thanks at this point i'm going to
pass it back to jackie for
action items and closing remarks
okay um
we have uh put together
uh some ideas some suggestions
uh a lot of which is flowing out
of what you all have been talking about
during this whole discussion
um and i will
uh put these forward and um
cole while i do that is going to put
some links in
into the chat if he hasn't done it
already
as to how you can get more information
um so first of all we have two main
suggestions
one is we hope that everyone
on this call continues to support
the nationwide uprising against police
violence
um and
uh militarized policing
and racism and this uprising is the
is actually the expression of
the the fight against
the authoritarian right at this point uh
and we all have to get behind it um
mass peace action uh
has identified five key demands and
we have this in our newsletter and you
can find it on our website
defund the police invest in our
communities
demilitarize the police repeal qualified
immunity
and chokeholds and excess force and the
use of the military within the u.s
territory and
um establish and foster restorative
justice not mass incarceration
um you can read more about that
in uh our article justice for george
floyd and police violence
and that will be in the chat um
and everyone i know has their own
organizational ways to participate
and support those those efforts
and both the black lives matter and i
think the poor people's campaign
are very important expressions uh
of this at this point our second
suggestion
is we must work aggressively to defend
the right to vote and counter voter
suppression campaigns
in every way and every place they occur
this is especially important for all
those
on this call in battleground states and
we urge people to
find out about it be active support
mail-in ballots same-day voter
registration rank choice voting
and all means of making
voting more accessible
to the people um and
we we think it's very important to
support progressives
running in down ballot races um
people have been talking about dog
catcher to president
and that's that's what we're that's
what what we're urging as well uh
you know those uh mass peace action
has um published our endorsements
for the senate the house of
representatives the state legislature
we've endorsed
26 people here in massachusetts
national peace action has a national
list of congressional candidates
you can find any of this on our website
or the national website
and finally of course we must do
everything we possibly can to defeat
trump
and this is not an election to sit out
in any way
uh all hands on deck so
thank you very much for participating
tonight
uh despite the bleak and dire
situation that has been so well
described by our speakers
uh i think that the the way forward has
has also uh been put forward
so thanks to all of you
keep in touch and thank you especially
to our panelists gnome van and ty yes
