it's inapplicable and there's many
examples of that and the immunity from
international law is also inherited by
clients actually we see that on the
front pages every day right now leading
client is Israel make major recipient of
US military aid for a long time right
now there are what are called the peace
negotiations going on and there's a
hang-up there's a problem what to do
about expansion of settlements you know
should they delay it for these are
always delay it for a couple of weeks or
something brother every settlement is in
gross violation of the Geneva
Conventions and that's not even
ambiguous actually the Israeli
government was informed of that in 1967
by its top legal advisers Taylor am I
wrong very distinguished international
lawyer Ashley the International Criminal
Court's and so on and the Attorney
General and in fact it was accepted by
the top people in the government moshe
dayan who was the in charge of the
defense minister in charge of the
occupied territories he said yo it's
it's we know it's illegal to move any
people into the territories but
countries violate international law so
we're going to do it anyway and that's
okay as long as the boss authorizes it
namely us and yes so they inherit that
right and the discussions in the
newspaper every day or as disgraceful as
the failure to you can measure it but
their honor in the same category as the
failure to mention the fact that the
first moment of the actual attack was a
gross violation of international law and
was celebrated because after all it was
a decent thing to do there is the United
Nations has a rapid Turon on the right
to food
declare he is it a strong condemnation
of the marine policy of depriving
civilians of food and water to try to
flush out militants which he pointed out
correctly as a flagrant violation of the
Geneva Conventions the US military
prevented the Red Crescent that's the
domestic counterpart to the Red Cross
have prevented them from entering the
city to try to deal with civilian
casualties another gross violation of
international law and it was condemned
the sir nigel young who was the chief
executive of the British Red Cross
condemned this very severely correctly
Americans were spared full of this news
unless you were kind of looking at
exotic publications you didn't see it
well there were plenty of atrocities
you've heard about some of them but the
operation was considered successful
almost reporters were a little concerned
that as they wrote that there weren't
many militants killed they couldn't find
enough dead bodies of fighters on the
street to make it look proper or to
translate that into New York Times
terminology there weren't enough dead
pack rats in their Warren's so there was
something wrong maybe you know not
enough maybe they got away or something
the marine commander said proudly that
this ought to go down in the history
books was really a great achievement
that he's right it should go down in
history books alongside other
more or less the same time for example
the Russian attack on Grozny it's a city
of about the same size roughly the same
time kind of similar leveled it you know
nobody knows how many killed because
they don't do body counts either
bitterly condemned in the United States
is a major atrocity so you have the two
ought to go down in history on the same
page and there are others so that you
can think of the tell us what page of
history we log on not for just for
carrying out these actions but for
tolerating them even celebrating them
which is more than which is worse than
just not noticing but that's what
happened well it's continuing today the
you heard about the report on the fact
that the effects the effects would have
probably radiation are beyond the level
of the atomic bombs that was reported
major professional journal actually had
someone to a media search virtually no
mention in the United States the data if
you like the just this morning there was
a report in both the globe in the New
York Times of a another a war crime
right in the suburbs of Fallujah your
Fallujah the US forces were called
advisors now and Iraqi forces attacked
village and according to the villagers
killed seven people were civilians the
u.s. command says doesn't agree with
that but you can make up your own mind
the attackers in this case are Iraqi
army forces and heavily Shiite Sunni
town
pretty much what happened in Fallujah
the poor Shia recruits from the South
were used to attack Fallujah at the time
that helped stir up the horrifying
sectarian warfare which tour the country
to shreds and in fact has spread
throughout the whole region and is a
plague now in the region and the same
may turn out to be true of the Fallujah
attack today same roughly the same
circumstances well what about there were
earlier as what coupled with both
speakers mentioned that was the second
attack on Fallujah the first one was in
April and some things happened before
that which are worth thinking about then
get reported and they're still not
mentioned but let me mention them on the
twenty-second of march in 2004 Israel
assassinated a quadriplegic shesh yasine
yasine he was a revered figure serious
analysts considered him to be one of the
more conciliatory figures in the Hamas
leadership he was tacked with it's a
targeted assassination kind of thing
we're good at and they are too he was
killed as he was coming out of a mosque
half a dozen people were the errors
collateral damage that that caused that
set off a furious reaction in the whole
region including Iraq where there were
massive demonstrations protests a couple
of days after that came the killing of
the four military contractors well
responsibility was for the killing of
the four military contractors was which
was taken by
a previously unknown group which were
called brigades of martyr ahmed yassin
and the issue statement what they
calling the murder of the contractors a
gift from the people of Fallujah to the
people of Palestine and the family of
shock media scene who was assassinated
by the criminal Zionists incidentally
using a u.s. helicopter Israel to make
helicopters which are provided to Israel
and still are and with the foreknowledge
that they're going to be used exactly
for purposes like these so it's not just
the criminal Zionists well the killing
of the contractors led to the murderous
assault by the Marines which both
speakers talked about but it's worth
remembering that bit of background and
remember that acts have consequences the
the targeted assassinations are going on
they're going on right now in fact
they're sharply increased under Obama
and of course it's leading to a very
angry reaction people have this strange
you know emotional reaction to having
invisible drones as suddenly murder
people in their midst including the
so-called collateral damage these
targeted assassinations are
assassinations of people on suspicion
it's not that you know anything about
them you just kill them because they
might be a problem and that's it not
doesn't only get bitter reaction say in
Pakistan and Afghanistan but also a kind
of a measured reaction from
international lawyers and international
specialists on human rights law the one
of the main ones is Philip Alston very
respected Authority he happens to be the
UN Rapporteur on extrajudicial
extrajudicial executions any wrote a
report on the top
which as usual was not reported here
that's an important he said that
referring to Obama that this this
strongly asserted but ill defined
license to kill without accountability
is not an entitlement which the United
States or other states can have without
doing grave damage to the rules designed
to protect the right to life and to
prevent extrajudicial executions well
that's what our taxes are paying for
increasing all over the region that's a
kind of judicious and measured response
you get much more angry responses on the
ground including things like the murder
the contractors which led to the marine
assault and practically blew up the
country they could barely contain it at
that time well actually that's the least
of us crimes and it illustrates pretty
well the exemption the license to kill
and the exemption from the law which we
just take for granted well it wouldn't
do to drop this topic without knowing
that US proccess didn't start and I
arrived didn't start with the invasion
they go way back in fact they go back to
the time when the US took over from
Britain in 1958 it up till 1958 Iraq had
been pretty much a British colony formal
independence but not real the 1958 there
was a military coup the general abdul
karim qassem carried addict who fit 1958
that was the end of british rule of iraq
the US and britain reacted very angrily
and furious furiously to that both
Britain and the United States sent
military forces to the region to
Jordan with very significant impact on
events there the US forces in Lebanon
apparently had nuclear weapons and were
prepared to use them they didn't want
what was happening in Iraq to spread the
end they were good reason and they also
its documents were sure within secret
but were later released and were
available at the time of the 1991
invasion of Iraq but not recorded except
that the margins the United States and
Britain both agreed in their terms
ruthlessly to intervene if anything
affected their control of the region
British control over its quaid a
dependency us control over Saudi Arabia
we're the big boys so we take the big
prize so there was commitment ruthlessly
to intervene if anything disrupted that
control but domestic international
whatever that would have been very
relevant in 1990-91 at the time of the
invasion of Iraq first invasion of Iraq
but of course not reported the there
were real concerns about the casa coup
and the concerns were expressed by
officials of the oil companies who ran
the Iraqi oil system and diplomats have
some quotes they were afraid that cousin
might attempt to distribute wealth to
build a strong democratic Iraq that
could help free other Arabs and afro
Asians he might they feared even adopt a
Nasser's plan Egyptian leader his plant
who was the main anime at the time he
might adopt Nasser's plan to use sooty
resources the main resources of the
region to use them to improve living
standards of Arabs everywhere President
Eisenhower declared that all of the
with a kremlin plot to undermine the
west using NASA as an instrument
evidence was zero or maybe minus zero
but that never matters and such things
