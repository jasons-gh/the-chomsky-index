so I think a key idea in Mars like you
said finding the right units to describe
your problem sort of right level of
abstraction if you will so if we take a
concrete example of a new field in
neuroscience called connect omics where
the goal is to find the wiring diagram
very complex organisms you'd find the
connectivity of all the neurons and say
un cerebral cortex or the mouse cortex
this approach was actually criticized by
Sydney Brenner who's one of the
originator Xin many ways of this
approach so these advocates of this
field don't stop to ask if the wiring
diagram is the right level of
abstraction maybe it's not so what is
your view on that well I mean there are
much simpler questions like here at MIT
there's been a program on an
interdisciplinary program on nematode C
elegans for you know for a decade and
they can talk to the people who work on
that the way better than I do but as far
as I understand even with this miniscule
animal where you know the wiring diagram
I think there's eight hundred neurons or
something that you kind of didn't know
exactly what they are still I can't
predict what the thing is going to do
maybe because you're looking in the
wrong place
