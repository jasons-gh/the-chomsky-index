kitchen up at SFU he wrote a book on
fascism totalitarianism is a boo term
what you got to do is unpack them usage
of the word totalitarianism Machiavelli
if you look at machiavellianism as
Machiavellianism from above and from
below but Kunin has been called a
machiavellianism from below I think word
we need more envious workers we don't
need sentimentality from Noam Chomsky
this is nothing to sentimental about the
workers all the polluting workers we
need Envy from below and greed from
above we're not gonna get anything but
greed from above you admitted that but
you want sentimentality from below I
don't want sentimentality I want
struggle freedom justice I met it I
didn't say much about it but when I was
talking about centralizing the
legislative executive and judicial
functions in a top center I was actually
quoting I didn't say so because it
wasn't time but I was quoting from a
pretty mainstream political annoyed
political economist back when I was at
round ninth in the early 1940s Robert
Brady who wrote a book on businesses
system of power in which he described
quite well the way in which totalitarian
institutions like corporations were
developing in the industrial world with
many counterparts to the fascist systems
there's more recent work when I
mentioned scholarship I had something in
mind to there's a legal historian at
Harvard very good with Martin Horowitz
who has two big fat books on the
transformation of American law and if
you look at the second volume he goes
which is the more you know goes through
say 1860 to 1920 or so he talks about
the origin of modern corporate
corporations in corporate law and
exactly these terms this is these are
descriptive terms they are not booooo
terms okay why can't we have
something like max Turner's alliance of
egoist from below well you can have it
if you want but that's not the world are
you want sentimentality an organism of
the born week for will it an organic
what you call honeyed ISM
totalitarianism of the left-wing
I think we've exhausted a stop it you
want sentimentalism of the left-wing
Organa system of the left-wing excuse me
if that's what it sounds like to you
yeah this left below this point I'm told
thank you
I'm not long ago in this province us and
some changes were made in the
legislature to legislation to make stir
the penalties for things like
distribution of hate literature in
response to an increased perception of
groups like the Aria nation and the and
the Heritage front and well it's it's
definitely important to preserve free
speech freedom of speech it is also
clear that the increased activity of
such groups also needs to be dressed as
well and I'm wondering what thoughts you
might have about what means could be
done so apart from trying to make
stricter penalties for distribution of
hate literature well I'm against it I
don't think the state should have the
power to decide what people think and
say I don't want the state have that
power
and I think it's bad to have people
running around with hate literature but
the way to do it is not to give power to
some more dangerous entity like the
state the what you have to do is meet
them on you know get to the people that
they're reaching right they are reaching
people who are susceptible to this
literature why well for reasons the kind
I mentioned let's take the the people
who have been subjected for the social
policies that we all know in which we
just alluded to yeah they're going to be
frightened angry they're going to search
for somebody to blame it on they're
gonna be easy targets for hate
literature just as they were under the
Nazis well the way to deal with that was
not to outlaw mine Kampf that would not
change the thing it was to deal with the
sources in the Society for what Hitler
was appealing to and the same is true
here incidentally if you're worried
about talks that harms people picking
out hate literature is a very odd choice
yes that harms people but free-market
ideology harms them way more you know
that's who's really suffering from the
kind of IMF fundamentalism which is
mostly phony but it's true that it's a
dominant ideology at least among it
leads well you know go to you know
Africa or Latin America or poor slums in
the United States and you'll find people
suffering mostly women incidentally and
suffering miserably like mortality rates
for women and infants have gone way up
okay hate literature hasn't done that if
you're worried about harming people
there are much more obvious candidates
and the answer to this is not to have
the state powerful enough to stop people
from talking about this stuff that's not
the answer
I don't think I can say thank you any
better than all of you have to know
thanks very much on behalf of the PC
Federation of Labor and the Vancouver
and District Labor Council and my thanks
to all of you for being so patient
