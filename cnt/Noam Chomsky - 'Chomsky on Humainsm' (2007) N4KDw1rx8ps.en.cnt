I'm Chomsky has been a leading
intellectual of the left for more than
35 years and has written about and
spoken to a variety of issues including
capitalist economics the nation-state
focusing on an extensive critique of the
powers that be and the policies of the
United States education socialism war in
peace and anarchism he began his career
in the study of language and is credited
with the creation of the theory of
generative grammar considered to be one
of the most significant contributions to
the field of linguistics made in the
20th century recently professor Chomsky
author of over 30 books of science and
of politics has been a subject of an
interview along with Gilbert ash Carr by
New Jersey based political scientist
Stephen Shalom in the book titled
perilous power the Middle East and u.s.
foreign policy in this book he discusses
among other things the resurgence of
religious fundamentalism in both the
Middle East and within this country and
offers some perspective on what might be
the cause or causes of the trend also in
a recent interview in the humanist the
flagship magazine of the American
Humanist Association professor Chomsky
continues his analysis of religious
fundamentalism as well as talks about
other issues at the core of the humanist
worldview equal time for free thought
spoke to professor Chomsky a few weeks
ago on the substance of humanist thought
from naturalism and religious critique
to the political and economic structures
which must be in place in order for us
to affect the social changes necessary
toward creating a humanistic futureworld
society here is part 1 of that
discussion first let me say that equal
time and free thought is very happy to
have you join us today professor Chomsky
your work covers much ground on the
human condition from language and the
understanding of human consciousness to
humanities social political
relationships and further to the way we
share Earth's natural and human-made
resources and still more equal time for
free thoughts central mission is to
promote a scientific naturalist
worldview in understanding the human
condition which of course includes much
of what I laid out regarding your
intellectual curriculum the end result
for us is a set of principles and ideas
which together form a larger philosophy
or way of seeing the world which though
not exactly the same thing as conceived
by each one of us at every moment we
call humanism to begin this conversation
I'll give this to my co-host Neil Murphy
Neil thank you very much Barry professor
Chomsky welcome to equal time for free
thought very glad to be with you thank
you a few months ago the humanists which
is the magazine of the
humanist association publish their
interview with you on humanism and other
related free thought questions now
before we move forward do you consider
yourself a humanist and if so what
characteristics would you include in
such a philosophy let me begin by
quoting a philosopher friend of mine who
once said the right a critical analysis
of work of mine and he started off by
saying that scratching his head he said
the problem with me is that the only ism
I believe in his truism so which is not
entirely false so the other things I
agree with but I don't associate myself
with any particular ism now modern
humanism is said to be based on
scientific naturalism and our philosophy
isn't performing by what we learn about
the universe and ourselves through the
physical and social sciences do you feel
that naturalism is the most appropriate
point of view toward understanding what
sort of creatures we are I think it
that's what I that's my professional
life so sure I think it's a fine thing
to do but the truth of the matter is
that these are from the point of view of
science
most of these topics are almost
inaccessible and for now and I suspect
for the indefinite future we'll probably
learn more about human beings from
literature and we will from science
that's an interesting point why would
you say that science deals with
questions that are at the periphery of
understanding to try to understand the
nature of insects is difficult enough
when you reach anything as complicated
as humans it's it becomes an extremely
hard problem one reason is that we can't
do invasive experimentation with humans
so when you want to study but we happen
to know a lot about the human visual
system for example but the reason is
because we permit ourselves rightly or
wrongly to do invasive experimentation
with cats and monkeys and we have a more
or less similar visual system but humans
are very unusual creature biologically
isolated in many respects and we don't
really learn a lot about them from some
but not a lot from the
stations we allow ourselves to conduct
with other organisms that's one
impediment understanding another is this
just very complicated what is your view
overall and supernaturalism now for the
moment let's separate this for we might
call religion which can mean several
things like established churches and
organized ideology do you think holding
a supernatural worldview is healthy and
beneficial for Humanity it's not for me
I don't see any point to it at all on
the other hand I know that it means
religious beliefs and other forms of
supernatural and having to mean a lot to
a lot of people if I find someone who's
say mourning the loss of a dead child
and is comforted by the idea that they
will be reunited with a child in heaven
it's not my business to take to try to
convince them that their belief is
incorrect in fact in a way I think
they're lucky to be able to have such a
belief I don't have it and I don't think
in the long run it's healthy but the
can't legislate to other people of what
they should believe in order to say
comfort themselves it almost sounds like
you have a lazy fair attitude towards
religious belief in other words as long
as one person's private morality doesn't
interfere with someone else's then you
can sort of live and let live is that a
fair assessment absolutely fair okay
what in general do you feel that about
religions role in human society both
historically and here in the 21st
century overall I think it's in terms of
its effect on policy ranging from social
policy to war I think it's been mostly
negative
in fact often extremely negative with
regard to individuals it varies for a
lot of people it just means a lot and
always has what do you attribute to that
do you think there's something
biological like many people have argued
that we're sort of hardwired for
religion do you think that religion is
sort of keeping in lockstep with
evolutionary processes first of all we
know very little about the evolution of
humans in any relevant respect I mean we
know a lot about you know the fossil
record and so on but when you get to
human cognitive capacities or and so
however what we call sometimes higher
mental faculties the evolutionary record
is just extremely thin we're a very
recent product of evolution modern
humans from a cognitive perspective
cognitive behavioral perspective only
emerged within roughly the last hundred
thousand years which is a like a flick
of an eye in evolutionary time and we're
all more or less identical this for a
little genetic variation one relevant
genetic variation among humans because
there's been we probably come from a
small breeding group somewhere in East
Africa you know probably no later than
say fifty thousand years ago there's no
time for anything to have happened uh
and we could in a sense it's like almost
my view virtually a tautology to say
that the commitment to religious belief
is the result of evolution because we're
the result of evolution just like my my
chin is my toenails are so so are my
higher mental faculties but that just
doesn't tell you very much I mean we all
know without playing kind of doing pop
science that people do want to find ways
to give an intelligible picture of the
universe around them to find comfort to
find association with others and they do
it in all kinds of ways some of them we
call religion a lot of some what we call
magic in modern and the modern period
period of the rise of organized modern
science course goes way back but really
as a major phenomenon in human life
there's been a concerted attempt to
explain to gain an understanding of the
world by means that do permit
confirmation dis confirmation building
on the results of others and so on so we
call science ok that we should push that
as far as we can surely we want to
understand as much as we can about the
world and that's the best way to
understand it do you think that religion
overall
I'm talking here about monotheistic
religions Christianity Judaism Islam do
you think that it's the case that
religious believers are asking the right
questions about the meaning of life and
creating some type of order but that the
solutions are dangerous well personally
I don't think they're asking the right
questions about life but and that's why
I don't ask those questions so Jewish in
background but I don't repeat the I
believe X plus all the XY z-- and Z's
that you're supposed to do because I
don't believe no I don't see any reason
to believe them my grandfather did
repeat them and whether he believes them
or not I frankly don't even know because
Judaism traditional Judaism was more a
religion of practice than of belief so
he observed his very Orthodox but the
observed the practices and I never asked
him did he believe what he was saying
because it kind of wasn't relevant
that's not what the religion was there
were others who may believe choose to
believe let's say this or other
monotheistic religions but I don't seek
that and it's the same less a fair
attitude if you like if that's if that
kind of belief contributes to people's
sense of where they stand in the world
personal comfort does identification
with the community and so on well that's
their choice it's quite a different
matter when their choices impinge on
what others do so I think we should have
for example I was appalled the other day
when I was listening to reports and
problems on NPR or maybe I was reading
reports of Mitt Romney's first talk on
maybe was the Republican debate you know
one of those places where he gave read
yeah I was listening to pieces of it and
he gave a what was considered a very
high-minded speech about the role of
religion and politics he said the word
something like this that the constitute
we should keep to the constitutional
separation of church and state which
means that it doesn't matter what faith
president has but of course it's
presuppose
that he must be committed to one of the
monotheistic religions that's not what
that amendment says I find it
interesting that in today's political
climate it almost seems that you have to
be close to a religious extremists to be
taken seriously I mean if you listen to
even John Kerry in the O for election he
was trying to profess his you know
Catholic beliefs as a kind of litmus
test for his legitimacy does that trend
in American politics concern you very
much so it's extremely dangerous I think
it's extremely cynical I mean the US has
been a deeply fundamentalist society
since its origins I mean the early
colonists were religious extremists and
the various waves of colonization that
here at sins in New England you know
that spread across the country also were
you know waving the holy book while they
exterminated the evens and that sort of
thing but and there's been repeated
periods of religious revival ISM there's
kind of like mass hysteria of religious
revival ISM the most recent and quite
significant one was in the 1950s far
back and there were others since
nineteen seventeen eighty I guess
something new has happened the religious
fundamentalism has been a political
managers party managers and so on
recognized something that they kind of
ignored before that you can manipulate
religious beliefs extremist religious
beliefs into creation of a voting bloc
and since about 1980 what you describe
has been the case every just about every
candidate for high office a president
portrays themselves whether accurately
or not as you know a person of deep
religious faith I suspect some of them
are about as religious as you and I are
right Clinton yeah the for instance Karl
Rove has repeatedly said that he's not
in fact he was mentioned in a recent
article that he's not one of them in
other words that they're cynically
manipulating this base for their own
personal power so it's not that they're
sincerely motivated by religious
concerns but they see this base as a way
of ensuring their own self interest is
that a fair assessment I didn't see that
comment but that that's the way I that's
what I conclude from just observing
what's been happening I suspect I've
never really seen a study of this but I
suspect that it began with Carter who
was undoubtedly quite sincere but he's
the first president who's or went out of
his way to present himself or Trey
himself as a deeply believing Christian
and I think party managers got the point
yeah you can use that way of appealing
to a substantial electoral base and
since starting with the 1980 election I
think it's just been just about every
candidate in 1980 I recall there were
three candidates Carter Reagan Anderson
all presented themselves as are their
managers you know their handlers
presented them as deeply religious
whether they were not to knows I'm
Carter probably I'm sure was and Robert
the others and since then that's been
the case and it's extremely cynical and
at first I will nobody cared very much
whether say Lyndon Johnson or Richard
Nixon went to church maybe they did
maybe they didn't but it wasn't an issue
it wasn't relevant it didn't pay a lot
of attention to it since in these last
roughly 25 years it's right in the front
and of course it's not called religion
anymore so called faith everything has
to be faith based meaning some form of
commitment dedication is one of the
organized religions leading ultimately
to the kind of comment from Romney that
I mentioned which was lauded whereas it
should have been bitterly denounced and
yes that's head of our negative impact
in a lot of respects as is intended I
mean it's a way to from the point of
view of party managers it's a way to
marginalize control and a demise a
population that they're afraid of I mean
they can read the same opinion polls you
and I can and they know perfectly well
that the positions of the two political
parties are too
sometimes they call to factions of the
same party on many crucial issues way to
the right of the population
so therefore elections have to keep away
from issues as they do I want to follow
up on the point you made about faith
because it almost seems that there's a
connection between you know the
Republican Party maybe in some ways the
Democratic Party and a faith-based
worldview because if faith is believing
something for which there is no evidence
and the Republicans paint themselves as
the sort of divine managers for lack of
a better phrase it would seem that what
the Republican electorate wants is a
kind of submissive faith-based populace
to secede their own political power and
representation to them to sort of act on
their interest but yet at the same time
as you said they're being cynically
manipulated do you agree with that if
you look at the opinions of the
Republican base they are not being
represented by the Republican Party
that's true an issue after issue go
through the details now but there's a
lot of detailed study of that both on
some and there's others the population
including the Republican part of the
Republican base is strongly opposed to
policy on many crucial issues a domestic
and international to give one example
out of a thousand short in the last
electoral campaign 2004 it turns out
that Bush voters were barely aware of
his policies some small percentage of
them may be you know two digits were
familiar with his policies in one case
and there are many a majority of people
who voted for Bush thought that he
supported the Kyoto Protocol Wayne did
not of course it was strongly you know I
don't know what he thinks but his party
was strongly against it but people
believed it and they believed that
because they're in favor of it very very
strongly in favor of it and he's a kind
of a nice guy that's the way he's
presented in the imagery and delusion
that passes for elections here so he
must believe it and it's the same and a
whole bunch of issues in the humanist
magazine interview you talk about
Americans as being one of the most
Americans me as being one of the most
fearful societies how does religion in
European come into play with regard to
this fear organized religion can be used
and often is you
as a way to separate ourselves from
menacing Outsiders who don't share our
fundamental belief and that can be
manipulated into creating fear actually
the the long-standing element of fear in
American society I think has different
origins and you can see it when you ask
what are people afraid of actually good
study this in literature popular
literature by Bruce Hank Franklin who
studies a little literary scholar at the
Rutgers told the worst stars he runs
through the striking theme of fear in
popular American literature since
colonial times it turns out that pretty
consistently people have been terrified
of some group that they are destroying
so in the early days it was fear of
these avid Indians no later it was fear
of the blacks than it was fear of the
heathen Chinese who were going to
conquer us this is late nineteenth
century and and so it continues I mean
take say Ronald Reagan perhaps recall
just twenty years ago he was a cowering
in his cowboy boots about the threat of
the Nicaraguan army only two days from
Arlington Texas had to call a national
emergency informed the press that he
remembers Winston Churchill and how
Churchill stood up for Hitler and
despite the odds against him a Reagan
will not be different you know will not
succumb to this awesome threat and will
defendant ourselves and we will defend
ourselves I mean looking at this from
the outside you don't know whether to
laugh or cry you know but yeah that
strike support regarding terrorism from
the point of view of religious
fundamentalism there have been writers
who have been dubbed in New Atheists
like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins who
feel that groups like the Muslim
Brotherhood and al-qaeda are not acting
on economic or even political
motivations so much as they're acting on
their conviction of how humans ought to
act and think based on the Koran
others would argue that the political
motivations are what's driving the
issues in the Middle East and not
religious motivations on this issue of
religion as the chicken or the egg
what are your thoughts depends or you're
talking about I mean first of all Muslim
brothers is not it is not essentially a
terrorist groups a social and political
group no it's been involved in terrorism
but who hasn't the if you look at the
appeal of groups like say the Muslim
Brotherhood and its offshoots like Hamas
in Israel which kind of offshoot of it
or or Hezbollah and Lebanon they have a
trans mount of popular appeal but it
would be very misleading to say that
it's religious there's an element of
that I mean they provide social services
and that the government does mega Veil
the air they're a kind of a populist
social economic group that's where their
support comes from it sounds I'm sorry
to interject I just wanted to get your
opinion on this it sounds like what
you're saying is because there are no
secular nationalist alternatives
these groups are filling a vacuum that
secular nationalist governments would
fill is that a fair that's not only fair
but it's been concerted US policy and
concerted Israeli policy secular
nationalism has been regarded by as an
extreme threat it's and it finally
collapsed partly from its own internal
corruption and so on but partly just
from the hammer blows against it but I'm
going to take us Palmas for example with
its earlier manifestations in clubs of
Hamas then were supported by Israel as a
weapon against secular Palestinian
nationalism of the United States our
oldest and most valued ally in the
Middle East is the most extreme
fundamentalist tehrani in the world
Saudi Arabia by comparison Iran looks
like a modern developed Society and the
reason is of course where the oil is but
the US was constantly backing it was in
the 60s
supporting Saudi Arabia against secular
nationalism represented by Nasser who
was regarded as the main threat he was
Hitler as Dulles called how Hitler yeah
secular nationalism has always been
regarded as a major threat you don't
want that it's dangerous
might have a PE or might even begin to
use resources for the population general
population that's a danger and there you
know not a hundred percent but quite
systematically a US policy and in their
own region Israeli policy has tended to
support religious fundamentalism as a
weapon against secular nationalism I
mean perhaps the most dramatic case is
Pakistan dangerous countries in the
world with a strong element of religious
extremism well I was sponsored by a
Ronald Reagan you know in fact Reagan
there was a brutal dictator at the
Reagan years as heel hook who worked
really hard to eliminate the secular
elements in society brought in Saudi
Arabian money poured in to build the
Madras as you know the religious schools
which became terrorist training schools
a lot of them Reagan even went to the
extent of denying that Pakistan was
developing nuclear weapons although the
US government of course no you wouldn't
know they were and you know then we end
up with you know the Kahn networks have
been distributing and the nuclear
weapons and missiles around the world it
was strongly sponsored by the United
States when I say Reagan I don't mean to
imply that he actually knew about it he
may not have known anything about it but
his administration certainly did
do you think overall I'm gonna ask if
this might seem a little naive but I'd
like to get your opinion on this do you
think religion overall is the main cause
for conflict and suffering over the last
thousand years in the sense of creating
the conditions that we have in the 21st
century or do you think that's a little
bit simplistic I think it's not a little
bit but the Norma Street simplistic I
just take the current period right now
some of the worst maybe the worst
atrocities going on in the world in the
last few years are in the eastern Congo
where estimates are maybe
four million people killed I don't think
religion had anything significant to do
about it
right now the the u.s. invaded Iraq of
course hundreds of thousands of people
killed the society devastated you know
millions fleeing may move on to
conceivable it might move on to attack
it Rand is a religion involved in fact
the u.s. attacked a secular tyranny in
Iraq and you've been listening to part
one of the discussion on humanism with
professor Noam Chomsky part two of our
discussion will air next week at 6:30
p.m. meeting everyone my name is Barry
Simon and this is equal time for free
thought a forum to explore the evidence
based worldview built upon a foundation
of scientific naturalism and secular
humanism on this program we examine why
we think such a worldview should be the
basis of a progressive future society
today we are proud to present part 2 of
a two-part series with famed political
analyst Nam Chomsky we've asked
professor Chomsky questions about
religion what he thought about human
nature as well as economics and
political ideals that might help us
articulate what we need to do towards a
future humanist society Noam Chomsky has
been leading intellectual on the left
for more than 35 years and has written
about and spoken to a variety of issues
including capitalist economics the
nation-state focusing on an extensive
critique of the powers that be and the

jersey-based political scientist Steven

the Middle East and u.s. foreign policy
equal time for free thoughts spoke to
Professor Chomsky a few weeks ago on the
substance of humanist thoughts from
naturalism and religious critique to the
political and economic structures which
must be in place in order for us to
affect the social changes necessary
toward creating a humanistic futureworld
society here is part two of that
discussion last week we began our talk
on religion with the discussion of
supernaturalism and naturalism
the primary attribute of supernatural
thinking is that there are magical
entities or for
which control the fate of humanity on
the contrary most natural ists argue
that humans are actually just one sort
of animal very much part of the natural
world this then means that our behaviors
are determined by some combination of a
genetic makeup and the environment from
birth to death act and how that
environment acts on those genes do you
think such a naturalism leaves open the
possibility of free will which seems to
contradict our notion of
cause-and-effect universe no it doesn't
contradict anything it just says that we
don't know whether the phenomenon that
we will experience it's our most
immediate experience the phenomena of
freedom of will is a real aspect of the
universe that we simply don't comprehend
yet or maybe ever or whether it's an
illusion that can be explained in some
other fashion that question just remains
open there's plenty of things we don't
understand for example we don't really
have a an intuitive grasp of something
which now naturaliss take for granted
namely that if I move my hand I can I'm
moving the moon you know that there can
be interaction at a distance when Newton
proposed that he regarded as a total
absurdity that's why he which is he said
no person of sound scientific
understanding can imagine to be true for
a moment if I could spent the rest of
his life trying to find some way to get
around it as did leading scientists of
his day but for centuries afterwards it
finally became scientific common sense
well there are things about the world we
just can't comprehend and it's we don't
know how far if we are just part of the
animal world as I believe and I think
you believe then our cognitive
capacities are going to be like all our
other capacities they'll have a certain
scope and they'll have certain limits
that's the nature of a biological
organism you're suggesting that until we
know more about the workings of the
human mind or you know that neuroscience
is it's starting to show us we can't
divinity come down one way or another on
the freewill question it's more of a
matter of intuition and still
the realm of philosophy Bertrand Russell
pointed out back in the 1920s and I
think correctly that there are several
grades of confidence that we have or we
should have in our belief system the
highest confidence is in our immediate
experience mmm the second level of
confidence he said is in the report of
immediate experience by others who are
like us and the third level lowest level
of confidence would be in the scientific
constructions that we develop to try to
make some sense out of our experience
well you know our most immediate
experience I can't think of anything
more immediate and less questionable is
that I could decide right now to say
hang up the phone or start talking about
you know the Boston Red Sox or thousand
other things but I'm not going to do it
because it wouldn't be appropriate our
most immediate experience is that we act
in ways which are somehow appropriate
situations which is quite different than
saying they're caused by them now maybe
there is some way of accounting for our
choices in terms of the circumstances in
which were placed and something internal
to us but you know that's a thesis it's
certainly counterintuitive and and I
think philosophers who discuss what do
you call themself determinists like your
friend of mine ten hundred would argue
that it is counterintuitive
and it might be easier to dismiss what
they call counter causal freewill and
then to affirm pure determinism but it
is it is a very complex question I don't
even believe that it's a complex
question I think it's something that we
simply do not know
mmm-hmm there are a lot of things we
don't know one of them is whether the
immediate experience of freedom of will
is an illusion or whether it is in fact
an aspect of the universe that we have
not yet come to comprehend and that our
cognitive capacities may not allow us to
comprehend just as our cognitive
capacities we are serious about it are
like Newton's they do not like allow us
to comprehend the
that action without contact as possible
we accept it and we understand theories
about it but as a big difference between
intelligibility of theories and
intelligibility of the world in fact
what happened in the Newtonian
revolution took a long time for it to
sink in was that the aspirations of
science were lower in the early modern
scientific revolutions a Galileo up
through Newton and beyond the assumption
was guiding idea was that the world is
like is a kind of a complicated machine
sort of like a clock you know the fancy
clocks that artists entitled just a lot
more complicated and we can understand
and and our goal is to try to gain the
understanding of how this machine works
well when Newton came along he was
accused of reviving occult forces the
things that machine can't have like
action at a distance and he really was
accepted that and you know he's not a
fool nor were the other great scientists
of the day and in fact if you look at
what really happened over time the
aspirations were lowered the goals of
science were lowered from
intelligibility of the world which we
kind of give up to intelligibility of
theoretical explanations of the world
which we hold and try to pursue well the
reason why I'm asking this question at
all because I think it might be
important due to the understanding it
might offer us and how we treat one
another especially with regard to say
the criminal justice system for instance
if we understand that we're not
ultimately responsible for our actions
as determinants say we might want to
alter our rather punitive methodology
regarding methodology regarding
punishment and reward and we focus our
efforts on creating a healthier
environment from the get-go I think I
mean I agree with your goal we should
what you're describing but I think
that's totally independent of what
speculations we have about the nature of
freedom of the will we do it anyway I
mean in our ordinary lives and in human
affairs we simply take for granted that
people have freedom of will just as we
see in ourselves and that they therefore
have more
responsibilities how we proceed to deal
with the questions that arise that's a
matter of the level of humanity and of
civilization that we've achieved for
example really serious problems in the
United States about this
take for example incarceration the u.s.
is just off the chart in incarceration
and it's not you know in our culture you
go back 25 years it wasn't true the same
society 25 years ago and incarceration
levels were within the spectrum of other
industrial societies will it or the high
end but not much another off the chart
did our culture change that takes a
incarceration of children children with
life and the International did a report
about a year or so ago on a
cross-country examination of children
who are in prison for life without
possibility of parole
well there very few I think there's a
couple of thousand around the world I
mean in countries which have any sort of
statistics I'm not talking about eastern
Congo the and the United States had
almost all I mean that's just scandalous
a kid is in prison for life without
possibility of parole because when they
were 12 years old they happen to be at
the scene of a robbery where felony was
committed yeah you know how to comment
on this this has absolutely nothing to
do with what we what speculations we may
have about the nature of freedom well I
want to get into those kind of questions
which had to do with the state of our
economics and the like but just as a
sort of a segue into that and coming
from the freewill question what do you
think behaviorally speaking humans
primarily are that is do you think we
have a sort of Hobbesian human nature or
plastic human nature or something else
because this seems to when you hear
either conservatives or liberals or
people on the far right or far left
discuss what kind of policies and what
kind of economics and what we should
have you know how we should deal with
the rest of the world it usually always
often comes back Lisa to justify their
opinions it always comes back to well
this is what humans are and this is
therefore more natural for us to do a
you know have a capitalist society or B
have a social Society what do you think
is the basic human nature that or
do you think that we have a basic human
nature I believe that we are part of the
natural world okay therefore we have a
nature
it's our genetic endowment determines
substantially what our nature is in fact
if you look at the growth of any
organism us bees you know yeast would
have a like there are actually three
factors that enter into its growth and
development one is its genetic
Constitution another is environmental
effects and a third is just the way laws
of nature work which is a turns out as a
major effect and the inquiry into
biological organisms takes all of those
into account or should as for our human
nature the genetic endowment that we
essentially share very little is known
about it I mean it's just a really hard
question and as I mentioned in our
earlier discussion a lot of the ways of
studying it are excluded simply because
we don't allow invasive experimentation
hmm the and it you know it's hard enough
to learn about insect nature where we
allow ourselves anything much simpler
organisms so what do we know about human
nature well most of our knowledge comes
from history experience literary
exploration and so on that's what our
knowledge comes from what does it tell
us it tells us that of course humans are
partially plastic-like I'll speak
Swahili for example so we're partially
plastic on the other hand there's there
has to be an enormous uniformity at a
level right below the surface and what
we see on the surface is a wide range of
possibilities I mean we see people who
are acting in a beastly fashion we see
others who are kind of sacrificing their
lives to save dolphins one of the the
sciences and I'm not sure it would be
categorized the hard science or soft
science or it's a it's an emerging
science evolutionary psychology people
like yo Wilson and Steven Pinker have
come around and and said they understand
what human nature is and it's based on
this new science
are you saying then that they are either
still just guessing or do they have some
some scientific backing that from what
you have if you've read any of their
work
yes I know there were a lot of them it
was now called evolutionary psychology
was in fact initiated about a century
ago over a century ago by Peter
Kropotkin the analyzed thinker and
naturalist wrote a book called the
mutual aid a factor in evolution mmm-hmm
and in it he investigated he was
basically trying to counter social
Darwinist he was Darwin Darwinist
himself and he argued by looking at a
lot of naturalistic phenomena other
animals human history and so on he
argued that if you look at it you
discover that mutual aid had a provided
a selectional advantage and therefore
organisms were had evolved through
selection including humans to be deeply
committed to one or another form of
mutual aid well you know that's not what
elite opinion wants to hear mmm they
want to hear some other story so
therefore for potkins
form of evolutionary psychology
essentially disappeared I've been
revived to some extent the actual modern
the modern state of evolutionary
psychology as I mean it's not that
there's no science there at all there's
some you know like sake in selection is
real reciprocal altruism is real a
couple other things are real but very
little is known it's Finn this is not
physics and certain it's not molecular
biology it's not chemistry it's a
largely guess is not it's a worthwhile
topic to pursue thank you mine topic to
pursue in fact it's where my own
professional work is in particular areas
but we should be scientists particularly
should be very cautious about inducing
the in diluting the public to think that
they know more than they do
mmm science has held an enormous respect
for good reasons and therefore
scientists have a responsibility to make
very clear here's what we know here's
we don't know and what we know in these
areas happens to be extremely thin not
because they're not good scientists but
because the questions are too hard so
you consider yourself an anarchist or
libertarian socialist I believe one
species of anarchist pardon the phrase
since we're talking about biology no is
called free-market anarchists they argue
that markets market societies become a
problem only via corporate capitalism or
as in me Milton Friedman's brand of
conservative libertarianism and that
market abolitionism is tossing out the
baby with the bathwater do you think
there can be a place for markets in in a
non capitalistic perhaps even non
statist society and it was sort of
quickly jumping into this maybe we
should backtrack a little bit and
discuss what what you think about
capitalism and markets well first first
of all I'm you know I have to kind of
give the same response that Gandhi gave
when he was asked what he thought about
Western civilization that maybe it'd be
a good idea
right right okay one can say the same
about markets maybe it would be a good
idea but there are no markets some of
the only market societies that the only
social systems that approximate market
societies are poor colonized
underdeveloped countries where it's been
rammed down the throats and that goes
way back I mean if the United States se
had ever been a market Society we would
now be pursuing our comparative
advantage of exporting fish and fur a
few scattered people who lived here the
u.s. developed as did every other rich
and developed society by a radical
violation of market principles extremely
high tariffs most protectionist country
in the world through its period of
growth a state intervention to manage
and control industry Industrial Policy
right at this moment it's essentially a
logical impossibility for the United
States to enter into free-trade
agreements because our own economy
depends crucially on the state sector
that's where we get computers and the
internet and telecommunications and the
containers that allow trade and lasers
also see an aircraft just look across
the board
relies very heavily on the state sector
for its dynamism its innovation and so
on so it's room very remote from a
free-market society and so is every
other one that had choices the societies
that it takes a the modern so-called
Tigers you know the East Asian Tigers
with great growth period Taiwan South
Korea China Japan they did it the same
way the currently rich societies did
namely by violating market rules but you
do separate I assume markets from
capitalism itself correct I don't know
what capitalism is supposed to be if
capitalism is supposed to be a market
society it's never existed except iron
countries Richmond rammed down the
throats okay
okay but we have a situation now
obviously United States which is which
is pretty terrible and it is a statist
society and it is a capitalist society
do you think we ought to be shipped back
to some sort of New Deal social welfare
state model like we saw in Scandinavia
several decades ago
you know perhaps one in other words with
with even regulated markets but not you
know corporate capitalism if that's
possible do you think that's a remedy or
at least on a short term earth well the
New Deal was a corporate state
capitalist society Roosevelt himself was
strongly supported supported by a major
sector of corporate capitalism it's been
shown by research of Thomas Ferguson and
others rose was a lot of a strongest
support was coming from the high tech
internationally oriented sector of
American state capitalism like GE and
others and the modern corporation
its modern form goes back about a
century earlier predecessors but New
Deal style welfare state measures were
introduced under tremendous popular
pressure and that has extended there
wasn't any Medicare under the New Deal
or Medicaid popular pressure has
continually attempted to bring about
government involvement intervention in
ensuring social
welfare I mean for decades and right now
large majority the population usually
runs around two-thirds or more is in
favor of a national health care system
of the kind that most other industrials
apparently every other industrial
society has something kind of like maybe
Medicare extended to the population
that's an overwhelming majority of the
population and that's the highest
domestic concern of people in poll after
poll right now the latest polls the
highest concern is Iraq second-highest
concern is health care well how come
these measures aren't enacted well
because they're regarded as by elites as
what's called politically impossible
meaning the insurance wall street's
opposed the financial institutions were
opposed the pharmaceutical corporations
are opposed the matter of 90% of the
population wants it so therefore it's
not on the political agenda it is
interestingly getting on the political
agenda now because a major sector of US
corporate state capitalism is supporting
it beginning to support it namely
manufacturing industry who are being
harmed by the extreme and efficiency of
the privatized health care system here
it's twice the per capita expenditures
of any place in the world whether an
industrial society and some of the worst
outcomes I was asking about that because
what it would be New Deal or even a new
keynesian kind of a model that we saw in
Sweden in the 60s and 70s
they've been economists who have argued
you know a few of them Robin Han they'll
talk it's Fotopoulos that the this kind
of social democracy has failed not only
because of outside pressure neoliberal
globalization but also because it's sort
of putting a human face on capitalism
and it's capitalism itself that's the
actual problem so it's sort of putting a
bandaid on a ruin rather than curing it
what's your thoughts on on on the social
welfare state in that sense even if we
mean it to be something that's temporary
in order to rollback the neoliberal
agenda well I think take someone who's a
committed revolutionary and I think we
really have to throw out the whole
capitalist whatever there is a
capitalist system
market system and so on pick someone
like that they're still reformists I
mean all the people imagined are still
in favor of sate developing a decent
health care system through government
intervention because that's the only
option today none of them say let's not
improve lives for people because we'd
like to see a revolutionary change
they'd all be in favor for example take
say OSHA you know safety and health
roles in the workplace I mean especially
under four years it's been declining
there Bush probably disappeared but
everyone you imagined it'd be in favor
of strengthening those regulations
they're government regulations because
what you're in favor of if you're
serious and the people you mentioned are
is pressing the institutions to their
limits seeing what they can achieve when
they're you're not going to get mass
popular movements trying to overthrow
the institutions until people recognize
they cannot satisfy our needs okay
therefore you try to press reform as far
as possible within the structure of
existing institutions meanwhile
developing alternative institutions from
within building the future in the
present society goes on simultaneously
right that that's called a sort of but
the next question was an email
conversation you and I had you said that
libertarian socialism is a long-term
goal one that you and I both I think
agree with is a good goal what should we
be doing from within towards the
long-term goal of libertarian socialism
partly its educational partly its
organizational so at the educational
dimension what we would do and have to
do is first of all develop their own
visions of the future Society and try to
learn about them and try to get others
to understand them try to get others to
contribute our understanding of that's
educational programs at the
organizational side we should be simply
developing alternative institutions for
example self-manage workplaces with
sharing of work rules Robin Hahnel who
you mentioned is one of the people is a
lot of work on this is Michael Albert
and others yeah we can do that and a lot
of its going on recent book by gar
alperovitz reviewing initiatives of that
kind all over the country so it's both
both
develop the understanding of some better
future for yourself and for others and
you also try to work through words of
constructing it in my own personal
opinion I think the great question of
not only you know practical politics but
of political theory er is how do you
balance the needs of liberty and
equality because those two impulses
always seem to be in conflict
conservatism would put in a sort of an
extreme emphasis on individual liberty
and sort of neglect equality liberals
you could argue probably want a little
bit of both and radicals or they're
anarchists communists or socialists
would in some sense lean more toward
equality over liberty I'm just curious
to know from you how do you think first
up do you think there is a tension
between liberty and equality and
secondly how do we best create a society
that balances those two tensions the
idea that there's a conflict between
them is ideological dogma
we don't know that there's a conflict
between them and in fact classical
liberals didn't think there was so it
takes a Adam Smith who were supposed to
review but not Reid is one of his core
arguments for markets I'd rather nuanced
arguments for markets but one of the
basic ones was that as he said in a free
society markets will lead to equality
and he meant equality of outcome not
equality of opportunity no he met
equality of outcome which he took for
granted to be a deserter out of well
that was one of his core arguments for
markets uh the under particular social
and economic conditions you get
different results but I don't think
there's anything generally can be said
about this I was going to say because
Adam Smith and I actually did read my
Adam Smith one of the reasons he
believed in markets was because he was
anti monopolies and that he viewed you
know these concentrations of power as
inherently dangerous to Liberty is that
accurate that's correct
and he was opposed to mercantilist
structures which have been reconstructed
in many ways in modern corporations yeah
he was strongly opposed to that in fact
when the modern corporation that was
introduced by state power about a
century ago classical liberals
conservatives they were often
called bitterly condemned it is return
to feudalism thank you very much
professor Chomsky for coming on equal
time for free thought today this has
been truly an honor and a privilege and
maybe hopefully you'll come back on our
show someday and thank you very much
okay glad to have you bye-bye
