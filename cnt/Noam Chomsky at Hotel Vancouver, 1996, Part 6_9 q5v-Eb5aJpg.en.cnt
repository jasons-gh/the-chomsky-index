angling us which is what they might do
with the new what's going on something
like that but it doesn't have to be like
that educate public education can be
very deliberate and here in BC we're
looking at cutting we're looking at
cutting back charter school funding from
minified into home schoolers from
minimal to none and well the public
education system by the latest poll by
the Ministry of Education shows that 12
you know 4.2 percent of grade 12
graduates feel uncared for and we're
11.2% of great old graduates feel that
what they're learning is unreal
irrelevant what are the dangers in
cutting back
education education funding to all
so-called are alternatives that want to
pop up what counter well parent is doing
oh anything from something like the
Sudbury Valley school to private schools
the to private Catholic schools I mean
well you know that there's something
there's kind of like a fundamental point
to face and that is as human beings do
we only care that like the what am I
supposed to only care that my children
get educated or am I supposed to care
that the kids down the street get
educated no that's you know that's the
question that cups goes across the board
on every issue there is a very powerful
you know extraordinarily powerful part
of the entire sort of capitalist
ideology is making you worry only about
yourself lose any connection to other
people destroy solidarity just leave
solidarity in the hands of the investing
class the rest of you just worry about
yourself
this goes way back you read the
working-class press and 1850 and round
the places like where I live you know it
in round New England which was the
center of the early Industrial
Revolution it was very lively
working-class pressed run by mechanics
and what they call factory girls young
women off the farms and so on a very
interesting reading but one of the
things that they were denouncing was
exactly this tendency the what they
called the new spirit of the age gained
wealth for getting all but self which
they regarded as degrading and demeaning
and destroying you know their human
values and so on correctly
in fact the labor movement throughout
his whole history has been fighting
against this work together you know
because we're all in it together and we
want to help each other that's a very
different ethic that's it's a
traditional ethic it took modern
capitalism's even questioning but and I
think that what questions is a very
antique human well that shows up in
connection with the schools it comes
down to the question do I care whether
the kids down the street get an
education well I think we should you
know I think we should care that that
means that means a public education in
fact I think that's the major motive for
public education like public health you
know it's like a public health system do
we do I care that the kids down the
street have sewage okay well the same
question you know why not just me I
should have sewage and they should have
a like you know hold on about in the
backyard well you know that's a question
of what kind of a world you want to live
in do you want to live in a world where
people care for each other and care
about each other I think we can tell you
that at least I think we ought to live
for that kind of a world but to then
that some form of community education
whatever you call it is part of it it
means that children ought to have the
best opportunities they can have and the
best chance for developing their own
powers that they can get it whether
they're my kids there's nobody else's
kids
and the whole move towards vouchers and
privatization and so on is in Africa as
far as I can see like trying to
privatize health care which says well
who cares if they're healthy down there
as long as I'm rich enough to buy health
care for myself and it's a very
dangerous tendency that's look I mean
you can say Medicare I mean what kind of
a show in Egypt of it yeah sure so a big
community system or a public system set
up plenty of choice
but that's what a democratic a
democratic society and a free society of
cooperating people or to allow options
if if you're only given the choice of
everybody's kids go to a factory call
the school or else I make choices for
them well that's not a very good set of
choices but I think we ought to be
working for a public education system
that you know that really does provide
opportunities and options and freedom
let's go on up to some limit I mean you
know you can't pop the limit has to be
determined by a community is really one
of my kids I ended up sending to a
private school to the online favor of it
actually ended up my girlfriend school
which is about as close to that as you
can get in the Boston area but that was
for you know I wasn't happy about it but
for various reasons given the options
within the public school system we just
felt we didn't do it so I'm not saying
that these are easy personal choices
given bad options they're not and the
same Stroeve health you know like I mean
I know that like if you might one of my
kids let's say really needed expensive
health care and you couldn't get it
through the public system I'd find a way
to pay for it myself though I don't
think there ought to beat that ought to
happen well it's because we're given a
set of bad choices so within the set of
bad choices I think things are just try
to make them better not eliminate the
good things because in some aspects
usually ain't working
I mean in a way it's like you know
anything you point to it's gonna be like
that every institution that exists is
distorted by concentration of power and
many other things fine so you try to
overcome those distorting effects but
you don't throw away whatever is useful
about institutions isn't about the labor
movement on the labor movement I think
has been over over the years has been a
major force and democratization and
improving people's lives and so on and
so forth on the other hand is crooked as
hell you know all involved with
gangsters and so on and so forth well ok
you know see instead of saying ok let's
throw out the labor movement what you
say is let's get rid of that aspect of
it
make it more responsive to workers
there's been a lot of yeah ok let's
let's
yeah and I'm analyst but I think you
know yeah I think it's better than
people to the mic sorry I didn't mean to
cut off the previous speaker I I have a
question there's been a lot of
discussion lately about the fact that
corporate profits have been rising while
at the same time layoffs of of employees
have been
