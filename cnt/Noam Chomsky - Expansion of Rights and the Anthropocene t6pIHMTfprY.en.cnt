over the past centuries the kind of
domain of Rights has been expanded so
like if you go back 800 years to Magna
Carta the kind of foundation of
anglo-american no Western law it granted
something called presumption of
innocence you're innocent unless proven
guilty in a fair trial with by a jury of
peers now that incidentally that right
has completely disappeared today guilty
means that Tuesday morning Obama decided
to kill you that's what guilty means
today that's the drone terror campaign
but there was such a principle
presumption of innocence but it was for
free privileged men in fact barons you
know over the centuries had expanded not
totally but it did expand considerably
okay he takes a the United States in the
United States Constitution it's there
but it meant free men with certain
amount of property obviously didn't mean
slaves didn't mean native-americans it
didn't mean women they were not in fact
women under the US took over British
common law under which women were
property they weren't persons so a woman
is the property of her father that's
properties handed over her husband in
fact that lasted until 1975 not that
long ago 1975 the US Supreme Court ruled
that women have a right to serve on
federal juries that means to be peers to
be a peer means to be a person so it
took a long time but expanded it's not
perfect but it expanded and rights have
extended in other ways like the slavery
is outlawed and so on and that's also
true of animal rights there's been a
expansion of the concern for animal
rights
takes a Cambridge Massachusetts where I
live two major universities Harvard MIT
50 years ago the labs were carrying out
experiments with animals that you cannot
carry out the day they violate federal
law local law and even university laws
all right that's an expansion of the
domain of animal rights at the same time
the severe regression huge regression
you take a look at species extinction
today species extinction today is at the
level of 65 million years ago when an
asteroid hit the earth and ended the age
of the dinosaurs massive extinction took
place that kind of opened the way for
mammals ultimately us species extinction
now is at the same level except we're
the asteroid that's an attack on animal
rights which is just colossal no we're
wiping out species at the rate of 65
million years ago when an asteroid hit
you can't imagine a more extreme
violation of the rights of animals of
species and we don't even know if that's
not enough is known to know if that's
the actual number could be much higher
because we don't I can identify lots of
species so it goes both ways it's
definitely a serious issue and we ought
to think about it part of geologists is
a lot of you probably know break up the
history into epochs now there was the
Pleistocene which lasted a couple of
million years up until 10,000 years ago
then comes the Holocene that is
connected with the human invention of
agriculture which made a big change in
the general environment 250 years ago
starts a new epoch it's called the
Anthropocene that's the industrial
revolution with really rapid effects on
the general environment you take a look
at these
numbers and project and it's not pretty
to ask what comes next but that's what
we're doing now we're racing forward to
make it worse let's say in the United
States now there's a lot of enthusiasm
about becoming the Saudi Arabia of the
21st century hundred years of energy
independence and so on what's the world
going to look like after another century
of exploiting fossil fuels well don't
leave it to your imagination but it's
it's not something projected for the
future it's something underway right now
with a massive attack on attack on
animal rights in fact massacres and
we're next not far
