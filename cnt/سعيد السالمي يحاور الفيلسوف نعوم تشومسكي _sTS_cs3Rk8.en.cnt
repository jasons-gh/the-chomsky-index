what's your advice to DRP does that took
a finish from darling
there's no advice to leader they know
what you do what the advice should be is
to the general population
[Music]
the leaders are sentenced to 20 years
many trauma listen child
what do you think about that situation
[Music]
pretty healthy is what I think about it
question is what to do about it the Arab
leaders are concerned with their own
interests our the wealth controlled
nominations I don't think they want to
attack you right but what they they
might be provocative
[Music]
it's a great pleasure to be with you you
have always considered that humanity is
facing to to agree threats the
ecological destruction and the nuclear
threat let's start by the first one the
ecological destruction dr. Tomsky as a
philosopher do you think that there is
still a chance or a possibility to make
a balance between the technological
developments the scientific developments
and the effects well I put it the other
way
scientific developments are the only way
for us to escape the catch catastrophe
which would be from an ethical point of
view utterly disasters its science that
will help us escape the facts the only
way for us to escape the looming
disaster environmental destruction and
as I say from an ethical point of view
destroying the prospects for organized
human life about the worst time the
imagine but the only answer to that
problem is scientific developments so
for example if we can move to
sustainable energy it's because of what
science achieves not was achieved in the
literature Department are you
pessimistic that this also is the
imminent
I think the disaster is very close I
don't see any reason to challenge the
overwhelming consensus virtually 100% of
the serious climate scientists and they
have plenty of evidence that were moving
to within a generation or two we might
reach total catastrophe if something
series isn't done
concerning the second trade the nuclear
threat as you know Trump withdrew from
the deal of the fence deal of 2015 but
the lates even proved that he looks like
he could engage a war against yarn isn't
it a positive mark in your view can we
expect a war more balances than well now
I don't think that the Trump
administration wants to attack it read
the consequences of that could be
they're unpredictable but they could be
devastating for example Iran has
sufficient missile capacity to attack
the air the Northeast areas of Saudi
Arabia
this is Shia areas where the oil where
most of the oil is oil facilities and
also where the desalination facilities
are now it correctly wipe out Saudi
Arabia they could the US would probably
respond with some devastating attack but
then I could easily spread and you know
where we couldn't make Isis look tame I
don't think they want to attack Iran but
what they might the provocative moves
that they're making might lead to an
accidental conflict say in the Gulf of
Hormuz which would blow up without
anyone's intending to be but easily
happen if an Iranian small boat launches
you know it's a US aircraft carrier you
know you tweeted be are a disaster but
more globally the Middle East is the
Middle East North Africa or the Middle
East as you call it here in the Middle
East is very troubled are you optimistic
about
it's future with all the cultural
problems ethnical problems Middle East
is doing is doing a good job of moving
in suicidal directions not just because
of the cultural issues I mean the most
of the Middle East region is gonna be
unlivable region literally the major
oil-producing regions have had about 30
or 40 years in which there is a little
window of opportunity they wish they
could shift from fossil fuel production
to something sustainable they're barely
making moves in that direction they're
still trying to expand fossil fuel
production which will destroy the region
this is quite apart from the confi
internal ethnic cultural and other
conflicts which are very harsh and make
it very hard to reach rational
concluding decisions about these matters
so yes I think the Middle East region is
very troubled for many reasons it
reminds me wow you said about this
lightly society it's with its cultural
problems its internal problems how these
problems may have a significant
significant impact on its power can we
talk about our self-destruction like
others let's just serious problem there
so that's not the most important or true
I think the problem within Israel is the
European based religious population
which is expanding very quickly carry
depopulation which doesn't contribute to
the society
is becoming an enormous factor and it's
undermining the second or character the
society it's leading to a serious
internal crisis for the there is the
Arab Jewish community is also
participating
they've been their own you know their
own elements as for the elements have
you heard about the deal of the century
the Orion though whether exists but from
the proposals that have been leaked out
it seems like an effort to eliminate the
Palestinian issue by sort of trying to
organize some funding that will satisfy
minimal Palestinian that needs is no
indication where that funding will come
and will to some kind of alliance
between Israel and the reactionary Arab
states one of the it's very hard to find
a coherent geopolitical program behind
the chaos the trunk creates all over but
there is one as an effort to construct
an alliance of the most reactionary
states in the Middle East that would
mean the Gulf dictatorships CC's Egypt
Israel which is shooting far to the
right beyond this Modi's in the or bonds
Hungary few others and to make that a
kind of an international base
reactionary alliance which would be the
base of trumps power that extended
Brazil tomorrow
others this is pretty explicitly the
dictates of Steve Bannon who was an
advisor he talks about it openly and
it's probably probable that that's in
the background of the people who are
carrying out any kind of tier strategic
analysis and compchomp administration
that may not include him he's doing
something else probably doesn't know
about it doesn't cure but I meant for
the Palestinians it means just ending
everything but
[Music]
this is the classic question the
traditional question how do you explain
and what the silence but the complicity
of Arab leaders Arab leaders are
concerned with their own interests power
wealth controlled nominations for them
the they're compelled to show concern
for the Palestinians because they have
to keep their own populations quiet and
the population for the population isn't
a big issue but you know there's been a
kind of a tacit alliance between Saudi
Arabia and Israel since only since 97
1967 which is when US policy towards
Israel changed radically before then it
was not there was commitment but nothing
as extremists followed that and the
reason is in 1967 Israel provided a
great service to both the United States
and Saudi Arabia by destroying the base
of secular Arab nationalism which was
the main rival to Saudi Arabia radical
Islam
that's an old conflict when the British
dominated the region they tended
overwhelmingly to support radical Islam
against secular nationalism when the
u.s. took over
through much the same policies and
that's understandable as secular
nationalism can lead to independence
development for the reliance that worth
adducts radical Islam you can assume we
take care of 9/11 was an exception but
it works most of the time and for them
that meant by the post 1967 region
Europe for the first part of the US
policy was based on three pillars as
they were cool
one was Saudi Arabia one was the Reds in
under the Shah the third was in the room
and the relations between Iran and
Israel were very close a lot of this
came out theoretically they were war
with one another but in fact they had
very close relations well this came out
after the Shah fell lots of information
appeared but it turned out that
virtually all the Israeli leaders had
traveled to Tehran and they were closely
they were acting in very close concert
and many issues and Saudi Arabia was
sort of part of it on the side and one
of the this great you know the deal of
the century a part of it is just to try
to bring all this in the open with you
right now of course but was the
reactionary Arab states and others in
the region how do you explain the the
expansion of the right wing next time
that's happening all over the world
there also there's resistance to it at
us all over the world take a look right
now Julie masse
was lots of uprisings against harsh
repressive regimes a lot of it is the
source of a lot of this all over the
world is the impact and the illiberal
programs of the legends generation which
have had a pretty harsh effect almost
everywhere in the United States for
example and in Europe this led to high
concentration of wealth pretty much
stagnation for most of the population
undermining of democratic forms there's
people angry resentful discontent with
established institutions it's its
fertile territory for demagogues to
arise to try to turn people's anger
against scapegoats usually people you
even more vulnerable than your
immigrants Muslims African Americans and
others but at the same time and it's
it's leading to a kind of a popular
reaction which is seeking to overcome
the these crises so for example in Chile
you may have seen the one of the slogans
of the demonstrators is it's not 30
paces it's 30 years we want to get rid
of the legacy of the Panama Shaitan
dictatorship which was the first major
experiment in neoliberalism it was
imposed by force Chuey later it spread
with Thatcher and Reagan to the Western
world that effects of elsewhere the
structural adjustment programs in Latin
America and went several decades of
under development and all of this is
piling up in many ways if you look at
the individual countries there are
specialists but this is a kind of an
undercurrent that you see everywhere
that's
the kind of contempt for the centrist
institutions that have run the societies
for many years is a pretty natural
consequence of what the policies have
meant to people in Europe the special
feature the structure of the European
Union is deeply undemocratic major
decisions taken out of the heads of
people they're placed in the bureaucracy
of Brussels naturally causes resentment
especially because the nature of the
policies which is the austerity policies
have been very large other places
there's different nations but this is a
kind of a marker and kind of like the
Arab Spring which may come back it's
undermining the democratic forms it's
because of new liberal programs but it's
also a representative democracy crisis
isn't a box of Trustee listen you're a
very strikingly so as I say in Europe
major decisions are made then unelected
bureaucracy in Brussels with ignore
their banks looking over their shoulders
now there's something not too different
in the United States and England the
effect of the neoliberal programs the
sharp concentration of wealth the
stagnation for the general population
has exacerbated features of Western
democracies that were already there
namely the overwhelming power of
concentrated wealth of the corporate
power that's been exaggerated enormous
the only rule period so people know
attitudes towards conquers or people
single-digit support you said that the
offspring may come back as you know the
populations are evolved against
dictatorship and authoritarianism but it
went bad because especially of
geopolitics now the populations are
taken hostage between the authoritarian
ISM and instability what's the solution
in your view dr. Tomsky solution is to
what was begun with the Arab Spring but
was aborted by concentrated power to
move the hunt to eliminate the
autocratic reactionary
social structure at the introduced
really functioning democracy there were
steps towards that but they were crushed
in one or other way as soon as you sort
of mildly developed an Egypt there
wasn't relation but it elected the
Muslim Brotherhood which had its own
kind of autocratic repressive character
that unfortunately the military coup the
progressives part of the population
welcomed the military coup much of it
because they thought it would bring
democracy to Egypt that's quite an
illusion military who introduced was
probably the hardest period in Egypt's
history in Syria of course everything
crash but I think the germs still
existed they'll probably come back up in
Egypt there were recently demonstration
new encroachment authoritarian leaders
toka
vanish from that situation to surprise
their people while the social causes is
increasing what's your advice to the
authoritarian army there's no advice to
the leaders they know what they're doing
what the advice should be is to the
general populations thereafter
organizers carry out significant actions
to try to overthrow the the dismantle
the authoritarian structure of the
states in the economy but that's in the
hands of the population the leaders
about do it
they're the ones with benefits vermin ah
 how about this happened you know in
Morocco to popular pressures there was
some relaxation of authoritarian
structures same in the United States I'm
in the United States in many ways is a
more civilized country than it was 50 or
60 years ago but that's not a gift from
leaders that's because of popular
activism which forced the leadership
class to yield to the pressures of the
population now let can go much farther
this actually great social tension in
Morocco many hundreds of political
prisoners men hundreds of peaceful
demonstrators from the reef regional I
have been arrested during last two years
for asking for drop Hospital education
that leaders are sentenced to twenty
years many tamales in jail what do you
think about that situation Baxter
Trotsky pretty healthy I think that
question is what to do about it but I
mean if you look at Egypt than about
sixty thousand that's what
popular organization should be
struggling to overcome and it would be
very good if there were international so
let the Solidarity of this to support
them but the leaders are not going to do
anything you have to force it on the
leadership there's only one way that
works that's by popular activism which
is not easy you get shot by the police
the imprisoned and so on but over time
and can succeed so if you look at
history there are many things that were
repressive systems that looked is this
there's no last forever
we're in need of a throne I thank you
very much dr. Tomsky I hope you enjoyed
the questions
