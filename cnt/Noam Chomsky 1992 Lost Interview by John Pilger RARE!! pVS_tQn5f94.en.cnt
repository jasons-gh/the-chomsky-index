in fact it was was like as later
learning the fourth is a worker that's
tripartite there's two parts sort of
fighting and they entered history
they're fighting he picked up the share
of power then there's the general
populations they both wanted this to it
in the Spanish Civil War there was a
popular revolution and the Stalin back
Republic and the fascist first combined
along with the Western democracies to
destroy the popular revolution and after
that was done they picked up the floor
what to pick up oil which is not an
unusual pattern and I saw I can't flames
was understood in any deaths at the time
I could already see the fixture our by
the time they're selling it was taxing
along and the information about the
surges is it impossible to take anything
seriously I was also an anthem enemy
because it stressed me at the time that
however horrifying the Stalinist times
were they clearly had there our origins
and lemonis authoritarianism and I was
also quite yet divorced about masters
and not so much certificate ideas is the
concept of any movement that is named
therefore the person already to rouse
decision it's the gift at once it is the
form of organized religion it's
something like that so we can't win
physics there's nothing like Einstein
ISM and in any serious dough name you
don't personalize collections of belief
and that immediately if they are like
wisdom in hindsight and it was quite
extraordinary at that period in the in
the 1940s when you consider the circle
that knew worth living and moving it if
that's not to have of known as the
Russian thing
you live you didn't have your revolution
with Spain
yeah I mean face I don't exaggerate I
was 10 years old at the first article I
wrote first litical article was actually
for a woman's paper and it was on the
fall of Barcelona and I'm and I knew
what was going on but I had some sense
of it and as I said shortly after I had
the rock I think in retrospect who have
become close to Annika crystals which
were quite Lively at the time and it was
a very lively vibrant exciting period of
political culture and working-class
focus because you still described
yourself as an anarchist and as a
libertarian socialist many people these
days
things are rather arcane expressions
almost from another age what do they
mean to you what they mean is the search
actually it's an outgrowth of classical
liberalism it's classical liberalism
adapted to the modern theory it's
anarchism is not a fixed set of ideas
it's a tendency and in a thought that is
trying to identify times is authority
and domination and if they can't justify
themselves which they really can who
works over summer
that means the overcoming state sorry
it also means overcoming the autocracy
capitalist enterprise which is simply
another form of hierarchy and domination
and sometimes it isn't it means
overcoming sexist expression whatever
you find sometimes it's already handed
exercise so for example if you've got
the three year old kids running across
the street fasik that's a party but I
think you can give a justification for
it
however the burden of proof is always on
those pieces all right they have to
demonstrate that their authority and
control with legitimate and that
justification can very rarely be given
so what you'll say that any structure
any institution then that the wall
should be challenged any institution has
Authority and domination institutions of
cooperation
voluntary Association Federation and so
on I think they don't have that burden
of proof and in fact they wouldn't want
an effect I believe that if you read the
classic original text 18th century
seriously and apply them to the current
age this is what he discovered Adam
Smith everyone reads the first paragraph
which talks about a wonderful division
of labor is but very few people gets
there amazing eight five hundreds or
were ever did for he says to see any
results of division of labor is going to
be to turn human beings into something
that's stupid engineer insane person can
be and therefore in any civilized
society the governor become one will
have to intervene to prevent thee for
endless effects of the Invisible Man
answer as a libertarian socialist what
do you make of the received wisdom today
but socialism is big it's happy well
let's let's take the very back to the
world what would for socialism in
Eastern Europe was killed by late 1917
of early 1918 every socialist tendency
that had developed in this free source
of experience was immediately excavated
including Soviet what factory Council
any positive organization was like that
since then it has been a trace of
socialism in Europe and in the West are
there have been kind of a slow there's a
there's a move for at the time as a
social democratic state capitalism like
some kind or other in various places the
basic ideas of socialism are in the
future
socialism is based on the traditional
socialism it simply is based on the
application of Enlightenment ideals to a
better society and it means that workers
will control for that
will control community and so on that
socialism if it means anything okay so
your friends of libertarians thank you
does that exist it anyway no it's a
little bit like asking where the
democracies existed anyway there's some
pieces of again I mean you look around
the world there are bits and pieces in
sponsorship in the United States that
are elements of democracy is very
limited element but real ones
so it's an improvement over the 17th
century lipstick that the American
Revolution would need to be flawed in
many ways in fact it's a third-world
country today or to promulgate the US
Constitution we would regard it as a
reversion but not system that
Constitution identified a group of
people priests it's human pretenders all
right but nevertheless in the context of
the time of the tremendous man and being
struggle for freedom is unending
are you cross one bridge designed other
barriers so there are bits and pieces of
democracy there are bits and pieces of
popular control there are new forms of
authority and domination that we didn't
notice before could we live on to what
it seems had the greatest impact on your
life and that was the Vietnam War or as
you've described with the American war
against Asia ok can you give me
something of the impact that have that
had on your life it had virtually no
impact in my thinking but it did have an
impact on my action there just came a
point where it seems impossible to look
in the mirror and continue with a very
pleasant life but I was leading I mean I
had a fine professional life I wrote my
work three or family
you know and there were funny things
that they passed out and then I had
individually she's got the best with me
but the Vietnam War by the early 1960s
is becoming a real monstrosity and you
made a conscious decision it was a very
conscious and a difficult decision
because any new ladies giving up a lot
and you can't put your foot in without
starting to swim again and it's obvious
it's going to go on and will be more
demand on I should say at the time that
I got started I thought it wasn't
totally hopeless all right we really
thought that I was getting insights into
a 1964 audiences is for people in some
church where the one with the organizer
and one with the local minister and one
was a junkie wandered off the streets
and the fourth one somebody wanted to
kill you and in fact as late as 1966 in
Boston this is a literal City
all right have public meetings against
the war without them being physically
attacked the first major public thought
that gave on the Boston Common
this is that few Lord isn't late 1965
the three or four of us were seeking had
to be protected by hundreds of police
and if you later right but you had quite
a profound estate directory so you were
a little off today there's nothing I
think more than doing general public
it's during this time of the Vietnam War
that you weren't developed being what
you'll almost acclaim for and probably
what you're most attackable
that is your skill at debunking the
language of the state the newsfeed of
the state the lives of respect what was
can you give me some idea
that's like full but very effective but
this takes take the general framework in
just 30 years ago 1962 Adonis Kennedy
sent the American Air Force the bomb
South Vietnam that was not a secret so
in October 1962 the New York Times had a
front page story in which they said 30%
of the missions against South Vietnam
has American pilots flying well you know
there was no pretense the first time
that we were attacked if anyone was
involved except us and the South
Vietnamese and we were attacking the
Delphian amazing 30 years is gone by it
has never been described in the
mainstream as an attack against Vietnam
it is always the defense of South
Vietnam and then people debate whether
the defense of South Vietnam was wise or
unwise for us but you know the very
phrase attack against us Vietnam is
expressible I mean it suggests it's the
Russian there any hadn't fallen apart so
Fresno's system is and maintained and
imagine that 30 years after the invasion
of Afghanistan no one had ever referred
to an attack against Afghanistan
everyone had referred to it as a defense
of Afghanistan against Erik supported
from the outside well that's what we're
living in we wouldn't call that subtle
propaganda if you thought aggressive we
would regard it as through its developed
Arianism but that's what we're living in
terms of the state and we we have we
have refused in this country and in the
United States the terms extremists and
model yeah they pop up on the news
regularly and in the same way that
people can be tagged so nations can be
so moved here we have to be a little
more differentiated I mean in the in
educated circles what if we were honest
we control the comments are flat they
take very so for example think they can
be Vietnam okay no one in the Thomas are
flat no journalist no intellectual no
writer and simply expressed truth that
the United States attacked South Vietnam
that's inexpressible in fact I've been
looking at
and impress some scholarly literature
carefully for 30 years now if anybody
can say it if you say it's in America
now sweet-talking of it takes a moderate
that is a very definite meaning Sobers
Marvel's yeah in the mid-1930s history
was a moderate he was described as a
moderate who describes everything
imagined government he was even flirting
internal documents and even published it
described as a moderate standing between
the famous of the right and left and
ever we had ridden and whistling he was
a moderate all of us about the names of
the moderate in back in the mid nineteen
in the late 1980s analysis news no
healer subscribe to moderate
contributing stability generally parts
of Indonesia is described by in the film
fest regularly it from 19 1965 he came
into power watering maybe 700,000 people
the New York Times and other journals
described him as the leader of the
Indonesian moderate today the London
economist says describe them as f5
benign
on the style of don't you think and if
you're often described as an extremist
sure I am an extremist because the
moderate and anyone who supports Western
powers and an extremist if anyone's
isn't subject now you've had some quite
spectacular rounds Arthur Schlesinger
accused you of betraying the
intellectual tradition I'd rather you be
with durability to power and if I didn't
afraid I would be attaining my because
around this time you'd accuse legends or
another being but useful a secular
priests it takes learning it off this is
I've got to say a sec of the face but
because it's you were dead to find a
whole cloth you were saying the liberal
intelligentsia of America are in bed
with the US government and some of the
more vicious policies around there as
they applied
I could say I bought an accusation well
I tried to document it in fact every
thousands of pages of documentation when
I think stage so the Flint after the
time secular freaks that I borrowed from
Isaiah Berlin who applied it to the
Russians
i'ma start west and I think it's correct
they're a secular priesthood and we have
one two namely the age of data sector
can I just interrupt there a second
because you you use the term commissar
they can defeat Russian experience and
Stalinist when you describe the Western
yeah you do that to infuriate no it
would be accurate I think that the term
Thomas R is a digital one there is the
dominance in virtually any sense if you
look at the respected and respectable
intellectuals are those who serve
external power a we main honor the
Soviet dissident but internally that
were not nominee they were filed the
people who were honored were the with
the common source and this is good it's
all the way back into take the Bible the
people who were honored in the Bible
with a false prophet it was the one we
call the prophets who were jailed and
driven into the desert so on
all right that's typical entirely
understandable we could have the honesty
to look at ourselves by the standards we
fighting easily applied to others so if
say a British intellectual rights
apologetic
vulgar apologetic for US government
atrocity that's no different than
anything American intellectual Road
vulgar apologetics its own and it
happens all the time the last time I saw
you speak in South London you defended
very vigorously the right of a man to
have his say a hectare and you happen to
be a man of near fashion does that right
a free expression expression in your
view extend to everybody I mean if we
don't believe in free expression for
people who despise you don't believe in
it at all
let me take another example recently
Muslim extremists last year's Muslim
extremist in this case
we will actually allow to call for the
death of Salman Rushdie would you would
you support their right to speak in that
one speak yes but I think their sentence
standard is the one that could be
observed if first two people walk into
it so third you and I walk into this
store and you have a gun and I tell you
shoot food store honor well that speaks
but it's not effective because that
that's things which is part of a bomb
attack but shouldn't that be as in the
case of the race that's being allowed to
speak shouldn't let me simply and indeed
it is in this country illegal
I mean it's incitement to murder you
have to ask whether it's incitements and
feminine violent action not you know
there's no there's no precise litmus
test it tells me the way to draw the
line but freedom of speech is ordinary
argument and I think there are somebody
says shoot when someone else has a gun
okay that's and the court rules wording
that the that the sonic many brought of
course things as Rushdie treated
regarded as subject to the equivalent of
vicious violence he's in the first rule
that if he had criticized between in the
Anglican Church fiftieth mosque then
then he would be subjected penalty but
it was only later things are selected so
that doesn't protect the papacy the
principle first falling burning rush to
organize and calling for death was
was inciting the murder yeah and you
wouldn't you wouldn't if it wouldn't
defend is right to do that
I agree that we're getting near the
border I mean if we got to the point
where someone said shoot there's Rushdie
standing over there that's not detected
if it's nobody making a speech thing I
think you would be killed I think they
think I ought to be filled
I don't think they ought to be stuff to
making that speak now you know exactly
how you make these decisions is a subtle
matter but it seems to me protection of
the right of freedom of speech all right
is extremely important your enemies have
a certain value to you judge fast the
success of what you're doing by the bat
by the intensity of the taxing I would
sort of wave in balance for example if I
started to be praised
you're doing by the rock by the
intensity of the taxonomy I would sort
of wave in balance for example if I
started to be praised by establishment
sectors I would have furiously with it
I'm not doing something wrong
why are they crazy over again it's not a
witness thing there's a person but
there's something else isn't there
because I read that while your
colleagues and friends from the 60 we
said many half note that you just go and
inside on the surface you're the country
is a very different message center for
30 years ago it is a much much civilized
country outside of educated circle it's
a much more to the Life Center now
that's not because of news that it's
because of thousands of people doing
both of organizing
actions very fun and I can play a role
in what they do many of those people
need someone group needs someone to come
in and get it for being a demonstration
of something and this tremendous
compensation for doing well assuming
history has an end where is the next
popular movement coming I think they're
they're still Manning up they pay
environmental issues or they're not that
you can't against that anymore we're
reaching the point where such a human
survival may be at stake but there's a
core question which is not addressed and
that's the question of power in the in
the state economic pump Nexus that's
basically the question of perfect power
we have to revive the understanding of
the 18th of 19th century that sorta
static controls of the economic system
is intolerable there's a major attack on
democracy going on in the world
absolutely major effect decisions about
the about human rights are being really
leveled so high that even Parliament are
not influencing them so there's a kind
of a de facto world government being is
that which are being designed to be
insulated from any form of positive
pressure they do surgeon they search
they reflect something real they request
the internationalization of the economy
they respect them they respect it
thank know people talk about the enemies
history but what there seems is its
intended effect on democracy and that
has to be understood and struggled
against best impede up
