welcome to activism in ik professor Noam
Chomsky thank you for joining us again
learn to be with you so I want to start
with you with some historical
perspective and let's work a way up from
there before the Second World War
what view did the United States
government half of fascism in Germany
what was the political and military
relationship between Berlin and
Washington well it was a mixed story
Roosevelt himself was I had a mixed
attitude so for example he was pretty
supportive of Mussolini's fascism in
fact described Mussolini is that
admirable Italian gentleman he later
concluded that Mussolini had been misled
by his association with Hitler and had
been led kind of down a wrong path but
American the American business community
the power systems in the United States
were highly supportive with miscellany
in fact even though parts of the labor
bureaucracy were a fortune magazine for
example the major business journal I
think in 1932 had an issue with the
headline I'm quoting it if the wops are
unlocking themselves the wop is a kind
of a derogatory term for Italians and
the wops are finally under Mussolini
they're becoming part of the civilized
world
it's and there was criticism of the
Italian invasion of Ethiopia a lot of
criticism but basically pretty
supportive attitude towards Muslims
fascism when Germany when Hitler took
over the attitude was more mixed it was
a concern for potential threat but
nevertheless the general approach of the
u.s. the British even more so was
apparently supportive so for example in
1937 the State Department described the
Hitler as a kind of a moderate it's
fending off the dangerous forces of the
right sorry I should continue yes please
the State Department described Hitler as
a moderate who was holding off the
forces the dangerous forces of the left
meaning the Bolsheviks the labor
movement and so on and of the right
namely the extremist Nazis and if there
was kind of in the middle and therefore
we should kind of support him this is a
pretty familiar stance incidentally but
in many other cases George Kennan later
famous is one of the architects of
post-war policy it was actually the
American Consul in Berlin
up until Pearl Harbor and he was sending
back reports which are public which were
qualified they said we shouldn't be too
harsh and condemning the Nazis there's a
lot of what they're doing is kind of
understandable they you know could we
could get along with them and so on this
is one strain and a major one there was
also plenty of criticism and
condemnation but the general attitudes
were fairly mixed now this is sometimes
called when
at the Munich conference late 38
Roosevelt sent his most trusted adviser
Sumner Welles to Munich and wills came
back with a pretty positive report the
saying we can really work with Hitler
it's this conference opens the
possibility of a period of peace and
justice for Europe and we should work
out ways to interact and deal with them
now that was late 1938 okay and so it
was quite a mixed story back to this
good there's good scholarly literature
on this if you want to go through the
details let's take a step forward than
in history in your speech
who owns the world that you held in the
you won University of Massachusetts you
surface from internal documents a scheme
known as the grand area could you talk
about the grand area and specifically
what role Germany was assigned within it
this is scholarly work on the Council on
Foreign Relations and the State
Department the Council on Foreign
Relations is the major non-governmental
institution concerned with Foreign
Affairs it says it draws from a wide
range of elite elements of business
politics of academic and so on it
publishes the journal Foreign Affairs
which is the main establishment Foreign
Affairs Germany from 1939 until 1945 the
Council on Foreign Relations and the
State Department held regular planning
sessions in which they tried to analyze
the wartime situation and lay plans for
the post-war economy in the and they
developed the concept which they called
grand area the grand area was defined as
a region that the US must control in the
post-war
it included of course the Western
Hemisphere it included the former
British Empire which the US was
intending to largely take over maybe
Britain would be a junior partner and as
much of Europe the commercial and
industrial center of you as much of that
as possible certainly Western Europe its
industrial technological commercial
center in the early stages of the war it
was assumed that there would be an
American controlled area grand area and
a German controlled area and they
thought in the early stages the war
looked as if Germany would be successful
in carving out an area after Stalingrad
and at the time when the Russian forces
were beginning to crank on the Germans
driving back toward Central Europe the
the conception changed that they
realized increasingly that Germany would
not survive as a dominant force in the
world
so the conception of the grand area
extended beyond this area was defined as
one in which the United States would
have pretty much complete economic and
political control and exercises of
sovereignty by others which challenged
this control would not be permitted I
can't give the exact wording right
offhand but it's something like that and
easily find it the major study of this
was done by two young American political
scientists Clara Chopin William enter in
a book called Imperial prank bang a
brain trust a Larry Shoop incidentally
just come out with a new book studying
Council on Foreign Relations programs in
the later period but that's the general
conception and it was pretty realistic
if you look at the power relations in
the world
the
was not an unrealistic picture remember
that the United States emerged from the
second world war in a position of power
that had no historical parallel the US
had literally 50% of world wealth
it had incomparable security controlled
the Western Hemisphere controlled both
oceans controlled the opposite sides of
both oceans had overwhelming military
power economic power who was that other
industrial societies had been either
seriously harmed or sometimes it's
virtually destroyed by the war that the
war was very beneficial to the US
economy
industrial production virtually
quadrupled the wartime spending ended
the depression which had not been ended
before enormous stimulus to the economy
the technology was developed which laid
the basis for post-war growth it was in
that context grand area planning of the
kind I described was by no means
unrealistic and furthermore it was put
into effect was implemented if you look
at the policies implemented and
developed in the early post-war period
they followed these prescriptions of
pretty closely read for example the
policy documents of the State Department
policy planning staff headed by George
Kennan by then they more or less spell
out the particular variants of these
programs each region of the world was
assigned what was called its function so
the function of Southeast Asia would be
to provide raw materials and resources
not just for the United States but
primarily for the former colonial powers
that which needed them in order to get
dollars so that they could purchase the
US manufacturing sir Germany's function
Germany's particular well took a couple
of years but within a few years Germany
began to be reconstituted
as a central part of the grandeur wasn't
called for in there anymore it was part
of the US dominated global system by the
early 1950s there were steps towards
every armed rearm it's certainly part of
this program I should say beginning
actually in the 1943 1944 was to
undermine the anti-fascist resistance
almost every word they first in Italy
the first place where the US and British
forces penetrated the Italian resistance
had precepts what was holding down
probably half a dozen German divisions
and parts of Italy had were beginning to
reconstruct an independent Society now
all of this was dismantled as the US and
British forces moved through the
peninsula and they pretty much
reinstated the traditional order
including fascist sympathizer and
similar programs were adopted in other
parts of occupied Europe as the United
States Britain took over including
Germany in fact a cannon at one point
toppled war planners I've said that the
West ought to wall off that's his phrase
wall off western Germany from the
eastern zone because there was danger of
the what they regarded as danger of the
labor based but they called communist
policies affecting the West might affect
them in Italy with a strong Communist
Party which was probably gonna win the
first 1948 election the u.s. poured
enormous resources into making sure that
they wouldn't win the election making it
very clear to Italians in many ways that
if they allowed the Communist take
control they'd be in deep trouble one
state department officials that the
policies have to be clear enough so that
the dumbest walk and under
Stan we're gonna strangle them unless
they look the right way in the first
free election in Greece the at first the
British moved in they faced a strong
that they tried to crush the
anti-fascist resistance they weren't
able to do it the Americans came in to
join them there was a major war which
probably a 150,000 Greeks were killed
the end result was a restoration of
something like the traditional society
including fascist elements and the
tragedy of Greece goes on from there
later in the 1960s there was a real
outright fascist coup in Greece military
fashion too strongly supported by the
u.s. continued supported until it was
overthrown by the Greeks in the mid
seventies excuse me for interrupting you
that's more forward to economic policies
doing that era in Europe there was a
huge rebuilding effort in Germany under
the Marshall Plan and in Germany it's
seen in the mainstream perception in a
historical literature it's seen as a
very noble endeavor it was based on
principles of cooperation and so forth
and so on
however in your book title understanding
power you write and let me quote you
here Marshall Plan was designed largely
as an export promotion operation for
American business not as the noblest
effort in history and it failed can you
please elaborate on that please that's
approximately what it did most of the
Marshall Plan money actually was
transferred from one bank to another in
the United States part of the Marshall
there was a big problem at the time a
major problem of the over of industries
industrial production the u.s. had a big
surplus of industrial production and the
world just didn't have markets the world
was virtually devastated by the war
so part of the attempt to create markets
for us excess production was what I
described before ensuring that the
former colonial areas would provide the
dollars through the to Europe so they
could purchase US industrial productions
called triangular trade programs and
other was the Marshall Plan which did
provide funding to purchase American
exports in the course of it Europe did
develop incidentally about I think
probably two billion dollars or so of
the thirteen billion it went for oil
imports that was part of the u.s. effort
to turn Europe into an oil dependent
economy the United States controlled the
oil Europe cold not oil and same in
Japan to try to turn them into oil
dependent economies the region the
reason that which was again expressed
clearly by George Kennan was that if we
did that we would have what he called
veto power over their policies because
we would essentially control the energy
speakers so all of that was it is not to
deny but in fact it's true that did help
European recovery to some extent that
how much is argued but to some extent it
did develop the you were being the
economy but it was also a big boost to
the United States in fact if you look at
the business literature in the United
States they describe this program
correctly as this source of the modern
multinational corporation that provided
opportunities for the US multinationals
then beginning to develop expansive
extensively to move into Europe as a
major place area for investment
production marketing and so on so is it
like most governments don't aren't
altruistic institutions they're working
for their interests and that means the
interests
dominant elements within the society and
they can sometimes have beneficial
effects but those are rarely the driving
forces not just the United States anyone
else as well now that you've given us a
historical perspective let's move to
certain developments that have been
happening today according to a report by
the Department of Defense dated June
2015 there are forty four thousand six
hundred sixty u.s. US troops stationed
in Germany it is estimated that there
circa and reports vary but let me just
point this out
170 military installations and one of
the most vital being Ramstein where
drone operations as you know are
conducted from there what do you think
is the view of the US political and
military establishment towards Germany
today is there any is there any
significant change since what what
you've described before well if you go
back back to the early 50s there was
always concern that Europe might move in
an independent direction independent of
us power it might become what was called
at the time a third force in
international affairs now the dominant
force was the United States the second
the second force was the junior super
powers Soviet Union Russia Soviet Union
and it was concerned that Europe which
is of course a rich developed the lanced
area that might just move an independent
direction
there were various proposals for this
like the goal advocated what he called a
Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals
including the major parts of Russia
major developed parts of Russia Willy
Brandt's must politique was another move
in that direction and the US was always
concerned with it in fact one of the
functions of NATO generally understood
was to keep to ensure that Europe would
remain under the US Egypt would not move
towards an independent direction and
those concerns still
and in some ways are even greater the
Europe does have the capacity of under
German initiative to move and
independent direction there are some
there's some steps in that direction in
fact it's very current in fact it takes
a the Iran nuclear deal that was just
made that the European powers Germany
France are very enthusiastic about it
they're moving directly to try to
reestablish commercial other relations
with Iran European know the ministers of
the government the corporation
executives are flocking to Tehran to try
to set up deals and arrangements it's
not happening from the United States on
the contrary it's even possible possible
that the u.s. might undermine the
agreement not the executive but Congress
might find ways to undermine the
agreement in fact if you take a look at
the Republican primaries taking place
right now
they just about every leading candidate
I said that when he's elected he's going
to cancel the agreement in fact several
of them have said when we're elected
we're going to bomb Iran that's quite
different from the European attitude and
it's one of a number of ways they're
quite a few in which Europe and the
United States are the dominant elements
in the United States has following
different paths this this kind of
conflict has existed for a long time
as I say it goes back to the early 50s
and it takes different forms at
different times with us our declining in
the world relatively to others is still
overwhelmingly dominant but it is
declining the options for Europe race
might move in that direction
now of course Europe means primarily
Germany in September of this year the
u.s. announced that it will be sending
around
a new type of p-61 12 nuclear bombs here
in Germany at the Bushell airbase each
of these bombs has 80 times the
explosive power of the nuclear bomb that
exploded in Hiroshima and most notably
German taxpayers will cover 1/5 of these
cost do you think that Germany is
violating article 1 and 2 of the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty which it
ratified I think in 2003 well that's a
no these treaties are somewhat vague in
their formulation so whether it's an
explicit violation is a kind of
technical question the more important
question is should Germany be doing it
and in my view absolutely not of the
existence of nuclear weapons is a major
threat to survival if you look over the
record of the past 70 years it's a
virtual miracle that we survived
literally there are a number of times
when the world has come literally a few
minutes from a terminal nuclear war
so in 1979 for example there was the
u.s. automated response systems had
detected what they determined to be a
Russian attack the reactions should have
been a pre-emptive nuclear strike on
Russia the National Security Adviser is
big new prevents key was virtually on
the telephone to tell the president
authorize a nuclear attack when
information came in saying it was a
false alarm
in 1983 couple years later the Reagan
administration was carrying out
simulated attacks against Russia to test
Russian defenses operation able Archer
it was called including nuclear threats
the Russians took it pretty seriously it
turns out and there was a major we now
know that it was a real war scary that
right at that time the Russian automated
systems detected what they took to be an
American missile
attack the protocol was for the single
human being named stanislav petrov who
was supposed to take those reports hand
them over to the high command in which
case that probably would have been a
preemptive strike he just decided not to
do it that's why we're here talking
about and there are many other cases
like that including real adventurism
Cuban Missile Crisis others complicated
story but to maintain these systems is
Lee that at every moment that raises the
possibility of the serious nuclear
attacked and remember an attack by any
major power will destroy the attacker
even if there's no response because of
the effects of nuclear winter it's been
understood for decades so to try to
increase these threats is core test they
ought to be reduced not increased or if
we intend to survive and now as a period
of considerable trim tension where
something could break out over crane
maybe over Syria and so on the expansion
of NATO to the borders of Russia after
the Soviet Union collapsed was I think a
serious error of policy not just error
of its understatement and it's a large
part of the problem that's leading to
the crane confrontation now this
incidentally was in violation of verbal
promises not written ones but verbal
promises to Gorbachev II thought that
the unification of Germany would mean no
expansion to the east was not the US
view so these are really dangerous
development I want to talk about some
single examples and work on to the
greater mechanisms that are at work here
so Germany really recently dropped a
case that was investigating the abuses
of the NSA which was revealed by Edward
Snowden's whistleblowing actions
and details included such as
eavesdropping on our Chancellor's
cellphone even collecting metadata of 20
20 to 30 million German citizens on a
regular basis and this investigation was
dropped and if we look back a decade
el-masri a german national was detained
in an holiday in Macedonia by the CIA
and extradited to Egypt where he was
tortured extensively and it was later
determined that he's innocent now in
both cases our prosecution went after it
but at the federal level it was dropped
at some point and we've come to know
that u.s. is at play here so what
mechanisms are at play here that always
align German policy to US interests
Germany and France and of the European
countries have their governments have
made a decision to subordinate
themselves the u.s. power shows up in
these ways and many others you recall
when the president of Bolivia Evo
Morales a fluke happened to fly to
Moscow and was flying back to Bolivia on
a in a plane that had diplomatic
immunity of course the European
countries including Germany and France
just wouldn't let him go through their
airspace obviously on US orders the u.s.
thought that maybe slit Snowden was on
board so they wouldn't let him enter the
airspace the pain was finally finally
had to land in Austria where it was
invaded by Austrian police in violation
of every imaginable with diplomatic
convention to find out if Snowden was on
it although this is that it's kind of
pitiful it's a revelation of real
cowardice in the face of power that the
European elites are unwilling to
confront a sign of subordination and
real lack of dignity and integrity in my
view and the cases you mentioned are
examples under the idea
that there are I think by now for Latin
American countries that offer asylum to
Snowden not one European country in fact
they won't even let him cross their
borders
why cuz the u of the master in
Washington tells them we don't want them
and what he would instead important to
recall performed enormous service a
patriotic service in fact to the people
of the United States in the world he
revealed to the population what your
government is doing to you that's just
what he should have done that's what a
that's the responsibility of a decent
citizen the idea that he should be
punished for this is really grotesque
and that Europe participates and it is
even worse
seems Prasanna there's some there's some
there's some resistance to US military
presence here such as peaceful
demonstrations that take place here
Monday in Minich every Monday and yearly
demonstrations against the security
conference in Munich and more recently
demonstrations are developing in
Ramstein in front of the drone base
however these grassroots actions are
immediately associated to the
nationalism of the 30s that we are
uniting as a nation and standing up by
the mainstream press immediately so
you've described this sort of action by
the mainstream media as the fifth filter
could you briefly touched touch upon
that again and why the mainstream media
uses this sort of action to quell
grassroots movements the mainstream
media or an ideological instrument now
they have they have owners they have
commitments they have advertising
support and so on they they're very
valuable I mean I read them all the time
I'm glad they're there but we shouldn't
have any
they're not coming from Mars they are
based on existing institutions of both
power and domination within our
societies and that affects the way what
they choose to discuss at all some
things they don't discuss and the ways
in which they do it it would be almost a
miracle if that weren't true and when
they condemn actions like these that
should be taken sprays say we're doing
the right thing
if these institutions condemn us that's
pretty good reason to think we're doing
the right thing it happens to be counter
to their particular interests but they
don't represent the public interest
they represent certain special interests
of power and domination and privilege so
if they don't like what we're doing fine
let's continue and it is the right thing
to do at least if you care about the
survival of the species and that's
what's at stake we should recognize that
in the case of nuclear weapons as well
as environmental catastrophe we're
really talking about survival of species
in the case of nuclear weapons literal
survival and it is again I repeat it's
come very close in the past and there's
no reason to think that's not Germany
has strong economic interest in the
Middle East to name a few examples it is
selling tanks to Saudi Arabia and it's
providing submarines to Israel what
implications to these relationships have
on democracy and the security security
of the population there I think they
harm the security the population take
the submarine these dolphin class
submarines that German is providing to
Israel are instantly refitted in Israel
to have nuclear weapons capacity and
that's not aimed at defense of Israel
nuclear weapons nuclear armed submarines
don't defend Israel they are meant for
attack that's what they are and you know
what attack they're aimed for in the
short run
attack on Iran in the Gulf that's a
terrible threat not only to the Iranians
but to the world then Israel after all
has a doctrine official doctrine they
say they're free to attack Iran if they
choose to furthermore Israel has been is
engaged in what the Pentagon described
as a war against Iran so is the United
States the pen of US Pentagon declares
that cyber war is an act of war
NATO last year agreed that at a NATO
conference that a cyber attack against
any native country would call into
operation the mutual defense provisions
of the NATO treaty which means every
NATO country would be entitled to
respond to a cyber attack by a military
attack the US and Israel are not only
carrying out cyber attacks against Iran
they're proud of it no that was openly
proclaimed with pride a sabotage cyber
attacks that's an act of war of killing
Iranian nuclear scientists which is
probably carried out by Israel we're not
sure would we accept them and to send
submarines which are in effect nuclear
armed submarines will become so the
Israel at this time is a an act of a
radical act of adventurism which is
should not be tolerated by Germany
that'll be there are other cases too but
this one is particularly egregious Noam
