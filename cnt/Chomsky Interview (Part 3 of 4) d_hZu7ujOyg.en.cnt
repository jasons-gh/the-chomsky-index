stay with Blair I heard a recent
interview with john de querer who stated
that after seeing blares performance of
the chilcot inquiry on iraq he wouldn't
want to interview or ask him anything I
take it he meant the Blair had covered
covered all the angles sealed off the
Monell if that he was now impenetrable
if you had a chance would you ask Clara
question no I wouldn't ask durables a
question you not that he's the same but
it's the same principle yeah I mean
there are businesses to protect
themselves to produce the answers which
don't make any sense in fact I don't
think there's much point talking to the
journalists and intellectual support of
the war I mean you can always make an
excuse for anything you know but when
information even a good room moving on
to Palestine I ask you a question in a
past email regarding the ongoing Israeli
atrocities atrocities towards the
Palestinians and the fact that Israel
always resort to that Tyson line of
defense regarding and last names been
the destruction of Israel I wondered why
Hamas wouldn't just shout their
rejection of violence than their
willingness to go along with whatever
the Palestinian people want from the
rooftops you stated that you agreed
today and ass should shout it from the
rooftops though it wouldn't be listened
to I'm not sure about this so wouldn't
it be the case that if Hamas were
absolutely unequivocally bout their
commitment to nonviolent resistance the
Israeli and the compliant elements of
the world's media would not be able to
offer any justification for their
violent actions Hamas good in a frantic
all Israeli I'd love that I was zero of
it and there's no particular reason why
they should humiliate themselves I mean
if you want to play the game of
commitment to district the commitment
with Hamas is already four years joints
come out in favor of the international
consensus on the two states set on it
they say they don't want to recognize
Israel I mean does the Democratic Party
you recognize Pakistan that political
parties don't recognize
if they're part of a government that
recognizes it is relocating that's all
that matters can they just say you
recognize these rate isn't why should
they need concrete of this I don't think
they should should the Democratic Party
recognizes a England I mean doesn't make
any sense white this is simply a means
of trying to humiliate them and prevent
diplomacy these are ridiculous demands
for furthermore if we want to pursue
this line of reasoning let's take the
ruling party in Israel Likud Party oh
they have a program I'm their official
program program on which they won the
election is that there cannot be any
Palestinian self-determination anywhere
in the Land of Israel well what's the
Land of Israel maybe they meant the
Jordan to the city but if you go back to
the Likud charter which they never
withdrawn that includes Jordan so
they're committed to the destruction of
wolf Palestinians and further it's not
just a verbal commitment they're
carrying it out and they have the gall
to say Hamas is committed to our
destruction I you can't even laugh you
know and I you know I a lot i don't like
about from us but to ask them to accept
these terms is just an effort at sheer
humiliation why should they accept it
I'm you can say it saying about other
countries I suppose that the United
States insisted that Mexico recognize
the right of the United States to exist
sitting on half of Mexico comfort in a
war where should they will never do that
they recognize the United States but not
its right to exist sitting on a half of
Mexico I suppose that Iran was powerful
enough so that it could demand that we
recognize Iran as an Islamic state
should we do it no why should we i watch
it anyone recognizes or as a Jewish
state I mean there's no reason to set up
these standards these are just various
techniques that have been designed to
try to evade diplomacy you mentioned in
a recent interview that Reagan's day
vacation is in marked contrast to public
opinion Joey's during his lifetime and
diametrically opposed to his actual
achievements whilst in office you stated
that having gods to worship is the
easiest way to distract people why
Reagan though and Kennedy why not Carter
or LBJ is it because they most easily
fit round America well Kennedy is
deified mostly among kind of liberal
education sector and he was he knew what
he was doing he realized that if he sort
of buttered up the intellectuals he'd
get a good press and if you look at the
whole creation of the Camelot image
that's just what happened I mean it was
right here in Boston it was dramatic
there was a shuttle of plane that went
from eastern shuttle went from Boston to
Washington every day and back in the
morning the Harvard and MIT professors
would get on the shuttle to go down to
Washington you know have lunch with
Jackie talk to the great man back in the
evening tell us you know how marvelous
catala I'm an exaggerated you look up at
that time back that was the that that's
kind of what was going on and it ended
up with Kennedy having a very good
picture of the administration the crimes
and just suppressed that was needed in a
very dangerous man I mean could go
through it but
his administration brought us pretty
close to nuclear war needlessly lot
apart from a lot of other things but
maybe scholars know about it but it's
not the image i what am I Reagan well
you know Reagan it was not particularly
popular other are polls in the United
States you can check i'm not even study
in fact when he left office say around
nineteen ninety he was polls show that
he was actually the most unpopular
living president apart from Nixon he was
below quarter and so on but then a huge
campaign developed called the Reagan
legacy to try to turn him into a kind of
Kimmel some figure so if you read
publications from say the Hoover
Institute at Stanford University he's
described as a colossal figure hovers
over us like a Friendly Ghost I mean
that's the kind of thing you might get
out of North Korea but night here you
get it out of the Hoover Institute at
Stanford and there's been presented as
the model of the free enterprise limited
government and so on actually he tripled
the deficit he the government grew under
his regime he was the most
protectionists president in post-war
American history doubled the import
restrictions to try to salvage
incompetent American management which
couldn't compete with the Japanese and
the International spherist a mass
murderer I mean in Central America he
had a war on terror that it killed a
couple hundred thousand people it's
being suppressed like in this morning's
newspaper if you read the New York Times
you notice a little item about the
arrest of twenty Salvadoran soldiers for
the murder of six Jesuit intellectuals
in 1989 it happened to be slightly after
Reagan left but those are the policies
of the Reagan administration
was initiating the killer's didn't say
it in the paper but the killer's had
just they came from a battalion the
aplicado battalion which had already
killed tens of thousands of people my
most brutal vicious battalions armed and
trained by the Reagan administration
they had just come from upgrading their
training at the John F Kennedy special
warfare school and Fort Bragg North
Carolina ties it together nicely came
back to El Salvador given orders by the
High Command which was in close contact
with the u.s. to break into the
University and assassinate the Jesuit
intellectuals this is a week after the
fall of the Berlin Wall that not only
destroyed essentially wiped out
liberation theology which was a great
fear for the u.s. back from the night
early 1960s when it began they were
adopting the preferential option for the
poor you know they were trying to go
back to the Gospels aus what a major war
against the church this was the latin
play religious martyrs this was the last
pretty much less debt that's of enormous
historic importance it's out of history
and that's just a piece of Reagan's
legacy and Reagan was one of the
strongest supporters of apartheid the he
incurred in order to increase support
for the apartheid regime Reagan not on
had at the inviolate congressional
sanctions which you did and there was a
justification war on terror 1988 the
white house condemned the African
National Congress says the words were
one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world in fact Mandela
himself just got off the terrorist list
about two years ago he can now come to
the United States without a special visa
so in order to fight the war on terror
they to support apartheid
and not only did that support crimes
inside South Africa but it also
supported South African rampaging in the
neighboring countries which according to
a leader UN analysis led to limit in a
half death in the Middle East strongly
supported the Reagan supported the
israeli invasion of lebanon and of
course participated in it vetoed
Security Council resolutions and so on
the usual and if I continued to support
it until it became was becoming harmful
to American interests by mid-august so
he ordered beggin to call it off or he
was a what use in 1982 August 82 and of
course Israel obeyed they have to so
he's you know gave him to go ahead cold
it off when it was done another 20,000
people his record it goes on and on this
guy's at a serious mass murderer and
certainly you know to call him a image
of free trade and actually the deficit
the up until reagan the united states
had been a creditor country world's
leading creditor the reagan very quickly
turned into the world's leading debtor
that's fiscal responsibility that and
also tripled the national debt but you
know you concoct the imagery do anything
you like that's what public relations is
about
