all right no I'm thanks for coming
you've mentioned quite a few
contradictions from the media and their
presentation on things and I think the
most notorious case of this is with
September 11 2001 you mentioned in a
forum on Z met in 2006 that you wanted
to see a consensus of engineers and
specialists that understand the actual
structures of these buildings and their
possible collapse and there is such a
group and I'm here to tell you about
that in ask a follow-up question
it's called architects and engineers for
9/11 truth there's a consensus of over
2000 W is this a question we spend
intellect asking a question I'm setting
it up thank you this consensus shows
that building seven the third building
that fell on 9/11 fell in freefall speed
as the NIST report acknowledges we're
ready to come forward and jump on board
9/11 I know you've mentioned it's a
distraction but there's no better case
of the media covering up things than not
presenting building seven that third
building we've all seen the other Towers
fall but what about building seven dome
well in fact the you're right that
there's a consensus among the miniscule
number of architects and engineers tiny
number they're a couple of them are
perfectly serious they are not doing
what scientists and engineers do when
they think they've discovered something
what you do when you think you've
discovered something what you do is
write articles and scientific journals
gift talks at the professional societies
that go to the civil engineering
department at MIT or Florida or wherever
you are and present your results and
then proceed to try to convince the
National Academies the professional
Society of physicists and civil
engineers the departments and the major
universities
Vince them that you've discovered
something now there happen to be a lot
of people around who spent an hour on
the internet and think they know a lot
of physics but it doesn't work like that
there's a reason why there are I mean
there's a reason desert math and finish
there's a reason why there are graduate
schools in these departments and and
research so the thing to do is pretty
straightforward do what scientists and
engineers do who think they've made a
discovery now when this is brought up as
it has been there are one or two minor
articles like there's one article that
appeared in an online a journal which
claims to have found where someone
claims to have found traces of nano
thermite in building seven I don't know
what that means you don't know what that
means but if it means anything bring it
to the attention of the scientific
community that's a couple of other
fragments like that so yes there are
there's a small group of people who
believe this and there's a
straightforward way to proceed now when
this is brought up there's a standard
reaction scientists and engineers and
professional societies and physicists
are so intimidated by the government
that they're afraid to take - they don't
have the courage to take this position
anyone who has any part record of part
any familiarity with political activism
knows that this is one of the safest
things you can do it's almost riskless
people take risks far beyond this
constantly including scientists and
engineers I could have run through and
can run through many examples I mean
kind of a maybe people laugh at you but
that's about it
it's a almost riskless position so that
can't be the reason why nobody's
convinced however there's a much more
deeper issue which has been brought up
repeatedly
and I have yet to hear a response to it
there happens to be whatever one thinks
about building seven I have no opinion I
don't know as much science and
engineering as the people who believe
that they have an answer to this so I'm
willing to let the professional
societies determine it if they get the
information so whatever the facts
there's just overwhelming evidence that
the Bush administration wasn't involved
very elementary evidence you don't have
to be a physicist to understand it you
just have to think for a minute okay so
let's think for a minute yeah there's a
couple of facts which are
uncontroversial right one fact that is
uncontroversial is that the Bush
administration desperately wanted to
invade Iraq that's a long-standing goal
it's good reasons for it you know second
largest energy resources in the world
right in the middle of the world's major
energy producing region you know
perfectly obvious reasons which they
affect later stated but there were
obvious anyway so they wanted to invade
Iraq one controversial fact second
uncontroversial fact they didn't blame
the 911 on Iraqis they blamed it on
Saudis mainly that's their major ally so
they blamed it on people from their
major ally not on the country that they
wanted to invade a third uncontroversial
fact unless they're total lunatics they
would have blamed it on Iraqis if they
were involved in any way that would have
given them open season on invading Iraq
a total support international support
the UN resolution the no need to concoct
wild stories about the weapons of mass
destruction and the contacts between
Saddam and al-qaeda which of course
quickly exploded discredit
no reason to invade Afghanistan and
which could mostly a waste of time for
them but they didn't well the conclusion
is pretty straightforward either they
are total lunatics or they weren't
involved and they're not total lunatics
so whatever you think about building
seven there are other considerations to
be concerned with
