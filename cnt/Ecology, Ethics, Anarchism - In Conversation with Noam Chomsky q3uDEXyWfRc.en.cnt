so professor Chomsky thank you so kindly
for taking the time today to converse
with me about ecology and anarchism it
is a true honor to have this opportunity
to speak to you before we pass to these
subjects though I would like to ask you
initially about ethics and solidarity
would you say that a manual Kant's
notion of treating humanity as an end in
itself has influenced anarchists and
antiquated thought in any way the
concept of natural law arguably has a
natural affinity with anarchism
indirectly but I think it's actually
more general my own view is that
anarchism flows quite naturally out of
major concerns of commitments of the
Enlightenment which found an expression
in classical liberalism and classical
liberalism essentially was destroyed by
the rise of capitalism
inconsistent with an advocate of I think
is the inheritor of the ideals that were
developed in one or another form during
the Enlightenment COTS expressions one
example exemplified in a particular way
and classical liberal doctrine wrecked
on the shoals of capitalism the
libertarian Left movements which are the
natural inheritors of them so in that
sense yes but it's ok you have described
humanity as being imperiled by the
destructive trends on hand in capitalist
societies or what you have termed really
existing capitalist democracies or rat
particularly of late you have emphasized
the brutally antioch illogical trends
being implemented by the dominant powers
of settler colonial societies as
reflected in the tar sands of Canada
Australia's massive exploitation and
export of coal resources and of course
the immense energy profligacy on hand in
this country You certainly have a point
and I share your concerns as I detailed
in imperiled life revolution against
climate catastrophe a book that frames
the
crisis as the outgrowth of capitalism
and the domination of nature generally
understood please explain how you see
rect as profoundly apart with ecological
balance rect is really existing
capitalist democracy is a kind of state
capitalism with a powerful state
component in the economy but some
reliance on market forces and the market
forces that exist are shaped and
distorted in the interests of the
powerful by this by state power which is
heavily under the control of
concentrations of private powers of
those close interactions well if you
take a look at markets they are a recipe
for suicide period in market systems you
do not account you don't don't take
account of what economists call
externalities so say you sell me a car
in a market system we're supposed to
look after our own interest so I make
the best deal I can for me you make the
best deal you can for you we do not take
into account the effect on no that's not
part of a market transaction well there
is is an effect on him there's another
car in the road this greater possibility
of accident there's more pollution
there's more traffic cams for him
individually it might be a slight
increase but this is extended over the
whole population know when you get to
other kinds of transactions the
externalities get much bigger so take
say the financial crisis that one of the
reasons for it is that there are several
the one is that in market trends that
safe Goldman Sachs makes it risky
transaction they if they're paying
attention covered their own potential
losses they do not take into account
let's call systemic risk that is the
possibility that the whole system will
crash if one of their risky transactions
goes bit that just about happened with
AIG the huge insurance company they were
involved in risky transactions which
they couldn't cover the whole system was
really going to collapse but of course
state power intervened to rescue them
the state this task of the stage was to
rescue the rich and powerful and to
protect them and if that violates market
principles okay we don't care about the
market principles the market principles
are essential for the poor but a
systemic risk is an externality that's
not considered which would bring down
the financial system repeatedly if you
didn't have state power intervening well
there's another one that's even bigger
that's destruction of the environment
destruction of the environment is an
externality in market interactions you
don't pay attention to it so if you're
say take tar sands if you're a major
Energy Corporation and you can make
profit out of exploiting tar sands you
simply do not take into account the fact
that your grandchildren
have a possibility to survive that's an
externality and in the moral calculus of
capitalism greater profits in the next
quarter outweigh the fate of your
grandchildren of course it's not just
your grandchildren but everyone
now these settler colonial societies are
particularly interesting in this regard
because you have a conflict within the
settler colonial societies are different
than most Florence's imperialism of
traditional imperialism state of British
in India the British can surround the
place they sit Europe that's the
administrators the officer corps and so
on but the place was run by Indians
says they're going out societies are
different they eliminate the indigenous
population so in the reed State George
Washington leading figure in the settler
colonial society who lived his fuel is
mean as his words we have to extirpate
the iroquois they're in our way there
are an advanced civilization in fact
they provide some of the basis for the
American constitutional system but they
were in the way so we have to extirpate
though Thomas Jefferson another great
figure they said well we have no choice
but to exterminate the indigenous the
Native Americans the reason is they're
attacking us the why are they attacking
us because we're taken
away from but since we're taking that
their land and resources away that they
defend themselves we have to exterminate
them and that's pretty much what
happened in the United States almost
totally huge extermination some residues
remain horrible conditions Australia the
same thing Tasmania almost total
extermination Canada didn't quite make
it
there's residues of work called First
Nations around the periphery know the
desert settler colonial societies there
are elements of the indigenous
populations remaining and a very
striking feature of contemporary society
is that throughout the world in Canada
Latin America Australia India all over
the world of the indigenous society is
what we call tribal or Aboriginal
whatever name we use they're the ones
who are trying to prevent the race to
destruction everywhere they are the ones
that leading the opposition to
destruction of the environment the
countries with substantial indigenous
populations like say Ecuador and Bolivia
they've actually passed legislation even
constitutional provisions both for
rights of nature which is left
the rich powerful countries but is the
hope for survival Ecuador for example
was made an offer to Europe to leave
them a fair amount of oil to leave the
oil in the ground there oughta be a
great loss to that you know huge loss
for development the request was that
Europe would provide them with a fractal
payment for a fraction of the loss small
fraction Europeans refused so now
they're exploiting the oil and you go to
say southern Colombia if I did digitus
people casinos originals afro-american
struggling against gold mines the same
in Australia integrating so at the same
time in these separate colonial
societies which is the most advanced at
the richest that's where the drive is
strongest towards destruction of the
environment so you read the speech fight
say Obama at for example at Cushing
Oklahoma I gave a speech because
that's the kind of senator for bringing
together his story the fossil fuels to
flow into there are distributed and it
was an audience of oil and our applause
he said that during his administration
more oil had been lifted then any
previous one for many years
he's a white lunch of crossing America
under his administration to the extent
that they're everywhere you go you're
tripping across the pipeline that we're
going to have a hundred years of energy
independence will be the Saudi Arabia
the 21st century and sure will lead the
way to disaster at the same time the
remnants of the indigenous societies are
trying to prevent the race to disaster
so in this respect the settler colonial
societies are a striking illustration of
first of all the massive destructive
power of European imperialism which of
course includes us in Australia and so
on and also the if you can call that
irony that the strange phenomenon of the
most simple advanced educated richest
segments of global society trying to
destroy all of us and the so called
backward people the pre technological
people try to remain sort of
every that trying to restrain the the
race to disaster if some
extraterrestrial observer were watching
this they'd think the species insane and
in fact it is but the insanity goes back
to the basic institutional structure of
really existing capitols democracy
that's the way it works it's built into
the institution which one reason is
gonna be very hard to change so a
nuclear war and environmental
catastrophe you argue the global society
must be reorganized so that care for the
Commons becomes a very high priority as
it has been in traditional societies
quite often you make similar conclusions
in an essay from last summer reflecting
on the importance of the efforts to
defend gezi Park in Istanbul which you
frame as being part of a struggle in
which we must all take part with
dedication and resolve if there is to be
any hope for decent human survival in a
world that has no borders how do you see
the possibility of thoroughgoing social
transformation and the devolution of
power taking place in the near future
through the emergence and sustained
replication of workers and community
councils as in the participatory
economic model or Paracon for example
that's well worked out detailed
proposals for one form of democratic
control of popular institutions the
social economic political others and it
is particularly well worked out in a
sense of detail whether that's the right
form or something other
literally until my feeling is that the
fair amount of experimentation has to be
done to see how societies can and should
function I'm a little skeptical about
the possibility of sketching in detail
in advance but that certainly should be
taken very seriously but something along
those lines seems to be a prerequisite
for first of all for reasonable just a
reasonable life put aside the
environment just the way a society lot
will work with people in a position
where they can make decisions about the
things that matter to but also I think
it is a prerequisite for survival at
this point I mean the human species is
reaching a point which is unique in
human history I'll just take a look at
species destruction forget humans a
species destruction now is at the level
of 65 million years ago when an asteroid
hit the earth and destroyed the
dinosaurs and a huge number of species
massive species destruction that's being
replicated right now under human unit of
the asteroid and we're on the list
not for in a speech reproduced over 20
years ago in the film version of
manufacturing consent you describe
hegemonic capitalist ideology as
reducing the life world earth to an
infinite resource and an infinite
garbage can even then you had identified
the capitalist tendency toward total
destruction you speak of a looming
cancellation of destiny for Humanity if
the madness of capitalism is not halted
within this the possibly terminal phase
of human existence the very title and
argumentation of the Germany or survival
continue in this line and in hopes and
prospects you claim the threat to the
chance for decent survival to be one of
the major externalities produced again
by wrecked how do you think a resurgent
international anarchist movement might
respond positively to such alarming
trends I think
an emergent I mean it might be about
anarchism is just the most advanced form
of political thought they say arose from
the Enlightenment its best ideals the
primary contributions of classical
liberalism carries it forward Paracon
which you mentioned is one illustration
or middle columns those anarchists but
and there others like it so I think that
a resurgent anarchist movement which
would be the peak of human intellectual
civilization should join with the
indigenous societies of the world to
take so that they don't have the burden
of trying to save humanity from its own
craziness this should take place within
the richest most powerful societies I
mean it's kind of a moral truism that
the more privilege you have the more
responsibility
it's elementary in every domain you have
privilege you have opportunities you
have choices you have responsibilities
in the rich powerful societies
privileged people like us were all
privileged people we have the
responsibility to take the lead in
trying to prevent the disasters that our
own social institutions are creating
it's outrageous to demand that our even
observe the poorest most repressed
people in the world taking the beliefs
trying to save the human species in
effect innumerable other species from
the distribution so we should join them
that's the role of okay in human
intelligence in the environment you
raise the possibility of factory workers
taking control of the means of
production and autonomously deciding to
break with business as usual opting
instead to produce solar panels or
high-speed rail this recommendation is
entirely anarcho-syndicalism nature in
keeping with your own proclivities
indeed it bears much affinity with the
prospect of an ecological
anarcho-syndicalism a concept that has
been advanced by the environmental Union
caucus of the Industrial Workers of the
world recently a particularly promising
proposal to the environmental union
caucus has made is that of an ecological
general strike in a similar vein
economic historian Richard Smith
recently called for the mass shuttering
of large corporations and vast swathes
of industry as a means of giving
humanity and nature a chance against
climate destruction moreover since the
US military is the single largest
contributor to the problem act of the
genic climate disruption the Pentagon
should effectively be dismantled for
this reason among others of course
how might activists present these
pressing goals in ways that do not lend
themselves being dismissed as mere huge
 ism well let's paint good the
idea of converting industry to producing
a solar panels mass transportation and
so on that was not utopian
the US government virtually nationalized
the auto industry
there's not tired but took over large
parts of it there were choices at that
point if there had been a powerful
movement of the kind that we're
discussing this popular base it could
have pressed for something very
realistic which I think would have had
support of the working class not even
guarded as a strength will be regarded
as a a weapon against them taking away
that our livelihood their survival but
there's nothing could support them have
them take over then what the choices
were to really either the government
rescues the auto industry has the
taxpayers expense
hands it back to the pretty much the
original owners maybe different phases
but structurally the same owners and
having to produce what they were doing
before we just destroyed that was one
possibility it's one mistaken the other
possibility which could have been taken
and with a sufficiently powerful popular
movement might well have been taken is
to put those factories into the hands of
the working class and have them direct
their make their choices rationally in
the interests of themselves their
communities the general society and do
exactly what you were describing that
produce solar panels as they take mass
transportation but going back to markets
you take an economics course they tell
you markets offer choices it's a part of
the true but very narrowly markets
restrict choices sharply restrict
choices the mass transportations an
example the mass transportation is not a
choice offered on the market like I want
to go home tonight the market does
for me a choice between a Ford and
Toyota but not between a car and subway
that's just not one of the choices
available in market systems and this is
not a small point the things at choices
that involve common effort and
solidarity and mutual support and
concern for others those are out of the
market system the market system is based
on a maximization of individual
consumption and that is highly
destructive in itself its destructive
even for the human beings involved that
destroys that terms them into
sociopathic individuals but it also
means that the kinds of things that are
needed for survival are out of the
market system like mass transportation
that's that's that's the form of
economic growth that could help preserve
the hopes for survival and it I don't
think it was all unrealistic for them to
live in time there was nothing utopian
about that now as compared with things
like say generous drivers I think that's
a much better
step step to take from its it's not
saying let's throw a wrench in the
Machine and arm everybody in the
interest of some longer-term goal it's
saying let's take a wrench and fix the
machine so it can function right now
with all of you guys working doing
better jobs running it yourselves that
you're better off psychologically
socially in every respect and you're
also producing the world that makes
sense to live it that's I think the
better way to proceed in general
according to German critical theorist
Herbert Marcus a revolution can be
defined in part as action which seeks to
secure the light of freedom and
happiness of future generations in light
of looming catastrophic climate change
this definition would seem to hold a
great deal great amount of importance
today within the modern Western
tradition some of the most promising
movements have arguably been gratis Bob
oof and the conspiracy of equals Rosa
Luxemburg and thus part of his league
and the Spanish anarchists what would
you say is the role of direct action in
revolutionary struggle you know this is
first of all I think we should assume
that revolutionary struggle is the only
option what we've just been discussing
for example you could call reformist if
you like it's taking the institution's
reshaping of reconstructing them turning
them into democratic institutions and
carrying out actions that are quite
feasible than we beneficial for all of
us is that a revolution was a reform
what's the role of direct action saying
that well the role of direct action
would have been realistically for
popular movements to have pressure of
the government to take that direction
which would not have been impossible I'm
in effect right now and the old rust
bill there is something like this
payment than the old arrest of a much
smaller scale back in 1977 young US
Steel major corporation decided to close
their operations in Youngstown Ohio
which was a steel town built by the
skilled workers by the Union that was
major steel town and I was going to
destroy everyone's occupation the
commune
that's a decision made by bankers at
work you know they make enough profit
the union Steel Workers Union offered to
buy the plants and run by the workforce
this was an effort that the company did
the corporation didn't want actually
it's kind of interesting it would have
been more profitable for them but I
think a class interest militated against
it this happens frequently multinational
frequently will refuse and offered by
the workers to buyout something they
want to close and prefer to take the
loss of just destroying it to having the
precedent of worker owned enterprises
that's what it looks like to me I can't
prove it corporations are totalitarian
institutions we don't get access to
their internal decisions but that's what
it looks like
anyway the company refused went to the
courts I think it went all the way to
the Supreme Court the starting blend the
margins of cases in the community and
the steel workers they had lost but they
could have one with enough popular
support anyhow after they had lost the
the steel companies were abandoned they
didn't give up they started working
people started developing small
enterprises worker owned which they
tried to integrate into the community
and it's not proliferated significantly
around Cleveland
there's quite a network of worker owned
enterprises not work or managed so it's
a gap but worker owned enterprises which
can become worker manage its extends
down expanding right now there's an
effort by the US Steel Workers to make
some sort of a deal with monitors beyond
the huge best conglomerate which is
again worker on the management selected
by workers but not managed and that's
got some prospects to so I think so what
is direct action well all of these
things are direct action they're direct
action geared to the existing
circumstances direct action has to be
based on an analysis of what the
existing circumstances are and how an
action can modify them positively
there's no general formula you can't say
direct action is good or bad sometimes
to be harmful sometimes would be
beneficial sometimes it could be
revolutionary sometimes may be reforms
that you simply ask yourself with to be
achieved now so these developments
didn't say northern Ohio really our
reforms there isn't supported by
Republican governors
goodbye some say if there's a business
you know get sort of fits their
right-wing libertarian conceptions fine
this person is that
nothing wrong but you just have to you
just can't give general formulas for
tactical choices they depend on a exact
close analysis of the situation sparta
cysts are a good case in point if Rosa
Luxemburg went along with the Sparta
cyst Verizon though she was opposed to
it as she was opposed to it not in
principle but because she realized it
was gonna fail gonna be crushed but out
of solidarity she went along with it she
was killed we're turning to the question
of natural law I would like to ask you
whether you think natural natural right
applies to non-human animals in an
interview from 2010 you acknowledge that
there exists a moral case for
vegetarianism but at a recent talk at
University College London you claimed
that animals cannot have the same rights
as humans because lacking reason they
cannot be considered to have
responsibilities can you clarify what
you mean by this
as you likely know many anarchists and
anti-terrorist a considered
vegetarianism and veganism essential to
the project of reducing humanity's
domination of a nature that makes sense
but that's separate from the question of
whether animals have the same rights as
humans it's a fact that animals don't
have responsibilities we can't overlook
if I have a dog the dog has no
responsibilities maybe I'd like it to
bark when a criminal comes but I can't
say the dogs guilty if it
- so it's a fact that animals don't have
responsibilities responsibilities are
related to rights this does not say you
should murder animals but it's a
recognition of reality and in fact you
know the vegetarianism or veganism I
think has a moral basis but sort of lots
of other things like that when you got
here you either drove for public
transportation the meaning used energy
that harms the environment you made a
choice your choice was to harm the
environment in order to come here so we
could have this discussion that we're
making choices like that every moment of
the day well one of the choices has to
do with whether people who say in the
countries were they there is meat that
market Australasia that's another truth
we have our own truisms we're always we
can't overlook the fact that we are
constantly making choices which have
negative effects and this is one of them
there's an opportunity cost of
vegetarianism like personally I'm not a
vegetarian but the main root well I
almost never eat meat but the reason is
just that amount of time for no time to
think about
think about I just pick up whatever
saves me time which usually is not me
that's not I don't purposely check to
see if there's a piece of chicken and
okay
that's a choice I don't like I don't
think we should have factory farming the
free-range business is mostly a joke
very well but it's kind of like the
choice we're always making choices like
that in counterpoint with regard to
rights and responsibilities they do
relate and I don't think we can overlook
that you could say this thing about an
infant an infant doesn't have
responsibilities
but the reason we grant the infant
rights is because of species in
theoretical terms I sense a great
affinity between the analysis you and
Edward as Herman present in
manufacturing consent and the dissident
cultural research engaged in by Western
Marxist during the 20th century you are
famously given to quoting Antonio
Gramsci saying pessimism of the
intellect optimism of the world I would
like to ask whether you believe the US
populace to be too conservative
distracted and enthralled by the system
to move radically against it do you
think the public will become the second
superpower you hope for in hegemony more
survival I'm not sure the public is that
conservative frankly there are some
interesting indications of the contrary
so for example in 1976 Bicentennial of
the Declaration of Independence
there was a poll there were polls pages
in which people were asked what they
thought was in the Constitution and
nobody has
in the Constitution but the answer is
basically worth do you think this is an
obvious truth if it is probably in the
Constitution one of them was one of the
questions was as to each from each
according to his abilities to of each
according to his needs the majority of
the population thought that was an
announced tution this is obviously true
in the late 1980s there were polls taken
asking people do you think that a right
to public to health care is in the
Constitution
very large proportion I think maybe the
majority of the population votes in the
Constitution if you take a look at the
polls generally you find it
even among sectors of the population
that are considered very right-wing you
do studies of people who say get the
government off my back I don't want the
government they turned out to be Social
Democrats they want more spending on
health we're spending on education that
we're spending on that same others with
dependent children but not welfare
because welfare was demonized by a
racist Reagan and others but and this
runs across the poor even on
international affairs so a majority of
the population thinks that the US ought
to give up the veto of the superior
and follow what the general what the
world population believes is right you
take a look at taxes striking they've
been polls on taxes for about 40 years
overwhelmingly the population thinks the
rich should be taxed more they're under
tax policy does the opposite direction
you know polls are not the definitive
you have to inquire into why people are
answering the way they do there's lots
of reasons but they're not insignificant
either my feeling is that people like
Adam Smith were basically right that
there is a natural sympathy for others
and I think the rich and powerful
understand that I think that's one of
the reasons why there's such massive
effort to destroy the institutions in
the society that are based on solidarity
so for example why is the right wing in
fact not just the right wing goes over
to Obama is so intent on undermining
Social Security it costs nothing
essential it's a very efficient program
that people survive on it it worked very
well there's no economic problems that
could be tinkered with it's really
marginal but there's a major effort to
destroy it why it's based on solidarity
it's based on concern for others there's
a major attack on the public schools the
underfunding vouchers all kind of things
foundations are trying to
why public schools are a major
contribution to modern society they're
one of the real contributions of
American society mass public education
why destroy them based on solidarity if
you take the ideology that we're
supposed to believe in why should I pay
taxes for the schools in my neighborhood
I don't have kids in school branch or in
school I never will
why should I pay taxes well you know if
you pay taxes of the kid across the
street all over the school because you
care about other people but that's has
to be driven out of people's heads it's
a little bit like markets and
consumption markets are favored by the
economics profession by the rich and so
on to a point they really don't believe
in they want the state powerful state to
come in and say even if they're in
trouble
ideologically their preferred because
they restrict you human action to
individual its self gratification not
mutual support not protection of the
comment actually the comments are an
interesting case we're coming up to the
800th anniversary of the Magna Carta
Magna Carta has two parts that one part
was the charter of liberties the central
part was presumption of innocence that's
out the window
that's but now the guilty means Obama
wants to kill you tomorrow that's the
definition of guilty innocent means he
didn't get around to but the other part
of the Magna Carta it was the charter of
the forest that's the part that's kind
of he find in popular myth like the
Robin Hood myth the Robin Hood was
protecting the Commons from the
Predators that's a big part of our
history in English history the comments
were cultivated by the general
population the Commons were these the
forests fields the source of fuel food
welfare you know videos big things from
the common front of the forest to
survive and it was nurtured it was
nurtured by the public it was cared for
they weren't that grow into jungles they
were carefully cared for the comment the
chart forests was an effort not by the
population by the Barons to protect the
Commons for the king but the population
wanted to protect the comments for
themselves then you move into the
capitalist period beginning with the
enclosure movements which proof evil off
the land and so on you have a
destruction of the Commons but today and
they capitalist ethic there's a concept
called the tragedy of the Commons which
you study in economics which teaches you
that if you don't have private ownership
of the Commons it's going to be
destroyed well based on capitalism
morality
if I don't round it was trying to drive
observe but in ordinary human life
that's just totally fallen privatization
is the tragedy that comments we can see
that when you privatize the Commons just
store it for private property
if the Commons are kept under common
control they're cultivated merchants
most people care about each other they
care about the future okay I think these
are very different when you ask is the
population conservative I doubt it
I think that these are deeply rooted
sentiments and understandings which show
up all the time they showed up showed up
in labor struggles against the
industrial system which was dehumanizing
people peasant societies they show up
the indigenous societies today
struggling against say gold mines maybe
they will give him more material wealth
destroyed their lives you find this
everywhere and then the great thinkers
of the past people we are supposed to
admire like Adam Smith it says control
talker alright last question actually
it's kind of interesting if you look at
Smith everybody could yeah once again
everybody knows the phrase invisible
hand apparently nobody looks at how he
used the phrase they rarely used a lot
of times one of the uses is when he
discusses what would have happened
it's an agrarian societies talking about
if what would happen if some landlord
controlled almost all the land what
would happen he says well out of his
natural sympathy and concern
for other people we would distribute the
wealth so as if by an invisible hand
society wouldn't end up being
egalitarian that's the invisible hand
the other major usage of the Dutchess in
our argument against against what we
call a dual liberal globalization he
considers England that asks that what
would happen if in England the merchants
and manufacturers decided to invest
abroad and import from abroad he says
well they would gain that England would
suffer however they have a kind of a
natural tendency to want to function in
their own society it kind of home bias
its own thoughts called an infinity to
their own society so as if by an
invisible hand England will be saved
from the ravages of what we call
neoliberal globalization that's not what
you're taught there coming from a
different eager oh that's the
pre-capitalist Europe and conceptions
were quite different before capitalist
morality distorted alright well many
