the israeli navy has seized a ship of
Palestinian solidarity activists seeking
to break the us-backed siege of the gaza
strip the Estelle was the latest boat
attempting to reach Gaza as part of the
Freedom Flotilla coalition on Saturday
Israeli Navy vessel surrounded the ship
and deployed forces on board to seize
the passengers taking them to a prison
inside Israel the passengers and crew
were nationals from Canada Israel Norway
Sweden and the United States hours
before the Israeli raid ship organizer
Matthias Gardell spoke to Democracy Now
from aboard the Estelle we are not
breaking any laws we are not the
provocateurs it is Israel that clearly
violates international public law in
decent human standards they are
provoking the world and by doing so by
inviting the world to witness this crime
against humanity they are also
presenting each and every one of us with
a choice edai issues to be part of the
problem who choose to be part of the
solution a lawyer for the detained
passengers has accused Israel of using
taser weapons during the raid on the
ship saying Israeli forces committed
quote electro torture Israel has denied
the claim in related news author and
professor Noam Chomsky made his first
trip to the Gaza Strip over the weekend
appearing at an academic conference
during his visit professor Chomsky said
he was inspired a twin is saying how
Palestinians survive under the Israeli
occupation and later expressed
solidarity with the detained estelle
passengers seeking to break the blockade
an impression is
how inspiring it is to see people
living under extreme duress
nevertheless remaining
brazilian
the struggle I should say that every
time Israel stops a boat that's another
blow to its diminishing legitimacy and
another element of support both of those
who are resisting internally and to
those who are opposing the policies
outside and sooner or later it the wave
will sweep over the barriers in other
news from the occupied territories
Palestinians held their first vote in
six years over the weekend with a round
of municipal elections the vote took
place only in the West Bank as the
governing Hamas movement held a boycott
in Gaza following the breakdown of unity
talks with the rival group Fatah
