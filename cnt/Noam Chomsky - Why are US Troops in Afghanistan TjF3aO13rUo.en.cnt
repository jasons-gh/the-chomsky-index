well invasion you heard a version of the
story from Obama a couple of nights ago
but there's also reality not just
invention and it's pretty easy to check
it's not obscure I me not going to find
it in the front pages but a little work
done you'll dig it out it was supposedly
a reaction to 911 we had to defend
ourselves from terror well let's imagine
that protection of the population from
terror was a high priority of the
government is almost unimaginable but
suppose it were true whether were that's
a very straightforward ways to proceed
I'm sure they're specialists in the
State Department could have informed
them that the jihadi movement was highly
critical of Obama bin Laden they
bitterly condemned 911 I mean there were
faultless coming out from the most
radical clerics of no loss our
University you know the most important
University denouncing Obama bin Laden
and so on so there was a perfect
opportunity to split the jihadi movement
isolate us on bin Laden and root
significantly reduce the threat of
terror instead they chose through the
opposite to act in a way which United
the jihadi movement and then vision
evading Iraq of course it's so even more
as one of innumerable examples that
protecting the population is not a high
priority of this government or
governments in general so that would
have been one reaction now of course
there was a serious crime not as serious
as 911 1973 but still very serious so
what do you do when there's a crime well
you try to identify the perpetrators
capture them it's an international issue
you know use international forces no
problem in this case and bring him to
trial and have a fair trial well they
couldn't do that didn't try to do that
and there's a good reason which was
explained later on eight months after an
11 the head of the FBI Robert Miller had
an interview with The Washington Post in
which he told them that we really don't
know who was responsible he says we
believe that the plot was hatched in
Afghanistan but implemented in the
United Arab Emirates and Germany well if
they only could believe it in April they
didn't know it the preceding October
which is why they did not respond prison
with us the reason why they didn't
respond to the Taliban when they who had
made tentative offers to extradite Osama
bin Laden but wanted to see some
evidence yes what you do when you asked
for extradition and of course this was
contemptuously rejected so we went ahead
and bond that's a major war crime first
of all is no there was no international
authorization of any kind totally
violated international law but it was a
moral war crime in a deeper sense you
have to go back to that time at that
time there were fought an estimated five
million afghans right at the edge of
starvation and it was predicted the aid
agencies which all had to flee warned
repeatedly and loudly that if the u.s.
bomb that would put at risk another two
and a half million people well you know
fortunately the world worse didn't
happen but that's not the way you
estimate the moral character of an
action that you've estimated on the
basis of likely consequences so they
were willing to take a risk of killing
another two and a half million afghans
in order to achieve their ends well what
were the ends not to end terror plainly
actually i think the ends were pretty
well described by some of the leading
anti-taliban afghans including the u.s.
favorite of the hawk its leader killed
they strongly abstruse lee objected
the bombing they said the bombing is
just killing innocent civilians it's
undermining our efforts to overthrow the
Taliban from within which they thought
reasonably could succeed and you're only
doing it because you want to show your
muscle and intimidate the world and of
course Afghanistan has unfortunately for
Afghans a strategic location right on
the periphery of the major oil-producing
regions and Middle East and Central Asia
and of course South Asia that goes way
back in history and they've suffered for
it so I don't have documents yet
internal documents maybe we'll get them
someday but it looks as if those were
the reasons well why is it continuing
well we don't documents from today
either incidentally you heard the other
night that the world supported us in the
bombing you know it depends very much on
how you define the world so for example
if the world includes the people of the
world we know the answer
after a little work to find the answer
but it's not really difficult on these
internet days and their books mine
others that talk about it but right
after the bombing was announced but
before it started there was an
international gallup poll all over the
world which asked people whether they
were in favor of bombing now the
question was asked on the assumption
that it would be selective it would go
after the perpetrators and those
civilians would be attacked which of
course was never happened and on that
assumption there was very little support
only two countries had even majority
support the one was India the other was
Israel both Indian Israel I don't think
we're even thinking about Afghanistan
India was thinking about Kashmir and
Israel was thinking about the
Palestinians so you want to go up on
people great it's a bomb Pakistan but in
every even in Europe the numbers were
like in the twenty four twenty to thirty
percent but most interesting were the
Latin American answers Latin America had
a little bit of experience with us
intervention in Latin America the
figures range sport range from two
percent in Mexico that is the half of
Mexico that we didn't conquer two
percent support their went up to i think
eleven percent in colombia and even in
panama expect the US colony it was like
sixteen percent or something well that
was the popular support for the bombing
on the assumption that it wouldn't hit
civilians of course it did it well the
the media clap cooperated by not
reporting an international gallup poll
on an issue like that is kind of
important so therefore that are
surprised but why are we staying as i
said we don't have internal documents
but i suspect it's partly the same
reason sister
locations on and so forth there's
probably another factor that's what then
Ellsberg called the woody call at the
stalemate machine I think when he was
writing about US policies in Vietnam
through the sixties he said kind of
accurately i think the document
supported that the idea was to just keep
it going so you don't lose the next
election if he wanted to win the word
I'm the in my opinion it was actually
didn't win the war in Vietnam but that's
another story but if he wanted to reach
the maximum goals you would have had to
move up to the clear warfare or
something like that and to reach the
maximal goals here it's not even clear
how you would do that but you don't want
to you know be attacked as soft wimpish
not courageous like Theodore Roosevelt
and those good guys that we honor so
probably that the stalemate machine is
probably a factor I mean the plans that
were announced the other day make
actually no sense on any ground but
we're not gonna suffer from it except
paying the Afghans will suffer as usual
and the Pakistanis and may be in real
trouble if this continues
