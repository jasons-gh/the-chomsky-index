merchandise a little bit different uh
for one thing there
these there's two questions there's a
number of questions to ask about the you
know the book i'm sure
you know the one thing has to do with
the quality of their claims
the other is about its reception and
notice that there is
the i think it is well received
and i think the reason is it exculpates
the us government
it says look we're fine uh what but what
can we do
there's this powerful jewish lobby
that's controlling us
so we'd be delighted to be benevolent
and uh you know helping people
our natural instincts but we're trapped
by the jewish lobby
well that's a pretty good reason i think
why it is accepted
the second question is about the thesis
i mean can it really be
that a small ethnic lobby controls u.s
policy i mean if this
if anybody believes that thesis there's
a there's a tactical suggestion
that that follows immediately put on
your tie and jacket
go to the executive offices of lockheed
martin
general electric goldman sachs
jp morgan chase and explain to them
that your interests are being harmed by
a little
lobby which you can put out of business
in five minutes
okay that's the tactical suggestion that
follows
does anybody pursue it no
because it's absurd i mean the claim
is it's this is actually an interesting
uh merchandise are very good scholars
they're
we're called realist ir scholars
according to realist scholar scholarship
uh states pursue what is called the
national interest
which primarily security that's it's an
anarchic world and states
try to preserve their own security
well-being of the wrong populations and
the national interest there's a lot of
questions that are open there
first of all what is the national
interest i mean is the national interest
of the
ceo of general electric the same as the
interest of the janitor who cleans his
floors
no their interests are quite different
so what what's the national interest
well you know in practice it turns out
that the interests of
state power and concentrated economic
power
take a look at the formation of policy
that's what it defends
is the national interest in that sense
harmed by
u.s policy towards israel well
pretty hard to argue that uh certainly
centers of american power don't think so
like say take say lockheed martin which
or the military
lava industry altogether big lobby
they think it's great i mean when the
united states
gives israel a couple of billion dollars
to buy advanced armaments that's a gift
to lockheed martin
in fact it's a double gift because it's
what in
the retail trade is called a teaser it
means that
saudi arabia comes along and says wait a
minute
we want 60 billion dollars worth of
second rate equipment which we don't
know how to operate
and so the defense industry can sell it
to them
you know so that's wonderful and
furthermore israel
tests the high-tech equipment on live
targets you learn things from that there
are
very close relations of intelligence
very close
if you took a look at uh that goes way
back
actually this one of the interesting
snowden revelations is that
israel is the only country that gets raw
data not what's called minimized
most data in the nsa supposed to be kind
of checked so you know
things that are really improper and
illegal are thrown out
and that's the way it's given to the
so-called five eyes you know
england australia and the close allies
not israel
they get straight data
and the intelligence relations are
extremely close
military relations are so close that you
you may have seen
one of the interesting wikileaks
exposures was a list of
super strategic sites sites that are so
important that the united states has to
defend them at all costs
not many of them one of them was right
outside haifa
the raphael military industries that's
one of the
super significant u.s sites that has to
be defended
it's a military industry high-tech
military it's one of the places where
they
did a lot of the drone technology their
relations with the pentagon are so
close that they actually move their
management offices to washington where
the
you know where the money is uh you take
a look at say
u.s investors warren buffett uh
intel they're investing in israel all
over the place buffett
recently spent on a billion dollars or
something to acquire some
israeli company and announced that
israel is the best place for
u.s investors outside the united states
intel set up their biggest
new factory for new generation ships
in israel i mean do these people think
that their
their interest is being harmed by this
relationship
