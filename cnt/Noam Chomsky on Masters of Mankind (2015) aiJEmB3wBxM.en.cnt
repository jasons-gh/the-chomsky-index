it's now 70 years since the end of the
most horrific war in history it ended
with the use of an ultimate weapon which
can bring human history to an end a day
which I happened to remember very well
we've been living under that shadow ever
since 20 years later two of the leading
figures of 20th century intellectual
life
Bertrand Russell Albert Einstein issued
an appeal to the people of the world
calling on them to face a choice that is
stark and dreadful and inescapable shall
we put an end to the human race or shall
mankind renounce war they recognized of
course that work and very quickly turned
into terminal nuclear war in 1947 The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
established its famous Doomsday Clock
setting at 7 minutes to midnight
midnight is the end last January it was
advanced to three minutes before
midnight that's a threat level that had
not been reached for thirty years at a
grim moment to which I'll return the
accompanying explanation invoked the two
major threats to human survival nuclear
war nuclear weapons and unchecked
climate change the call condemned world
leaders who are endangering every person
on earth by failing to perform their
most important duty insuring and
preserving the health and vitality of
human civilization the Russell Einstein
appeal differs from the current
declaration in two crucial respects one
is that it did not include the threat of
environmental
Astra fee which 50 years ago was not
sufficiently understood and secondly it
directly addresses the people of the
world not the political leadership that
is the difference is of some
significance
there's substantial evidence that on
climate change nuclear weapons planning
international policies generally the
population seems much more concerned
than the political leadership who do not
regard their most important duty to be
ensuring and preserving the health and
vitality of human civilization as ample
evidence reveals it's hardly a secret
that even in the most free and
democratic societies the governments
respond only in limited ways to popular
will for the United States it's
well-established in academic scholarship
that a considerable majority of the
population at the lower end of the
income wealth scale are effectively
disenfranchised their views are simply
ignored by policymakers influence
increases slowly as one moves up the
scale and at the very top which means a
fraction of 1% the policy is pretty much
determined that being the case the
attitudes at the top of the ladder are
of very great significance
these are revealed dramatically in a
poll of CEOs that was released last
January at the Davos conference in
Switzerland the conference of Masters of
the Universe as the business press
describes them by rather ominous
coincidence this was just at the moment
when the Doomsday Clock was advanced to
three minutes to midnight
the poll revealed that climate change
did not merit inclusion among the top 19
risks that concern CEOs worse still at
the top of their ranking of perceived
risks was regulation that that is the
prime method for addressing
environmental catastrophe their
overriding concern was with growth
prospects for their companies that's not
surprising whatever their individual
beliefs in their institutional role the
CEOs are constrained to adopt policies
that are designed to pose extraordinary
and undeniable threats to the continued
existence of humanity in the words of
the Doomsday Clock declaration and given
their enormous role in determining state
policy it's less surprising that policy
lags behind public opinion on the
concerns that move the clock so close to
midnight the effects are before our eyes
every day so take last Sunday's Wall
Street Journal typical example there's a
weakened review section it's it features
an article entitled fossil fuels will
save the world really the lead story in
the news section is headlined US
producers ready new oil wave the article
glory is in the thought of what they
call an ocean of oil from US shale as
American energy companies are poised to
unleash a further flood while they lead
us exuberantly
to the precipice scientists are well
aware that most of the oil must be left
in the ground if there's to be some hope
for a decent life for our grandchildren
but who cares as long as there are
spectacular profits for tomorrow
on international affairs as well a
popular opinion diverges significantly
from that of the decision-making classes
among many other examples a considerable
majority in the United States have held
that the United Nations not the US
should take the lead in international
crises such views are so remote from
Aelita opinion that they're barely even
articulated publicly a good part of the
reason is the nature of a lead opinion
and as often is the case it's the
critical end of the spectrum that's the
most informative so here's an example
from a featured article by the former
director of the Carnegie Endowment for
international peace in the current issue
of the New York Review of Books leading
u.s. intellectual journal rather left
liberal and orientation here's what she
writes American contributions to
international security global economic
growth freedom and human wellbeing have
been so self-evidently unique and have
been so clearly directed to others
benefit that Americans have long
believed that the u.s. amounts to a
different kind of country where others
push their national interests the u.s.
tries to advance universal principles
well comment should be superfluous
but in what's important is that this is
what many in so-called enlightened
circles actually believe it's quite an
astonishing fact in a free society where
information is readily available and the
impact on policy is not obscure nuclear
weapons policy reveals very dramatically
how governments and also the
concentrated domestic concentrations of
power that largely dominate
governments how both regard the
principle that ensuring and preserving
the health and vitality of human
civilization is their most important
duty when we inquire we discover that
regrettably governments have
consistently and not even considered
security of their own populations as a
particularly high priority it's rather
enlightening to review the record I'll
begin with some high points or maybe low
points so let's begin with the early
days of the ultimate weapon at a time
when the United States had overwhelming
wealth and power
the remarkable security there was
however a potential threat International
ICBMs with nuclear warheads there's a
standard scholarly review of nuclear
policies spy McGeorge Bundy he was the
national security adviser for presidents
Kennedy and Johnson he had access to the
highest level documents he's in quoting
him now he says the timely development
of ballistic missiles during the
Eisenhower administration is one of the
best achievements of those eight years
yet yet it is well to begin with a
recognition that both the United States
and the Soviet Union might be in much
less nuclear danger today if these
missiles had never been developed and he
then adds a remarkable comment
he says I'm aware of no serious
contemporary proposal in or out of
either government that ballistic
missiles should somehow be banned by
agreement in short there was apparently
no thought of trying to prevent the sole
serious threat to the United States the
threat of utter destruction rather the
institutional imperatives of state power
prevailed much as in the case
of the CEOs for whom the fate of the
species is of such little concern that
it does not even enter into the ranking
of risks furthermore these shocking
facts seem to arouse little interest or
comment in fact I've never seen a
reference to them it could the
development of these missiles have been
prevented there might have been
opportunities one suggestive indication
is a proposal by Stalin in 1952 offering
to allow Germany to be unified with free
elections on condition that it not join
a hostile military alliance which was
hardly an extreme condition in the light
of the history of the preceding
half-century Stalin's proposal was taken
seriously by the respected political
commentator James Warburg but apart from
him it was ignored or ridiculed actually
recent scholarship has just begun to
take a different view the bitterly
anti-communist Soviet scholar autumn
Fulham Harvard takes the status of
Stalin's proposal to be an unresolved
mystery Washington he said wasted little
effort in flatly rejecting Moscow's
initiative on grounds that were
embarrassingly unconvincing leaving open
the basic question was Stalin genuinely
ready to sacrifice the newly created
German Democratic Republic
East Germany on the altar of real
democracy with consequences for world
peace and for American security that
could have been enormous
Melvin Lafleur is one of the most
respected Cold War scholars that
recently published a review of research
in released Soviet archives he observes
that many scholars were surprised to
discover quoting him now that Lavrentiy
Beria
the sinister brutal head of the secret
police proposed that the Kremlin offer
the West to deal on the unification and
neutralization of Germany agreeing to
sacrifice the East German communist
regime to reduce east-west tensions and
improve internal political and economic
conditions in Russia opportunities that
were squandered in favor of securing
German participation in NATO it's
actually a shocking decision that is
being relived right now under the
circumstances of the early 50s it's not
impossible that agreements might have
been reached that would have protected
the security of the US population from
the gravest threat on the horizon but
the option apparently was not even
considered and possible opportunities
were dismissed with ridicule another
indication of how slight a role
authentic security plays in state policy
and to heighten the extraordinary
significance of this failure it was just
at that time that the Doomsday Clock was
moved to two minutes to midnight the
closest it has ever been these events
from the early days of the Cold War have
considerable resonance right now and
right at the borders of Russia in
Ukraine four serious crises that traces
right back to the end of the Cold War a
crucial issue at that time around 1990
had to do with the fate of NATO
now that the alleged threat of Russian
invasion had disappeared one might have
believed that NATO would have dissolved
quite the contrary
expanded radically mikhail gorbachev
agreed to allow a unified germany to
join nato rather significant concession
but there was a quid pro quo
namely that nato would not expand one
inch to the east
that was the phrase that was used in
high-level internal discussions
referring to East Germany and NATO at
once expanded to East Germany
Gorbachev naturally objected but he was
informed by Washington that these were
only verbal commitments and nothing in
writing the kind of unspoken implication
is that if you're naive enough to accept
the verbal gentlemen's agreement with
the United States it's your problem
Clinton came along and expanded NATO to
the borders of Russia and as another
leading international relations scholar
John Mearsheimer recently pointed out in
the major establishment journal Foreign
Affairs he pointed out that the
indications that Ukraine might be
assimilated into the Western system
possibly even into NATO could not fail
to be threatening to any Russian leader
we need only imagine how the United
States would have reacted at the height
of Soviet power
if the Warsaw Pact had taken over most
of this hemisphere and now Mexico were
preparing to join the Russian run
military alliance last December the
western-backed Ukrainian Parliament
voted 303 to 8 to rescind the policy of
non-alignment that had been adapted
adopted by the ousted President and they
committed Ukraine in their words to
deepen cooperation with NATO in order to
achieve the criteria required for
membership in this organization the
growing crisis concerning Ukraine is no
slight threat and it is an avoidable one
by diplomatic steps to guarantee
Ukrainian neutrality steps which
regrettably are not being taken well
returning to the 1950s
other developments reveal the low
priority assigned to authentic security
when Nikita Khrushchev took over after
Stalin's death he recognized that Russia
could not compete militarily with the
United States and that if Russia hoped
to escape its economic backwardness and
the devastating effect of the war of the
arms race would have to be reversed
accordingly he proposed sharp mutual
reductions in offensive weapons the
incoming Kennedy administration
considered his offer and rejected it
instead turning to rapid military
expansion the policies are summarized by
distinguished international relations
scholarly Kenneth waltz pointed out that
the Kennedy administration undertook the
largest strategic and conventional
peacetime military buildup the world has
yet seen even as first Jeff was trying
at once to carry through a major
reduction in conventional forces and to
follow a strategy of minimum deterrence
and we did so even though the balance of
strategic weapons greatly favored the
United States well once again the
decision u.s. decision severely harmed
national security while enhancing state
power how severely it harmed national
security was revealed in 1962 when
Khrushchev sent missiles to Cuba
partially that was a foolhardy attempt
to write the balance partially it was
because of the very clear threat of US
invasion in the course of a major
terrorist campaign that Kennedy was
waging against Cuba kind of erased from
our history but very much alive in real
history
khrushchev effort set off what arthur
schlesinger called the most dangerous
moment in history and what happens
happened then
emeritus clear careful consideration no
time to go through the details but it's
worth remembering that at the peak
moment of the crisis October 26th and
27th 1962 Kennedy received a letter from
Khrushchev offering to end the crisis
peacefully by simultaneous public
withdrawal of Cuban of Russian missiles
from Cuba and u.s. missiles from Turkey
these were Jupiter missiles liquid
propelled meaning slow to set in motion
which means that they were first strike
weapons not intended for a deterrent
they were also obsolete weapons the US
had already issued an offer and had a
Tory issued in order to withdraw them
because they were being replaced by even
more lethal weapons invulnerable Polaris
submarines
so that was Kennedy's choice shall we
publicly withdraw obsolete missiles from
first strike missiles from Turkey on the
border of Russia which are being
replaced by even more lethal mass
missiles or shall we refuse he refused
his own estimate subjective estimate of
nuclear war at the time was between 1/3
and 1/2 that's in my view one of the
most appalling decisions in history and
even more appalling is that Kennedy is
praised for his cool courage and
handling the crisis well 10 years later
Henry Kissinger called a nuclear alert
this was in the last days of the 1973
Israel Arab War the purpose of the alert
was to warn the Russians not to
interfere
with his delicate diplomatic maneuvers
these were designed to ensure an Israeli
victory but a limited victory so that
the US would still be in control of the
region unilaterally and the maneuvers
were delicate we've learned a lot about
them from recent Declassified sources
the United start out the United States
and Russia had jointly imposed a
ceasefire but Kissinger secretly
informed Israel that they could ignore
it hence the need for a nuclear alert to
frighten the Russians away unfortunately
they were frightened away security of
the population was a matter of little
concern as usual ten years after that
the Reagan administration launched
operations to probe Russian defenses
that meant simulating air and naval
attacks against Russia that these
actions were undertaken at a very tense
moment right at that time pursing two
missiles were being installed in Western
Europe these at a five to ten minute
flight time to Moscow very destructive
missiles also Reagan had announced his
so-called Star Wars program which is
presented here as if it were defensive
but every strategic analyst on all sides
understands that missile defense is a
first-strike weapon if missile defense
ever worked which it might not it could
not stop a first strike but it
conceivably might stop a retaliatory
strike which means it's a first strike
weapon and that was being installed at
the time all of this very seriously
caused great alarm in Russia especially
with the simulated attacks that led to a
major war scare in 1983 that was the
last time that the Doomsday Clock
reached three minutes three minutes
before
midnight 1984 newly released Russian
archives reveal that the danger was even
more severe than historians had
previously assumed there's a recent
comprehensive US intelligence study
which runs through the evidence now
available and concludes in its words the
war scare was for real and they conclude
he concludes that US intelligence
underestimated Russian concerns and
underestimated the threat of a Russian
preventive nuclear strike which would
have been the end recently we've learned
that it's was even more dangerous than
that in the midst of these world
threatening developments Russia's early
warning systems detected an incoming
missile strike from the United States
sending the highest level alert the
officer on duty the Russian officer on
duty stanislav petrov decided that it
was a false alarm
and he did not transmit the warnings
violating protocol that was the
difference between survival and
extermination a Russian air defense
systems are much less sophisticated than
those of the United States they pretty
much rely on radar which means
line-of-sight recta detection of
incoming missiles u.s. systems rely on
satellites we can detect them at the
point of launch so the Russian systems
are on much more tense alert of great
danger to us of course well twenty years
before that back in the Cuban Missile
Crisis a Russian submarine commander
named Vasili arkhipov blocked the
launching of nuclear-tipped torpedoes
which could have set off a terminal
nuclear war - there were three
submarines Russian submarines
the two other commanders had authorized
the launch when the three submarines
were under attack by u.s. destroyers
during the Missile Crisis according to
the protocol the agreement of all three
was required arkhipov refused to agree
yet another sign of how thin is the
thread that we grasped for survival
there are chilling estimates about
failures of us systems which as I
mentioned are surely far more reliable
than the Russian ones there's a recent
review in The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists of several years of data on
us accidental reports of Soviet military
launches by the automated systems
aborted by human intervention the
hundreds of these these were right in
those years of the greatest dangers 1979
to 1983 the author of the review Seth
bomb concludes that nuclear war is the
Black Swan we can never see except in
that brief moment when it's killing us
we delay eliminating the risk at our own
peril now is the time to address the
threat because now we are still alive
the former commander of Stratcom
General Lee Butler recently reviewed his
long career as a strategic weapons
planner and he wrote that he had been
among the most avid of these keepers of
the faith in nuclear weapons but now it
is his burden to declare with all of the
conviction I can muster that in my
judgment they served us extremely ill
and he outlines the reasons like the
ones I've mentioned and he then raises a
haunting question by what authority
through succeeding generations of
leaders in the nuclear weapons States
usurped the power to dictate the odds of
continued life on our planet most
urgently why does such breathtaking
audacity persist at a moment when we
should stand trembling in the face of
our folly and United in our commitment
to abolish its most deadly
manifestations general Butler went on to
conclude that we have so far survived
the nuclear age by some combination of
skill let luck and divine intervention
and I suspect the latter in greatest
proportion looking over the record one
can understand his judgment that plainly
these are not risks that would be
accepted by any sane decision-maker
they are being accepted by
decision-makers who are perfectly sane
just as the devastating risks of
environmental catastrophe
are being faced with eyes open and
ignored by the Masters of the Universe
all of them are trapped by an
institutional logic that is deeply
pathological and that must be cured and
quickly if we are not to put an end to
the human race in Russell and Einstein's
words thanks
[Applause]
again these lights are super bright well
what's it like being a Sufi sage or
what's it like like being a Sufi sage
Sufi save just I promise do something
different and introducing him but you
ended that very cheerful talk did I miss
something
all are trapped by an institutional
logic that is deeply pathological and
that must be cured and quickly if we are
not to put an end to the human race how
do we go about doing that it's easy it's
all in our hands in the case of nuclear
weapons actually the answer is known
there are ways to end the threat of
nuclear weapons
furthermore as many of you know it's a
an obligation of the nuclear weapon
states to carry out good-faith measure
efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons
totally that's article 6 of the
non-proliferation treaty of 1970 that's
furthermore a legal obligation as the
International Court of Justice ruled
some years later in 1996 and those
efforts could be carried out in
unfortunately we're going in the
opposite direction so President Obama
has recently announced a trillion dollar
program to modernize and upgrade our
nuclear weapons at capacity our attack
capacity other other powers are acting
more or less similarly they there are
policies being conducted right now I
mentioned Ukraine but it's not the only
one that are bringing the global
situation to the point where it might
lead to
perhaps accidental cracks perhaps
intended nuclear strike incidentally
it's been known for many years decades
that if a power launches a nuclear
strike first strike it will be destroyed
by the effects of the nuclear explosions
so there's no escape it's any nuclear
war that between any powers with any
capacity will lead to the virtual
extermination we know how to end it but
the steps that are being conducted are
in the opposite direction and there have
been some potential
unfortunately aborted efforts to
implement steps that would reduce the
danger so one major threat right now has
to do with Iran in the United States
it's commonly claimed by high officials
commentators and others that Iran is the
greatest threat to world peace it's kind
of interesting to compare this with
global opinion there are polls of global
opinion taken by US polling agencies
Gallup hold major one the most recent
about a year ago did ask people around
the world which country is the greatest
threat to world peace the United States
won by a huge margin nobody else was
even close a second was Pakistan which
was probably inflated by the Indian vote
but that's but
fortunately Americans are spared
knowledge of these facts the press
refused to report them but they're facts
nevertheless anyway here it's Iran
that's the greatest threat to world
peace there's interesting questions that
one can ask about just what the threat
is but let's say there's a threat
whatever it may be is there a way to end
it yeah there are ways to end it if I
don't you want me to go into it but the
kind of stick to the five five minute
lecture but but there have been
potential steps which have been blocked
by the United States
that's unfortunate anyway in the case of
nuclear weapons we know how to end the
problem it's feasible it's a matter of
implementing policies that are
understood and they could be carried out
if they were sufficient popular pressure
to compel them to be carried out the
populations of the world care about
survival
their leaders typically don't they care
about power and we can influence those
decisions particularly in countries like
this more free and open societies with
regard to an environmental catastrophe
it's not so obvious that there's a
solution there are measures that can be
undertaken to mitigate the threats and
maybe to overcome them that's an open
question but again policy is going in
the opposite direction what I quoted
from The Wall Street Journal is
unfortunately pretty typical you read it
in the business presses of the business
pages of the press across the spectrum
New York Times Financial Times others
plenty of euphoria about how the United
States can become the Saudi Arabia of
the 21st century it can achieve energy
independence we can flood the world with
oil all great and one
the price of oil is going down which is
great means good for American consumers
who can drive more and all of these
marvelous things are simply very
straightforwardly driving us towards a
precipice which will fall over which
will be extremely harmful may be
devastating for generations not very far
away the generation of our grandchildren
much worse of course for the poorer
countries but also here
well senator cotton of Arkansas is one
of the many intellectual Giants in that
esteemed legislature legislative body
recently announced that we do have a
great deal to fear from Iran because
they control Tehran I know that's pretty
super but you should add that if you
read The Washington Post this morning
you'll discover that Senator cotton was
got a real pedigree even graduated from
Harvard is positioning himself to be the
future foreign policy specialist of the
Republican Party taking the mantle of
McCain and Graham he has other
interesting warnings I don't know how
much he followed his career but when he
was running for Senate in Arkansas he
warned the citizens of Arkansas that the
Mexican drug cartels are linked to Isis
and joined together they are working to
send terrorists across the border into
the United States where they can kill
citizens of of Arkansas and of course
all of this is the forum full of fault
of President Obama with leaving a porous
order and so on if that's true we should
move that clock to two minutes to
midnight
yeah election in Israel Netanyahu won a
third consecutive term his fourth
overall Haymarket author and
Electronic Intifada co-founder Ali
Abunimah says Netanyahu's good for the
Palestinians why because he's very clear
no Palestinian state no compromise
Haaretz correspondent Amira Hass sees
only cosmetic differences between the
two major Israeli parties and she says
that the now moribund two-state solution
is actually a tenth stage solution a
bunch of bantu styles she says inside
the West Bank what's your view on what
happened in Israel well what happened is
that one question is how much difference
there is between the camp between the
parties and they're all pretty much on
the right others.the there was a very
minor sort of peace party merits got
four seats barely made past the
admissions point the there is the Arab
party which is the third largest but
that's pretty much excluded from any
coalition just on racist grounds no
coalition will accept the Arab party as
a important constituent but there are
some differences one difference is if
you read Netanyahu's appeal to the
electorate which that carried him to
victory after a rather tepid polling
results it was a combination of outright
racism and extreme fear mongering so
you've probably read in the papers he
warned the electorate that Arabs
Arab citizens of Israel are being driven
to the polls by leftists with support
from foreign governments all in an
effort to undermine his policy of
defending Israel from you know
terrorists so on and so forth
and that combination of fear-mongering
and racism does work it worked in Israel
we're not unfamiliar with it here and
it's a very
it's a very dangerous sign about the
nature of Israeli society which has been
drifting very far to the right and it's
a this is a this is a major nuclear
weapons state it's a violent state
that's carried out lots of aggression
it's a direct violation of international
law and the occupied territories that's
accepted essentially by the entire world
with the exception of Israel in the
United States and it can be an extremely
danger it is already a very dangerous
state can be much more so as to the a
benign on Amira Hass conclusions I think
they're slightly I don't think they're
analyzing the situation quite accurately
the there's it's widely argued not just
by them across the board by you know
Israeli analysts Palestinians others
that there are two options either a
two-state settlement in accord with the
overwhelming international consensus
which includes essentially everyone
outside the United States and Israel
that's one possibility and the other
possibility is supposed to be what's
called a one state solution
Israel takes over the whole of the
former Palestine Jordan to the sea and
then there will be what in Israel is
called a demographic problem too many
Arabs in a Jewish state that pretty soon
in fact maybe majority from the
Palestinian Palestinians who and
Palestinian supporters like the one used
you mentioned who regard this positively
say well then it'll be possible to carry
out an anti-apartheid struggle a civil
rights struggle to call for the rights
of Palestinians within this one state
the problem with that analysis is that
these are not the two options the two
options are quite different one up this
second option one state is not an option
there is no possible
the reasonable possibility that Israel
will take over the whole territory and
face this demographic problem they don't
want it
the second option alternatives to States
is something quite different it is what
is exactly happening before our eyes
there are policies being implemented
daily right before our eyes we can see
them we can see where they're directed
now they've been in motion for almost
half a century and their purpose is
clear what they're doing the policies
take Oh first of all they Israel is
taking over has taken over at what it
calls Jerusalem that's an area about
five times the size of historic
Jerusalem that includes substantial
areas of the West Bank
many former our villages supposed to be
an internationalized territory
Israel's taken it over in all the
parties except for the very far out ones
are saying yes this is an indivisible
permanent capital of Israel that's one
thing then if you look at the
development programs which are pretty
systematic very obvious the one of them
developed is developing a corridor
extending east of Jerusalem to include a
large town mollado Miam was built mostly
during the Clinton years its purpose is
to subdivide the West Bank to part
virtually partition it the borders of
mala domain reach virtually to Jericho
which will be left in Palestinian hands
that's right at the border so as a
corridor extending to the east
pretty much bisecting the West Bank if
you look at the map there are other
corridors to the north including other
new Israeli towns REO whom they break up
the region further in addition Israelis
taking over it's committed to taking
over everything that's within the
so-called separation wall it's an
annexation wall declared illegal by the
World Court
by international opinion but the US
continues to support the policies
doesn't matter that's a large part of
the arable land that excludes the
Palestinians from their farms orchards
and so on furthermore Israel is
systematically taking over the Jordan
Valley that's roughly a third of the
West Bank much of its arable land
Palestinians are being steadily expelled
by one or another pretext sometimes
simply thrown out the Jewish settlements
are being established that wells are
sunk and so on
the traditional method for a hundred
years now of ultimately incorporating
some region inside Israel well you look
at that pattern and you can see what's
happening the the Israel is carrying out
a perfectly reason Dan telogen program
intended to integrate into Israel
everything that might be of any value in
the West Bank but to exclude the
Palestinian population the areas that
Israel's taking over don't have many
Palestinians and those were there are
being largely expelled that will leave
the Palestinian population in some kind
of limbo not not within Israel no no
demographic problem no one state
Palestinians lose everything that's the
live alternative there is no serious
alternative that anyone has made any
meaningful case for to think that there
could be one state unfortunately this is
the assumption that's made across the
board but if you think it through you
can see that it's extremely unlikely of
the likely alternative to astute state
settlement is what I just described the
policies that are now being implemented
what could stop them actually one thing
it's in the hands of the United States
as long as the you know the United
States officially objects to these
policies so the official US policy says
it's unhelpful to peace but the u.s.
continues to support them it's providing
the military economic diplomatic support
for them even the ideological support
for them by the way the issues are
framed in the United States which is
quite different from the rest of the
world as long as the United States
continues to support the policies there
is no reason to expect Israel to
withdraw from them whether it's
Netanyahu or Isaac Hara or anyone else
there are some differences in the
policies the racist and extremely
alarmist rhetoric of Netanyahu who's not
chaired by others so there's some
differences but a mirror House is
correct and saying that they're not
fundamental differences in New Mexico
under US law Native American and Spanish
land grant heirs have lost common lands
and acequia water rights have been
separated from the land for commercial
use
what hope for the future do you see from
traditional people's continuing to
defend the rights of the Commons and the
shared use of natural resources rather
than exploitation for profit well again
same story it's up to you these are
decisions that the American population
can make in the case of the United
States and of course as we all know this
has been going on for 500 years 400
years ever since the first English
settlers came there's been a steady
attack on the Indian nations driving
them out of their lands
exterminating them expelling them
sending them the reservations that's
been well that's American history there
are two fundamental profound crimes in
American history the one is
expulsion or extermination of the
indigenous population the others of
course slavery with its impact still
remaining the United States is as is
what's called a separ colonial society
that's an unusual form of imperialism
it's a form of imperialism in which the
imperial power originally England
settles the country that is being taken
over drives out or exterminates the
population that's a extreme form of
imperialism it's true of the what's
called the Anglosphere the countries
that sort of extend it out of England
through the United States Canada
Australia New Zealand almost they didn't
quite exterminate the indigenous
population that's an unusual form of
imperialism very for the indigenous
people a very dangerous one and yes
they're fighting back needs support
however there's another point that ought
to be made about preservation of the
Commons that's back to climate change
the Commons are the environment in which
we live if the Commons are privatized if
they're handed over to Exxon Mobil and
Chevron and so on and we're dead for the
reasons that I've just mentioned we're
pretty obvious if the Commons are
preserved for the common good we have a
possibility of surviving if you look
around the world almost everywhere
it's the indigenous populations which
are in the lead in trying to protect the
Commons from destruction by the
industrial capitalist powers primarily
China others so in Canada it's the First
Nations in Australia is the Aboriginal
people in India it's tribal people all
around the world the countries that have
substantial indigenous majorities and
populations have actually taken steps
towards trying to preserve the Commons
Bolivia for example which actually has
rights of nature written into its
constitution Ecuador made an interesting
effort to keep some of its oil in the
ground where it ought to be if the rich
countries the European countries would
pay Ecuador a fraction of the profit
that it would have received from us
marketing the fossil fuels the rich
countries refused so now they're doing
also destroying valuable forests it's a
pretty striking fact which what they're
really shame us that it's the indigenous
peoples who have been driven to the
margins of survival who are in the lead
in trying to protect us from the folly
that we are now carrying out which is
very likely to destroy the possibilities
of decent survival that's the most
crucial aspect of protecting the Commons
the day after the big climate March in
New York and September the very next day
the Rockefeller Brothers fund the
Rockefeller Brothers fund disinvested
from fossil fuels you can't miss the
significance of that given John D
Rockefellers background is is this the
start of a major movement in terms of
divestment from fossil fuel corporations
I was in Portland Oregon recently and an
activist told me this is one of the
hottest issues on campuses from Stanford
to Harvard yeah MIT my on campus it's
hot issue on campuses and yes it's
important it's in a way symbolic but
significant these are some of the steps
that can be made to impede the race to
the precipice how important it is will
like everything else depends on people
like you would you do something about it
I want to talk to you about two ships
one fictional and one real the Pequod
and Moby Dick and the Titanic I think it
was Edward Sayid right on this stage who
years ago talked about the monomaniacal
urge of Ahab to destroy Moby Dick no
matter what and to take the crew down
with him it was of no concern to him and
what do you think about that metaphor
that Moby Dick is nature and that a hob
is out there's an out-of-control kind of
capitalism and that when it comes to the
Titanic the reforms that are offered up
by the centers of power are merely
cosmetic they're moving deck chairs on
the Titanic recycle your cardboard
driver Prius and things like that sorry
- Prius drivers
well like any kind of models and
metaphors there's some point but some
differences the crucial we are not being
I mean you might say that Hitler was an
Ahab let's say he was especially toward
the end of the war he was dedicated to
continuing in the war even if Germany
was totally destroyed and it was the
fault of the Germans if they didn't
succeed in winning the war okay that's a
hab like in a way but the in our case
it's somewhat different it really is
institutional logic it's not a matter of
individuals those CEOs who voted in the
Davos poll if you asked them personally
maybe they contribute the Sierra Club
and maybe they're in favor of divestment
could be but in their institutional role
as managers of major corporations they
have a duty in fact a requirement even a
legal requirement to maximize profit and
market share and to ignore what
economists call externalities the impact
of a transaction on others that doesn't
enter into market calculations well in
this case the externality happens to be
the survival of the grandchildren but
they cannot in their institutional role
attend to that problem because their
task is to maximize profit and market
share there's some range of choices of
course and there's some variation among
corporations as to how they operate but
this overwhelming institutional property
happens to be lethal in its nature it
cannot continue if we are going to serve
and survive in the case of state power
it's not dissimilar quite typically
States governments regard
their own populations as a major enemy
the Snowden revelations for example will
reveal the extent to which the u.s.
government regards the u.s. population
as an enemy which has to be monitored
and controlled the pretext of defending
terrorism is very weak as you may recall
when the Snowden revelations came out at
first it was claimed by the government
that 50 over 50 terrorist acts had been
prevented by the NSA surveillance under
inquiry they reduced it to maybe a dozen
or so under further inquiry it was
finally reduced to one one case someone
had sent $8,500 to Somalia that was the
net yield of this massive program which
is a program aimed at the population to
ensure their control and obedience and
that's very typical of governments and
understandable the leadership is
committed to power the state power if
you think through the record of nuclear
policy I sampled it if you look in
detail it's much worse but the record is
one of an astonishing record of
disregard for the safety welfare of the
population and steps in order to enhance
state power that's the way powerful
institutions function and these things
have to be a to overcome institutional
pathologies is a lot harder than
overcoming an individual pathology in
the case of Ahab you know you can throw
them into the ocean or you submit them
to psychoanalysis or institutionalize
them there are remedies but in the case
of institutional pathology it's far more
serious as for rearranging the deck
chairs on the
it's it's not a bad image but but there
are some steps being taken that are not
insignificant the development of the
solar energy for example is proceeding
there are major efforts to try to block
it but it's proceeding unfortunately
this is not the center of where it's
proceeding the major production of solar
panels is in China and this means
sophisticated ones they're at the
cutting edge of advanced technology and
solar panel production should be here
but some steps are being taken there are
some environmental rules but by and
large the primary thrust of policy is in
the wrong direction years ago the
philosopher John Dewey said politics is
the shadow cast on society by big
business how would you evaluate that
shadow today in light of citizens united
and McCutcheon vs. FEC and other Supreme
Court rulings
well Dewey's comment was accurate it
extends way back back in the 1950s
somebody will remember there was a
Equipe I think maybe it came from
Seawright Mills I don't remember which
said that the United States is a
one-party state of the business party
which has two factions Democrats and
Republicans and that was
that's pretty accurate at the time but
it's less accurate today the United
States is still a one-party state the
business party but there's really only
one faction the Republican Party has
pretty much departed from being a
functioning parliamentary organization
but that's not just my judgment the very
highly respected conservative political
analyst Norman Ornstein of the American
Enterprise Institute right wing
think-tank pointed out recently I think
accurately that the Republican Party has
been witty has become what he called a
radical insurgency no longer committed
to parliamentary participation there's a
lot of truth to that we've seen it
pretty dramatically in the last couple
of years we're seeing it right now just
take a look at the today's newspaper the
description of the House Budget
basically the Ryan budget what is the
Ryan budget through an all kind of
sleight of hand which economists just
mocking about balancing the budget but
what it actually does is undermine
Medicare by moving to privatize it which
means - it's the one part of the health
care system that more or less works
because it's not privatized it's
inefficiencies and costs are due to the
fact that it has to work through the in
highly inefficient bureaucratized
privatized system in the United States
so privatizing moving to privatize
Medicare or saying let's undermine the
one system the more or less works
cutting back Medicaid under the guise of
federalism repealing the Affordable Care
Act which sends not a wonderful
legislation but nevertheless an
improvement which will send tens of
millions of people into the onion
word lists cutting back food stamps and
so on in other and enriching the wealthy
that's the one policy of the Republican
radical insurgency do anything he can to
enrich the wealthy and powerful and
attack the general population well you
can't win votes that way so what's
happened is over the last years the
Republican Party managers have mobilized
sectors of the population which have
always been around but have never been
mobilized into a significant political
force
one part is Christian evangelicals major
component of part of the base of the
Republican Party today you see it in the
Iowa primaries coming up but quite
generally another is nativists people
who are afraid that they are taking our
country away from us which has a basis
in fact the white population is a beacon
will become a minority pretty soon and
for extreme ultra-nationalists nativists
this is a crime that can't be tolerated
people who are sectors of the population
who are so frightened that they have to
carry guns into Starbucks because who
knows will come after them in fact
there's legislation in Nevada right now
being debated to allow guns to be
brought into daycares matters and maybe
some of these three-year-olds were
trained by Isis so notes but these are
you know these are not small parts of
the population it's a very strange
country in many ways that's a large part
of the population people can be
mobilized on those issues and not notice
that the policies that their leaders are
pursuing are attacking them and
supporting the super-rich and the
corporation's well that's one
that's one of the former two factions
what's the other faction it's not
Democrats its what used to be called
moderate Republicans if you take a look
at the Democratic Party programs there
are a few exceptions like Bernie Sanders
and others but if you take the the core
of the Democratic Party Democratic
Leadership Council and so on these are
the policies that used to be called
moderate Republicans in fact somebody
like Richard Nixon would be kind of at
the left of American politics today
Eisenhower would be off the spectrum
Eisenhower went so far as to say that
nobody insane could think of dismantling
New Deal programs namely the ones that
are being dismantled right now the
current Republican programs are efforts
to dismantle programs that were
initiated under Nixon the drift to the
right during this whole neoliberal
period roughly since Reagan is pretty
extreme actually see it's pretty
strikingly in the public attitudes
towards health towards the health
programs of the unites the u.s. health
system is an international scandal it
has about twice the per capita costs of
comparable countries and relatively poor
outcomes furthermore the US government
spends about as much per capita as
comparable countries but that's a small
part of the health costs because it all
has to work through the privatized
health system which is inefficient
bureaucratized and in the hands of tons
of bookkeeping administration and so on
and so forth and in the hands of
institutions we have no interest in the
health an insurance company is not
dedicated to health it's dedicated to
making money so not surprisingly they do
things try to make money
well this if you look back at the
there's an extensive polling record of
public attitudes on health care
and for a long period since the Second
World War there have been substantive
considerations or ities you know a lot
of the polls depend on exactly how the
question is asked but a large part of
the population often a majority has been
in favor of national health care they go
back to the late 1980s a majority of the
population thought that there ought to
be a constitutional guarantee for health
care national health care and in fact I
think it was 40% of the population
thought it already was in the
Constitution
that's the late 80s and take a look
today when Obama presented his
affordable health care program you'll
recall that at the very beginning one of
the part of the program was a public
option allowing people to make the
choice of something like Medicare
national health care at the time almost
two-thirds of the population was in
favor of that but it was dropped without
discussion it never entered the
discussion the United States has a very
unusual maybe unique law which bars the
government from negotiating drug prices
you can negotiate other things but not
drug prices so of course drug prices are
way out of sight much higher than in
comparable countries the population is
overwhelmingly opposed yes there haven't
been many polls but the only ones I've
seen show over 80 percent opposition
there was never even a attempt to deal
with this the power of the
pharmaceutical corporations is so
enormous that there wasn't even an
effort to try to introduce it into the
so-called Obamacare if you look at the
attitudes towards the so-called
Obamacare they've been pretty negative
most of the population has been opposed
even though for years the population has
been strongly in favor of national
health care and this of course isn't
national health care now some of that
opposition
is because it didn't go far enough we
don't know how much because the
questions aren't asked in the polls but
a lot of it is the kind of thing you see
reflected in this famous Town Hall
comment where somebody got up and said
I'll keep your keep your hands off my
Medicare you know that kind of thing
people don't understand that what the
government is doing and what the private
corporations are doing and the effect is
a significant change in expressed
attitudes towards the policies that's a
remarkable triumph of propaganda if you
think about it especially considering
how vital health care is to everyone's
life well those numbers have been at
zero for quite some time and there's a
light up there that says exit but I'm
going to take a moderators privilege
here and just go on for a minute or two
more if I may on this that's okay
well on this long journey you've been on
did you ever imagine the kind of crowds
you routinely draw or having your books
on display at airports well actually
started giving public talks on these
issues much too late in the early 1960s
early days of the Vietnam War I started
giving talks about the Vietnam War and
as it you know it was talks to three
people as somebody's living room or a
church with three or four people or
something like that and that was never
and none of us who were involved ever
had it could have guessed at the time
that a couple of years later there would
be a major anti-war movement but there
was and the same has happened on other
issues with all of the negative things
that have happened over the past years
this neoliberal reaction since Lee
Carter primarily the Reagan years
there's also been plenty of progress
audiences are very different than they
were in the past
concerns are different lots of issues
that were fighting issues back in the
60s you could barely discuss them are
now accepted and taken for granted
women's rights gay rights there was no
concern for environmental issues in the
60s now there's substantial concern of
the years there have been mount periods
of extensive popular activism to try to
terminate the nuclear weapons lunacy the
the general atmosphere of the public has
changed a lot and you know audiences
kind of reflect that well all of this is
positive there's basically two
trajectories there's one trajectory
which one just been describing which is
a constructive positive offers hope
there's another trajectory which I
talked about which is going in the
opposite direction and the question is
which one will prevail but again as I've
said several times and as you all know
without my saying it that's in your
hands you were just in Argentina and met
with some you were just in Argentina and
you met with some activists from the
podemos movement in Spain what were your
impressions well this was an
international conference of activists
from around the world mostly South
America but some from Spain some from
Greece Arisa and others and it reflects
some of the positive developments in the
world
one of the major positive developments
internationally in the past for a long
time long what's he like has been what
has taken place in South America over
the past roughly 15 years South America
for 500 years since the early conquest
had been dominated by foreign powers the
South American countries themselves were
the typical structure was a small
Europeanized mostly white elite
extremely wealthy in a sea of misery and
poverty the elites were oriented towards
the outside they had their second homes
in the Riviera they sent their money to
Zurich you know and so on there were
very little interaction among the South
American countries of the South American
countries were the most religious
students of the neoliberal policy
structural adjustment policies of the
World Bank and the IMF and the Treasury
Department and they were the ones who
suffered most naturally but in the last
10 or 15 years they pulled out of this
for the first time it's a major change
in world affairs South America used to
be regarded here as what was called our
backyard
they did whatever we told them we don't
pay any attention to them now South
America is out of control you take a
look at the hemispheric conferences the
United States is isolated in fact the
primary reason why Obama made some steps
towards normalizing relations with Cuba
is that the u.s. was utterly isolated on
that issue in the whole hemisphere they
were trying to get some kind of
arrangements before the summit of
Americas which is coming up soon they
didn't quite make it but that's the goal
this is a huge change and that's why the
conference was in South America but
there were participants from
particularly podemos and syriza these
are in Greece Europe has been subjected
to a program of a kind of a savage
economic program which is seriously
undermine European democracy it's been
devastating for the weaker the
peripheral countries
it's beginning to dismantle Europe's
major post-second world were achieving
it the Social Democratic welfare state
programs and I think that's the purpose
of the policies it's economically
destructive this is these are the
policies of austerity under recession
even the International Monetary Fund's
is it crazy
from an economic point of view but they
are they make some sense from the point
of view of class war they are enriching
the big banks they're dismantling social
programs and so on well there's a
reaction the reaction was pumped first
in Greece which has suffered most and
the German banks which are basically
responsible for these crises are
reacting in an absolutely savage way to
try to prevent Greece from taking steps
that might extricate itself from the
disaster that's been imposed Greece's
calling for restructuring of its debt
you know delaying debt payments and so
on
this is particularly ironic because
Germany in 1953 was permitted by the
European countries to about to cancel
its major debts that's the basis for
German recovery that's why it's the
dynamic center of Europe
secondly Germany practically destroyed
Greece during the Second World War
well put all this together the Greece is
now asking for a limited element of what
Germany was granted in 1953 and the
German the powers in Germany the bank
the Bundesbank are just flatly refusing
in a very savage way now they may get
away with it in Greece because Greece is
a pretty weak country Spain is going to
be harder nut to crack that's a bigger
country a more powerful economy and in
Spain in the last couple of years two or
three years a new political party
developed for them us which
by now is running first in the polls and
it is also a policy
a party has dedicated in a pretty
pragmatic sensible way to reversing the
austerity programs sustaining rebuilding
the the the social economy the welfare
state programs and moving the country
thoughts and constructive development in
Spain as well the the criminals the ones
who caused the crisis were the banks the
Spanish banks and the German banks but
they want the population to pay notice
that none of them believe in capitalism
in a capitalist society say if I lend
money to you and since I know you I know
it's a risky loan and I therefore and I
therefore get a lot of interest and make
a lot of money out of it if at a certain
point you can't pay it's my problem in a
capitalist society but not in the
societies in which we live the problem
is your problem and your neighbors
problem your neighbors didn't take the
debt the debt but they got to pay for it
that's the way our system works
radically anti-capitalist makes sense on
class warfare grounds but no resemblance
to markets or capitalism and that's
what's been going on but there is a
struggle against it and podemos I worth
keeping an eye on they have sensible
programs might win the next election
which is coming up soon and it's not a
it's not going to be easy for the
Brussels bureaucrats and the German
banks northern banks to crush Spanish
initiatives one last question you grew
up in the 30s at a time when solidarity
meant something there was mutual support
there was an active labor movement what
is it going to take in 2015 to rekindle
that spirit of solidarity well remember
what happened in the 30s the labor
movement was in fact in
for from there was CIO organizing
sit-down strikes so on
they had a sympathetic administration so
the Roosevelt administration was willing
to accommodate to the some extent to the
pressures developing among the public
labor movement spearheading it which did
lead to the New Deal legislations which
were very beneficial to the population
and to the economy but go back to the
1920s the labor movement had been
destroyed there was nothing left
practically nothing left of it one of
the leading labor historians David
Montgomery died recently has a book full
of the Fall of the House of labor and
it's about the 1920s there had been a
lively vibrant active pretty radical
American labor movement but it had been
crushed by a brutal attack this is very
much a business run society and the
business classes are highly class
conscious constantly fighting a class
war have state power supporting them and
they were able to crush and destroy the
labor movement but it revived and it can
revive again and other popular movements
can as well too and there's a basis for
it
the basis for it is the quite positive
changes that have taken place since the
1960s in many ways it's a much more
civilized society than it was at that
time and many issues and I think that is
a basis for recreating the kind of
solidarity mutual aid working together
dedication commitment that is very
necessary today and we can't overlook
the fact that we're at a moment of human
history which is entirely unique for the
first time in human history we are at a
position where the decisions that we
will make will determine whether the
species survives it's not been true in
the past it's very definitely true now
these are not small questions it's quite
a sobering note and as we bring this
evening to a close in Hindi there's a
word called Saiva it means service and I
can think of no one who has performed
more savor more service for humankind
than you thank you very much
you
