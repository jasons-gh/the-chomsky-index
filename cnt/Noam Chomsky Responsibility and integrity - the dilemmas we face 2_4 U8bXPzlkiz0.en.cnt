look what happened in El Salvador was
bad enough was about 70,000 killed
almost entirely the government related
security forces is funded by the US
trained and armed by them but the other
countries are even worse in Guatemala
was about a hundred thousand and
Nicaragua maybe 30,000 altogether about
200,000 people killed in the 1980s that
was called a war on terror ronald reagan
came into office in 1981 and declared
that the core function of u.s. foreign
policy would be to combat the plague of
the modern age return to barbarism and
our time namely state-supported
international terrorism that episode has
kind of been disappeared from history
the bar of the latin american transitive
verb disappear it's been eliminated kind
of wrong story wrong agency not the
right kind of thing to remember it it
goes back much before that this war on
the murder of the jesuit intellectuals
in 1989 terminated a long campaign of
terror and brutality that started in the
early 1960s the it started actually with
Vatican to the Vatican 2 in 1962 was a
an attempt by the Pope hooked on the
twenty-third to institute a really
radical change in church history as
probably no he won't he tried to restore
the Church of early Christianity the
Gospels what they actually say a message
of radical pacifism which is of course
why the early Christians were persecuted
that changed in the 4th century when the
Roman Empire
over the church made it the Church of
the persecutors not the Church of the
persecuted in phrase of distinguished
theologian Hans kung one of those
punished in the period of the 60s and
70s he he wasn't killed he was just kind
of kept from teachings on these lucky in
1962 Vatican to the the Pope declared an
effort to return the church to its
original mission to be the church of the
persecuted a very significant change and
it was taken seriously particularly in
Latin America Latin American the
latin-american bishops have adopted that
program they adopted what was called the
preferential option for the poor message
comes out of the Gospels and priests and
nuns laypersons it went to the
countryside tried to organize peasants
into base communities where they would
read the Gospels think about ways to
adopt measures to survive somehow in the
extremely harsh domains of us power that
was a heresy that was not going to be
tolerated the u.s. very quickly launched
the war against the church at the church
and all social movements that were
participating in these similar efforts
it began very quickly in 1964 the
military coup took place in Brazil
overthrowing the civilian government
that
been prepared by the Kennedy
administration carried out shortly after
kennedy's assassination that established
the what was called a national security
state kind of a neo-nazi style terror
and torture state brazil's a big country
and big influence a plague spread
through the hemisphere Chile Uruguay
Argentina one country after another
similar phenomena plenty of religious
martyr because they were in the
forefront and it continued through
Central America in the 1980s it
essentially terminated with the murder
of the six Jasmine intellectuals in
November 1989 right at the time the fall
of the Berlin Wall well it's well known
to scholarship that the terror and
atrocities and brutality and slaughter
in Latin America from the sixth from
1960 to the end of the century were in
comparably worse than anything that
happened in Eastern Europe in those
years what happened in Eastern Europe is
bad enough but what went on in Western
domains was incomparable worse that's
known the scholarship for example you
can read it in the recently published a
Cambridge University history the Cold
War kind of comment on it but it's not
known to the public what's known to the
public is the suffering of the East
European dissonance which was real and
they should be respected and honored but
in comparison with what was happening
elsewhere they were pretty lucky far
luckier than the Jesuits of El Salvador
or the archbishop or many others during
those years well at the task one of the
task of intellectuals is to read is to
ensure that we know about the East
European dissidents and we pride
ourselves
on our heroism and supporting them but
we don't know about the ones who we
slaughter and tortured and killed that's
out of history not to be remembered I
happen to be in Europe in November in
november two thousand nine at the 30th
anniversary of the fall of the berlin
wall and there was a great deal of
euphoria self-congratulation by our
great courage and supporting dissidents
in the enemy's domain but there wasn't a
word about what happened in latin
america primarily carried out by the
united states but with a strong support
of its European allies all the way
through well that's the typical task of
the intellectuals if you go back to say
the Vietnam War there was protest and
substantial protest I mostly on the part
of young people students people outside
the elite intellectual circles there was
some protests there but very muted and
quite interesting in its character
written about it if you want the details
up through the early years of the war it
was overwhelmingly strong support for
the war virtually no protest in fact
support for the war was so strong that
very few people even today know when the
war began actually began just 50 years
ago in 1961 kennedy president kennedy at
the time sent the American Air Force to
start bombing South Vietnam authorized
the use of napalm chemical warfare to
destroy crops and
ground cover programs to drive the rural
population which was overwhelmingly
supportive of the guerrillas they knew
to drive them into what amounted to
concentration camps called strategic
Hamlet's to surround him with barbed
wire to protect them from the guerrillas
who they were strongly supporting that
end up with millions of people being
driven out and off to describe what
happened to South Vietnam was virtually
destroyed the war expanded to the rest
of the of Indochina always with European
support and with virtually no criticism
by the about nineteen 66 or 67 there
were few voices of criticism in educated
circles on the grounds that it was not
working very well same kind of grounds
you here today in Afghanistan or heard a
couple of years ago about Iraq wasn't
working too well you know maybe it was a
mistake in 1968 everything changed in
january nineteen sixty eight there was
an amazing uprising in South Vietnam
there's been nothing like it in history
the country was saturated with over half
a million American troops over a hundred
thousand pie Korean other mercenaries a
huge army seven or eight hundred
thousand people every village penetrated
informants everywhere all of a sudden in
january nineteen sixty eight there was
an uprising which no one knew about
everyone had kept quiet and it was all
over the country practically you know i
went broke into the American Embassy you
know this is the Tet Offensive I don't
think there's ever been a case of such
overwhelming commitment to a
revolutionary cause no one even talked
about it and it was a surprise
everywhere well that struck a chord with
the American business community the ones
who are decisive in determining policy
it got them to recognize that this war
is worth fighting any longer we've
basically won our objectives to waste
the money in time and they pressured the
government a pretty strong power play to
reverse policy and the government did
follow orders reversed policy started
withdrawing troops entered negotiations
of the president announced that he's not
going to run for a second term and so on
the intellectuals responded almost
reflexively all of a sudden everybody
became a long-term opponent of the war
without any trace that anyone can find
in fact the record says the opposite but
that was the new party line where
long-term opponents of the war got to
get out the steak should have gotten in
and so on there there are a number of
leading figures in the Kennedy
administration who wrote memoirs Arthur
Schlesinger writer hillsman theater
Soren's and others they rewrote their
memoirs literally the early memoirs the
ones written at the time if you look at
them we're fully supportive of the war
or often didn't even mention it was so
interesting the post 1968 story which is
the one that enters into history is
Kennedy was going to pull out of Vietnam
everybody was opposed you know never
gotten it in the first place it's the
bed Texan Lyndon Johnson who turned
everything around and we the elections
were passionate the opponents of the war
couldn't make our case that's the more
or less official story today there is
but by now the if you go to 1975 when
were officially ended it was quite
interesting to look at what was being
written then and what popular attitudes
were then at that time among the public
about seventy percent of the population
in polls said that the war was not a
mistake it was fundamentally wrong and
immoral that's seventy percent of the
population not a phrase like that in the
educated community in fact that the
outside limits of criticism say in the
New York Times of the most dissident
journalists anthony lewis wrote that the
war be
