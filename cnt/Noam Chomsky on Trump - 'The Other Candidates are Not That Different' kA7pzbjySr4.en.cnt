then in our democracy now special we
continue our full hour broadcast with
Noam Chomsky the world-renowned
political dissident linguist author
Institute professor emeritus at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
where he's taught for more than half a
century he's author of more than a
hundred books as we bring you the
remainder of his speech on power and
ideology which he delivered this weekend
at the new school here in New York
perhaps the United States and Israel are
justified in cowering and terror before
Iran because of its extraordinary
military power and it's possible to
evaluate that concern for example you
can turn to the authoritative analysis
detailed analysis of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies the
main source for such information last
April which conducted and published a
long study of the regional military
balance and they find I'll quote a
conclusive case that the Arab Gulf
states have an overwhelming advantage
over Iran in both military spending and
access to modern arms that's the Gulf
Cooperation Council states that's
Bahrain Kuwait Oman Saudi Arabia United
Arab Emirates they outspend Iran on arms
by a factor of eight it's an imbalance
that goes back decades and the report
observes further that the Arab Gulf
states have acquired and are acquiring
some of the most advanced and effective
weapons in the world while Iran has been
essentially forced to live in the past
often relying on systems originally
delivered at the time of the Shah forty
years ago which are essentially obsolete
and the imbalance is of course even
greater with Israel which along with the
most advanced US weaponry and its role
as a virtual offshore military
base of the global superpower has a huge
stock of nuclear weapons there are of
course other threats that justify
serious concern and can't be brushed
side a nuclear weapon state might leak
nuclear weapons to jihadis no joke in
the case of Iran the threat is minuscule
not only are the Sunni jihadist the
mortal elements of Iran but the ruling
clerics whatever one thinks of them have
shown no signs of clinical insanity and
they know that if there was even a hint
that they were the source of a leaked
weapon they and all they possess would
be instantly vaporized that doesn't mean
that we can ignore the threat however
not from Iran where it doesn't exist but
from US ally Pakistan where the threat
is in fact very real it's discussed
recently by two leading Pakistani
nuclear scientists Pervez Hoodbhoy
yan britain's leading journal of
international affairs they write that
increasing fears of militants seizing
nuclear weapons or materials and
unleashing nuclear terrorism have led to
the creation of a dedicated force of
over 20,000 troops to guard nuclear
facilities there is no reason to assume
however that this force would be immune
to the problems associated with the
unit's guarding regular military
facilities which have frequently
suffered attacks with insider help in
other words the whole system is laced
with jihadi elements in large measure
because of the
Patrick Coburn described the ization of
Sunni Islam from Saudi Arabia and with
the strong support of the United States
ever since the Reagan administration
well in short the problem is real enough
very real in fact it's not being
seriously addressed it's not even
discussed rather what we're concerned
about is fantasies and concocted for
other reasons
about the current official enemy
opponents of the Iran nuclear deal
maintain that Iran is intent on
developing nuclear weapons US
intelligence can discern no evidence for
this but there is no doubt at all that
in the past they have in fact intended
to do so we know this because it was
clearly stated by the highest
authorities in Iran the highest
authority of the Iranian state informed
foreign journalists that Iran would
develop nuclear weapons certainly and
sooner than one thinks the father of
Iran's nuclear energy program former
head of Iran's Atomic Energy
organization expressed his confidence
that the leadership's plan is to build a
nuclear bomb and the CIA report also had
their words no doubt that Iran would
develop nuclear weapons if neighboring
countries do as of course they have all
of this was under the Shah the highest
authority just quoted that is during the
period when high US officials that
Cheney Rumsfeld Kissinger were urging
the Shah to proceed with nuclear
programs and they were also pressuring
universities to accommodate these
efforts
my own university was an example MIT
under government pressure it made a deal
with the Shah to admit Iranian students
to the nuclear engineering department in
return for grants from the Shah this was
done over the very strong objections of
the student body but with comparably
strong faculty support that's a
distinction that raises a number of
interesting questions about academic
institutions and how they function the
faculty or the students of a couple of
years ago but have a different
institutional place opponents of the
nuclear in fact some of these MIT
students are now running the Iranian
nuclear programs opponents of the
nuclear deal argue that it didn't go far
enough you've heard a lot of that and
interestingly some of the supporters the
deal agree a demanding that it go beyond
what has been achieved and that the
whole Middle East should rid itself of
nuclear weapons and effect weapons of
mass destruction generally actually I'm
quoting Iran's Minister of Foreign
Affairs
Javad Zarif he's reiterating the call of
the non-aligned movement most of the
world and the Arab states for many years
to establish a weapons of mass
destruction free zone in the Middle East
that would be a very straightforward way
to address whatever threat Iran is
alleged the pose but a lot more than
that is at stake this is discussed
recently in the leading us world arms
control Journal arms control today by
two leading figures in the International
anti-nuclear
their movement to scientists who are
veterans of Pugwash and UN agencies they
observe that the successful adoption in
1995 of the resolution on the
establishment of his own free of weapons
of mass destructions in the Middle East
was the main element of a package that
permitted the extension of the
non-proliferation treaty that's the most
important arms control treaty there is
and it's continuation is conditioned on
acceptance of moves towards establishing
a weapons of mass destruction free zone
and declare free zone and the Middle
East
repeatedly implementation of this plan
has been blocked by the United States at
the annual five-year review meetings of
the non-proliferation treaty most
recently by Obama in 2010 and again in
2015 a couple of months ago the same two
anti-nuclear specialists comment that in
2015 this effort was again blocked by
the United States on behalf of a state
that is not party to the
non-proliferation treaty and is widely
believed to be the only one in the
region possessing nuclear weapons that's
a polite and understated reference to
Israel
Washington's sabotage of the possibility
in defense of Israeli nuclear weapons
may well undermine the non-proliferation
treaty as well as maintaining dangerous
instability in the Middle East always of
course in the name of stability this is
incidentally not the only case
when opportunities to end the alleged
Iranian threat have been undermined by
Washington some quite interesting cases
no time I won't go into them but all of
this raises quite interesting case
questions which we should be asking
about what actually is at stake so
turning to that what actually is the
threat posed by Iran it plainly it's not
a military threat it's obvious we can
put aside the fevered pronouncements
about Iranian aggression support for
terror seeking hegemony over the region
by force or the still more outlandish
notion that even if it ran had a bomb it
might use it therefore suffering instant
obliteration the real threat has been
clearly explained by US intelligence in
its reports to Congress on the global
security situation of course they deal
with Iran and they point out on quoting
US intelligence Iran's nuclear program
and its willingness to keep open the
possibility of developing nuclear
weapons
is a central part of its deterrent
strategy right it's part of Iran's
deterrence strategy no offensive
policies but they are trying to
construct a deterrent and that Iran has
a serious interest in a deterrence
strategy is not in doubt among serious
analysts it's recognized for example by
US intelligence so the influential
analyst CIA veteran Bruce Riedel who's
by no means a dove he writes that if I
was an Iranian national security planner
I would want nuclear weapons
as a deterrent and the reasons are
pretty obvious he also makes another
crucial comment he points out that
Israel's strategic room for manoeuvre in
the region would be constrained by an
Iranian nuclear deterrent and of course
also true of the United States room for
manoeuvre means resort to aggression and
violence and it's yes it would be
constrained by an Iranian deterrent for
the two rogue states that rampage freely
in the region the United States and
Israel any deterrent is of course
unacceptable
and for those who are accustomed and
take for granted their right to rule by
force that concern is easily escalated
to what's called an existential threat
the threat of deterrence is very severe
if you expect to resort to force
unilaterally at will to achieve your
goals as the US and secondarily Israel
do commonly and more recently the second
US ally Saudi Arabia has been trying to
get into the club pretty incompetently
with its invasion of Bahrain to prevent
mild reformist measures and the more
recently its extensive bombing of Yemen
which is causing a huge humanitarian
crisis so for them a deterrent is a
problem maybe even an extension threat
that I think is the heart of the matter
even if it wouldn't do to say or to
think and except for those who hope to
fend off possible disaster and to move
towards a more peaceful and just world
it's necessary to keep to these
injunctions these are things it wouldn't
do to say wouldn't do to think you don't
read about them you don't hear about
them but they are I think the heart of
the issue professor Noam Chomsky
speaking at the new school this weekend
after his talk professor Chomsky read
and answered questions from the audience
this is one of those questions what do
you think about the antics of Donald
Trump in tangent to your earlier idea
about American exceptionalism I think we
should recognize that the other
candidates are not that different I mean
if you take a look at just take a look
at their views
they've tell you their views and their
astonishing so just to keep the ran a
couple of weeks ago the two frontrunners
they're not the frontrunners any longer
where Jeb Bush and Scott Walker and they
differed on Iran Walker said we have to
bomb Iran when he gets elected they're
going to bomb Iran immediately the day
he's elected Bush was little you know
he's more serious he said it's going to
wait to the first cabinet meeting and
then the Obama run
I mean this is just off the spectrum of
not only international opinion but even
relative sanity this is I think Ornstein
and men are correct it's a radical
insurgency it's not a political party
you can tell that even by the votes I
mean any issue of any complexity is
going to have some diversity of opinion
but when you get a unanimous vote to
kill the Iranian deal or the Affordable
Care Act or whatever the next thing may
be you know you're not dealing with the
political party it's an interesting
question why that's true
I think what's actually happened is that
during the whole so-called neoliberal
period last generation both political
parties have drifted to the right
today's Democrats are what used to be
called moderate Republicans the
Republicans have just drifted off the
spectrum they're so committed to extreme
wealth and power that they cannot get
votes can't get votes by presenting
those positions so what has happened is
that they've mobilized sectors of the
population that have been around for a
long time it is a pretty exceptional
country in many ways one is it's
extremely religious it's one of the most
extreme fundamentalist countries in the
world and by now I suspect the majority
of the base of the Republican Party is
evangelical Christians extremists not
they're a mixture but these are the
extremist ones nativists who are afraid
that you know they are taking our white
anglo-saxon country away from us people
who have to have guns when they go into
Starbucks because who knows they might
be killed by an Islamic
terrorists and so on I mean all of that
is part of the country and it goes back
to colonial days they're real roots to
it but these have not been an organized
political force in the past they are now
that's the base of the Republican Party
and you see it in the primary so yeah
Trump is maybe comic relief but it's
just a it's it's not that different from
the mainstream which i think is more
important
