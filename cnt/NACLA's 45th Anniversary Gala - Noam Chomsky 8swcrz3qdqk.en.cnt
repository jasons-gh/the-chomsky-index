Thanks well I'm i have only a few
minutes and I'm not going to waste your
time by telling you what a pleasure it
is to be able to join you in this
celebration and also how grateful I am
to have received this award I can't
imagine a more welcome one from an
organization that for which I've had
more respect over many many years I
don't want to spend these minutes
bringing coal to Newcastle you all know
lots about Latin America and I won't try
to talk about it but there is one
comment that's so significant that it
just I wouldn't feel right if I didn't
at least bring it up and that's a
recognition of the quite remarkable
things that have happened in Latin
America just in the past decade so it's
long the days are long gone when us
leaders could proclaim triumphantly that
inaccurately that we are practically
sovereign on this continent and our law
holds without exception when we apply it
and in fact the days are long gone from
the time when nakhla was founded I'm
sure you all remember that necklace
founding was right at the in the opening
years of an incredible plague of
repression that spread over the
continent like nothing and it's horrible
history since the conquest the doors and
it
continued well into the 1990s since then
things have changed in fact things are
different from one of my visits to Latin
America to Brazil in about nineteen
ninety eight or so and I havin to be
able to spend a little time with lula
this before it was elected we traveled
around a bit and got to know him and I
asked him at one point his popularity
was very high on poles and I asked him
did he think he'd ever get elected
president he said no it's impossible he
said he understands the mentality of the
peasant and though they might prefer him
when they walk into the voting booth
they're going to ask themselves could
somebody like me ever run a country and
the answer will be no obviously not so I
can't vote for Loula because he's kind
of like me I have to vote for one of
those rich guys in you know Rio or
something that's long gone actually I
met happened to meet whom Allah before
before the election that he law right
after the election that he lost and I
asked him pretty much the same thing and
he gave me more or less the same answer
but in fact he's been elected and what's
there's been a change of consciousness
among the population of South America
and partly Central America which has
been pretty spectacular that's kind of a
wave that can't be beaten back we just
saw striking example of the of it just a
couple of weeks ago at the car to FINA
meetings of the hemisphere and Colombia
was the story was kind of blanked out of
the press here with a kind of marginal
and insignificant Secret Service scandal
but what happened was quite significant
there were the conference it was a
summit conference it couldn't come out
with a declaration because there wasn't
unanimity and the lack of unanimity
very striking there were two issues one
was admitting Cuba into the hemisphere
and there was unanimous agreement and
strong agreement with two exceptions
United States and Canada which blocked
it but I think probably for the last
time looking at the discourse I suspect
that next time if there's another
meeting that's not going to happen and
the other issue is the one you just
heard about so eloquently the drug war
over throughout Latin America there was
overwhelming pressure to decriminalize
to move towards decriminalizing drugs
decriminalization is not legalization it
means treating drug users right
individuals as an administrative issue
the way it's done in most of Europe not
as a criminal issue to objections united
states and canada and that's how the
conference ended so our law is not Fiat
on the continent as it was a century ago
or half a century ago in fact the United
States and Canada are being excluded and
in fact that's even happening officially
there was a sub sure you know there was
a new organization formed about a year
ago in Caracas salek which included
every country of Latin America of the
hemisphere with the exception of the
United States and Canada that's if it
begins to function which it may that
could be very significant development in
fact probably could replace and maybe
we'll replace and the Organization of
American States dominated by the US
these are extremely significant
developments there's of course quite a
long way to go you've just heard a
description of how long the way how long
the path is in Mexico but in fact it's
true everywhere I just instead of trying
to review it I'll just
give some personal reminiscences to very
much in my mind the last trip I took to
South America was about a year ago it
was to southern Colombia where I've been
several times thanks talking all day as
you sure southern Colombia kalka you
know Colombia I was going with some
friends human rights activists that we
were taken by the Ombudsman of Calca to
we were going to very remote endangered
villages young hours off the
pan-american highway on a virtually
impassable Road scattered villages
they're engaged in the idea trip was
actually delayed for about six months it
was supposed to be earlier but we
couldn't go because there's too much
violence in the region but it had calmed
down temporarily so he could make it as
you drive toward the village that we
were aiming towards stopped at a few
others means something I guess if
there's a little clearing in the road
where if you look at it there's a row of
wooden crosses that's from where
paramilitaries had stopped the bus
murdered everybody went on a little bit
finally got to the village very kind of
delight poor but rather delightful place
they're engaged in a major struggle they
it was big meeting of the villager they
were talking about it struggles against
mining and privatization of water the
the mining companies nor in Colombia but
all over the world India everywhere are
destroying indigenous communities in
horrifying ways and they're targeted are
trying to work out ways to
defend themselves against mine the other
thing is privatization of water the
Colombian government learned a lesson
from the Bolivian effort where the
attempt to privatize water for the
country was not a beaten back by popular
resistance but the popular is instead of
a revolt which overthrew the government
that led to the first authentic
indigenous government in South America
and they didn't want to face that so
what they're doing is trying to pick
places off bit by bit now see if you go
after you know remote village get them
to privatize water privatization of
water is you know may look good in some
academic seminar but it means that
people can't go don't count out water
they can't afford it one of the ways in
which they were trying to do this and
this is why I was personally going is
that they actually dedicated a forest up
in the mountain above the village to my
late wife and we went there to
commemorate that and I won't talk about
a very moving experience but the
kindness and compassion and warmth of
these simple people you need to have to
get coffee or back here you need a poet
to describe I can't describe that's I
had men in that region before that's why
they were doing it last time previous
time I went same given right act
activists we were trying to collect
testimonies from people who had been
subjected to a chemical warfare it's
called her fumigation it's under the
pretext of the drug war drug wars a
total fraud as I'm sure you know but the
part of the pretext of it is is carrying
out chemical warfare in large parts of
the country a chemical work we couldn't
get out we could get as far as the
central town puppy on the activists
would let us go any further was too
violent in the countryside but peasants
came in compa sinos
indigenous people Afro Americans just
simply to give hours of testimony and
with bed photographs films children with
horrible sores and their arms a lot of
the chemical warfare is not fun and it
destroys everything I mean theoretically
it's aiming for coca but kills
everything else too so the peasants are
driven out of the way there they can't
they can no longer the coffee farming is
a they are coffee farmers is a pretty
tricky business it's hard to get into it
to survive on it but they had managed to
work themselves out a niche market in
Europe where they were selling organic
coffee and doing reasonably well that's
over that once the ground is destroyed
by chemical warfare no more organic
coffee groin so that's finished their
crops are all gone because they were
destroyed the people are ill and
children are dying and so on and they
end up being driven into the urban slums
Colombia has the maybe the
second-largest displaced person
population in the world this is very
efficient we say here that the drug work
has failed but that's a very misleading
term a lot of things it may be failing
and it's announced objectives but then
you have to ask yourself why does a
policy go on for 40 years that's failing
miserably and it's announced objectives
and doesn't change and also is pursuing
policies that are known to not to work
there's government studies other studies
that show pretty conclusively that if
you want to reduce substance abuse by
far the most efficient way is a
prevention and treatment in fact we have
evidence of that right before our eyes
the worst killer by far is tobacco I
mean just
dwarfs all other substances and tobacco
use has not been criminalized in the
United States but it's become a class
issue so if you go to a college campus
you do see people smoking but they're
either foreigners or staff if you go to
the local McDonald's nearby kids are
carrying cigarettes but not young
educated people no criminalization just
change in lifestyle which reduced
tobacco use raw meat coffee and all kind
of other things that aren't very good
for you that's prevention and treatment
are quite efficient police coercive
activities police work is has very
little impact it is very expensive out
of country operations like say Colombia
are the most expensive and the least
efficient now they haven't had any
effect non-availability of drugs and if
for 40 years policies are being followed
that are known not to work and that in
fact fail and the announced objective a
rational person asks themselves you know
what are the what's in the planners
minds are they lunatics or is there
something else well they're not lunatics
and if you want to figure out of the
likely intention there's a legal
principle that you can pretty well rely
on and that is that predictable
consequences are fairly good indication
of intent particularly under
circumstances like this where the
announced goals are always failing the
methods used are those that are known to
be the worst possible but yet they're
pursued so we ask ourselves well what
are the predictable consequences they
are
understandable so in Colombia for
example the predictable consequences are
to open up a vast areas to mining mono
crop agribusiness big ranches and so on
all very fine for the rich folk in
Bogota and the International the
corporation's it happens at the peasants
are beaten present population is being
kind of decimated but you know who cares
about them but what about domestically
in the United States well there's also a
predictable consequence and we see it in
front of our eyes it's redoing what was
done in the United States in the 1870s
take a look back at the American history
slaves of course you know weren't human
until the Civil War the 14th amendment
gave them formal freedom lasted about 10
years then there was a north-south
compact which authorized the south to
essentially do what they like and what
they did was reinstate the population in
a very efficient way criminalizing the
black life was criminalized in many ways
and pretty soon you had most of the
black male population in jail turned out
to be a very efficient workforce if you
have slaves that's capital you have to
keep them alive you know they care of
them and so on if the state provides
slaves you don't have to be anything and
yet they don't strike you know they
don't ask for higher wages perfect
workforce and that's a large part of the
American industrial revolution a lot of
it's based on mining US Steel others of
manufacturing in the south the part
that's familiar is the chain gangs you
know went back to agricultural labor
this lesson pretty much until the Second
World War free labor was needed in the
for war industry then came a couple of
decades two decades in fact a very high
growth and growth and manufacturing
their job
for black black man you get a job in an
auto factory buy a house in the skid to
college and so on that ended in the
1970s with the sharp change in the
economy towards financialization
offshoring of production well all of a
sudden you got a big supercilious
population on your hands well if we were
an uncivilized country like say Columbia
you would carry out what they call
social cleansing psso see all you know
murderer but we're a civilized country
so we throw him in jail and in fact the
exactly what's happened they take a look
at the incarceration rate since around
late set 1980 shot up to the
stratosphere has nothing to do with
crime it's primarily targets the black
males Hispanic males and others a class
race correlation in the United States
helps account for that Plus straight
racism and it's that pre texts the drug
war so it's having a good effect
actually it even has a good effect in
Mexico there's a last time I was in
Mexico la jornada you know great
greatest newspaper in the atmosphere had
an article reporting an academic study
that showed that eighty percent of
Mexican businesses are involved in narco
trafficking then they make plenty of
money so two American banks that's how
the money gets laundered actually about
15 years ago and there was a lot of
enthusiasm about emerging markets and
how wonderful they are you able to
invest in them that's not a curiosity I
for a couple of years I read the regular
quarterly reports of the Department of
Commerce they publish every quarter you
know detailed reports of every kind of
economic data that you can think of and
part of it is what's called foreign
direct investment in the Western
Hemisphere and in fact foreign direct
investments shot way up just like that
propaganda
but if you look at where went it was
kind of interesting about a quarter of
it went to Bermuda about fifteen percent
went to the British the islands cayman
islands and about ten percent went to
Panama that's fifty percent and none of
it is going to build steel mills they
didn't say what it was for but you can
bet that a lot of it was going into
money laundering no money comes into
American banks send it out to someplace
end up getting rich so I don't think
it's fair to say that the drug wars a
failure the policies that are pursued
consistently for a long time when it's
known that they're not going to reach
their intended objectives usually have a
purpose and this purpose i think is not
difficult well it's a couple more the
first things have it despite the fact
that there's plenty of problems there
things definitely have improved i'll
just give you a couple of other examples
well one example this morning yesterday
the part that got the colombian
parliament had a bill introduced calling
for the legalization of all agricultural
production that means poppy and coca
probably won't pass but it's a step
significant step things like that are
happening elsewhere in Bolivia for
example where there's a peasant who's a
president there was a coca farmer and he
did say at one point that he would pay
some attention to us demands to fumigate
carry out chemical warfare in Bolivia to
destroy coca if the United States would
agree to have chemical warfare and
tobacco and killing tobacco in North
Carolina and Kentucky is obviously a
much more
a far more lethal drug overwhelmingly
more lethal well that kind of mood is
spreading around Latin America and I
think it's going to be hard for the US
government to continue to withstand
pursue a lonely course particularly if
the American population can overcome its
two major problems with javi appointed
to the problem for Latin America with
drugs is here of course it's demand
everybody knows that it's also supply
the Bureau of what are they called if
this Federal Bureau of arms arms tobacco
something whatever they are they came
out with a report a couple of weeks ago
in which they just analyzed the weapons
that are turned over to them in Mexico
with a u.s. Mexico exchange turns out
about seventy percent of them come from
the United States now they're not arms
that are they also pointed out that the
character has changed over the years
like five or six years ago they were
pistols and now there are you know fancy
assault rifles and so on if you go into
a store in Arizona and Texas you see how
it happens you can go up and pick up an
assault rifle and hand it over to the
cartel representative your vile happily
pay for it and take it across the border
you know everything's monitored coming
this way but not doing that way so we
supply the guns we supply the demand
they suffer and people here suffer the
poor and deprived people here that's
basically the drug war well things have
changed so for example i was in chile 19
a couple of years after the fall of the
dictatorship but
it was gone you know it's technically a
free democratic country I happen to be
in concepts young you know visiting the
University and one evening I was walking
through the university with some friends
there and we haven't noticed that it was
a big building on campus that was empty
do look like a new building nobody in it
I asked what's the problem they said
well the army won't let this is a dorm
and the army refused to let the students
on campus and what was interesting is
that nobody thought of challenging it
you don't challenge it if the army says
you're not going to have students at
campus they had lived through an
experience which I lifted detailed to
you what they call the first 911 much
worse than our 911 they'd suffered
through it for many years i noticed when
i was talking to journalists if they saw
a soldier in everybody they'd shut up
you know well that was this 1996 I was
there three years ago its client
problems but it's quite different that's
gone it could be I was taken through the
villa core maldive with the worst of
finishes torture chambers taken by one
and survivors the very few survivors to
provide step-by-step showed each kind of
torture they carried out at each stage
now they can show it to you they have a
rose garden commemorating victims
however I asked him he told me that it
each each stage the torture was
supervised by physicians to make sure
that people didn't die because he had to
get them to the next stage of torture
and I asked it will wear the physicians
he said are there practicing medicine in
Santiago well if that surprises us well
if do is look here and there were
doctors and psychologists and Guantanamo
supervising the torture what are they
doing they're practicing here back to
their professions there's a long way to
go but one one of the hell end by just
mentioning
greg is around here somewhere one of the
things that I learned from greg's worked
was about the itch I didn't know was
about the quite significant
contributions of Latin American legal
scholars and intellectuals to the new
deal to New Deal legislation and later
on to Universal Declaration of Human
Rights well it's an important lesson
from Latin America today there's another
lesson the US has been involved in what
Bill bloomed correctly called killing
hope for a long time but who are an
impoverished and request people in
latinum all over Latin America are now
providing a different lesson they're
inspiring hope and that's one that kept
us to take it up and to carry it forward
in the way that neuqua has been doing
very successfully for 45 years of
achievement
so we would also like to present a gnome
with this print from a little real
you
