please welcome co-president of students
for justice in Palestine I wonder if you
can share some more of your thoughts and
ideas and takes about what's going on
right now in Israel she's also
application of the ocean occupation
right now in the news there is the case
of Japan that the government and export
Palestinian neighborhood in order to
field right now it's a synagogue for the
Jewish community other Jewish neighbor
memories maybe share with the
Palestinians thank you yeah actually
that's quite important another topic
that's good since what specifically you
have to patient and talk about it but
it's what's happening in Israel now it's
very dangerous I think there's a very
sharp drift to the ultra-nationalist
extremists right and in fact to go back
to South Africa that's pretty much what
happened there when you get through into
the 1970s and into the 1980s as you know
the international opposition became
stronger and increased and became
implemented in sanctions and boycotts
and so on South Africans reacted I mean
they varied of course there were some
struggle
support but the large majority and the
government reacted by just becoming more
repressive violent circling the wagons
say okay the world doesn't understand us
the world's against us we're perfect
nobody understands this so what has
become a harsher and more brutal and and
they just almost in your face like there
was a contact group hunter Carter that
was trying to arrange something about
Namibia South African Terrence I thought
were held the territory in other word
court the United Nations and argued they
totally illegal to have to give it up
South Africa wanted it a big port there
were White's living there right at the
point where the contact group was Europe
basically the united states with couple
of European allies just as they were
meeting to try to achieve a settlement
South Africa picked that moment to carry
out a murderous attack on an Angolan
refugee camp in kasanga the killing six
hundred people it's kind of thing that
Israel's doing just saying well okay you
don't like us will show you will be
tough and brew and internally the the
rules became more brutal to and Israel
is reacting very much the same way I
mean there first of all they're moving
towards an extreme form of their
rationality I mean it's long shot like
the the treatment of the Turkish
ambassador you know their one Ally just
purposely insulting and humility
it just doesn't happen and diplomatic
circles Lieberman foreign ministers do
the same thing to the Prime Minister's
of France and Spain foam you know get
lost in a very ugly terms that in funny
I was just doing the same right now to
Obama promised happens in minor ways to
but I was a minor example myself in May
I was invited to talk two beers a
Palestinian University my friends and I
decided to go in through home on because
if you get turned back at nobody who's
Jewish ever get started that but thought
there's a possibility so because of
what's happening in Israel you get
turned back from that the Allenby bridge
just have to go back to a Mon you get
turned back at Ben Gurion Airport got to
come back to the United States we were
going on to a bit rude so we went in and
the Minister of Interior wouldn't allow
him in they wouldn't be when there was
an international protest AIDS a minor
incident but it's again shooting
themselves in the foot if they allow me
to go two beers eight to give a talk as
it done many times before nobody would
even known okay but this way
international press protests so on but
they then tried to lie their way out of
it and say that it was a word official
didn't know he was doing but that was
totally untrue the Ministry of Interior
the whole way and what they were said
about was interesting you can see from
the questions that a couple of hours my
daughter
Tara gation it was basically one
question how come you're going to
lecture at a Palestinian University and
you're not going to Israel if I said
okay I'll go to Israel and talk it no
tel Aviv University that would have been
fine but the idea that a Palestinian
university could invite somebody to
speak actually on American foreign
policy that had nothing to do with this
repellents not the idea that they could
do that was intolerable and that's again
just minor example of irrationality the
mavi marmara you know the attack on a
ship Turkish ship in international
waters of murdering people that's much
more serious and but they're acting kind
of the way south africa and internally
as well as in the example you mentioned
but also in a series of laws that are
coming through if you want to have a
look at them there's a small article by
Nev Gordon an Israeli professor ben
gurion in the London Review of Books I
think maybe the last issue in which it
just runs through some of the laws that
are being considered and already passed
the cabinet and will be implemented in
Israel and they're they're really pretty
ugly one of them which i think is just
about to be implemented requires that
non Jewish immigrants have to declare
loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state ok
that's like as if Gordon points out it's
like somebody immigrant to England being
compelled to declare a loyalty to the
Anglican Church you know the civilized
countries don't do that they say non
Jewish immigrants for a reason a lot of
the Jewish immigrants won't do it
Orthodox Jews for example will not agree
to that
you've got to make it a racist
distinction there's another there's
another law coming along which would
actually criminalize statements to the
effect that Israel's not a Jewish state
that's pretty extreme you know it's like
in England you know Louis thing you have
to it's a criminal act not to say it's
an Anglican state an angling churches
the official church yeah serious like
that one of them which is really
important and isn't discussed much has
to do with the land laws of the most
racist laws in israel since 48 have been
the landlords there's a conflict i wrote
about it years ago you can look it up
but what it comes down to is that over
ninety percent of the land was placed
under the authority of the
organization's charity Emmett Jewish
National Fund which has a charter with
the State of Israel in which it stated
that they can act only for the benefit
of people of Jewish race religion or
origin ok that's the wording you pay for
that all of you because it's tax-free
that has tax-free status in the United
States so when you pay your taxes you're
paying for an organization that controls
over ninety percent of the land in
Israel through various arrangements and
must act for people of the benefit of
people Jewish race religion and art that
not many countries could get away with
this and maybe none well that was
finally overcome in the year there are
some civil rights groups in Israel in
the year 2000 they brought a case to the
High Court a case involved an Arab
couple that
little class couple who wanted to buy a
home in a Jewish town and that went you
know through the courts finally reached
the High Court Supreme Court and they
ruled against it which is quite
important that formally overturned the
land laws but then followed something
which we were all very familiar with in
the United States a series of measures
to try to get around it so in fact one
of them is now a 4 put the law hasn't
really been implemented but it's on
books now there's a proposal in the
Knesset to allow a community to refuse
admission to any family that that isn't
congenial to the community you know or
that doesn't as a culture different from
that of the community in other words our
Palestinian citizens not unfamiliar in
the United States is gone through it
myself but ugly you know and there are
other proposals like that coming along
israel's just becoming a very ugly
country in many ways which was not true
before and I think the South African
analogy is pretty appropriate that's
what happened
even once it happened to the dedications
of types as example times different
squares in revoir after partners and
others like that going on what is your
opinion of the colonization of the
conflict the weather add or detract to
house beacause and legitimacy so how
does it help or detract from the
Palestinian cause and its legitimacy
personally I think that that's harmful
everywhere it's harmful all over the
world there is a rise of sort of
religious fundamentalism in many parts
of the world including the United States
and I think it's extremely harmful you
can understand it I think of reasons for
it but whether it's Islam or
Christianity as it is here or Hinduism
as it is in India it's pretty ugly and
has it is very harmful to the
Palestinian cause and so that's not
something foreign to us we should bear
in mind that part of the reason for this
kind of outlandish us support for
Israeli crimes is Christian Zionists
Christian Zionism long precedes Jewish
scientists as well back into the 19th
century and in a country like the United
the United States is kind of off the
spectrum and religious extremism the
Western world I mean about a third of
the population in the United States
believes in the literal word by word
truth of the Bible and the Bible says
you know God promised the land to the
Jews
so therefore anything they do is right
and we go to support it that was a sort
of a passive phenomenon in the United
States until the last 20 or 30 years
when party managers recognized that they
could mobilize this force as a force
against everything that they don't like
you know the civil rights human rights
and in this case in favor of support for
Israel in fact Israel has special dealt
a special kind of mission even special
newspapers to appeal to the
fundamentalist evangelical community
which is substantial I should add that
they are the most anti-semitic people in
the world in history in fact if you
literally take a look at the end times
literature you know which has been
developing since in parallel with thee
with the establishment of Israel really
took off in 48 that was taken to be okay
the sign God is telling us you know Jews
are going back to Palestine in 1967
another big shot in the arm this appeals
to a large part of the population huge
in fact their line is that they want to
see a conflict a battle between the Jews
and the Arabs or the Iranians of the
Russians or anybody anybody which will
end up in Armageddon which they all
slaughter each other and the souls who
are saved rise to heaven
comes and you have a thousand years of
peace and so on and so forth actually
for some reason I don't know why 144,000
Jews get saved don't ask me why but the
restaurant the rest get exterminated and
go to eternal damnation I mean even
Hitler didn't go that for but that's the
group that's the strongest support for
Israel in the United States and is being
mobilized by Israel and the and by
political leaders and so on so that's
one manifestation of this and when it
happens in say with Hamas and the Gaza
or to an extent in the West Bank it's
equally young snot doesn't have that
power but it's the same dangerous kind
of phenomena it's happening in many
places and it's quite dangerous I think
you're right to bring it up
