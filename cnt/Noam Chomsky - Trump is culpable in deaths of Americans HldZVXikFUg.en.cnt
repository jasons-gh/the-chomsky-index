so they take the United States it's over
just to illustrate and president Trump's
the budget proposal for next year
came out in February and I made his
raging drunk of course is denied so
that's just food but it's raging visibly
in the United States thousands of people
dying comes out with a separate tense of
the budget the calls for reducing
expenditures in some areas increasing
them and others reducing expenditures in
anything health related so reduce
expenditures for the center of Disease
Control that's something that promise
been doing every year that is term
cutting it back morning so let's
continue to cut it back let's continue
to make sure that the population is as
vulnerable who can make it will suffer
as much as possible but will sports
increase profits for his primary
constituency wealth to one hand you hold
up a banner that says why don't you I'm
just a few trust me do everything for
you but the other hand you stab them in
the back that's every part of the
legislative programs it's a great
strategy for killing a lot of people and
improving his electoral politics it
sounds as though you you kind of
categorize him as culpable in in the
depths of people the corona virus
pandemic
yes but it's much worse than that much
worse because the same is true
internationally to try to cover up his
criminal attacks against the American
people
we've been going on all this time he's
flailing about to try to find scape
goods one scapegoat he hit on is the
World Health Organization how do how do
you punish the World Health Organization
deep and then make it clear that you
want to destroy them eliminate the World
Health Organization also destroy
programs that are working to protect
them
Americans so there were serious programs
government-sponsored programs working
around the world particularly in China
to try to identify the coronaviruses
cancel those programs to make sure that
Americans are as vulnerable as possible
for whatever happens because that can
improve your electoral standing with the
mobs you trying to organize I'm as
shocked a--the say mainly crime all in
order to improve his electoral prospects
