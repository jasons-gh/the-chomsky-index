peace in the world then mean anything
till you tell me how you go from here to
there and I've only heard one proposal
that you have moved to the international
consensus which essentially everybody
accepts outside the United States and
Israel and once that's established my
guess is that the people themselves will
see that it doesn't make any sense
anyone who's traveled in that region or
lived there and knows that there's
simply no sensible way to draw a line
through sis Jordan that makes any sense
at all you know so I assume that what
would happen is the cycle of violence
would reduce relations would begin
normal in normal ways to be established
commercial cultural others fact it
already it happening you know across the
border with Jordan and when that
continues at some point there will be a
recognition that should move towards
something like maybe federalism and from
federalism you can move on to something
closer if the two sides see that there's
a better way to live and in the longer
term I feeling is the people in that
whole region given if they're not if
they're not blocked by imperial power
will move towards something like kind of
an ottoman system now nobody wants the
Ottoman Empire back no its brutality and
corruption and everything else but they
had the right idea about something they
left people alone it partly because they
were too corrupt to do anything about it
but they left people alone so you know
you go to Beirut through Jerusalem
whoever it is that the Armenians run
their affairs and Greeks run there
and Jews run their affairs there weren't
many of them and they sort of interact
it was kind of a pretty friend you could
travel from Cairo to Baghdad to
Constantinople that I were crossing a
border and there were plenty of
connections and for that region I think
that makes a lot of sense I think it
makes a lot of sense for almost every
region but that's another story it and I
think maybe it could move on to that I
mean if there's some other plan I'd like
to hear it but the only other thing I
hear is slogans over here mr. Chomsky in
2007 at Camp David and I'm sorry in 2000
at Camp David under Clinton's direction
a hoot Barack offered 97% the West Bank
and one hundred percent of the Gaza
Strip and Arafat turned his head and
walked away from the negotiations what
ensued was the second intifada and years
of Hamas and Palestinian terrorism
target against Israel how can you
Felicia sleek clean that it was Barack
that walked away from the negotiations
when it was in fact Yasser Arafat who
turned around you're talking about that
you're talking about the Camp David
agreements in two thousand yes yes yep
we really don't have to discuss that
because Clinton himself recognized that
they made no sense in fact a couple of
months and then
yeah I mean you can look it up if you
want but what I said you can easily is
easily document it's all in print the
Camp David negotiations were in summer
the standard tail here is what you
repeat you said but a couple of months
later Clinton recognized that no
Palestinian no Arabs ever go to accept
the terms that he and Barack tried to
impose he recognized they made no sense
he presented his parameters in December
and just as I say addy gave a speech in
which he said both sides have accepted
them they have reservations they'll meet
to work out their reservations then
followed what I described so there's no
need to discuss it you know there really
isn't I mean there is an official story
it's true but like a lot of official
stories it falls apart very quickly as
soon as you look at the fact
over here maybe I don't know enough
about the relationship between the
United States and Israel but why in your
opinion why do you think the US has been
allowing Israel too quick to allow these
war crimes and to become you know just
to be almost voiceless about what's
going on even though they're very much
aware that terrible things are happening
and there's so much injustice currently
nice so why does the u.s. support his
criminal actions and the West Bank and
Gaza and so on well I mean part of the
reason is pretty simple Israeli Jews or
people Palestinians are unpeopled and
you treat people and unpeopled quit
differently but then there are serious
reasons to Israel offers a lot to the
United States the Palestine offers them
nothing Palestinians have no force they
have no wealth they don't have powerful
support so there's none of any human
rights oh it's a elementary principle of
state graph Israel on the other hand is
a rich advanced technologically advanced
highly militarized society it provides
it has very close strategic and
intelligence relations with the US in
fact we look back at the history
us-israeli relations were established in
their current form in 1967 and something
happened in 1967 there was you know we
know that there was an Israeli Arab war
but there was more than that at that
time there was a war going on between
Saudi Arabia and Egypt that was an
actual war was fought
mostly proxy war boo was real and what
lay behind it was a serious conflict
between secular nationalism based in
Egypt and extremist religious
fundamentalism based in Saudi Arabia and
the US and the UK have pretty
consistently supported extremist
fundamentalism and still do in fact and
opposed secular nationalism and there's
good reasons for that secular
nationalism threatens whether we'll do
it or not to take over the resources of
the region and use them for the benefit
of its people the religious extremist
fundamentalism though work for whoever
will you let them play their games and
get wealthy so there's it's only very
good historical work on this for both
Britain in the United States if you want
the documentation but it's pretty
consistent and it continues today well
this conflict was going on and Israel
succeeded in destroying the center of
Arab secular nationalism which was in
Egypt and that was a great gift to the
United States and to Saudi Arabia its
main ally and you know they were
impressed actually the long history but
that made a change and that's when the
relations were established in their
current form and then it continued so in
1970 for example the Jordan there was a
Palestinian uprising in Jordan and it
looked for a while as if Syria might
intervene to prevent the Palestinians
from being massacred the United States
didn't like that at the time the United
States was so bogged down in Southeast
Asia that it couldn't possibly do
anything so it called on israel israel
mobilized you know has very powerful
military force erie back down
and that was considered another gift to
Saudi Arabia they were concerned that
the Saudi Arabia might be threatened by
a national stop rising and Jordans a lot
of conflict between the two and at that
time the Nixon Doctrine was established
was called the Nixon Doctrine was that
of course the main concern in the Middle
East is the energy reserves that goes
way back to the second world war in
before the main concern is the energy
reserves mostly in Saudi Arabia safely
under the control of Islamic religious
extremists who do what we like and we
got to keep it that way but then
somebody has to protect the dictators
who we support from their own
populations and so there have to be what
the next administration called cops on
the beat the local Jean garms preferably
non-arab because they do a better job
killing Arabs and then police
headquarters of course is in Washington
and branch office in London so that's
the basic structure and at that at the
time the cops on the beat were Iran
non-arab under the Shah who was loyal
ally and a dictator Pakistan which
provided the Saudi royal guard and so on
a lot of still do a lot of Pakistani
mercenaries working in Saudi Arabia
Turkey you know non-arab big military
force and now Israel was added to it so
Israel is another cop on the beat not a
very useful one and it sort of continues
like this I go through the record if you
like but there continue to be very close
the military and intelligence relations
the United States uses Israel to
reposition weapons Israel can in fact
carry out experiments with
advanced weapons on live targets which
is useful you know try out your new
weapons that way and all sorts of a hole
and also Israel I mean by the 1980s it
was becoming Congress was imposing
constraints on support for our most
vicious clients so you needed surrogates
who would move in and do it taiwan
israel you know British intelligence
contractors and others but Israel played
a big role in that kind of secondary
services so that's one category another
category is strict economic Israel US
investment in Israel high-tech industry
is increasing pretty quickly and it's
considered through a close relationship
I'm para is a highly militarized
high-tech economy in fact if you look at
one of the interesting WikiLeaks
exposures listed vital regions of the
world which are high strategic
importance to the United States must be
protected at all odds there weren't a
lot of them that one of them was right
near Haifa Raphael military industries
and one of the places where they
developed drones other high-tech weapons
and that's considered just part of the
United States in fact the Raphael's big
military industry actually moved their
management to Washington because they're
closer to the Pentagon and the funders
and so on a very close integration Intel
which is the biggest chip company in the
world they have a new generation of
computer of chips coming along which
they think I'll sweep the market they're
building their main Factory in Israel
and a lot of other connections like that
and that's an edge on the other hand
again the Palestinians offer absolutely
nothing you know there are other factors
which I think are probably
underestimated cultural factors there's
a is a structure in the world that's
political scientist sometimes called the
Anglos
England and it's offshoots offshoots are
the United States Canada Australia New
Zealand the Anglosphere is somewhat
unusual in the history of imperialism in
the anglosphere the English settlers
exterminated the native population and
replaced them it's not the usual course
of imperialism and that's deeply
embedded in the culture of the
anglosphere know we did it so it's got
to be right and the Jews are doing it so
it's got to be right and if you look at
international diplomacy about the only
countries that big countries that
sometimes go along with the United
States I mean the Marshall Islands dudes
on but real countries are Australia and
increasingly Canada they I think just
sense a kind of commonality and this is
reinforced by something else the
Anglosphere is unusually religious I
mean deeply religious that it's a
fundamental these are fundamentalist
societies particularly the United States
the United States one most extreme
fundamentalist societies in the world I
mean about a third of the population it
believes in the literal truth of the
Bible I doubt that there's another
country in the world it comes close to
that about half the population thinks
the world is created a couple thousand
years ago that's what's you know says in
their interpretation of the Bible about
two-thirds of the populations expecting
the second coming some of them like Rick
Perry expected in our lifetime these are
extremely unusual things well and in
fact it's not you know we think about it
sometimes as you know uneducated people
in rural Texas it's not it's the elites
Lord balford Christian Zionism and
angland long preceded Jewish Zionism and
it was they elites you know Lord Balfour
Lloyd George these guys in the United
States
when general Allenby conquered Jerusalem
during the First World War you take a
look at the headlines in the national
press Richard the lion-hearted defeated
salad and we won the Crusades literally
he saved the jerusalem from the patent
well the Bible says something else the
next thing that has to happen is Jews
have to go back to Israel in the evenin
the Roosevelt administration harold
ickes major person said that the return
of the Jews to Palestine is the most
important event in human history and if
you're a bible reading fanatic you could
believe that and this permeates large
parts of American culture from the
elites down to evangelicals when you get
to people like say Bush number two you
know evangelical extremists and others
well it takes out a different form but
that's real and that I think reinforces
the general sense that there's got to be
something right about the Jews kicking
out the Palestinians because it's pretty
much what we did and in fact if you look
back over the history the analogy of
Jews and Palestine to the United States
and Red Indians runs all the way through
you find it all over the place I don't
know how much weight to put on these
factors but I think they're significant
cultural factors along with a very clear
strategic intelligence military economic
factors it could be changed I mean if
significant parts of the real us power
system decided to shift it would shift
and incidentally there are signs of that
interesting signs of it if you read
closely stuff that's coming out and you
know for military leaders until high
intelligence official
even the Centers of strategic planning
like the CSIs Center for Strategic and
International Strategy one of these you
know conservative think tanks conserved
military they're beginning to raise
questions about whether the strategic
analysis the strategic alliance with
Israel really make sense at this point
I'm sure you saw a statement by General
Petraeus ahead of the Strategic Command
mastering of Central Command for the
region he a couple of years ago said
that Israel's intransigence is harming
our brave boys and girls fighting out in
the fields he was immediately shut up
but he was expressing a view that is
expressed by others if that ever broke
through I think you would see a wave of
anti-semitism in the united states that
would be fierce you know these jews are
harming our brave boys and girls and not
going to accept that and it might shift
American policy radically it wouldn't be
very pretty and I don't want to see it
change that way but it could happen
other things could happen too but but if
you just consider the balance of force
and power and wealth between Israel and
the Palestinians what's happening kind
of almost follows like a theorem over
here thank you hello
is this fine okay how has the language
surrounding on people's evolved since
the genesis of the State of Israel to
contemporary times and how can the
Palestinians distinguish themselves as
peoples well the actual term is more
recent it's far as I know not before
Mark Curtis who used it a couple of
years ago and his books on the British
imperial crimes but it's the concept is
there you know then it goes way back and
that's the way we treat the native
population here no they're on people you
kill them exterminate them break
treaties steal their land the
african-american populations kind of
obvious in fact the Constitution says
they're three-fifths human our own
people as I mentioned the Fourteenth
Amendment supposed to remedy that in
civil war but it really didn't just for
a couple of years and I went right back
to the same thing with criminalization
and so on and we're right in the middle
of it now and the cut it's just a
standard Imperial concept actually is a
pretty interesting history if you look
at the I don't know if we should go into
this but if you look at the intellectual
history it's kind of interesting in the
17th century in England and France but
main imperial powers there was a lot of
concern they were there discovering lots
of new creatures you know expanding
beyond Europe and you get these blacks
orangutang a lot of others and there's a
lot of discussion about which ones are
people and should have rights and which
ones aren't people and especially if you
were Cartesian I was pretty crucial
because there's ashfur Cartesian is a
sharp distinction between creatures who
have a soul and those who don't the ones
who have a soul or people
don't are not people they're machines in
fact a long story behind this a lot of
debates and they were kind of a you know
trying to make figure out who's they
kind of looked the same they're not
European so how do we decide that's a
very interesting discussions a lot of it
had to do with one of my favorite
arguments was by the Weaver seen the son
of the dramatist he concluded that apes
are actually smarter than us and the
proof is they don't use language and the
reason behind it is that they understand
that if they use language we would
enslave them like we enslave the blacks
maybe you could add that to the
literature on teaching Apes language
they're smart enough not to do it but
but it was a serious issue right through
the early days of imperialism and then
it kind of goes on you know over here
professor Chomsky what are your thoughts
about the recent diplomatic tension
between Israel and Turkey about the
marmara event and the UN report and
turkeys role in the region regarding the
peace process
between Turkey and Israel the recent
events well Turkey and Israel have been
very close allies since nineteen
fifty-eight it was kind of secret at the
time you know none but not discussed but
in 1958 had been ben-gurion and made no
agreements with Turkey and they've been
very close allies since the continued
right through the Nixon Doctrine period
military relations economic relations it
they couldn't have much in the way of
the public diplomatic relations because
you know I have to look it didn't fit
with the image but they continued in
fact it was Israel's only regional ally
and an important one well last couple of
years that's in fact decline Prime
Minister Aragon has taken pretty strong
stands against Israeli crimes during the
Gaza attack he was about the only
Western sort of quasi Western if you
like leader who actually came out very
strongly denouncing the crimes the West
mostly except in them then came the mavi
marmara incident where Israel attacked
ship in international waters it's called
hide it's called hijacking when Somalis
do it and it happened to be a Turkish
ship mean primarily not technically was
essentially a Turkish ship they attacked
the ship in international waters and
killed nine turks one of the American
citizen and Turkey didn't like that and
that made relations much worse Israel
was quite surprised by this reaction and
with good reason I mean Israel have been
hijacking ships and international waters
for
kids and it goes back to the 70s you
know the ship's going between cypress
and Lebanon Israel would attack them you
know the capture kill people kidnap
people bring them to prisons in Israel
and nobody ever made a fuss about it
because the US was saying you know fine
and they didn't quite understand why all
of a sudden it's an issue but it did
become an issue and it's now going
beyond I'm in practically whether Israel
has reacted in it Israel is going way to
the right you have to understand I'm it
was at ten years ago I think they would
have smoothed it over but Israel went
way out of its way to make the relations
worse so the foreign minister in Israel
foreign minister Donnie il on sub Ford
what is he he was foreign minister yeah
he called in that he was a deputy
foreign minister yeah he called in the
Turkish ambassador and set up a kind of
a televised scene in which he was
sitting on a high chair and the Turkish
ambassador sitting on a low stool and it
was all televised and he's kind of
lecturing him you know that's just not
done and diplomatic relations and a
turkey didn't like it a bit you know
that they're things going on like that
and it's gotten pretty tensed by now I
mean turkey has stated that their kind
of they'll do it but they'll send naval
vessels to a company ships trying to
break the Gaza siege like the flotilla
if that happened I know what would
happen and we go to war just recently
there was an announcement on if it's
true that Israeli planes were scrambling
in Israeli in Turkish airspace
to harass is Turkish vessels that are
exploring for natural gas that's a big
conflict brewing all through the recent
region you know there's been a lot of
natural gas discoveries and that whole
region and everybody wants a piece of
them and a lot of conflicts and one of
them is Turkey and Israel Turkey
complained about it I don't know if it's
true it was just reported on the on the
press but if that kind of thing goes on
there could be serious conflict thank
you over here hi professor Chomsky just
want to thank you for doing what you do
and considering the global protesting
going on especially this past Saturday
and even in in New York City do you
think a people's movement can start in
Israel to challenge these policies and
if so how would the u.s. react to that
thank you well I mean there has been
they are pretty interesting kind of
Occupy movement in Israel it's a
relative to population it's probably the
biggest one in the world it's pretty
it's it's kind of that pretty narrow
goals understandable but narrow you know
it's it's pretty reasonably privileged
people you know people like you
basically students you know relatively
well-off families who are being squeezed
hard by the neoliberal policies so they
can't get apartments they got to live in
their parents homes you know can't get
decent jobs and same things happening
all over the West and they protested
about that it excluded by decision
anything related to the occupation so it
didn't mention that
the reasoning apparently was if they
brought it up who would just undermine
it Palestinian Israeli Arabs apparently
didn't participate they're the most
repressed group in Israel along with
Orthodox Jews who also live in poverty I
don't think they participated so it's
kind of a you know relatively affluent
educated uprising and a pretty serious
one but for narrow goals could anything
go beyond that it's pretty hard to say
Israel's changed a lot in the last few
years dramatically it's shifted way to
the right this shows up in diplomacy and
a lot of other things so for example
take the demand that Netanyahu's demand
that the Palestinians recognize Israel
as a Jewish state as far as I know
that's just arisen in the last couple of
years it was never raised before and
it's just a kind of a barrier to ensure
that negotiations won't get anywhere and
it's quite kind of like the notion right
to exist which as far as I know a rose
in the 70s after steps were being taken
to accept the right to exist in peace
and security you know the wording of un
242 got to raise the barrier to prevent
having no country has a right to know
state as a right to exist like New
Mexico recognizes the United States but
it doesn't recognize its right to exist
on half of Mexico we've conquered by
aggression you know as far as a Jewish
state is concerned you know Obama
recognizes it but no sane politician say
recognizes Pakistan as an Islamic state
that's what they call themselves so we
recognize Pakistan but we don't
recognize Pakistan as an Islamic state
and we just recognize Pakistan same with
you know Saudi Arabia extreme but so
this is a new
and it's a reflection of the general
shift to the right which is very
noticeable so whether anything and I
mean in Israel amazingly they do not you
know overwhelmingly I know the figures
butts very high do not understand why
the world was outraged by the Gaza
attack they don't understand why the
world was outraged by the mavi marmara
in fact the standard picture in Israel
you know aside from the fringes is our
brave soldiers were attacked by the
people on the ship and that's their
conception overwhelming they're kind of
circling the wagons if you has a certain
resemblance to South Africa there's some
interesting comparison that a lot of
comparisons grown with South Africa most
of them don't make any sense but there's
some that are very I think meaningful
mention one around nineteen sixty the
apartheid regime understood that they're
beginning to be recognized as
international pariah and in fact I think
nineteen sixty or so the foreign
minister called in the American
ambassador and told them we have the
documents of in declassified that we
understand where a pariah state everyone
votes against us in the United Nations
but you and I know that there's only one
vote in the United Nations yours and as
unit as long as you support us we don't
give a damn what the rest of the world
thinks and that's exactly the way it
developed by the 1970s the UN imposed an
embargo by the 1980s the US Congress
imposed sanctions
the reagan administration continued to
support south africa as part of their
global war on terror effect in 1988 the
reagan administration declared that the
african national congress Mandela's
congress was one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world he had to
defend the White regime against them
that was not a small thing that led to
millions of deaths literally and I
continued until about nineteen eighty
eight meanwhile a South Africa was
acting more and more what looks like
irrationally I'm they were carrying out
major atrocities just kind of kicking
the world in the face you know attacking
refugee camps for no reason killing
hundreds of people and they have at the
White regime thought as long as they got
the United States behind them it just
doesn't matter what the rest of the
world thinks which turned out to be
right around nineteen ninety four
reasons that we can only surmise there's
no documentary record the United States
changed its position suddenly and that
was the end of apartheid within a couple
of years it was formally gone I think
you can guess the reasons but we don't
really have documentary evidence and I
think Israel's following the same course
than treading on pretty thin ice
it's my job to make sure professor
Chomsky gets to his flight on time and
in order to do that we have to leave
right at seven forty-five so I'm very
sorry to the people who wanted to ask
questions but couldn't but we need to
stop here and thank professor Chomsky
you
