don't have a free press here but it was
so you know if you're really a scholar
and you got a terrific memory you can
remember that something unpleasant
happened there but it's certainly not an
issue we don't look into the question we
nobody calls for freedom of the press
and El Salvador and for two very good
reasons for one thing Washington the
office of public diplomacy has ordered
us that that topic is off the agenda
we're not supposed to talk about that so
I'm there for being loyal cowards we
naturally obey so that's one reason the
other reason is that the call for a free
press in El Salvador would be ridiculous
you can't have a free present El
Salvador without first dismantling the
whole terror system that the United
States installed precisely to ensure
that you can't have things like a free
press or for that matter bible study
groups that might turn into peasant
self-help groups and in fact all the
developments that caused Washington to
unleash the terror apparatus so the
sense is absurd to ask for a pre-press I
guess there's no point in doing so in
any event no one asks about it meanwhile
i should say in nicaragua nothing
remotely comparable has happened the
opposition claims harassment and of
course it always hits the front pages of
the newspapers but they're not expecting
to be murdered tortured and this
opposition is extreme it's the kind of
opposition which has never survive
didn't have been a Western democracy in
times of crisis la prensa for example
and the groups around it are openly
support the US attack against Nicaragua
nothing secret about it i just had the i
guess i'm sure it's happy experience but
experience of reading three months worth
of La Prensa I must be the only person
outside the CIA who actually has all of
La Prensa since the time was opened in
my office at home and it's just openly
pro contra don't even hide it it so is
simply a US government disinformation or
Oregon I mean to allow the journal to
publish it's as if in the United States
during the Second World War the media
were largely dominated by japanese
fascist journals calling for the
overthrow of the US government and the
liberation of you know the territories
in the Pacific from the racist murders
in the United States or something like
that
I mean such things are inconceivable you
know I never happened in the West and
the same is true of what we call the
opposition which openly identifies with
the US attack against Nicaragua and
regards the u.s. is their only basic
political support well that they they do
get harassed and you know they get
censored and that sort of thing they
don't get murdered in El Salvador
there's nothing remotely similar
instantly the press knows all of this
but will never report any of it
inconceivable that they report these
things though every journalist in
Managua and San Salvador knows it but
again nobody is talking about the
application of the terms of the occurs
which would permit the opposition even a
mild opposition to function nobody's
talking about those conditions in El
Salvador that's off the agenda and in
general all the simultaneity
requirements are unacceptable because
they would require the dismantling of
the terror apparatus that the United
States took such pains to impose and
still supports now another feature of
the Accords that's unacceptable was
international verification the Accords
had in them a provision for verification
an international verification commission
which included the five Central American
countries the Latin American democracies
the contadora countries the OAS the
Organization of American States in the
United Nations well plainly that's
unacceptable essentially for the reasons
I just mentioned international
verification would put barriers in the
way of the US attack against Nicaragua
and the US attack against the
populations of El Salvador Guatemala and
Honduras via the terrorist apparatus the
military regimes which were either
imposed or supported for that purpose so
that's unacceptable another reason why
international verification is
unacceptable to the United States is
that the Latin American country is
though dependent of course on the United
States after all we are the 800-pound
gorilla they're dependent on the United
States and their limits beyond which
they can go nevertheless they have a
degree of Independence they have a
degree of Independence and therefore
they're not allowed in at all in fact
nobody with the degree of independence
from the master the hemisphere is
allowed in so plainly international
verification has to go and in fact the
demolition job on the Accords was
completed by January by January the
simultaneity condition was thrown out
international verification was
terminated and in fact nothing remains
of the Accords they are finished they're
part of ancient history nothing remains
of the guatemala city of course the
press mate talk about the RAS chords and
so on but either they're lying
consciously or else they're unwilling to
bother to look the fact of the matter is
there is nothing left of those accords
what is left is a version of the Accords
written in Washington and transmitted by
the press and accepted by Congress and
that version says Nicaragua has to
accede to arbitrary demand stated by the
United States government whatever they
happen to be that's the Accords and
that's all there is left there's nothing
left of the original text well what were
the means used to destroy the Accords
this is a very successful demolition job
what were the means used well there were
two kinds there were military means and
there were ideological means you might
say the military means were first of all
and most important the intensification
of the CIA supply flights that was the
most important event that happened
during August to january as i mentioned
the supply flights which of course
illegal to start with were sharply
intensified to about two to three a day
and also us surveillance flights with
very expensive surveillance apparatus
although fanciest sr-71 s and youtube
satellites and spy ships off coast and
so on are carrying out intensive
surveillance of nicaragua and that was
extended to now both of those operations
are significant the supply flights are
crucial in fact critical because as is
recognized on all sides of this debate
the Contras the proxy army are not
guerrillas they have no remote relation
to guerillas
the KGB doesn't fly two to three supply
flights a day in the El Salvador to keep
the guerrillas in the field and nobody's
talking about sending humanitarian aid
to the guerrillas you don't have to
because they're part of the country
they're rooted in the country they fight
inside their own country they've got
their own network of support fact the
reason for us terror in El Salvador's
men to try to destroy that base of
support but they don't need supplies
they don't have to give it the countries
on the other hand have to get everything
from food to fancy communication
equipment to boots to arms and so on
because they're not part of the country
they're a foreign implant that's what it
means to sit in fact you know buddy
nobody really denies this is not a topic
for debate you know the Reagan
administration first ones to tell you
that this force is going to collapse
unless we continue to provide them with
arms and supplies the meaning of that
which they don't bother to tell you in
the press but you can figure it out the
meaning of that is there not guerrillas
because nobody does this for gorillas
and in fact that's written into the
Accords it's under well understood in
Central America you take a look at the
actual wording of the Accords and they
say that and the indispensable element
for peace in the region is an end to any
form of support and they mention
military logistical propaganda or
whatever to two kinds of groups namely
irregular forces and insurrectionist
movements now the distinction for that
is that the irregular force of the
country's foreign for foreign organized
forces attacking some country the
insurrectionist movement our movements
are indigenous gorillas and the
indispensable element of the Accords is
the termination of any form of support
for them any form logistical or whatever
and of course the as a corollary the use
of one country is a territory for for
Incept insurrectionist movement for
irregular forces attacking another in
January the International Commission the
verification Commission gave published
its report now that was plainly the most
important thing that happened in January
here's this commission made up of the
five Central American countries and the
Latin American democracies and OAS and
UN had investigated all the countries
they finally came out with a report now
we can finally get into
and an objective assessment of the
compliance with the with the guatemala
city of courts well it was mentioned in
the New York Times we have a free press
it got actually one sentence in the New
York Times buried in an article by James
lemoyne in which he stated that the
conference that the Commission broke up
in this agreement well in fact its
report was unanimously accepted but that
was the total description in the news
report on january fourteenth when
fifteenth report was issued on the 14th
other here and there you could find this
kaga Tribune actually covered it in this
case but there was very little coverage
well and you can see why the conclusions
of the Commission were just not useful
for ideological warfare why well first
of all the Commission denounced the
United States it singled out the United
States and the United States alone for
condemnation because the United States
had undermined the indispensable element
for peace in the region by continuing
its support for the irregular forces
attacking the garage or from Honduras
and in fact from Costa Rica and that
that's the central condemnation in the
Accords well plainly that's useless now
the Commission went on to say that they
couldn't provide detailed comments on
the particular countries of the region
and the reason for that was that three
countries objected El Salvador Guatemala
and Honduras the three US terror states
would not permit a description you can
figure out for yourselves what the
description would have been and but the
u.s. wouldn't allow it through its
clients it blocked any description of
the however they did carry out a press
conference in Costa Rica and there the
delegates discuss this at Latin American
representatives spoke openly at the
press conferences of what they called
they said they were shocked by the
attitude of patent fear in the faces of
opposition people and trade unionists in
El Salvador and Guatemala to us terror
states while claiming there's no point
reporting that the commission also
praised Nicaragua for what they called
concrete steps towards democratization
despite the ongoing us aggression
plainly useless fact none of this is
useful for ideological warfare so
therefore it didn't happen and the
reporting is virtually zero in the New
York Times which is the most important
newspaper worse than zero one sentence
which was a lie the Commission plainly
had to be disbanded and the u.s. simply
insisted that it be disbanded the main
us client in the region Jose Napoleon
Duarte who is a Democrat by definition
because he follows us orders it's also
one of the worst murderers in the
history of Latin America and he's
reviled and be tested throughout Latin
America for this region but here he's
very highly praised he said with some
insight I think that it wasn't really
necessary to have an international
commission of verification because he
said the press would suffice for
verification that's quite right that
provides that expresses a real insight
into the workings of the press well that
took care of the International
verification Commission so one element
of the course the basic element Accords
is gone no more international
supervision and recognizing that the
powerful make the rules and the week
just obey Nicaraguan president Ortega
then announced that Nicaragua would
adhere to the conditions of the cords
alone a lot happened between the time of
the speech by Noam Chomsky on the third
March 1988 until about the third of
April when this video tape was made
March first the conscious attack to
Nicaraguan village March second the
Republican counter aid plan was voted
down the next day talks between the
Nicaraguan government and mosquito
Indians began my march forth Democratic
contr aid plan was voted down two days
later there was an investigation of
misuse of american funds in El Salvador
March 9th negotiations between the Sun
and nieces and the Contras were
counselled the next day the Contras
released a captured American the day
after that the country is agreed with
talks with Nicaragua March twelfth
Robert McFarlane pled guilty to
withholding contr information from
Congress on the fifteenth senate voted
to force the President to inform them
about covert operations the next day the
Costa Rican President
pposed contra aid then the big four was
indicted for conspiracy the u.s. sent
troops to the Honduran border saying the
Nicaraguan invaded which nicaragua at
nine the next day the troops did arrive
from the United States and the following
day Oliver North resign duarte el
salvador almost lost control the
National Assembly American troops moved
within 50 miles of Nicaragua and the
Nicaraguan Contras talks reconvened on
the 24th temporary truce between the
Nicaraguans and the country's was ironed
out all the heavies pleaded not guilty
in the Contra gate affair March 28
Nicaragua freed the prisoners under
ceasefire agreement and the next day the
negotiations began on the 30th congress
approved more contra aid they prefers
the ceasefire began in nicaragua the
next day the u.s. sent 1,300 troops to
panama that's of march 27th 25,000
people have been killed in this American
sponsored contra war against Nicaragua
there's a very good article in the
propaganda review in the winter of 1988
that's the anatomy of the disinformation
campaign that illustrates very well
known Chomsky and Edward Herman's view
of the media and the way they
manufacture could sent to certain
conservative policies what this article
deals with is the way that the mass
media presented the aftermath of an
attempt to assassinate the Contra leader
Eden pastora that took place on May the
31st of 1981 pastoral was a Sandinista
hero hero of the Nicaraguan Revolution
who went to Nicaragua with the
Sandinistas after the Revolution and was
a major figure in the government he then
left Nicaragua because he thought they
were becoming too closely involved with
Cuba and the Soviet Union so eventually
pastora joined the Contras and started
engaging in fights against the
Nicaraguan government to try to
overthrow the Sandinistas he got
completely fed up with the other country
forces though that were directed with
the CIA so I made the 31st of 1984 he
called a press conference to denounce
the other cultural leaders to separate
himself from them and to renounce his
contra activity at that press conference
a bomb went off that wounded many the
journalists there that harmed pastora
and some of his contra friends and the
killed some other journalists right
after that bomb went off ABC and PBS
reported that the bomb was set off by a
Basque ETA terrorist who was working for
Nicaragua the Basques are a mountain
people in Spain who want an autonomous
country free from Spain and from France
and had been engaged occasionally an
armed struggle for boskie independence
for many years and what happened was a
disinformation campaign was set up there
was a
using so-called Basque terrorists of
involving themselves in terrorism in
political assassinations and violence in
Central America as surrogates of the
Nicaraguan Contras the source for this
story was a former member of the El
Salvador liberation group who told the
member of a Reagan group the office for
public diplomacy that the bosques were
very active in terrorist activities in
Central America the office of public
diplomacy was a Reagan administration
office it was the first state propaganda
Bureau that the US government ever had
that is an agency to create propaganda
and disinformation for a very specific
policy which was that of the Reagan
administration policy in Central America
so the office of public diplomacy put
out a report that they paid one of their
employees to publish that the busks were
very active in terrorism in Costa Rica
El Salvador and other Central American
countries this had the first effect of
souring the relationships between the
Costa Rican government and the
Sandinistas all sorts of stories were
leaked to Costa Rica and newspapers at
the time the Costa Ricans were trying to
get better relations with the
Sandinistas that the Sandinistas had
sent terrorists to Costa Rica to carry
out political assassinations to bomb
people in the Costa Rican government in
the US Embassy in a country forces there
and although there was no evidence ever
that bosque were actually operative
there the stories were printed in Costa
Rica newspapers so after the pastora
attempt at his assassination the bombing
of pastora the office of public
diplomacy revealed documents about this
Basque terrorist group and claimed that
one of
top Terrace were there who was the one
that was attempting to assassinate
pastora and he was a sandanista hija
terrace and leak this story out to the
media well ABC and PBS both picked this
story out they were dupes of
disinformation on june the first ABC on
their world newsroom tonight reports
boldly stated that there is quote
growing evidence that the Sandinistas
have hired international hit men from a
Basque terrorist group known as the ETA
to have pastora killed they then went
into the whole details of the supposed
Basque terrorist operations in Central
America and said that all the evidence
points to this Basque hitman and
presented this as a sandanista plot
which some people thought might be a
prelude to a US invasion of sand and
east of nicaragua's was an attempt to
create hostility and tension between the
Costa Rican and the sandanista
government now this is ironic because as
it came out later the guy that really
did the assassination attempt of the
past aura was was related to the John
Hall Oliver North Richard C chord
network it later came out that this
terraced whose picture was at the news
conference a well-known international
terrorist landed on John halls our ranch
got explosives from Hall that were
provided by Richard C chord who was a
top man in the North network and that
Hall gave him the explosives gave him
the false passport and press credentials
to get into the press conference and
that helped him escape later this was
this came out in a Christa Institute's
lawsuit which began with the lepen
kabani
one of the plaintiffs in the Chris tech
Institute suit was Tony a be known and
Martha honey who tony was a harmed in
this bombing and so he did research and
point it to john halls ranch so all the
leads pointed to john hall Chomsky talks
about other ways in which they media
simply lie about things for instance he
made a study of the Washington Post in
the new york times for january-february
march of 1987 he looked at all the
editorials and found they were all anti
sandanista and he said chomp she said
there are two very striking things about
these sandanista government compared to
the other governments in Central America
Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador one
that Sonnen Easton government doesn't
slaughter its own population whereas the
other three hunder escada malin el
salvador have killed over a hundred and
fifty thousand of their own citizens
just in the 1980s and second that's
never pointed out by the media is that
Nicaragua was the only one of those
countries in which the government has
tried to direct services to the poor and
diverted resources for social reform and
education he said well Honduras is a
little bit different from Guatemala and
El Salvador they there don't kill some
buds but they just let the rich rob the
poor so it's also very interesting his
analysis in another propaganda review
this in the winter 1987-88 Chomsky says
that very interesting things happen in
the 1920s he talked about even in world
war one a bunch of American Historians
offered themselves to President Woodrow
Wilson saying that they wanted to do
some historical engineering so that they
could get together and engineer the
facts of history so that we serve the
state and in 1921 the famous American
journalist and pillar of the
establishment walter Lippmann said that
democracy can exist only if there is
manufacture of consent
among the people so you can see the
problem democracies have Soviet Union or
totalitarian States I say by god this is
it and we have state censorship but you
can't quite work with such a heavy hand
and democracy so what they have to do
they have to control what goes out and
they have to control what people think
so as Chomsky said one of the ways to do
this is to create a debate so that it
looks like a lot of opinions are working
a lot of different information is coming
in but actually it's all working within
a very narrow margin very narrow
spectrum all acceptable by the elite
knob ski is one of the great
intellectuals of our time and yet see I
saw him once on with an interview with
the guy from PBS Illinois Illinois
that's the art interview series with
chomps gave the time at his book
manufacturing consent came out but he's
hardly ever on the mainstream media
simply because he's such a radical
critic then I might know these are he's
a very respectable professor at MIT he's
one of the experts in the field of
linguistics he's one of the top
theorists of language and linguistic
activity in the whole country so he
basically has two academic careers as a
researcher and critic of American
foreign policy in the media and is a
specialist in the science of linguistics
where he's probably one of the most
respected theorists and entire world for
that matter here's an example of what
the establishment does to Chomsky as
well as not letting him on TV he's been
forced to publish most of his work with
small circulation presses because the
big mainstream mass-circulation
organizations won't won't do it there
they almost did once back in the early
70s warner modular publications which is
a city area of warner communications
signed a contract with Chomsky Chomsky
and Edward Herrmann to write a book
called counter revolutionary violence
bloodbath in fact and in propaganda well
the manuscript was written
to 20,000 copies of the book were
printed there were ads put out in the
New York Review of Books promotional
Flyers were listed by it by the
publisher but the parent company Warner
started sniffing around and Warner's
Williams sarnoff who was offended by the
criticism of the US government ordered
the publication not take place well the
president of the Warner subsidiary
Claude McCaleb protested this and tried
to work out a compromise so they could
do it but Warner was interested only in
getting rid of the book may not only got
rid of the book they got rid of record
McCaleb the president of the subsidy are
then they did away with a subsidiary
usually they don't put ideology over
finances obviously they lost a lot of
money that they paid Chomsky in advance
for the book they printed $20,000 20,000
copies so they must have lost you know
hundreds of thousands of dollars but the
book was such an explosive indictment of
u.s. foreign policy that they just
didn't want to publish it south end
press eventually published it in two
volumes i think was called the
washington connection it basically is a
study of state terrorism sponsored by
the CIA the way that the CIA has
supported state terrorism for instance
in indonesia in the 1960s the CIA
engineered an overthrow the
democratically elected government and
hundreds of thousands of leftist were
killed in indonesia in this project
sponsored by the CIA later in east timor
one of the indonesian
island chains the Indonesian government
working with the CIA carry out a
bloodbath there of state terrorism that
again the CIA was involved in and they
went through Vietnam they went through
Central America all the ways that the
United States government particularly
the CIA have supported state terrorism
this was just too explosive a book for
Warner's to publish so he just covered
it over the incident created a big sure
are in France that reported quite a bit
about it but not in the United States
this is blatant censorship there that
brings us to the end of another
