I suppose somebody has a good idea so
suppose we were trying to organize
something that you have a good idea okay
then for that and we'd to think yeah
that's a great idea okay for that moment
you're a leader okay
maybe tomorrow he has a good idea so
he'll be the leader if we designate
somebody to be the leader we're gonna
follow them no matter what they say then
weird rule if you want to look up to
people you should look up to say the
snake workers people are really doing
the work in the south they had car
bitter experiences not just them but
plenty of black activists I know there's
some white people joined them and that's
what should really look up to know as
soon as you start worshipping leaders
you're in trouble why because they're
going to take power and Institute
systems of authority and domination now
which are after its freedom and
independence leader should be
representatives of the community
temporarily given positions of degree of
authority under popular control take
Martin Luther King it was a very
important figure but he was kind of
riding a wave of popular activism if it
hadn't been for snake workers in the
south and Freedom Riders and black
students sitting in at lunch counters
and mass public demonstrations there
would be no mark like that comin to be a
king but nobody'd be listening to him
what he did was recognized to be
dangerous by power systems if you take a
look at the history of how King is
regarded and treated it's very
illuminating I mean on Martin Luther
King Day there's lots of elaborate
rhetoric which typically ends in 1963
with you know I have a dream because
that's kind of tolerable to systems of
power and Dhamma
if you like it but they can accept it on
the other hand what about what he did
right after that where people's movement
organizing and going to work to support
a sanitation workers strike that's
that's not their effective gave a
another I have a dream speech of the
night before he was assassinated but
that's not quoted
