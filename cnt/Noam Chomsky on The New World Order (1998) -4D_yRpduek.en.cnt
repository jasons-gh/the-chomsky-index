well since david brought up or will i
might mention that in his defense that
he didn't only write about foot control
in totalitarian societies it's perfectly
true that that was the you know
well thrust main thrust of his work and
it's certainly what he's known for but
he did write an interesting essay called
literary censorship in england and it
was about foot control and free
societies big thing one does the example
because he was there and the point that
he made is that it really wasn't all
that different from the talat area in
soviet union it was just done in
different ways but he said that the in
fact one of the ways he mentioned is a
good education you'll be happy to know
so if you have a good education i
presumably meant you know Oxford and
Cambridge in those places you just have
it instilled in you that there are
certain things it just wouldn't do to
say or even to think if the system is
working properly and he also talked
about private ownership of the press and
other factors that as he puts it to end
up with and the result that unpopular
ideas are an entry called inconvenient
facts are silenced with surprising
effectiveness well that's not very well
known and there's a reason for it it was
intended as the introduction to his
famous Animal Farm which made him a
household word you know satire on the
Soviet Union but as if to prove his
point it was silenced with surprising
effectiveness it didn't appear for
unknown reasons his biographers don't go
into though they must know and it was
discovered about 25 years later long
after his death and his unpublished
papers so it's true that Orwell is known
for his attack on the other guy but he
generalized the point and the more
important points the ones that have to
do with us which are always the most
important are those
have been as he put it kept dark and
silenced with surprising effectiveness
still unknown for the most part except
the real Orwell aficionados well that
message is worth bearing in mind he was
writing about England but applies us as
well and more importantly because of
American power it was American power in
fact that established the current world
order there are only occasional moments
in human affairs when you can sensibly
when there are changes that are dramatic
and significant enough so that makes
sense to talk about a world order one of
them probably the most dramatic and the
most easily x surely was in 1945 at the
end of the most devastating single
catastrophe in human history which left
much of the industrial world either
seriously damaged or in ruins except for
the United States which was unscathed
and in fact had benefited enormous Lee
from the war industrial production more
than tripled that ended the depression
which had not been affected very much by
the New Deal and it set the stage for
the next phase of history the United
States at that time had about half the
world's total wealth and unparalleled
military power and security of a level
that
had no precedent and perfectly naturally
dominant forces in the state corporate
system planned to use that power to
organize in the world and accord with
their own perceived self-interest
that's what's technically called the
national interest in academic writing
and the media and so on inside these
truisms which is what kind of a
curiosity about the intellectual culture
is that these truisms which is what they
are are commonly described as a Marxist
view which is odd since first person
ever who I know of who are
them clearly was Adam Smith and perhaps
the person who most lucidly articulated
them was Winston Churchill and you know
it shouldn't strain the intelligence of
a eight year old to figure out that
that's the way the world works
anyway it does if you have a good
education that's an inconvenient fact
but in fact well how do you organize the
world the there were conflicting visions
you know us elites had their picture of
how to ought to be organized but it was
certainly not uniform any means and
opposing forces had to be dealt with
somehow want to borrow some cold war
rhetoric they had to be contained or
possibly rolled back if that could be
done and that was done with varying
degrees of success the basic conflicts
of course persist and they persist for
quite simple reasons they're about
fundamental values about justice and
freedom and human rights and these
values are constantly an arena of
conflict between the more powerful
between centers of power and most of the
rest that's a good deal of history in
the last half century is no exception to
that well at the onset of the current
era the end of the Second World War
there were very the framers of the New
World Order they had to face these
challenges everywhere first they had to
face them at home
I mean domestically in the United States
what had to be contained or rolled back
was the fact that a large majority the
population had rather strong commitments
to more or less social democratic ideals
sometimes a lot more far-reaching than
that positions that the business world
quite rightly regarded as a threat to
its traditional domination of US society
as they put it in their own internal
publications
it was the hazard facing industrialists
in the rising political power of the
masses which had to be contained and
suppressed and that was that was then
you that's a constant theme that runs
through came up again in the wake of the
turmoil of the 1960's which led to
concerns among elites in this case
liberal elites about what they called
the crisis of democracy the fact that
large parts of the population that are
usually apathetic and passive and
obedient were trying to enter the
political arena to press their own
demands it's a crisis of democracy which
had to be overcome
they incidentally expressed particular
concern about what they called the
institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young the ones who
make sure that you don't have that the
wrong thoughts don't come to mind and
the period since the early 1970s has
been one of a doctrinal assault against
the effort the rather successful in many
ways
Liberatore elements of the 1960's that's
the modern theory but going back to the
early period the early the mid 1940s
these were major problems and it's
interesting to look at how they were
dealt with but can't go into it now well
there were similar problems right
throughout the industrial world
there they were enhanced by the fact
that the anti-fascist resistance had
quite considerable prestige and appeal
at the end of the war and often it had a
sort of radical Democratic thrust to it
also traditional conservative the
traditional conservative order had been
discredited because of its association
with fascism well the first first task
of the United States and Britain after
the war was to restore that traditional
order and its
and that was a major it was done all
over the world and one or another form
sometimes blood aliy sometimes in other
ways mostly in ugly ways that should be
chapter one of post Second World War
history well as in the United States
that project continues it's taken new
forms in the last couple of decades
under under the guise of what's
sometimes called neoliberalism or
economic rationalism or the free market
and other terms that are permeated with
a good deal of fraud and hypocrisy I'll
come back to that in the third world
there were similar problems in the 40s
and there they were compounded by
pressures to dismantle the Imperial
systems and the legacy that they had
left a legacy of subordination and
dependency and throughout the third
world rather similar policies were
imposed but you can really see them in
their starkest clarity in latin america
and the reason is because they're the
United States really reigned supreme I
mean there were essentially no
challenges so you can see the policies
formulated you read them in internal
documents sometimes public ones and
executed with pretty dramatic clarity
the when I say there were no challenges
that's not quite true
there was one major challenge and that
was the domestic population in Latin
America there there was a threat and it
was recognized right away the State
Department records from the mid 40s
early and mid 40s talk about the concern
they're concerned with what they called
the philosophy of new nationalism that
was sweeping all over Latin America I'm
now quoting it was embracing policies
designed to bring about broader
distribution of wealth and to raise the
standard of living of the masses on the
principle that the first beneficiaries
of a country's resources should be the
people of that country
the name for that evil doctrine is
radical nationalism or economic
nationalism that's what's called an
official state papers and of course it's
unacceptable
the first beneficiaries of a country's
resources should be US investors their
counterparts elsewhere and the local
associates that's taken for granted we
have to protect our resources as the
chair of the State Department's policy
planning staff put it George Kennan
famous humanist our resources happen to
be somewhere else but they're ours and
we have to protect them and make sure
that we're the first beneficiaries there
was a conflict over this and in February
1945 at a hemispheric conference a u.s.
power naturally prevailed and the United
States imposed what was called the
economic charter of the Americas which
called for an end economic nationalism
in all its forms so none of this
nonsense well there followed a cruel and
bloody half-century still going on and
these were central themes throughout and
they remain so now they're very much
alive today although here too they take
the form of they've changed somewhat in
style and form now they're in the
framework of a certain kind of
globalization in a very special form
which is crafted primarily to serve the
interests of those with power perfectly
naturally transnational corporations
financial institutions that state a
leets and so on well the most critical
part of the third world then and now as
well was the Middle East and there's a
simple reason for that it was the locus
of the world's major energy supplies and
remained so State Department didn't
mince words about it it was called the
greatest material prize in world history
the strategically most important part of
the world uh stupendous source of
strategic power and so on
that's the Middle East and it was clear
who had to be the first beneficiaries of
those resources they had to be under
effective US control had to be
accessible on terms that are acceptable
to us power US leadership and the main
concern was the huge profits that they
generate they had the flow primarily to
the United States secondarily to its
junior partner as the British Foreign
Office ruefully described itself in the
mid-nineteen for 1945 internal documents
recently released the profits have to be
recycled by local managers who are
supposed to be the plinth dependent on
the global rulers the British and their
day and the Sun had a nice name for them
and internal documents they call them
the Arab facade behind which the British
would exercise actual rule they're still
around there's still the Arab facade so
that's the structure basic structure of
the system naturally it engenders
continual conflict the people of the
region don't understand why they
shouldn't be the beneficiaries of the
resources of that region kind of
backward that way they and that causes
problems in internal documents the
problems which have been going on since
the Second World War and effective long
before they're called the problem of
radical nationalism economic nationalism
and so on for the general public for
people like us they're different terms
used for them they're called
international terrorism of really big
intellectual the crisis The Clash of
Civilizations or some other fancy term
but it's good old-fashioned radical
nationalism the strange idea that the
first beneficiaries of a country's
resources should be the people of that
country and that there should be effort
to construct policies designed to bring
about a broader distribution of wealth
and to raise the standard of living of
the masses and State Department
terminology well that goes on and it's
likely that it'll become worse at least
if the consensus of geologists is
anywhere near accurate that is that the
current oil glut and extremely low
crisis I mean at the pump in the United
States they're lower than they've been
since the Second World War in real terms
it's generally assumed that that's a
temporary phenomenon and that there is a
an oil shortage coming probably not too
far the reason for that belief is that
the rate of discovery has declined which
went up from about 1850 until the mid
1960s kept kept going up it's been
declining since the mid 60s despite much
more elaborate technology and deep
drilling and so on keeps going down and
the available oil which is some rough
estimate of it is being used up very
fast in fact close to half of the known
exploitable capacity has been used since
the oil crisis of the early 70s and it's
accelerating so that you know but about
furthermore about half of the known
exploitable capacities in the Middle
East which means that that region of the
world will become you know it'll be
looming larger and larger in the effort
to control the whole world and those are
you know not certain but reasonable
prospects unless there's something
radically new discovered that looks as
if that's what's coming there's a
general prediction that about half of
total known capacity will have been used
up by within a
gate or maybe two decades anyway not
very distant future and after that as
far as anybody knows there'll be a
decline and a shift to middle east
sources as the major center there's a
lot of hype about the Caspian Sea and so
on but that's apparently mostly fake
according to oil company sources they
claim it's being hyped by the United
States government for political reasons
as part of their ante their their effort
to develop an alliance with Europe
against Iran which they so far haven't
been able to do so they're kind of
talking about Caspian Sea but the
estimates are that that's maybe on the
order of North Sea oil not very large a
couple of years use at most the and most
of it isn't in that region it's in
kazahstan all right well anyhow those
are prospects that are expected which
means the Middle East will be be a major
center of conflict and turmoil very
probably there are new alignments taking
shape there which if you want to you
should keep your eyes on them
it's not yet and part of it's already
there part of its taking shape but kind
of an alignment between which is this
one's very visible turkey Israel and the
Palestinian administration which is
supposed to keep the Palestinians under
control they're supposed to play the
role basically that the black leadership
of the ban Thurston's played and under
the apartheid regime it's why agreement
was about and so those three are sort of
on one side the turkey israel relation
is now very visible and frightening
people on the other side you can see a
kind of and this must be wearing people
in the State Department no end and the
planning centers there's the beginnings
of interactions rapprochement between
Saudi Arabia Iran Egypt Syria in part
frightened by the turkey israel
relationship that's being established
under US power with the junior partner
following loyally behind as always and
it's this is
recipe for a lot of trouble in the
future well there's a lot to say about
all these matters but and plenty of
aspects of the post-war post-world War
two world and global system that haven't
even mentioned but let's drop that on if
you're interested glad to talk about it
later
and turn to something different namely
the institutional framework that was
designed for world order in the in the
mid 40s that's 50 years ago asked how
it's fared and where it stands today
that institutional framework had three
basic pillars there was an international
political order there was a Human Rights
order and an economic order the
political order is articulated in the
United Nations Charter the say a little
about each the first the political order
that's essentially the UN Charter the
Charter has some simple long document
but it has it's based on a very simple
principle namely it bars the threat or
use of force in international affairs
threat or use of force and there only
two exceptions to that which are clearly
specified and more or less they're
relevant to the real world one is if the
Security Council of the United Nations
unanimously authorizes the use of force
or the threat of force after having
determined that peaceful means have
failed the second exception is famous
article 51 which permits self-defense
against armed attack until the Security
Council acts armed attacks pretty
narrowly define concept an international
law that means a sudden overwhelming
attack so for example if Cuba were to
land troops and Washington the way the
United States is supposed to respond is
to inform the Security Council and ask
them to do something about it and until
the Security Council acts the United
States is permitted to use force and
self-defense
the Cuban invasion that example may be
hypothetical I'm not sure the Cubans
kept a couple of months ago the Cuban
threat was officially downgraded by the
Pentagon that elicited a lot of anger on
Capitol Hill and there was rejected by
the White House at the same time the
European Union was bringing charges
against the United States and the World
Trade Organization US embargo against
Cuba for violating international law as
has already been determined by every
relevant international body and the u.s.
refused to accept World Trade
Organization jurisdiction claiming a
national security exception meaning that
the Cuban threat is still live so you
better make sure you got your gas masks
and your desks to hide under and so on
well anyway that's the sole exception
these are the sole exceptions there's of
course no enforcement mechanism apart
from the great powers and decisively
that means the United States but the
problem is that the great powers as far
as I know universally reject the
principles of the Charter and the small
powers would too if they were big enough
to get away with it they reject them in
practice and also in the case of the
United States explicitly in doctrine as
well very clearly so in fact the
doctrine has been stated repeatedly
maybe stated most clearly by Dean
Acheson leading statesmen at the time it
was a senior adviser to the Kennedy
administration he was justifying the
plainly illegal blockade of Cuba in 1962
before a meeting of the American Society
of international law and he pointed at
he stated that quote a situation in
which our country's power position and
prestige are involved cannot be treated
as a legal issue okay so if US power
position and prestige are involved
forget about international law the
Charter or anything else that's pretty
plain and accurate
there's no need and no time to go
through the practice of the past
half-century one recent example is the
bombing of the pharmaceutical plant in
Sudan it's quite trivial in historical
context though of course a war crime and
didn't arouse much concern here but I
suppose that if there was a terrorist
attack that had destroyed half of US
pharmaceutical supplies I might have
maybe made it to the back pages of the
newspapers anyhow that's a minor example
of the utin case the use of force and
radical violation of international law
without leaving a plea to of any cover
but it's quite standard you read it in
the front pages every time there's any
talk about say bombing Iraq obviously
that's not done with Security Council
support the u.s. of course knows it
can't get the Security Council to agree
to that so therefore it's just blatant
violation of the central principles of
international law even the threat this
is independent of what you may happen to
think about the regime or anything else
we're talking about here about the
international political order what's
kind of interesting about the past 15
years or so the since Reagan is that
it's all become very open and public so
that's the one real innovation of the
recent period so the United States
during the Reagan administration claimed
officially that article 51 self-defense
against armed attack that that includes
quoting self defense against future
attack that was that was that was a
justification for the bombing of Libya
or it permits the United States quoting
to defend its interests that was the
justification for the invasion of Panama
and the even gotten were ludicrous in
the Clinton years but the basic point is
we'll do what we feel like and now
that's open and unchallenged accepted by
the
electril community except maybe they
question it on pragmatic grounds us at
the end of the UN Charter that's the end
official end it's always it's never been
effective but it's by now officially
dead about the practice should don't
don't go into it but the this has been
amply demonstrated in action and
shocking ways and again always with the
acquiescence and the just of the support
of the intellectual classes the educated
classes those who've got a good
education and though which things are
inconvenient facts so there are no such
facts as say the American invasion of
South Vietnam in the early 1960s or the
US war against the church and other
miscreants and Central America in the
1980s and on and on those didn't happen
in official history or of course they
happened in real history in a free
society in a free institution of higher
learning these would be central
components of the curriculum and in fact
it's a kind of a reasonable measure of
the freedom of the university to ask
exactly how much attention is given to
these central events of modern history
and the doctrine that lies behind them
leave that as an exercise for those who
might be interested you know what the
answer is going to be well let's turn to
the second pillar of world order the
human rights regime that's of course the
universal declaration of human rights in
a couple of days and December 10th that
will be the 50th anniversary of its
signing unanimous signing and we'll
probably be regaled with condemnations
of the horrendous human rights
violations of somebody else particularly
official enemies and those charges will
probably be accurate or reasonably
accurate but partially you can be pretty
confident that the inconvenient fact
don't be mentioned a vastly more
important topic will be ignored namely
human rights violations and the often
terrible atrocities which can be charged
in whole or in part to our account easy
to think of examples many of them
ongoing well these are whatever their
scale happens to be huge but even if
their scale was slight they would be far
more important than enemy atrocities or
other atrocities for quite elementary
moral reasons moral truisms namely these
are the exempt cases that we can act to
mitigate or to terminate so on the most
elementary principles those are the most
important the comparative treatment of
enemy atrocities in our own is very
instructive and again I'll put it aside
there's plenty in print about it
unfortunately I don't know of any
analysis of Stalinist propaganda but I
assume it was sort of a mirror image of
ours it would be interesting to discover
that in fact the interesting to discover
if it sinks to the depths of moral
cowardice of our treatment of Western
treatment American treatment of the
atrocities chargeable home that's
another good topic for somebody to look
at if you want you can get a certain
insight into the real understanding of
human rights by looking at a doctrine
that's well known the international
lawyers not much beyond it's called the
whole formula it's attributed the US
Secretary of State Cordell Hull of the
Roosevelt administration this formula
defines what it calls the international
minimum standard of civilization
well that standard doesn't involve
genocide or torture and other such
marginal issues rather it is in quoting
the right to adequate effective and
prompt compensation for expropriated
property where full compensation is to
be at fair market value as determined by
the former owners that's the
International
standard of civilization and it's a
formula that applies in rather intricate
ways for example it's the basis for the
US economic embargo and terrorist war
against Cuba for forty years that's been
carried out because of Cuba's failure to
meet this minimum standard of
civilization that as it failed to offer
what Washington unilaterally decided was
fair compensation for nationalized
property so the formula applies there on
the other hand it doesn't apply for some
odd reason to US investors in the US
government who stole the Cuban
properties at the turn of the century
when Cuba was under US military
occupation and consented to this robbery
by force but that expropriation was okay
doesn't fall under this principle the
principle also doesn't hold for the US
government and private powers who stole
Spanish and British possessions in Cuba
and the Philippines at the same time
after the bloody conquest of the
Philippines killed a couple hundred
thousand people the United States
throughout the Spanish concession for
the for example for the Spanish on
Manila railway company on the grounds
that in quoting it had been inspired by
Spanish imperialistic motives unlike the
u.s. possessions that Cuba nationalized
so it's a rather subtle doctrine it also
doesn't apply to the founding of the
United States that was based on
expropriation of British properties
British possessions and also the
possessions of British supporters who
were about as numerous as the rebels in
the Civil War that was part of the
global war going on at the time it's
called here the American Revolution
actually a civil war with two sides
supported by different great powers and
more or less equally balanced at home
New York State alone gained close to
four million dollars which was a huge
sum in those days by taking the property
of loyalists but that's okay that
doesn't fall into the formula
well goes on have to have a kind of
subtle mind and good education to
comprehend all of this and to understand
what counts as an international minimum
standard of civilization and against
that kind of background you can
understand more accurately the
significance of the Universal
Declaration in the real world I think
one final comment on that and then I'll
go on the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights the central thesis of it is
universality of course that means all of
the rights enumerated are of equal
status and you're pretty sure here talk
in the next couple of days about you
know the relativists various bad guys
please Asian values and things like that
again the charges will be mostly
accurate again partial you're unlikely
to read editorials about the fact that
the United States is a leader of the
relativist camp quite officially one
whole category of rights enumerated in
the Universal Declaration is simply
dismissed namely the socio-economic
provisions according to the US
government they have no status ginger
Patrick Kirkpatrick Reagan's ambassador
to the UN
she described them as a letter to Santa
Claus the US ambassador Morris Abram the
ambassador the UN Commission on Human
Rights described them as preposterous
dangerous incitement actually he was
talking about the Declaration of the
right to development that the UN was
considering which closely paraphrases
the Universal Declaration in which the
u.s. proceeded to veto thereby vetoing
central parts of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights
well maybe I'll be surprised and
there'll be an editorial about this but
I'm not holding my breath again there's
a lot more to say if you read those
provisions you'll see why they have no
status so let's put that aside and turn
to the international economic order
which is actually all over the front
pages today the reason that it's all
over the front Hey
is that the crisis the last 20 or 25
years has finally become begun to hit
rich people so now it's a crisis up
until now it didn't exist but now you
can read it in the headlines and by now
what's been happening is reasonably well
known for exactly that reason nothing
new just different victims our potential
victims the international economics
order was also established in the mid
40s 1944 the Bretton Woods system
it's the Bretton Woods system designed
by the United States and England was
essentially I mean theoretically not but
effectively then it had two basic
principles one principle was that it
called for freeing up trade so
liberalizing trade they wanted to get
back to something like the period before
World War one which were only just about
approaching in terms of scale of
international economic transactions
relative to the economy and so on
scale it's not all that novel so they
want to end drink between the two wars
it declined a lot so they wanted to
liberalize trade its principle one the
second principle was to regulate capital
flow and keep exchange rates fixed
that's actually still you can still find
that in the IMF rules the reason for the
second principle was in part a belief
which is probably probably correct least
reasonable that capital flight
short-term speculative capital flows
particularly an exchange rate
fluctuations which go along with them
they're going to undermine trade trade
an investment and in fact recent
experience tends to be consistent with
that assumption the more important
reason however was again a kind of
truism which wasn't controversial and it
isn't controversial now and that is that
free flow of capital undermines
democracy and undermines the welfare
state they were far too popular to
ignore in the new
twentieth century actually and if you go
back to an earlier period say during the
period of British domination of the
world before World War one nowhere near
as strong as US domination but
substantial during that period as I just
mentioned the level of globalization in
gross terms was not very different from
today actually higher in some respects
capital flow was roughly at today's
levels relative to the economy but in
those days economic policy state
economic policy could be designed
without very much concern for the rabble
because they didn't have a voice it was
just you know voting was restricted and
in the industrial societies kind of very
weak imitation of democracy therefore
national economic policies could be set
and exchange rates could be fixed and so
on even though there was rapid capital
flow and in fact a major part of current
economic policy is to try to get things
back to those happy days when you could
sort of disregard the population and
just leave decisions in the hands of the
right people you know financial capital
and so on that's a large part of the
history the last twenty or so years now
the truism about free capital flow
undermining democracy in the welfare
state that was emphasized quite
explicitly by the negotiators the US and
British negotiators at Bretton Woods and
the reasoning is straight forward
capital controls that is restrictions on
free movement of capital across borders
they enable governments to carry out
fiscal policies like monetary and tax
policies that are from the point of view
of investors irrational as they only
help people not profits so they sustain
employment or sustained incomes and
social programs and so on and such
policies can be introduced without fear
of capital flight if it's constrained on
the other end if there is free flow of
capital you get what some international
economists have called a virtual Senate
of financial capital it can impose its
own
social policies simply by the threat of
capital flight now sending the capital
out of the country which leads to higher
interest rates and economic slowdown
budget cuts for health and education and
so on and recession or maybe collapse
basically the IMF principles if
prescriptions if you look at them well
as I say all of this was articulated
very clearly at the time by the US
British negotiators and it's not
particularly controversial then or now
if you have free flight a free flow of
capital you're going to get a virtual
cent a Senate and democracy and you know
the welfare the social contract will be
undermined very it's important to keep
these really pretty elementary
observations in mind when you look at
the current period
well the Bretton Woods system as
originally established was pretty much
in place in for about 20 20 25 years or
so that's what's often called the Golden
Age of post-war state capitalism had by
historical standards high good economic
performance so high growth high rates of
growth both of the economy and of
production expansion of the social
contract and so on its was dismantled
the system was dismantled from the early
1970s one major move was when Nixon
simply unilaterally abrogated some of
the basic principles the other major
financial centers joined in by the 1980s
capital controls were mostly gone in the
rich countries completely gone the
smaller economies held up held on to
them South Korea for example which is a
significant economy kept them through
the 80s it was compelled to drop them in
the early 90s that's widely regarded as
a major factor in the recent collapse
along with radical failures in the
private sector throughout East and
Southeast Asia the big topic I should
say I won't go into it but I ought to
say that serious analysts at least
to consider the East Asia East and
Southeast Asia quite different but the
East Asian economic miracle is
considered quite real so chief economist
of the World Bank Joseph Stiglitz highly
regarded economists he's in the after
the crisis he's emphasized that the East
Asian economic miracle as he calls it
was his words and amazing achievement
historically without precedent he also
points out that it was based on quite
significant departures from official
doctrines and that it ought to be
sustainable unless it's destroyed by
financial markets he only quote him he
points out that in the East Asian
countries South Korea and Taiwan
government as in Japan a government took
major responsibility for promotion of
economic growth abandoning what he calls
the religion that markets know best in
intervening to enhance technology
transfer relative equality education
health along he doesn't say this but
along with industrial policy
coordination and strict capital controls
he also mentions that the rich countries
hadn't followed somewhat similar paths
as the World Bank has also acknowledged
but nowhere near accurately and in fact
that's the basis for economic
development historically and in every
case that we know well what happened
after the Bretton Woods system collapsed
in early 70s essentially the Golden Age
ended since then it's been a period of
much poor economic performance again you
can argue about causal effects but the
facts are not controversial there's been
a slowdown specially in the industrial
world I mean let's keep to the
industrial world the Western industrial
world at you know a little variation
from place to place but essentially
there's been a slowdown of growth both
of the economy and the productivity
that's noticeable also trade if you look
more closely
it's a lot of claims about an explosion
of trade and there's a few instances
where it's correct but overall it's not
trade seems to be going up relative to
the general economy but that's because
the economy has been going down faster
than the rate of birth of trade has been
going down so the ratios higher the it's
one major effect for economic
performance
secondly particularly in the United
States and England but to some extent in
the general industrial world incomes
have stagnated or declined for the great
majority of population in the United
States working conditions have gotten a
lot worse Social Services as you know
have deteriorated infrastructures
collapsed there's huge debt the welfare
state is kind of in tatters sort of what
would be expected from the decisions of
the virtual Senate in the United States
and in England inequality has which was
declining from during the Golden Age
it's rapidly increased it's known back
to roughly what it was in the 1920s that
all of these effects leave a kind of
superfluous population very you know
don't contribute much to profit
formation in third world dependencies
you carry out things like what's called
social cleansing in Colombia like you
kill them or something like that but
this is a civilized societies that we
treat them differently we throw them in
jail and the rate of incarceration has
been going up very rapidly right along
with these policies it's sort of made
easier by race class correlations and so
on but the basic phenomenon is not much
to do with them so throw them in jail
around 1989 - with crime rates
incidental a u.s. crime rates are sort
of toward the high end of the rich
countries but not off the spectrum there
was one exception namely killing with
guns but that has to do with a gun
culture and the gun was not crime rates
the and as you'd expect in around 1980
the United States was within the
spectrum
sort of toward the high end in
incarceration of the population that
tripled during the 1980s it's still
going up very fast it's now five to ten
times as high as any other industrial
society and it's long been a world
record among any societies that have
meaningful statistics the and it's not
insubstantial
so for example the numbers in prison
numbers of working-age people in prison
would if he counted them that would add
about two percent to the unemployment
rate which is no small amount there's
also a big prison industry developing
and you know it's becoming a major
private boondoggle even for big military
industry and so on a lot of money
involved
well that's these are other changes
another change is that particularly in
the 1990s profits went through the roof
the business press has been just
ecstatic through the 90s actually this
is up until the middle of this year
things changed around August but up
until then the business press was
absolutely ecstatic
you know stupendous dazzlingly couldn't
find words for it
a major change around 1970 early 70s was
an astronomical increase in capital
flows that came from the deregulation
and mostly short-term very short-term
like around 80 percent of it is a week
or less you know I mean it comes back to
where it started within a week often
days or hours the amounts are now huge
nobody really knows but it's estimated
about a trillion and a half dollars a
day or something of that sort it's
virtually unrelated to the real economy
probably harmful to it back in 1970 when
the total was far smaller about 90% of
foreign exchanges were estimated to be
concerned with the real economy meaning
like investment and trade 10%
speculative by now general guesses are
around
maybe 5% related to the real economy the
rest speculative and very short-term
with the effects you'd expect if there's
well not those of you that's well-known
in the economics literature that there's
basically no theory for financial
markets there govern standard
terminology is by panics manias and
crashes there's a lot of irrational herd
behavior as what's called technical
trading or noise trading you know not
related to economic fundamentals but
just like you know guesses as to how to
make money in three seconds and so on it
leads them there has been much more
volatility of markets since the early
1970s a lot of panics manias and crashes
unpredictable and never predicted and
bigger and bigger every time they come
around nobody knows what's going on and
they the honest people admit it recently
the the Bank for International
Settlements which is I guess ranks as
the most conservative institution around
it's the central bank of central bankers
they recently came out with their latest
report in which they said look we don't
know what's going on and they urged
humility in the face of the turmoil in
the world as I said it's now becoming a
crisis because rich people are getting
worried instead of the usual victims the
IMF did a study of banking crises from
1980 to 1995 at 15 year period and they
found that about a fifth of the country
that's almost every country in the world
around 180 countries 1/5 of them had
serious banking crises and another and
another 60% had significant problems
often recurrent problems a lot of them
bailouts and you know again very
volatile and irrational markets and
rapid fluttering fluctuations of
exchange rates and response to the
speculative flows all of that means
everything's out of hand and now as I
say it's worrying rich people the
another feature of this
period since around the 1970 has been an
attack on free markets that's not what
you read but that's what's been
happening the words of me just the head
of economic current had a head of
economic research of the World Trade
Organization did a technical monograph
on this a couple years ago he described
this period as one of what he called
sustained assault on free markets led by
the Reagan administration he estimated
the Reaganite protectionist measures
which were extreme at about three times
those of other industrial countries in
their effects these are often not
tariffs they're what are called
non-tariff barriers just various other
devices which essentially block trade
and are intended to do that during the
Reagan years which was accepted the
Reagan period is called conservative but
what that's supposed to mean it was an
extreme radical statist administration
the ratio of state expenditures to gross
national products shot up the debt shot
up and protectionism also increased it
approximately doubled during the Reagan
years broke post-war records public
subsidies increasing enormous Lee they
were bailouts transfer transfers to the
public sector in effect it was there was
reasons for it the reason was go back to
around 1980 you'll notice there was a
lot of concern about the industrial
decline about the decline of the
American economy and there were calls
for what was called reindustrialization
of America and in order to carry out the
reindustrialization of America the
Reagan administration turned to the
classic device government spending in
particular Pentagon spending which since
the Second World War has been the
absolute foundation of the economy every
dynamic sector of the economy
sort of virtually everyone flows off it
some extreme examples like a current
example is the Internet but computers
electronics you pick it that largely
initiated and subsidized through by the
public then handed over to private
capital
and the Pentagon has been a favorite
device for doing this one reason why the
Pentagon budget stays high independently
of any conflict and why it's strongly
supported in fact increased by people
like Gingrich and lot and others parade
as conservatives can in other words all
this market discipline is fine for poor
people but not for rich folk they have
to keep the cycle of dependency going
well in 1980 it was a big problem and
they had to reindustrialize America they
turned to the Pentagon as and there was
a huge increase in the Pentagon budget
it was pretty explicit what it was about
and so for example the Pentagon picked
up developed a program manufacturing
technology program manTech it was called
which was going to overcome the failures
of American management American
management had failed to keep up with
modern management techniques that had
been pioneered largely by the Japanese
leaning production and all this kind of
stuff so they had to get be given a shot
in the arm the Pentagon devised this
program to design what they called the
factory of the future with automation
and flexible production lean production
and all this kind of stuff and that
purpose was straightforward it was in
their words to boost the market share an
industrial leadership of American
industry which had fallen way behind
because of management incompetence the
same is true of the National
Laboratories so the do-e labs the
Department of Energy labs their explicit
goal is to their words the move
federally developed technologies into
private industry and academia academia
is just one of the funnels by which
public funds go into private pockets my
job to it I shouldn't complain too much
mit is a large part of this but that's
the purpose of the end of the government
labs and the reindustrialization worked
the its the idea was to overcome
management failures to save central
components of the economy the whole
industrial system from mainly Japanese
competition and also to put them in a
position to dominate the emerging
technologies and markets of the future
again as I say the internet is and
information technology generally are
good examples the internet for example
was designed for about 30 years mostly
in the public sector first by the
Pentagon and the National Science
Foundation was finally commercialized
over the opposition of about two-thirds
of the population all right but that was
just a few years ago in 1995 in fact to
the extent that there had been some
private involvement but if you check it
back it's usually federally funded
initiative came out of the information
processing technology office of the
Pentagon for the most part the since the
sixties but that's only one example well
all that's continuing under Clinton
including radical interference with free
trade when it's convenient and that runs
across the spectrum of choices so the
Clinton administration has in one way or
another barred everything from you know
things ranging from Mexican tomatoes
openly because US consumers preferred
them to Florida grown ones they said so
that's at one end the other end Japanese
super computers which were blocked by
prohibitive tariffs pretty recently for
the open purpose of protecting US
manufacturers like Cray enterprise which
is main had been the main US
manufacturer of supercomputers called
private enterprise but only because the
profits are private the markets are
government under buy America programs
and things like that
much of the technology and the funding
has been public but the privates are in
the profits are indeed in private and
when they couldn't manage just slammed
high tariffs on so that goes on and
that's an old story that's the history
good part of the history of industrial
development
from 94 Britain as well before us I go
to the United States goes back to the
early 1820s well in the recent years
mid-90s there's been a lot of euphoria
in the United States again up till about
August of this year it's a switch point
but up till then there's been a great
deal of euphoria about you know what's
called a fairytale economy so you could
read in front-page headlines in the New
York Times about saying that Americans
were smug and prosperous and the happy
glow of the American boom and fat and
happy America is enjoying one of the
greatest booms in American history and
on and on if you read through these
euphoric accounts they always give one
example that's the stock market and it's
true the stock market has been an
absolute fairy tale especially for the
top 1% of American households who won't
close to half the stock and other assets
and top 10% who own most of the rest
what happens when you go down to the
next 10% you know the next decile from
80 to 90 percent of income well it turns
out that their net worth has declined in
the 1990s meaning their debts increased
faster than their assets and as you go
down below the next 10% down to the
bottom and the story just gets worse and
worse
80% approximately if families are
working a lot more hours on the worst
conditions just to keep from losing more
ground the they haven't yet recovered
the level of the of 1989 according to
the latest statistics little on early
1970s when the great economic boom began
to take off all of this is without
precedent in American history this is a
recovery from recession and it's the
first recovery in which most of the
population was basically left out trying
to get back to where they were before
the boom as for growth no economic
growth and so on
this greatest boom in American history
is in fact one of the worst the worst in
the post-war period it's the slowest
it's below economic growth is below even
the quite anemic 70s in the 80s
way below the 50s in the 60s it's it's
great it's a fairy tale for some people
undoubtedly and those happen to be the
ones who are writing the articles about
it and the ones they meet and elegant
restaurants and right parties and so on
and so forth so yeah for them it's a
fairy tale economy you do get fake
there's studies of consumer you know of
consumer optimism that sort of thing
they've been running pretty high but you
look a little more closely and you'll
discover that the main reason is that
people as the researchers point out have
lowered their expectations so now if you
can get by that's enough you know then
you're happy you don't expect your
children to do much better maybe worse
that's a change it's a new change in
American history well that's the fairy
tale economy and the reasons for the
fairy tale are also pre frankly
explained and we should listen to the
explanations so maybe the most powerful
and most respected person in the United
States is the Fed chair Alan Greenspan
and he's explained he's very proud of
the economy that he presided over and he
explained how it works to Congress and
his congressional testimony he
attributed the fairy tale to what he
called greater worker insecurity meaning
workers are intimidated you know they're
afraid to ask for wage for raises and
wages because they can just be fired or
their jobs can be transferred to Mexico
or something like that the Clinton
administration agreed economic report of
the president attributed the economy
with fairy tale economy again they're
very proud of it to what they called
significant wage restraint yeah that's
the same thing a greater worker
insecurity workers are too in
to ask for a share in the good times the
it's reported in the business press
Businessweek had a study a couple months
ago showing that about 90% of working
people are insecure and that's good for
the health of the economy any of you who
study economics know that there's a
phenomenon called health of the economy
which has actually nothing to do with
health of the population I mean even in
the technical sense and the health of
the economy is improved if people are
scared and wages are down and you don't
have to waste money on irrational things
like what's good for the general
population keeps inflation low enough to
please financial institutions and
concentrates wealth where it ought to be
top a few percent well there are a lot
of reasons for that threat of job
transfers is one that's one of the main
purposes of the so-called trade
agreements and there's many others I
will skip further discussion about this
because I'm going on too long for a
while it looked as if this whole story
was gonna work there were it looked as
if this fairy tale for the top few would
work out and that it would be possible
to maintain the fraud about the markets
knowing best and so on and so forth
while calling on plenty of massive state
intervention to ensure that the rich
don't have to face market discipline
where that was all moving along rather
nicely until about last summer when
again the threat started to reach the
people who matter since then it's been
there's been a remarkable change in
economic orthodoxy it does change very
quickly very fast if you look over the
years sois
flipping up and back it's a very
flexible science it turns out now the
orthodoxy has changed there are calls
for capital controls from pretty
surprising places like the
Bank for International Settlements
business press World Bank in one former
and others debates about it
even inside the IMF the last bastion
there's concern about it now and also
some of the most passionate academic
advocates of free trade one of them
well-known Columbia University professor
Jagdish Bhagwati has been writing angry
articles all over the place is one of
the most prominent free trade advocates
in the profession enough in foreign
affairs and so on condemning what he
calls the wall street treasury complex
which is destroying the International
economy by imposing policies that free
financial markets I'm quoting him
through the IMF and so on that's that's
change and I think the change can be
dated at least and may be attributed
least plausibly attributed to the change
and the victims up until now it's been
mostly poor people the majority of the
population in countries like the United
States the third world has been
completely devastated by this but
sectors have been left out the people
who count and now they're worried
they're worried that the whole system
will lead to a kind of global meltdown
well how to there's a reason why they're
calling for humility they don't know how
to tame the destructive forces would
have been unleashed there have been some
proposals they look reasonable they've
been advanced by leading economists for
20 years or so they're now sort of
coming out of it you know they're now
sort of moving into the public
discussion they might work they might
not they've been kept off the agenda of
the powerful because they liked the way
things were going they liked those
outcomes no maybe not well is this
so-called globalized economy really out
of control that's the call for humility
is a good idea but still given what we
know it's pretty hard to believe as I
mentioned in gross terms it's not all
that new and there are novelties but
by gross measures it's kind of like
pre-world War one and most of the
interactions most of the interchanges
are within the major industrial
societies with sometimes called the
Triad you know Europe your European
Union you know North America and Japan
well those are all countries where you
can Institute with the public in fact
could act to institute economic policy
changes these are countries where you
can have public policy decisions there
aren't going to be any military coos for
example it's not like a third world
country
it's that means and even within the
framework of existing institutions there
are plenty of things you can think of
that could well be enacted to restore
sort of you know what's called golden
age type structures and there's no
reason to stop there I mean the
institutions are not self legitimizing
and never have been in history there's
still not I left didn't they have to be
challenged justified if they can't be
justified which I think they can they
can be changed
that's all subject to popular will with
very few constraints in the rich
industrial countries of course it's
completely natural for all the doctrinal
institutions to try to make you feel
hopeless to you know the divert public
attention away from the crucial issues
and try to bring about a mood of sort of
hopelessness and despair and you know
turn people individual survival
strategies and so on and if you were
working for a PR agency nobody would
have to tell you that that's what you
have to do is obvious that that's what
you have to do it's been going on for
centuries it's understandable
and as always understanding can liberate
people it can liberate them to design
and follow a very different paths and
these could go quite far they could go
to the dismantling of oppressive
legitimate institution
new democratic more democratic
institutional arrangements you can right
through the economy sort of obvious
where to look there are plenty of others
and in fact it may we ought to be
thinking about somehow trying to make it
possible should be within our reach to
address in some serious way the needless
suffering and injustice that are that
really define contemporary society and
to demonstrate that the human species is
not some kind of lethal mutation which
is destined to destroy itself and good
deal more in what amounts to the flick
of an eye from an evolutionary point of
view that's actually not an unlikely
prospect if things continue on the in
the present the prevailing conditions of
social life okay I'll stop there
[Applause]
okay could we have some lights and we
all have not that light
I'm gonna have two mics down the front
sir okay very good so come down and put
your questions keep keep your questions
short and bear in mind please that your
questions and comments bear in mind that
we have interpreters here so keep them
clear and just about see the mics
somebody over there yeah go ahead yeah
working no okay
in your opinion what is the year 2000
computer crisis and what effect will
this have on the world order as you've
described it I'm the big specialist on
this and you know I'm sure there are
people here who can give them more
competent answers than I can but there's
no doubt that it's pretty serious so for
example the u.s. security officials are
very concerned about it for one reason
because they're afraid that the air
defense systems will collapse and the
Soviet Union and China where they
haven't even started to address these
questions yet and the way what are
called air defense systems work they can
shoot off missiles you know with very
little you know kind of a hair-trigger
in fact the US has actually offered
China and Russia new air defense systems
to try to make sure that they don't you
know by accident happen to destroy the
world all right that's one problem but
there are plenty of others I mean the I
mean I imagine that the you know the big
banks and so on of probably they made
sure their interests are cared for but
a lot of other problems around that
nobody really knows as far as I can tell
nobody basically knows it could be the
main advice people are getting is stay
in your homes for the first week or two
of the year 2000 don't take any trips
you know store up on food beforehand and
see how things kind of even out I don't
know I mean and I've never haven't read
anything that seems to know is that one
working I don't think he'll oh yeah yeah
I wanted you to comment briefly on the
you talked a lot about the institutional
economic order and I was interested in
your feelings on the currently ongoing
high level discussions on the
multilateral agreement on investment in
the obvious lack of public discourse
mm-hmm okay I've written a lot about
that if you're interested so it's in
print I actually did a review that the
multilateral agreement on investments
which you get which is always for the
moment did the it was this is a well
sort of the nature of it was captured
rather nicely in a Businessweek headline
last February called it the the
explosive trade deal you've never heard
of both parts of which were true it's an
explosive deal not really a trade deal
it's an explosive investor rights
agreement which gives investors
extraordinary rights like nothing you
know the most extreme that have ever
been imagined with no obligations I mean
all the huge treaty 150 pages all the
obligations are on what they call States
which means people you know the state is
is sometimes the state's dictatorship
sometimes marginally you're more or less
democratic but the obligations are all
on people and they're in public
institutions and the rights are all for
private power unaccountable private
power and the rights are pretty
extraordinary
I mean corporations had been given the
rights of persons which is outlandish
early in this century something would
scandalize classical liberals they
should say but that has already happened
although it could be and I think should
be rescinded because it's outlandish but
this treaty like parts of NAFTA actually
gives them the rights of states which is
something novel and you know time to go
into it anyhow it's been going on it was
initially originally they tried to they
thought they'd put it through the World
Trade Organization but that didn't work
because there was a lot of objection
from third world countries India and
Malaysia so it shifted over to the OECD
the rich countries you know twenty nine
richest countries that's more controlled
and it went on for about three years and
negotiations with virtually no public
comment I did a almost complete review
in the United States and England and
Australia and until the one act until
early this year that's after close to
three years there was a like statistical
error you know occasional or mention
here and there it's not that it was
unknown it was perfectly well known so
the business press the business world
knew all about it their lobbying groups
were involved in it from the beginning
the you know it must have known but it
was kept it's one of those inconvenient
facts that was kept dark to borrow war
wealth phrase the one partial exception
was Canada in Canada in early 1997 it
sort of broke through because of popular
activism right and that led to a lot of
pressure and a lot of publicity you know
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and so
on in the rest of the industrial world
it's sort of an to break through mostly
from public activism early this year and
the the signing date was supposed to be
last April but they backed off in near
panic the OECD there were some quite
comical articles about it the London
Financial Times which is you know the
premier business daily in the world had
an article called hordes of vigilantes
and it was about the hordes of
vigilantes who
the OECD and the corporations and the
you know the rich countries and the
transnational and the international
financial institutions this gorgeou
vigilantes which a lot of activists just
overwhelmed them and frightened them and
they had to back off from trying to do
it and they quoted people who warned
that it may not be as easy as it has
been in the past to arrange
international agreement in secret and
then have them rubber stamped by
Parliament's that's the way it's been
working until now but now we may be in
trouble because all those vigilantes are
around the trade unionists
environmentalists you know grassroots
activists and so on it's other crisis of
democracy and in fact a pretty stunning
victory for the vigilantes if you look
at the forces that were arrayed against
each other well they tried to put it off
until October and last October but it
collapsed I mean by that time a couple
of major countries it pulled out France
pulled out Australia pulled out the
United States kind of mixed and for the
moment at least it's on the Shelf which
means they're gonna sneak it in some
other way the major effort of the United
States has been to try to push it
through the IMF rules by revising the
IMF articles to include conditionalities
that include a lot of the multilateral
agreement the my m-f is properly secret
you know so it never gets reported and
in fact operates in secret so that's a
better forum but people are interested
or to keep their eyes on do you think
the recent failure in Paris could be at
all attributed to look to the what you
talked about going on in the stock
market in August yeah partly I mean
partly just the power centers are scared
but partly and I think we shouldn't
under look underestimate this this horde
of vigilantes really made a difference
the same happened last fall with a year
ago that is with fast track up until as
the Clinton administration argued
correctly fast track had been standard
legislation instantly this fast-track
issue doesn't really have anything to do
with free trade I mean even if you put
aside the fact that the
so-called trade agreements aren't free
trade by any in any meaningful sense the
fast-track issue has to do with
democracy
so even most passionate advocate of free
trade would be in favor of would be
against fast-tracked if they also
believed in democracy I mean fast track
is just an arrangement which allows
exactly what I quoted it allows deals to
be made behind closed doors and
rubber-stamp by Parliament's that's
fast-track this has got nothing to do
with free trade but in fact it had
always been accepted I think for about
twenty years
a brief gap but last fall when the
Clinton administration tried to push it
through with like a hundred percent
media support as far as I know enormous
corporate backing they had to back off
mainly by constituent pressure so you
know people were banging on the doors of
their congressional representatives and
they backed off even if they were in
favor of it never came up well those are
all indications of how much can be done
even by extremely disorganized groups
with no unity and you know very little
interaction and you know scattered all
over the place
just imagine what could be done by
really organized popular movements
that's one of the reasons why the end of
the doctrinal system has to you know the
institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young the
trilateral commission they got to work
overtime to do their job make sure that
people don't have these bad thoughts and
worry about inconvenient facts but these
are victories that should be recognized
I mean they're kind of defensive
victories they didn't you know they
prevented something but they're a signal
that you can go on to more substantial
ones what do you think of direct
democracy well it depends what you mean
by it well I mean if you mean by it for
example that say as contrasted with
representative democracy that depends I
mean any complicated society is gonna
have to have some kind of representation
I think
think that's undoubted the question is
how it works I you you you were my rock
syndicated you're dissatisfied with the
way power is acquired and wielded in
this country they may not as mine do
with thee you ended by suggesting that
perhaps it's time for some new ideas but
that doesn't mean do it I mean none of
them one of them is that everybody votes
more or less more less irrelevant and
it's irrelevant because that's one of
the ways in which the doctrinal system
diverts your attention from what really
matters what really matters is the fact
that the major institutions in the
society are under totalitarian control
after all what's a corporation you know
a corporation is just a tyrannical
system one of the most tyrannical
systems that humans have ever devised
they've been given extraordinary rights
by the courts not by legislation early
in this century
they're like the multilateral agreement
would give them actually the rights of
states they're basically unaccountable
to the public when they've been given
the rights of persons that means for
example they have the right to
propagandize so like they've been given
the rights of free speech which is
insane you know these are collectivist
institutions they've been given the
right to advertise in fact that your
expense so you get the tax free so you
get you pay for the privilege of having
your minds destroyed and they're they
you know they own the information system
and they control the information system
that what are the media you know huge
corporations parts of bigger
corporations that sets the framework of
discussion discussion it the major
decisions that affect what happens in
the economy and social life are made
behind closed doors very little public
accountability they have the right
freedom from search and seizure you know
Fourth Amendment rights means you can't
know anything about what they're doing
you know all right
and and they have enormous power
furthermore
you know I mean let's describe this free
trade it's ridiculous I mean these about
maybe nobody these are secret
institutions so all figures have to be
taken with a big grain of salt because
nobody really knows but the guesses are
that by international economists that
maybe 40 percent or so of US trade is
actually internal to corporations
meaning it's not trade at all you know
it's just moving something across a
border it's no more trade than moving
from Indiana to Illinois or something
like that happens across a border you
know to get cheaper labor to avoid
environmental restrictions and so on
well you know 40% is not a small number
and that's a vast underestimate because
there are also complicated strategic
alliances among alleged competitors so
IBM and Toshiba and Siemens and so on
are working together you know they're
working together on design on marketing
and so on and in fact in fact it's
gotten to the point where some
international economists call it a new
system what they call alliance
capitalism
you know big networks of tyrannical
institutions basically running the world
I mean in comparison with this the
difference between you know everybody
voting and everybody not voting is
pretty trivial these are the major
questions so you think the public
opinion polls are a sham no they're not
at all sham in fact they're extremely
interesting and you should pay attention
to them the the United States is very
public of painful czar different from
votes incidentally totally different in
fact public opinions and the results of
votes often turn out to be radically
different and some of the reasons are
given by the fate of referendum so for
example take where I live Massachusetts
for years you know every year there was
a referendum on the progressive income
tax for the state
now that would benefit you know
overwhelming benefit for the general
population you take a look at the public
opinion polls at the beginning very
strong support for it and then it slowly
declines by Election Day it's a minority
why did decline
well huge propaganda campaign
warning people that if you do this all
the business is going to flee out of
Massachusetts you won't have a job your
children will starve and so on yeah
that's just what the guys are willing
the information system want you to
believe so public a pin you should look
at public opinion polls for the same
reason that they are taken well why do
we have so many public opinion polls in
the United States and they're mostly
business or initiated the propaganda
institutions like the PR industry they
want to keep their finger on the public
pulse they've got to know how to design
the propaganda so they want to know what
people are thinking so in fact if you
want to find out you can find out too
and you can find out how these opinions
are changed sometimes sometimes they're
very resilient strikingly resilient so
say take the Vietnam War there was huge
propaganda justifying the war I mean
among articulate people there was
virtually no opposition to it contrary
to what you're told
there was pragmatic opposition you know
it's not working or something like that
but you know there's that kind of
opposition and Hitler's General Staff
after Stalingrad the principled
opposition was almost non-existent
this has been studied incidentally
literally almost non-existent on the
other hand if you look at public opinion
polls they're quite different so public
opinion studies were taken regularly by
the Gallup poll is one of the questions
every you know regular questions and the
Gallup polls from around 1970 to the
early 90s last one I saw was what do you
think of the war in Vietnam given an
open set of choices you know like 10
options where you usually get low
numbers but it was a steady 70 percent
roughly you know plus or minus a little
that chose fundamentally wrong and
immoral not a mistake
there's nobody in educated opinion
articulate opinion whoever said that I
mean everybody who answered the question
that way was making it up for themselves
well you know that's it's striking
indication of the divergence between
public opinion and policy actually
another one is the multilateral
agreement on investments which is just
mentioned as soon as it became public
you know the whole thing collapsed
because for exactly the reason that the
negotiator said looks like an end to an
we can make deals behind closed doors
and have them rubber stamped by
Parliament
there's Ravel getting involved in things
those are some of the major reasons for
for the kind of thing that Orwell was
talking about it for you know what
controlled and free societies in fact
the more you you know the less force as
people win more freedom as we people
have you know meaning that the power to
coerce by violence has declined the
importance of propaganda has increased
and that's well understood I mean you
can you know you read it in manuals of
the public relations industry and the
productions of academic intellectuals
you know the founders of modern
political science public intellectuals
and so on you have to control the public
mind because we can't control people in
any other way well under those
conditions public opinion polls are
important and interesting public
intellectuals and so on you have to
control the public mind because we can't
control people in any other way well
under those conditions public opinion
polls are important and interesting but
voting is something different because
people are giving highly structured
choices structured by an information
system which is dedicated to maintaining
the power of those who owned and run it
and that power is enormous I'm in the
corporate control of the media's like a
small part of it corporate control of
the economy and social life is a far
stronger part the virtual Senate that I
mentioned is another part I mean unless
we think about those institutions
worrying I mean you know concern about
things like proportional representation
or you know voting by computer and so on
may be of some interest but it's like
10:30 effect Noam you mentioned how
geologists have their findings are
having an impact on the long term geo
strategic impact or interests in the
Middle East I was wondering if you could
comment on on a different type of
scientists in
act on the same resource in particular
that of climate scientists who are now
estimating that over the next hundred
years we can safely use maybe 40 years
of current usage of fossil fuels without
having some serious impacts both on on
the ecology but also on a number of
human social structures and what that
will what potential that has for
altering the geostrategic balance and
also for being an issue around which
people can confront these sources of
power that you talk about you and so
just to be clear I'm not suggesting that
policymakers or advisors are paying much
attention to any of this the reason is
that they think an extremely short term
in a short term framework and
furthermore a lot of them are account
professional economists so if you look
at the OECD you know the rich countries
they don't apparently don't even have a
major study group on this I and the ones
that they have are mostly staffed by
professional economists who just like
the head of the World Bank said they
have a religion and the religion says it
can't happen no it can't happen because
markets are perfect you know so as soon
as the price starts to go up some
miracle will happen and people will find
an alternative fuel well maybe you know
maybe maybe not
nobody knows but if you believe in the
religion you know have to worry about it
like most religions there's an answer
you know you got it in graduate school
but as far as I know there is no serious
planning going on about this and the
professional articles about it say they
can't discover anything serious planning
it should be a serious issue and what
u.s. planners are surely concerned about
are the visible steps towards
realignments in the Middle East region
that they're concerned about and they
certainly are concerned about
controlling it and they are concerned
about China in the United States about
trying to there's a conflict between the
United States and Europe over Iran right
now I mean the Europeans mostly want to
reintegrated into the world system the
United States for its own reasons wants
to keep it out and punished all right
and that's apparently a good bit of the
background for all this talk about where
the pipeline ought to go and you know
how much oil there is around the Caspian
Sea and so on so that kind of short-term
stuff yeah people are thinking about but
not there's no reason to believe that
they're thinking about the long term
questions I think we ought to be
thinking about them but doesn't mean
planners or on the climatologist yeah
you're right I mean there's just a
overwhelming consensus that there are
big problems coming nobody knows what
they are you know like one of the
consequences the critics there's like
about six scientists in the world or
something who are pick up about half the
newsprint who are regularly trotted out
to say which is true that the models
aren't very good and there are a lot of
things you don't understand and so on so
there's a lot of uncertainties but of
course a point about uncertainty is that
you know the guesses could be off in
either direction that's one of the
elementary properties of uncertainty so
the predictions could be overstating
which is the only thing you ever hear or
they could be understating which you
don't hear you know and again for
reasons of short-term gain and profit in
fact until the ozone layer started
breaking up in the North you didn't hear
anything about that either you know as
long as it was just people down down
there yeah and then they had they had
alternatives but it's really hit the
Wall Street Journal and so on when
people who count we're starting to get
affected and right now people who count
or not are doing pretty well with oil
stocks the big mergers that are coming
along like Exxon and Mobil those guys
are probably thinking about it you know
but that doesn't but that doesn't mean
that planners are on the climate issues
the ecological issues are there that's
sort of what I had in mind in my last
statement it could well turn out that
humans will simply quickly be any a
lethal mutation that could happen and in
fact as to the consequences of global
warning you can find predictions all
over the place I mean some of them are
that you know the
level rise meters and meters which may
happen but another fairly widely held
view is that the Europe will move into
an ice age because the Gulf Stream will
be redirected farther south which would
make Europe something like you know
ain't Greenland or something like that
and the effects of that on the global
global society are you know just
incalculable another prediction is
reasonably widely held is that the
Midwest US will become a dust bowl which
would have a terrific effect on global
food supplies for bad reasons because so
much of it has been concentrated there
so you know there are all kinds of
serious dangers people ought to be
worrying about these things I wanted to
ask you about the possibility of a
solution that as you mentioned in Latin
America the basic other force was the
masses and that's also true about the
whole world considering that now what
the situation is that basically the
workers union in their United States
have been demolished for all practical
purposes and that's kind of happening in
Europe to them today and what's
happening in the third world
there is no OPEC anymore and there are
low nations don't exist basically most
of the progressive forces have been
attacked and we can how do you see that
because from where you are I'm sure you
have a better idea that now I have at
least now we're all guessing but my
guesses are a little different that do
you see that the movements the little
movements here and there somehow will
come together and create a mass movement
that can connect internationally because
that's basically what we need and being
a left person and some of the left ways
of doing things have been discredited by
still I'm discredited by who by their
powers to get my parents did they ever
create
no no they tell you they're discredited
but that's because they want you to feel
help okay first just to back up a little
I mean I think you ought to be cautious
about describing an OPEC as a
progressive force it wasn't even
independent yeah but you know just take
a look at US and Britain and their
reaction to the rising oil price they
didn't mind in fact the US and Britain
kind of suppressed I mean Britain that's
kind of like the little puppy dog they
do what they're told but the United
States in fact you know you can read
professional literature which says refer
to the US Treasury and then has a
footnote saying that's shorthand for the
US UK Treasury but they they were not so
much opposed to the oil price rise and
the reason is they sort of benefited
from it these are the their main
competitors the other industrial
countries Minh in fact you know the US
was actually running a positive trade
balance with Saudi Arabia after the
price went up because they figured out
ways of getting the Arab facade to
recycle the profits that's why there was
such a huge armaments floated to the
oil-producing countries mostly comes
back here and also don't forget that the
end construction projects and all sorts
of things
that's where Bechtel got you know rich
from from and don't forget that when the
oil price goes up at the pump the
profits go up too and the profits are
mostly us British companies so they're
perfectly happy to have the price go up
another effect of the early seventies
price rise was that it enabled the oil
majors to bring online production fields
they knew about but we're not using
because they weren't profitable enough
when the price went up high enough you
could start using North Sea oil which is
what saved the Thatcher government from
totally destroying England and you could
bring along Alaska oil
which are you know wasting resources
they're not big but they're around for
20 years or so and that was there
because of the price rise so the oil
companies were not unhappy about it and
in fact it was a meeting and I think
around February 1974 so were Kissinger
and you know the White House called in
rich countries other and kind of told
them you know laid down the line on this
not to make a fuss about the oil price
rise and if in fact the US and Britain
led the way out of the you know short
term global recession then because they
weren't being harmed by it and if they
had been harmed that our Arab facade
would not have stayed in business very
long you can be sure that they would
have you know they did their job or else
they're out the so I I mean you know
there are big problems with energy but
not that I don't
I wouldn't quite say that the American
unions have been destroyed they
certainly have been damaged they were
damaged seriously by the trade
agreements they were damaged even more
by just criminal acts authorized by the
government so the Reagan administration
effectively told corporations that they
were not going to that they were not
going to enforce the laws against
illegal firing of union organizers and
so on this is pretty open actually it
was reviewed in the business press brief
frankly they simply said and the Clinton
administration is continuing with that
so the number of firing firings of
workers for attempting to organize
started shooting way up it's all it
legal but doesn't matter if nobody's
enforcing the law if you have a criminal
state you know crime pays you know very
well and one of the effects of that and
threat to transfer and so on that's
certainly weakened the labor movement
along with other you know bigger
developments but it's leveled off and
there's a recovery and it's it's not a
big change in terms of numbers but it's
quite a change in terms of consciousness
so you know talks like say this you can
give to labor audiences
years ago you can now easily you know
and in fact they're not militant enough
these stalks because they want to see
more you know there's these things
oscillate in fact for the first time I
mean the International you're right
about stressing the importance of
international solidarity that's very
important and there's not much of it but
just take a look at American labor you
know up until quite recently US labor
internationally it was like an adjunct
to the CIA you know they were working
hard to undermine unions and undermine
democratic regimes and so on that's no
big secret that's changed the people in
the international office now are people
who are very much attuned to problem say
of Latin American labor and in fact
there are some beginnings you know
they're not huge but there's some
beginnings of cross-border solidarity
and anti-sweatshop agitation you know
pushing you know this very limited
wording and NAFTA which was put into
silence public opinion about labor
rights but that's being pushed sometimes
constructively by American unions
sometimes by Mexican workers and things
and those are good signs a Europe is a
big problem in Europe interaction among
the labor unions is apparently I don't
know a lot about this but from what I
understand is very slight you know
different languages and so on and so
forth and that's got to become a more
significant factor especially with the
European Union
but that doesn't seem to be in any ways
a lost cause and all the talk you read
about discrediting the Left that's
ridiculous I mean these these views that
they say are discredited or ones they've
been screaming and denouncing for all
their lives you know all through history
nothing discredited about them like mild
social democratic policies that work
quite well you know within limits
because they leave private power
essentially unassailed but it's the
collapse of these policies that's been
devastating policies weren't dis great
the and they're by no means the limit
they're the beginning I think there's
and things like what we're talking about
before says a popular really quite
spontaneous popular reaction to things
like the MA I
that's rather striking that's done with
no organization and by now you know
their structures forming they can
interact and they can grow so it doesn't
seem to me a terribly depressing
prospect you can worry about the pace
maybe it's not adequate probably isn't
but you know the right kinds of things
are happening yeah well you know there
are things you can be amiss you know I
mean optimism and pessimism are kind of
like personal you know that belongs to
that's what you worried when you're
sitting alone somewhere that's what you
think about otherwise you just stay
optimistic that's the only way anything
will ever happen dr. Tomsky
just to let you know ahead of time this
is a critical comment it sounds as if
your work draws a lot on CWM ales marks
and Emanuel Wallace teens thinking and
I'm wondering what's new and exciting
about Chomsky in theory so for us
students are the social sciences in the
room what can we take away from this
lecture yeah
well certainly not I mean especially
first well there's no theory in fact I
don't know of any theories in the social
sciences I mean I don't think the term
theory should be applied to fields as
intellectually thin as the social
sciences so there's no theory oh there's
just some common sense observations I
started off with you remember by saying
that views of this kind are commonly
described as Marxist which is kind of
ironic because the clearest articulation
is people like Adam Smith and Winston
Churchill and so on which is true the
and I think that most of this is kind of
common sense so there's no theory what's
the
oh the theory is very different from
understanding most of our lives we live
our lives often pretty successfully
without any theories about other people
and we don't have any theories about
other people but you know we get along
and manage our interactions and so on
there's very few areas of human life
where there's anything you might call a
theory so some areas like even in
biology you know it would be but when
you get very far beyond big molecules I
mean starts to become pretty descriptive
sure right there there's an in this in
the world of human affairs I don't think
there's much in the way of theory I
think the message you go to take is use
your use your sense look at history you
know think of obvious things you know
break through the propaganda images
remember that the institutions are
trying to indoctrinate you keep that in
mind compensate for it and if you do
these things I think you can get as good
a sense of the world as anybody has
thank you you mentioned the ongoing
artificial threat of Cuba to the United
States and I wonder if you could address
radio program called Marty that we beam
as a propaganda and maybe on a larger
level the whole apparatus of the
International propaganda broadcasting in
the US mm-hmm
well the u.s. like other countries has a
state propaganda system US Information
Agency and others and it's not
particularly huge I mean this is you
know by comparative standards I don't
think it's considering the size and
scale of the United States it's not
relatively a huge program I mean I don't
think states ought to have the right to
carry out propaganda but even more
important
I don't think private entities or to
have the right to carry out propaganda I
mean maybe the individual the
individuals in them can but not as
entities private entities like the New
York Times or or General Electric or
Jorge Moscone osa who recently died yes
he's a person he should have rights
people should have rights I think
independent of what their views are
but whether organic entities should have
rights that's another question as I
mentioned when organic entities were
given the rights of persons early in
this century that scandalized
conservatives and what are called
classical liberals for perfectly obvious
reasons classical liberal doctrine would
school conservatism held that rights in
here and human beings persons that means
people of flesh and blood
you know not collectivist entities legal
fictions you know there were constituted
and created and given the rights of
persons by courts I think those are
things that we ought to question why
should they have the rights to freedom
from search and seizure for example so
that you don't know what they're doing I
mean I think an individual should have
it like I don't think that cops should
have the right to go into your living
room and find out what you're up to but
what about a an organic entity should
that have those right I mean should Nazi
Germany if it have those rights for
example their Bolshevik Russia I don't
think so
so why General Electric
I was very disappointed on you expose
first part in who's his world power you
did the measure you mentioned the cutter
but you read you emphasize few seconds
ago about history I mentioned you didn't
mention at all about Yugoslavia
I left Yugoslavia 40 years ago I didn't
extend west that time while they're
happy Broz Tito you go south with Yalta
with the Karen etc I'm Serbian by native
cities related States I came in United
States in College Park I've won my
political freedom in New York but I lost
my Jewish wife from New York my personal
freedom we have daughter here who got
graduated diploma last summer
intercultural relations she cannot
understand Jewish mother always right or
wrong father serbian so we polarized our
family of three members into half
question my question is if organization
of European states
37 countries signed about quarter
century ago unknown violation of borders
of any states and former secretary Baker
said in June I do believe 21st June in
Belgrade was not for forty years over
there then border of Yugoslavia
unviolated yet now my adopted country
sided with former colonies country
France Great Britain Portugal Spain
breaking one country two pieces same
people same language two different
alphabets what about your victim poor
people on third part of expose for
economic point of view for second part
about your human rights we are always
with course with with kangaroo tails
them on Saturn my Serbian people there
how you can mush you how you can explain
but you're there how can I explain well
first of all every case has to be
explained on its own
you're quite right I didn't mention you
Slavia but you know i didn't mention a
99% of the world like it for example I
didn't mention Southern Africa where at
the very same time as all the as the
Bosnian war was going on ever even more
people being killed in Angola and in
fact if you go back to the Reagan years
under the rubric of what was called
constructive engagement US and British
backed South African forces killed maybe
a million and a half people and caused
say sixty billion dollars of damage I
didn't mention that either there was a
lot of things I didn't mention you know
but Yugoslavia yeah we could look at it
and we sort of you know I kind of know
what happened the country was first of
all was under a dictatorship since the
40s and that dictatorship had many
negative aspects like dictatorships do
was pretty brutal on the other hand it
did dampen lots of internal hostilities
kept him down
you know the dictatorship collapsed part
of the reason why it collapsed in fact
was IMF rules so during the 1980s it's
not just the IMF I mean during the 1980s
he was likely did go through a kind of
structural adjustment program which had
the usual effects that it's had in the
third world one of the effects that it
had was kind of breaking apart the
social fabric that happened alongside
the breakdown of the dictatorship when
Slovenia and Croatia pulled out and we
don't really know all the details but as
far as is known it looks as though there
was significant German pressure within
the European Union to let him break away
and facilitate their break away which
led as everyone predicted to conflict
between Serbia and Croatia then came you
know the Bosnian atrocities and ended up
with the u.s. moving in I after most of
the dirty work was done an imposing part
in effect partition that's you know
that's more or less what happened now
the struggle was moved on the Kosovo
which is a very complicated issue but
just to mention one aspect of it when I
said
or that the Western powers in Western
opinion don't even you know give minimal
commits have no minimal commitment to
the basic principles of international
order
I mentioned Iraq but I could have just
as well mentioned Kosovo NATO which just
means the United States has no authority
to threaten or use force this is
independent of what you think about
what's going on there you can think
whatever you like but there is no
authorization for the threat of use of
force by the United States or anyone
else there's can the so I mean you're
right when you say that the whole
international order broke down in
Yugoslavia but it did everywhere else to
I mean didn't it break down when the
United States invaded South Vietnam and
then the rest of Indochina and ended up
killing four or five main field paradox
but unifying 16 different countries
dozen different languages in Europe and
breaking one small country to pieces you
would better get from broken glass you
don't drink anymore I'm sorry I don't
see what the paradox is this is just one
of the innumerable problems of
international affairs every one of which
has to be looked at on its own although
you find many of the same factors behind
a lot of two more okay boss there's two
more questions one on each side
dr. Chomsky my thinking is more from the
point of view of India but you can
answer in a more general sense I'd like
you to comment from the point of view of
the so called third world countries in
the face of the globalization for
example if you take democracy democracy
seems to be closely linked with freedom
of choice but safe to take a silly
example if you take say 20 cities in
India and you expose them to a Pepsi or
coke for say one month and then take a
perfectly democratic referendum you
would find that all of them would
support I mean that Pepsi should come
into India so it seems so vulnerable to
the onslaught of the multinational
corporations of globalization bro in
fact wait a moment when India was
pressured an Indian elites agreed
remember and nene leakes agreed and with
the Western pressure to what's called
liberalized I think the first thing that
the first sector of Indian the Indian
economy that was targeted was
advertising so the first thing that
happened is big mostly New York public
relations firms and London public
relations firms went in there and just
like you described you know carried out
huge pressure to try to modify tastes
but that shouldn't really surprise you I
mean the West has been subjected to that
for hundreds of years
it's a I mean that's why we have a huge
public relations industry
it's an enormous industry which is
designed to turn people I mean you know
they're not very secret about what
they're up to they want to turn
everybody into an atomized consumer who
recognizes that life is essentially
worthless you can't control your
productive life you can't control your
work life the only thing you can't talk
to anybody else because you have to be
isolated and atomized and you get your
gratification by consuming more
commodities that you don't want I mean
that's what the television is about
that's what radio is about that's what
nine-tenths of the newspapers are about
and it's been going on quite consciously
and you know my Khan for a hundred years
okay now it's hitting India you know my
concern is what about the solutions the
solution is I think to oh that you
strike at the heart of private power I
mean as long as as private power has
this as as long as you have this
extraordinary concentration of
decision-making power in essentially
unaccountable private organic
institutions you're gonna have problems
just like you have problems if you have
a Bolshevik state I mean India is very
striking I was there you know before and
after and it was pretty striking I mean
the last time I was there was first time
I was there it was all you know Indian
food and the other thing last time I was
air was a December in January 1996 I
think I was there for about a week
traveling around the country getting
talks
it happened you know it happened to hit
a huge snowstorm so I the flight took
around 48 hours and I had turned out I
had to give the first talk at the Delhi
School of Economics right like two hours
after I land
you know after not having slept for a
couple of days so I asked for some food
you know something to eat you know what
they brought
Kentucky Fried Chicken I mean
mind-boggling introduction to the new
[Laughter]
India can defend itself I mean for
example the Indian media which are not
you know great exemplars of democracy
you know they're privately owned rich
people and so on but they defended
themselves against public takeover I
mean Murdoch and others want to take
them over and they just resisted India
has somewhat resisted the international
patent regime it's kind of it that's an
interesting story the United States
claims to be in favor of free trade but
really isn't
nobody is nobody powerful is at least
except for somebody else but one of if
you if you look at the World Trade
Organization one of the founding
doctrines of it is radically
protectionist that's what's called
intellectual property rights they
extended intellectual property rights
like patents for drugs you know to an
absolutely unprecedented extent and also
extended them from processes to products
products were never patented before just
processes that's not only an attack on
free trade it's also an attack against
innovation it means that some smart guy
in India can't figure out a smarter way
to produce some drug the purpose of this
is a major assault on free trade and on
innovation and growth in order to ensure
the profits of things like merck
pharmaceutical well you know india
resisted so the way you know a better
night
so fill me in if I don't have the
details right but the India there was so
much public opposition that the Indian
Parliament couldn't ratify it I think
the government went over their heads if
I recall correctly and ratified in
Islington yeah and by now it's kind of
interesting but the pharmaceutical India
had very cheap relatively cheap drugs
because they had their own
pharmaceutical industry I was like as
compared with Pakistan which had
international companies the Indian
prices were much lower and of course the
purpose of all of this stuff is to make
the prices go up
at first the Indian pharmaceutical firms
objected but I noticed that now they're
not objecting which suggests maybe you
know the answer but suggests to me that
there probably linking up with the
Western pharmaceutical firms so they can
just exploit the Indians more
efficiently all of them together I guess
I mean I don't know that for a fact but
yeah these are but the point of all of
this is that India can raise is so for
example India maintain some kind of
capital controls in fact it's kind of
striking if you look at Asia there's an
Asian crisis but there are few islands
which haven't been much affected India's
one China's and other Taiwan as another
they all have some degree of capital
controls and it's been noted in the
professional literature so India was
able to resist that kind of
liberalisation and you know when you
talk about India it's kind of misleading
because there are sectors in India the
wealthy sectors the professionals and so
on who like the globalization but look
there were sectors in India who loved
the Raj you know they enriched
themselves they were the counterpart to
the Arab facade you know you go to any
third world country you want you know
the poorest one in central Africa you'll
find a sector of very wealthy people
very privileged very wealthy people who
are kind of linked up mostly with
Western power like the people who ran
India for the British and the British
didn't run it they ran it through an
Indian civil service and in fact Indian
troops and about 90 percent of the
British Army was the Indian troops well
you know those guys do fine and they now
are in favor of this kind
liberalisation the population may suffer
but that's a different story
thank you I read this interview with you
and I think someone I think it was Marty
parrots said that you were outside the
pail of intellectual responsibility I
was wondering what was the context of
that and also how do you respond the
same way everybody else I mean as he
defines intellectual responsibility
that's absolutely right for example I
don't have a slavish Stalinist like
loyalty to his holy state you know okay
that puts me out of the pail of
responsibility right off okay and then
also I met this guy who said that your
last name is Tom ski because your dad's
felt it with a head is that true that's
what the guys at Ellis Island
Immigration decided yeah I mean actually
as you know and from there Eastern
European immigrants they didn't have
last names so if my father was say if
you like but it was so and so son of
so-and-so and somewhere along the line
probably at Ellis Island they got this
name which my father did pronounce with
a foot and in fact I went through early
years of schooling that way until I
finally realized that you know I'm being
put with the h's or the something and so
I just changed the pronunciation just
for convenience yeah all right thank you
yeah
