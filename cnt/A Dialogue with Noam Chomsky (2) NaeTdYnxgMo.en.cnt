what do you think about the cartographic
project to what extent is it compatible
with your views my views don't really
matter but what I think the right
question is what do we think about the
cartographic project I say drink ways
were that one is it's very fascinating
material they've Cinque Ricci
others have discovered some quite
remarkable facts if you look at Cinque
is extensive rich cartography of the
adverbial positions it's remarkable that
languages should conform to this
apparently quite complex structure and
he's got plenty of evidence for from
many different languages so it looks
like a quite a solid result
same with ritzy on the Left periphery
and so on but there are a couple of
problems serious problems which should
lead us to recognize that it just can't
be right
one problem any linguistic theory is
going to have to meet two conditions
this has been obvious for sixty years
any any theory you know wasn't true for
structureless theories because they were
not attempting to find more than
extremely superficial general properties
of language but if you're if you're
engaged in the project of generative
grammar trying to deal with the classic
problem of how you can have an infinite
array of structures coming from a finite
object your brain which will have
interpretations if you're willing to
engage that project at all then you have
two fundamental questions you have to
deal with a question an ability and
questions of evolve ability so it's kind
of be learned obviously it is
how can it be learned that it couldn't
have evolved will it evolve so how could
have evolved turning to the cartographic
project say Cinque structures cannot
possibly be learned there's no
conceivable evidence that a child could
have that would lead to establishing
these structures
you don't just don't have any evidence
for them you have to search our to find
evidence that bears on them it's not in
the environment of a child acquiring the
language and since it does appear to be
universal it seems to arise without
effectively without learning so the
learnability problem is severe and the
only possible answer to it is
evolvability it somehow must have
evolved and it's part of a universal
grammar but you're facing the same
question how could anything like this
ever have evolved I mean almost can't
show that it's impossible virtually
unimaginable so there's got to be some
other basis for and you have to try to
see if you can find some other basis for
this complex very intriguing fascinating
collection of material some other basis
in more elementary principles that are
available independently and there have
been a number of interesting attempts to
do this one right here Jordan for Toni's
work another careful analysis by
Ernst Thomas Ernst I think his name is
Rotem interest very interesting book on
adjuncts in which he tried to show that
there are general properties of adjuncts
that would yield the Cinque is a
cartography and there are a couple of
other approaches like that but I think
that's the right approach it's quite
remarkable work it's very illuminating
it meets these it faces these two
fundamental problems which have no
answer on their own learn ability and
evolve ability which leads us to seek
deeper principles known elsewhere which
could yield these complex results and
there is an interesting work in that
direction so I think that's my own view
is that's the way to look at it very
interesting research topics
it's a related question so when we try
to derive cartographers from semantics
for instance take an example we appeal
to semantic principles does it work yeah
but we do not know them independently so
there are very close is related to two
syntax so there may be some danger there
because we may get into a vicious circle
then that we try to derive something
from semantics for instance but we don't
know semantics from independently so how
can we appeal to principles that we need
to discover them in advance is it clear
did you get it is very very easy
yeah no Kodama so if you try to guys
something from semantics how do you know
those principles independently because
some way they are derived from syntax
how do you know how do you know those
principles independently no did somebody
whatever any observation about vision
principle so could there be general
somatic principles which would yield the
cartography well that's the approach
that's been taken plausibly and so if
there are adjuncts that have sentential
scope let's say and there are other
adjuncts that have verb for a scope
it's automatic under standard IR
principles that the one with sentential
scope will be higher than the one with
verb for a scope and the question is can
you account for the whole range of
cartographic discoveries by invoking
properties like this which are
independent and the work that I
mentioned is effort to do this that's a
similar you might try similar things for
the less periphery you know there's some
intrinsic reasons why a topic and focus
should be arranged in a particular order
presumably somatic or pragmatic
principles now that looks like the
direction to go and it has is the
direction that has been pursued by the
people have been trying to find a basis
for them so yeah I agree that's that's
the plausible direction so what is the
place of optionality in grammar and it's
interaction with interface conditions
imposed by pragmatics and semantic
principles
well this is a question that's been
wrestled with since the earliest days so
for example the say if you have a fear
at the stage of development of the
theory where you're working with say
move alpha lazon excite OHS proposal
roughly late 1980s so you've reduced say
you've reduced the variety of
transformational rules to move alpha the
question is is the application of mu
alpha determined by some properties of
the physicians that are being related
so does is movement triggered by a probe
that has to be satisfied by the movement
rule say that's a typical question one
approach is to say yes everything has to
be determined the rules apply to satisfy
certain conditions a similarly external
merge you know putting together two
things to form a larger phrase is it
triggered by the need to satisfy a theta
role let's say is that generally the
case for the way the architecture of the
system works that leads to efforts like
crash free grammar the effort efforts
try to show that everything's determined
in such a way that nothing ever crashes
that's one line of approach another line
of approach is to say everything's
optional rules just apply freely and
that will of course give a a lot of
what's called over generation but is
that wrong or is it right well you know
going back to the early days like
logical structure of linguistic theory
my assumption then is it's right you
should generate everything every string
of elements does get some interpretation
a fixed interpretation usually even
sharply deviated expressions in fact
deviant expressions often exactly the
right kind of expressions to use so take
metaphors they're all semantically
deviant that's what makes a metaphor if
you say misery loves company it's
violating select semantics selectional
rules there are many cases where
innovations are used precisely because
they're deviant
when Thorstein Veblen was talking about
consumer culture and invented the phrase
perform leisure that has a mean a
special meaning because it deviates in a
special way from grammatical rules some
of them are one of my favorites is an
example of the Rebecca West's it was
asked once what she thought about many
world many many world theories like in
cymatics and she said one of the damn
thing is enough radically violates
grammatical rules but it's exactly the
right thing
to say and we interpret it directly so
in fact I think the language thought
that the internal language in fact does
assign interpretations to things that
deviated from grammatical principles and
those are often used in fact that leads
to the suggestion that the rules really
oughta be optimal optional that they
just don't apply freely and they get
whatever interpretation they have that
at the interface levels that means that
you want to understand the way the
interface levels assign interpretations
to things but that's part of the nature
of language so my own feeling is that
the right direction to move is towards
optionality of rural systems they just
apply they fly freely the way
combinatorial rules do and other
computational systems it's right or
wrong about it and they yield whatever
they yield and it gets whatever
interpretation it does okay so question
six traditionally traditionally MIT's
research has focused on locality
constraints but someone who is sick
phenomena show that globality is also
relevant in accounting for certain
phenomena how can this tension be solved
well this question is highly theory
internal unlike the others which are
quite general so the tension arises in
very specific theories namely phased
based approaches to generation there of
the tension arises and it arises I think
because of a misinterpretation for which
I'm responsible of the notion transfer
transfer is
usually I and others have described it
as for those of you familiar with these
theories as eliminating the elements of
a phase and then moving on to the next
phase and then you perform things in the
next phase and you eliminate those as
you send them to the interfaces and so
you go on but then there are global
phenomenon and that leads to attention
the local phenomena are phasing eternal
but how does the global ones work if
you've eliminated every piece as you
went along and I think that's the result
of a serious misinterpretation of the
notion of transfer which should not
eliminate anything and we have good
reason to believe this this is discussed
and a thesis by mikio about five or six
years ago in Michigan but the point is
very simple if you have just take any
you know any phrase that includes within
it a complete phase let's say a clause
so take a phrase like the claim that the
verdict that Tom Jones is guilty the
verdict that Tom Jones was guilty
internal to it that Tom Jones is guilty
is plainly a phase if anything is
suppose you were to eliminate that and
then the phrase the verdict for Tom
Jones is guilty is moved to higher
position I so you get the verdict that
Tom Jones is guilty seems to have been
reached by the jury without due
deliberation or something how do you
pronounce the phase that Tom Jones was
guilty way up there
not down below
eliminated well that doesn't make any
sense so what it means is that what it's
called spell out doesn't exist at what
you have is just and that transfer
simply means identify a phase as closed
and inaccessible to operations that
might change something within it
that's what satisfies the computational
motivation for phases but nothing ever
is gone it all stays there it's not gone
it's just the unit's element phased by
phase or marked as you can't change me
anymore
okay um but nothing changes at that
point the tension between globality and
locality disappears things are local if
they're local so condition C is the
binding series I'll play over the whole
unit of complexities so I think the
tension is a problem internal to a
certain interpretation of phase
theoretic approaches and what you have
to do is abandon that interpretation
which is wrong anyway so question 7 what
is the place of acceptability judgments
in linguistic theory and how do they
relate to linguistic variation how can
we explain the fact that phonological
and morphological factors like prosody
Horizonte pronouns ellipses may
ameliorate some syntactic vibrations
well when you begin to study some topic
it's just a massive complex data you
don't know what belongs where as you
develop a degree of theoretical
understanding you begin to parcel out
the phenomenon into different areas and
different dimensions and different
factors you may be doing it wrongly but
that's the only way to
that's the way science proceeds in this
case there is a fundamental difference
between what's called competence and
performance the common internal system
system of common knowledge that's
accessed by production and foreign
parsing and perception and the input and
output systems the performance systems
acceptability judgments have to do with
performance the of course performance
always accesses internal knowledge so
that's an element in performance but
only one element there are many other
elements and performance when you get
acceptability judgments the purse the
subject is using all of the different
dimensions that interact to yield the
judgment so for example memory
constraints are going to affect accept
acceptability they don't they don't
affect the internal system and that
these are topics that were studied 5060
years ago and the results are there
still things that are not understood so
it takes a simply the effect of memory
on interpret ability of expressions also
takes a embedding the George Miller and
I should 50 years ago that plane
embedded expressions are interpretable
up to the level of short-term memory
which is about what you'd expect so up
to the level of about seven you can
construct sentences with embedding as
deep as maybe six or seven and with not
any particular difficulty you can
understand them and that's what you'd
expect you can't go beyond short-term
memory in carrying out the performance
so things beyond that level will be
unaccept
though they're perfectly grammatical a
very interesting result still not really
understood is that self embedding like
embedding a clause within a clause that
has a much narrower constraint in fact
it doesn't go much beyond - if you try
to get to self embedding of three it
comes unintelligible even though there's
no memory restriction so that raises a
question an interesting question for
performance theories why what aspects of
what elements of our cognitive system
are preventing self embedding from going
up to the level of short-term memory
when Miller's and I discussed this we
talked about it in the metaphor of
computer programs so if you're executing
a certain routine
you can't call in that routine if you're
executing a relative Clause routine you
can't call in the routine in the middle
of that'll put a constraint on itself
embedding and maybe that's the right
answer maybe there's some other entity
but that's the kind of question that
arises when you start looking at
acceptability judgments and there are
many other things like they're simple
that takes a heavy NP shift or extra
position or any of the operations that
involve sort of the weight of an
expression which is sort of put off till
the end that doesn't have anything to do
with from a dramatic at grammaticality
with the properties of the internal
system has to do with ways in which our
memory and our perceptual systems are
organized so it's another dimension and
in fact the rules that apply probably
don't even belong within the
language they have other properties like
extra position or we've been putting
them all together because we don't
understand enough about the different
systems that interact but quite possibly
these sometimes called stylistic
transformations that belong in the
externalization system and not in the
core computational system and they
involve factors like heaviness of
expressions which have no particular
syntactic meaning in fact none you know
other questions of linear order which
where you avoid certain concatenations
for euphonic reasons so it takes a takes
a verb particle constructions like take
the matter up or make make this up let's
say you're gonna have make up this
solution or make this solution off take
the problem up or take up the problem
but you can't put these things together
so that you get two occurrences of up at
the end see if I can make it work in my
mind but something like
they made the decision to take the
problem up up okay
that's almost unintelligible but it's
perfectly grammatical it just uses the
extra position of up twice you wouldn't
do it you would keep one of them inside
well that's a performance that yields
unacceptability but no ungrammaticality
and in general acceptability it's what
you have to begin with because to know
what you're doing you just use whatever
data there is but acceptability is
basically raw data not categorized by
the systems to which it is relevant so
therefore it involves all kinds of
factors the memory euphony happiness all
sorts of other things and to progress in
understanding the nature of the systems
involved you want to try to find ways to
sort these things out so then assign the
data through the systems from which they
arrive it's the same in any scientific
endeavor and this is a problem that we
have here as for the major ation of
syntactic violations i presume it
certainly happens and I am at likes a
result of pronouns these are probably
performance effects which don't strictly
belong within the computational system
of language it's not to say they're
irrelevant they're part of our whole
linguistic behavior but they just belong
some other compartment that's a trigger
guess I think so we move to a question
eight so in the current version of the
minimalist program what are the theory
internal restrictions that make it
falsifiable well the it's been hard to
get this point across even in the
professional literature but notice that
the minimalist program is a program and
programs aren't falsifiable or
verifiable this is not a property of
programs the programs can be premature
or they could be misdirected all kind of
comments you can make about Pro they can
be right you know a lot of things you
can say about programs but they can't be
verified and they can't be falsified
they're not theories they're just ways
of approaching a topic so the minimalist
program can't be falsified particular
proposals within it can be falsified and
are all the time every time you open a
journal some read the articles they're
falsifying some proposal that was made
within the pursuit of the program but
that's a different matter okay and
somehow it's been really hard to get
this point across so there's lots of
things in the professional literature
which are always like that the
minimalist program is refuted or
supported or you know doesn't have
enough evidence one thing or another
none of which it's all category errors
you can't falsify or verified
so we'll Scala 2014 has argued that a
universal categorical specification that
is universal labeling is impossible
because languages may differ with
respect to the categories labels unit
types they express which Co proposes
instead that ug should be conceived as
conforming only to a category neutral
hierarchical spine can you comment on
the plausibility of a conception of long
these lines oh so it may appear to
conform to minimalist decision to dizzy
DeRita but it raises a number of
questions about the learnability or a
system where categorization is
unrestricted grammatical categories are
assumed to be language specific and
where the division between functional
and lexical elements is blurred
well the answer to this question is a
matter of fact you know it's not a
matter of opinion so is it true or isn't
it floors is Mark Baker right and his
approach category serves this right but
the question that arises at the end
about minimalist desiderata goes back to
the point I made before any approach is
going to have to face questions of
learnability and evolve ability this
approach weakens the assumptions about
innate structure it says there's
something weaker therefore there's more
to be learned so it's going to have to
meet learnability conditions oh that's a
problem that it's going to have to face
maybe rightly maybe wrongly depending on
whether the approach is correct so the
thing the way to approach the question I
think is to ask whether there is
sufficient evidence that there are
universal categories say things like
noun verb or whether there's just
abstract forms that could take that
almost anything could fill in well you
have to answer to my strong suspicion is
that there are universal categories but
it's a question of fact so we move to
question 10 concerning ellipsis and its
place in grammar a very widespread view
contends that ellipse is a syntactic in
nature whereas some others including
work of yourself without lessening back
in the 90s argue that the ellipsis
should be regarded as a radical case of
DX intuition thus placing ellipsis at
the bf side of the grammar how positive
do you feel about the syntactic view of
ellipsis if you take a look at the mass
of cases of ellipsis almost all of them
fall under D accenting there are
exceptions but the math that large it
almost invariably there's a D accented
analog to the ellipsis case try the
mountain C which suggests that there is
a fundamental principle that the accents
and we basically know Y has to do with
pairing
focus and so on and once you have the
accented there's an option of eliminate
that would eliminate the question of
ellipses for that category of cases well
there are some other cases so what's the
right answer my strong suspicion this is
a research topic my strong suspicion is
that the fundamental issue of ellipses
is d accented which means ellipses
basically doesn't exist but there are
performance effects that do involve
other kinds of ellipses and they're
going to have the wrong properties which
I suspect are around the periphery of
the system but that's you know that's a
thesis proposal which is either right or
wrong and you can investigate but I
think it is quite striking that almost
all of the cases of ellipses do have a D
accented analog which has to be
accounted for and once you've accounted
for you've counted for the ellipses
which simply says delete the undie
accented part
so we moved to question 11 what is your
opinion on the application of minimalism
to the acquisition of non-native
languages well first of all what's
minimalism minimalism is just science
okay
so the question is what's your opinion
on the application of science to the
acquisition of non-native second
languages why is it called minimalism
you know there's a reason why the term
was used although it's just a unbroken
continuity from the earliest days of
generative grammar seamless change it
was what happened is by the around the
early 90s it seemed to a number of
people me included that enough had been
learned so that it might be worth trying
a different research approach instead of
trumpeting the earlier work from the
very from the verb as soon as the first
I mean they have to go back a little bit
to see what was going on in the
structuralist period say the 1940s when
I was a student it was assumed that
everything is known virtually there
aren't any problems the only problem is
to apply the methods of structural
analysis to new languages so a typical
assignment when I was student was take
data from Cherokee and apply the methods
of phonemic analysis to the data and
an organization in the day and that's
linguistics it's the application of
methods more or less known may be can be
refined a little to new data in fact
this is so extreme at the time that
there were very prominent linguists by
around nineteen fifty who had concluded
that there's no point doing linguistic
analysis anymore on the only thing to do
is collect data because computers are
coming along and it'll be possible to
program the methods and then you just
feed the data and apply the methods you
get the organization that's it but there
are no problems fundamental problems
except the fixing the data as soon as
the first attempts were made primitive
attempts to construct generative
grammars that actually tried to account
for the infinite variety of expressions
and the way they're interpreted and
articulated it immediately became
obvious that the opposite is true
nothing is known everything you look at
is a problem and that was quite a shock
in a way and the way to deal with it
seemed to be to try to develop a series
of generative grammar which were
intricate and complex enough so they
could at least cover a lot of the data
that was quickly being unearthed that
hadn't been noticed before so the early
grammars are extremely complex it was
always understood that this can't be
right for the reasons of learnability
and evolvability so efforts were made
over the years to reduce the complexity
so reduce the complexity of phrase
structure grammar to x-bar theory for
example keep going like that
and by the early 90s it seemed again to
a number of us that enough progress had
been made so you try a different
approach
namely ask what would be a perfect
system and then ask how close does this
come to account for the data now that's
the strong minimalist thesis and that
approach that research approach you can
call minimalism but remember it's an
approach it's asking the question
whether this approach yields interesting
results you can decide for yourself
I think it has yielded some quite
striking results but then the question
is can this approach tell us something
about second language acquisition I
think it probably can but that's a topic
to investigate when you're looking at
how second languages are required like
to what extent and there's a lot of
common those of you who've worked in
this area know there are many questions
well there are maturational effects
which are pretty general no that's by
now fairly well-established that there
were a couple of sensitive periods not
quite critical periods going back to
Leonard he or you there's a critical
period for language acquisition meaning
a period in which you must acquire it or
you're finished and it's more likely
that there are what are called sensitive
periods there are periods when the
evidence more quickly and effectively
leads to certain consequences others
where it's much harder and maybe it
never totally does but they're not
strictly critical and it looks like
they're several such periods age three
age six puberty and there's experimental
evidence
that you get differentiations depending
on what when a second language was
acquired and depending on maturational
properties so that these questions
consider there are questions about the
extent to which a second language is
tacked on to the first language so
whether it simply picked up from the
start the way a child does using ug
principles and these are all quite
interesting research questions they have
many complications and you can ask
whether the approach of seeking the the
minimalist research program of seeking
to account for things by assuming that
it's really the simplest possible system
and then adding complexity as you're
forced to whether that's a useful
research approach I think that's the way
the question shapes up as a normal
question of science question 12 well you
probably answered it but assuming some
version of phase theory how does the
system proceed to assemble the different
pieces of a derivation a process that is
needed by PF and LF well actually this
question goes back to one that we were
talking about earlier it's a question
that arises within in a highly in theory
internal way in terms of particular
version of phase theory that interpreted
transfer to mean eliminate but that was
wrong and if we don't interpret the
transfer that way rather we interpret
transfer is just meaning close this off
from further change which again
satisfies the computational motive but
then this question doesn't arise
because everything is there so no
problems and this is actually related so
are there reasons to maintain the P I
see facing penetrability condition as an
independent condition or could it just
be derived from cyclic spell out of
phase compliments well this is the same
answer we have to get rid of spell out
because it doesn't make sense
for the reasons I mentioned like
movement of the phrase that's already
been spelled out so if we eliminate
spell out we're left with the P I see
the phase impenetrability condition and
questions then do arise like for example
when we if take the phase
impenetrability condition if some it's
as if some phase has been completed you
can't modify what's in it but can you
access what's in it that's a factual
question the question arises at one of
the cases standard cases is icelandic
when the when you have a quirky
nominative object cannon and it's within
a v star p you know
presumably a phase but it does affect
the inflectional element that's outside
the phase and does that mean penetration
into a past phase without modifying
anything but just accessing something
and one approach is to say yeah that's
allowed another approach which was
developed by he's Akita Hara and others
is to recover redefine the notion phase
so it's all within a phase these are the
kinds of questions that can arise you
have the same questions arising for say
the labeling algorithm kind of labels
something deep inside which
change anything just gives it a property
but these are all non-trivial research
questions I think
but spell out I think is just a mistake
teeny is also related to today's theory
the last one related to that so what are
the problems empirical and conceptual of
the proliferation of phases say beyond
c8v little B and E
in particular the postulation of phases
within the world well there are the case
of D raises serious problems what's
several problems for what kind of
problem is it is is it really D I doubt
that very much it's been conventional to
call nominal phrases DPS but that
doesn't make a lot of sense D originally
meant something it meant determiner like
this or that by now a D is simply used
to mean whatever a nominal phrase has
even if has no determiner and that just
loses the notion of determine these
things should really be called nominal
phrases I think and there are there are
interesting approaches to how to
reconstruct the notion of the nominal
phrase so that it ends up being an N
with D just being some internal element
that may or may not be there there's a
paper by muscle we she which
unfortunately is in a pretty
inaccessible fest rift which I'm sure
you can get hold of it which is far as I
know the most elaborate effort to work
this out raises
question so and then what you find is
that second question is this element
this entity nominal phrase seems to have
some of the properties of phases but
lacks other properties of phases so it
seems in an ambiguous position and it's
not clear how to lease to me how to sort
that out I don't know what the answer is
going beyond that adding other phases
simply adds all kinds of complications I
mean the the most the only basic
property of phases is the
impenetrability condition if you don't
have that you know there's no point in
phase but if you make it smaller units
the impenetrability condition is going
to force you to raise everything that's
later changed out of the unit right and
that just leads to madness as soon as
you try the work about you have constant
every little piece is being raised
because later on it's going to be
changed what's left that doesn't make
any sense in fact if you do that there's
really no point in having the notion
phase it's my strong suspicion is that
we're going to end up with two phases a
clausal and verbal and probably that's
related to uninterpretable features
they're very curious fact about language
that they have uninterpretable features
why should a language have an
uninterpretable feature so it doesn't
add anything to the interpretation by
definition so what's it there for and it
the only answer that's ever been
suggested to my knowledge is that the
uninterpretable features mark phases
there are unanswered
features for CP and for VP at least B
star P and maybe that's what they're
there for
just to mark the phases if there's
another reason I don't know what it is
they seem to serve no function within
the linguistic system and certainly not
in the interpretive system by definition
so kind of a guess is that that's
something like what we're going to end
up with when we understand enough that
leaves the question of nominal phrases
in limbo they seem to be a problem so
there's no question we moved to the last
one which is a very general question um
[Music]
David hilt Hilbert famously came up with
several fundamental problems for
mathematics in nineteen nineteen hundred
which he presented in the International
Congress of mathematicians at the
cellphone what would you say are today's
problems for linguistics as you
understand it and do you see the news
for research into them they don't have
to be 23 as conceived by Hobart or even
10 as he presented in the Congress but
it would be good if they are serious and
in your opinion solvable not mysteries
well notice first that Hilbert
formulated these problems in 1900 not at
that point mathematics which went back
thousands of years to the Babylonians
had finally reached the stage where it
had been literally formalized Euclidean
geometry wasn't formalized until about
1900 by Hilbert in fact the formal logic
had been formalized by Frigga not
long we fund that arithmetic by iana
not long before but Hilbert was raising
these questions at a time when a certain
field of inquiry which had been studied
intensively for thousands of years had
finally gotten the formalized if you
went back 50 years before that 60 years
before that early in the 19th century
there were the system the mathematics
was literally incoherent not just unform
alized but incoherent the core notion of
analysis calculus limits wasn't totally
incoherent notion it meant very small
but smaller than anything you can think
of but not zero and what's that if you
take a look at Newton's proofs they're
defective as was pointed out quite
quickly because in one line of the proof
zero means zero and another line it
means as small as you can get so the
limit of something and that's an
equivocation which undermines the proof
in fact there's a long history where
continental and your British
mathematicians diverged and how to deal
with this problem
the British mathematicians try to solve
the problem and they didn't get anywhere
at the time wasn't right to solve them
the Continental mathematicians like
Euler and others it just ignored the
problems gallops and so on zero K its
incoherent but let's go ahead anyway and
they developed all of the main modern
mathematics and finally by about the mid
19th century the incoherence was too
much to deal with you had to find a way
out of it and at that point you get
to lebesgue integration Delta Epsilon
proofs the kind of stuff you now learn
in calculus courses and you solved the
problems a couple of years after that
arithmetic was formalized finally
Euclidean geometry was formalized
finally by 1900 you had a system that
was clear and explicit enough say it
could propose problems
that's mathematics it hasn't happened in
any other field there what you have in
any other field is just problems things
you don't understand like in physics how
do you unify gravitational force and
other forces problem and like wisdom
says everywhere you look there are
problems oh it's not as bad as it was in
the 1950s when every sentence he looked
at seemed to be a problem or say the
1970s when a major problem was the freak
was called the free word order parameter
in the 1970s it was assumed that scene
it was assumed by the best linguists
people I can he'll others that a German
Japanese had free word order and
obviously Australian Aboriginal
languages like well--very the famous
case so this seemed to be a real free
word order parameter and that was a huge
problem the later work showed that
that's not the case that these languages
including well--very have fixed word
order and it's the same it's not word or
it's fixed hierarchic structure and
[Music]
they're basically the same as others and
get Mark Baker's work on Apollo
synthetic languages brings it together
with that so these problems got resolved
didn't quite interesting ways but there
plenty of new ones waiting and
all over the place there are problems
but I don't think you can list them and
the way that Hilbert was able to do at a
point in the development of mathematics
where it had finally after thousands of
years become a coherent set of ideas not
totally by any means because the set
theoretic paradoxes quickly arose after
Hilbert and those are unsolved so by now
it's unclear whether set theory which is
the fundament of the basis of modern
mathematics has a coherent account
intuitionists which claim it does so
more problems but in the case of a field
like linguistics we're just in the very
early stages even of trying to decide
where problems fall so does it say heavy
n NP shift fall within a merge based
system of core computation or is it part
of the performance system even questions
like that we don't really know the
answer I can have guesses but you don't
know the answer the questions of
cartography in fact just about
everything that's come up today are
problems that ask for solutions and we
it's not always often not obvious where
look you know so I don't think it's
really possible to carry out something
like the Hilbert the program 1900
program
okay so let's pay professor Chomsky
please
and also thank you for Angelica Diego
the main organizer of this event and
allow a bond ad for a ferry great job
