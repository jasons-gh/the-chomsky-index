talk about the liberal media just
doesn't make any sense if one thing you
know the media have a if you want to say
the media or liberal I can't disagree I
mean so the journalists tend to support
choice a woman's choice
yeah probably do they believe in civil
rights yeah probably but that has almost
nothing to do with the content of the
media the if you want to I've never in
my little OTT about the media but I've
never talked about liberal conservative
bias but I don't think it means anything
you want to understand the media first
of all take a look at their content okay
I gave one example before the propaganda
fantastic propaganda which managed to
convince people of these incredible
delusions about Iraq it's not that the
media came out and said Saddam Hussein
was responsible for 9/11 but they
permitted a distribution of those
charges uncritically in such a way that
the population actually became came to
believe it and there's case after case
of this before this I earlier in the
program I mentioned that you can't find
a map in the media of the the Clinton
Barack offers of a settlement and Camp
David which was so highly praised well
you know I don't know if that's liberal
bias or conservative bias but it's not a
journalistic integrity if you want
people to understand what this proposal
was showing on that that's the way to
decide what it was and that was withheld
and there's case after case in this I
think there's an enormous documentation
of the fact you can check it if you like
that the shaping the choice of topics
the shaping of information the you know
the basic assumptions and so on fall
within a fairly narrow spectrum which
tend to be highly supportive of state
and corporate power I don't think it's
either liberal or conservative it's just
the way things work when I'm some of my
favorite newspapers are called very kind
like the news reporting in the Wall
Street Journal is as good as any I know
maybe better and it's supposed to be a
conservative journal but the the
question is what is the media product
and then if you want to understand it
you don't look at liberal and
conservative whatever they mean you look
at the institutional roots what kind of
institutions are in the media well you
know turns out they're major
corporations tied in with even bigger
ones their income comes from other
businesses namely advertisers they're
basically selling a product namely
audiences to other businesses and I
think if you look you'll find that the
interests and concerns of the sellers
and the buyers have a very powerful
influence on the media product that has
to be demonstrated not just asserted but
that's my opinion and as I say I know
there's a written a lot about it but I
don't think there's anything to do with
liberal and conservative bias
