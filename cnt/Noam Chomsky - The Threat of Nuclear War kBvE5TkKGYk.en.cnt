let's turn to the threat of instant
destruction by nuclear weapons the
record on that is extremely interesting
and it demonstrates quite clearly that
from the earliest days the security of
the population has been a non-issue and
remained so to the present the record is
shocking and insufficiently recognized
I'd really urge you to look at it
closely it strongly supports the lament
of the General Lee Butler he's the last
commander of the Strategic Air Command
controls nuclear weapons and weapons
policy in his words we have so far
survived the nuclear age by some
combination of skill luck and divine
intervention and I suspect the latter
and the greatest proportion and he goes
on to say that we can hardly count on
divine intervention as we continue to
play roulette with the fate of the
species in pursuit of the driving
factors in state policy he didn't add
that I added it so take a couple of
illustrative examples beginning at the
start of the Atomic Age at that time
this is 1950 the US was overwhelmingly
powerful enjoyed remarkable security
nothing like it in history
controlled the Western Hemisphere
controlled both oceans controlled the
opposite sides of both oceans it had 50
percent of the world's wealth is just
incomparable power and security there
was however one potential threat
potential at that time that was ICBMs
with hydrogen bomb warheads they didn't
exist but they might exist someday there
is actually a standard scholarly review
of nuclear policies written
with access to high-level documents it's
by McGeorge Bundy who was the national
security adviser for the Kennedy and
Johnson administration's and what he
writes is that he describes the
development of ICBMs with nuclear
warheads is one of the great
achievements of the Eisenhower
administration but he then adds that
it's useful to recognize that both the
United States and the Soviet Union might
be in much less nuclear danger today if
these missiles had never been developed
and they yeah it's a very instructive
comment he says I am aware of no
proposal could find no proposal in the
literature and either in or out of
government that these missiles should be
banned by agreement nobody even
considered it there was no thought at
all of trying to prevent the sole
serious threat to the United States
threat of utter destruction and this
striking fact merits a phrase in the
standard comprehensive history and has
been ignored in commentary I can't find
anyone who's ever even referred to it
well could it have been prevented would
a treaty have been possible can't be
sure of course but some indication that
it would have been possible one
suggestive indication is remarkable
proposal by Stalin in 1952 he offered to
allow Germany to be unified with free
elections which of course the Communists
would lose but with a condition that it
not join a hostile military alliance
again hardly an extreme condition in the
light of history while Stalin's proposal
was received in the United States but it
was ignored or whenever mentioned just
ridiculed and actually a recent
scholarship which now has access to
Russian archives has begun to take quite
a different view and an illuminating one
that one case is audible lungs a
bitterly anti-communist Harvard scholar
leading specialist on Bolshevik Russia
here's what he says he says the status
of Stalin's proposal is an unresolved
mystery Washington wasted little effort
in flatly rejecting Moscow's initiative
on grounds that were embarrassingly
unconvincing leaving open the basic
question was Stalin genuinely ready to
sacrifice the GDR on the altar of real
democracy with consequences for world
peace and real security that would have
been enormous that one of the most
prominent cold war scholars melvin
Leffler reviewing recent research and
soviet archives writes that scholars are
surprised to discover that Lavrentiy
Beria the sinister brutal head of the
secret police proposed that the kremlin
offer the west a deal on unification and
neutralization of germany agreeing to
sacrifice the east german communist
regime to reduce east-west tensions and
of course to improve the political and
economic conditions in russia
opportunities he points out that were
squandered in favor of gaining West
German participation in NATO well under
those circumstances it's not at all
impossible that agreements might have
been reached that would have protected
the security of the population from the
gravest imaginable threat total
destruction but the possibility was not
considered another striking indication
of how slight a role authentic security
plays in state policy accidentally this
tells us quite a lot about intellectuals
in the United States and Europe
try to find any discussion of this well
that was revealed again in the years
that followed a couple years later
Nikita Khrushchev took office he
recognized right away that Russia could
not compete militarily with the United
States the richest most powerful country
in history and he recognized that if
Russia hoped to escape from its economic
backwardness and of course the
devastating effects of the second world
war it would be necessary to reverse the
arms race so he proposed sharp
reductions in offensive weapons mutual
reductions the incoming Kennedy
administration considered the offer and
rejected it instead they turned to rapid
military expansion the late Kenneth
waltz one of the leading most respected
international relations scholars
describes it like this he said the
Kennedy administration undertook the
largest strategic and conventional
peacetime military buildup the world has
yet seen as Khrushchev was trying to
carry through a major reduction in
conventional forces and to follow a
strategy of minimum deterrence and we
did so the u.s. did so though the
balance of strategic weapons greatly
favored the United States again a
decision to harm national security
security the population while enhancing
state power
that's Kennedy a major reason why
Kennedy barely squeaked the victory in
1960 was his charge that Eisenhower and
Nixon had permitted the Russians to leap
ahead in offensive weaponry creating
what they called a missile gap that
severely threatened u.s. security that
frightened the population enough so that
Kennedy barely won the election in
reality the US was far in the lead the
Russians had
or operational ICBMs tiny fraction of
the u.s. arsenal and this was quickly
understood and speaking for the
administration McGeorge Bundy again
he explained that they had nevertheless
been right in emphasizing a fake missile
gap because as he put it the phrase had
a useful shorthand effect of calling
attention to our basic military posture
that's an illusion to the posture of
rapidly expanding overwhelming US
dominance and threat and rejecting
security and the prospects for survival
well the Russians did react the reaction
was to place missiles in Cuba in 1902 by
1962 that move was motivated also by
Kennedy's huge terrorist campaign
against Cuba which is mostly suppressed
but this plenty of evidence about it
which was scoutship scheduled to lead to
invasion in October 1962 the month when
the missiles were emplaced that brought
the world to the most dangerous moment
in history
Kennedy advisor Arthur Schlesinger --zf
raised historian as the crisis peaked in
late October the Kennedy received a
secret letter from Khrushchev offering
to end the crisis by simultaneous public
withdrawal of Russian missiles from Cuba
and US Jupiter missiles from Turkey
these Jupiter missiles were obsolete
missiles withdrawal order had already
been given for them because they were
being placed by far more lethal
essentially invulnerable
Polaris submarines the Kennedy's
subjective estimate was that if he
refused this offer the probability of
nuclear war was between 1/3
and a half a war that would have
destroyed the northern hemisphere as
President Eisenhower had stated he
refused it's hard to think of a more
horrendous decision in human history and
worse he's praised for his cold courage
and statesmanship ten years later Henry
Kissinger called a nuclear alert in the
last days of the 1973 Israel Arab War
the purpose was to warn the Russians not
to interfere with his delicate
diplomatic maneuvers these were designed
to ensure an Israeli victory but a
limited victory so that the US would
still be in control of the region
unilaterally and the maneuvers were
indeed delicate the United States and
Russia had jointly imposed a ceasefire
but Kissinger secretly informed Israel
that they could ignore it and therefore
he called a nuclear alert to frighten
the Russians away the security of the
population had its usual status zero ten
years after that the Reagan
administration came in and they decided
to launch operations to probe Russian
defenses the way they did it was by
simulating air and naval attacks against
Russia and also calling the highest
level nuclear alert which of course
known to the Russians
all of this was undertaken at a very
tense moment pursing two missiles had
were being deployed in Europe he's had a
five-minute flight time to Moscow Reagan
announced the so-called Star Wars
program missile defense which the
Russians understood to be a first-strike
weapon
that's how missile defense is understood
on all sides for good reasons and other
tensions were rising well naturally the
Russian
were quite alarmed by this unlike the
United States Russia's quite vulnerable
had repeatedly been invaded and almost
destroyed and that led to a major war
scare in 1983 there are newly-released
archives that revealed that the danger
was much more severe than historians had
previously assumed there's a CIA study
that just appears it's called the war
scare was for real they conclude that
CIA concludes that the u.s.
underestimated Russian concerns and the
threat of a Russian reaction the major
journal on this topic Journal of
strategic studies it writes that these
Reagan exercises almost became a pre
prelude to a preventive nuclear strike
which would have wiped out the northern
hemisphere and in fact it was more
dangerous than that that we learned last
September it was it was revealed that
right in the midst of these world
threatening developments Russia's
automated early warning systems detected
an incoming missile strike from the
United States sending the highest level
alert well the protocol for the Soviet
military like the American military is
to retaliate at once with a nuclear
attack of its own now there was an
officer on duty
stanislav petrov he decided to disobey
the orders and not to report the warning
to his superiors and thanks to his
dereliction of duty we're alive to talk
about it that was 1983
[Applause]
and
you can determine how much publicity has
been given to all of this well security
for the population was no more a
priority for the Reagan planners for
there than for their predecessors and
that continues right to the present in
fact I'm pretty obvious when you take a
look at what's going on in Ukraine and
plans for the future or even more
frightening Obama came into office with
nice rhetoric about cutting back the
arms race in fact he's exceeding his
predecessor George Bush in expanding the
nuclear weapons arsenal the United
States under Obama is now planning to
spend more than a trillion dollars on
the nuclear arsenal in the next thirty
years and of course the United States is
not along though it's in the lead so
going back to general Butler it's a near
miracle that we've escaped destruction
so far and the longer we tempt fate the
less likely it is that we can hope for
divine intervention to rescue us for
America folly well we're all surely
aware just to conclude that we now face
the most ominous decisions in human
history there are lots of problems that
should be addressed but two of them are
overwhelming and their significance
environmental destruction nuclear war
after the first time in history we face
the prospects of destroying the
possibility of decent existence and not
in the distant future for this reason
alone it's imperative to sweep away the
ideological clouds face honestly and
realistically the question of how policy
decisions are made and what we can do to
alter them before it's too late
