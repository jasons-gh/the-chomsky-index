mr. Chomsky since Kofi Annan's term will
be expired with in lesson 6 month how do
you evaluate these years and what was
the if there is if what was the great
achievement he could made and there was
the failure or misjudgment he made and
you mentioned about what we call the
high-level panel report in your book is
there any way this organization could be
revitalized in the arrow which you know
major countries doesn't care about the
rule of law or international law the
high-level report from I think was
december two thousand four was a very
sensible document in my opinion it it
included leading western figures like
Gareth Evans Brent Scowcroft and others
and a sampling from the rest of the
world and their proposals I thought were
pretty sensible particularly their
proposal their conclusion that article
51 of the Charter should not be revised
or rewritten that it stands
appropriately today and it should remain
the core of international law well the
consequences of that they didn't have to
spell out but you know them yeah I think
that was a proper decision that's the
core of their disposals as your question
there's no way of for the UN to function
if the great powers simply kick it in
the face which they do I mean just take
a look at the record of vetoes I mean
the most a question of violating
security council resolutions was brought
up before and they shouldn't be violated
but the most extreme form of violation
of a Security Council resolution is
devito I mean you can't that's the
ultimate extreme of violating a Security
Council resolution well take a look at
the record of vetoes I mean in the early
years of the United Nations who in the
u.s. you know ran it almost totally just
for obvious economic and military
reasons the UN was very popular in the
United States now it's huge denunciation
of the Russian
for vetoing things even had
distinguished anthropologists giving
psychoanalytic explanations of why the
Russians say no all the time because
they were isn't swaddling clothes and
that sort of thing so is this terrible
thing the Russians are vetoing
resolutions well through the 1950s the
UN became to a limited extent more
representative of the peoples of the
world with decolonization with the
recovery of other industrial societies
by 19 by the 1960s it was not completely
under control so take a look at the
record of veto since the 1960s a u.s. is
far in the lead on a whole range of
issues it Britain is second and nobody
else is even close okay well as long as
that's the case can't do much as the UN
can't do very much including the
Secretary General nice had some good
positions and statements you can't
implement them if the great powers
primarily that's primarily the United
States and Britain which is Britain's
leading journal of international affairs
journal the royal institute described
blares britain as the spear carrier for
pax americana which is not inaccurate as
long as the one great superpower and its
spear carrier dismissed the united
nations and international law then
there's nothing much that the UN can do
and that's again a problem that is
internal to the group to the great
powers again if you take a look at a US
public opinion it is overwhelmingly in
support of giving a greater in fact
leading role to the United Nations
International Affairs so an overwhelming
majority of americans think that the UN
should take the lead not the united
states in international conflicts and
crises since april 2003 i think around
two thirds of the American public has
been in favor of keeping US troops in
Iraq only under UN
supervision that's essentially what the
Italian voters of Spanish voters voted
for in march two thousand four this even
surprisingly a small majority that
thinks the US should give up the veto
and follow the will of the of the United
Nations even if they don't like the
policies there's strong majorities in
favor of increasing funding for you and
peacekeeping operations and so on so if
again like the global warming question
if public opinion entered into the
formation of public policy well then the
UN would have a much wider latitude to
function if public policy remains
divorced from public opinion that won't
be true fear remains in the hands of
concentrations of power that are
essentially unaccountable no then the UN
will be very restricted I mean after all
the Bush administration went out of its
way to humiliate the United Nations by
appointing as its ambassador someone who
says very outspoken says the United
Nations does not exist if it's an
instrument if it follows the will of the
United States it's fine otherwise we
ignore it because international law
doesn't apply to us it's a it's a
contract made among states if one of the
States decides not to follow it that's
fine of course doesn't mean if you know
some enemy decides not to follow but
it's fine it means if we decide not to
follow it it's fine while pointing him
as ambassador is a message very clear
message to the United Nations not very
subtle and so are the actions in fact
you know the build-up to the Iraq war
the formal Iraq war we now know that it
was already going on Britain in the
United States were already carrying it
on in secret but in the so-called build
up to it in the fall of two thousand two
colin powell and others pointed out to
the united nations that you can either
accept the u.s. position or you can
become a debating society
approximately that well you know if
that's the position of the dominant
great power in violation of the will of
its own population then there's a
limited range of options open to the
United Nations and that's the problem
right here in the United States
secondarily in England and in fact
elsewhere in the world to but
responsibility is distributed roughly
relative to power
