on behalf of the MIT Center for
International Studies I welcome you on
John chairman the executive director and
today we have a very of course a very
interesting program I want to give you
just a couple of notices though before
we begin with today's program and that
is a couple of upcoming events one on
februari seventh a week from Monday will
be hosting Abbas Milani the Iranian
scholar from Sanford who has a new book
on the Shah he'll be introduced and will
be discussing his book with Ali bono
Azizi professor at Boston College that's
at seven o'clock in 66 110 and on
februari 11th a book about the green
movement in Iran I guess it's Persian
week here at MIT by edited by nada
Hashemi and Danny postal professor
Michael Fisher is hosting that event
we're co-sponsoring it's going to be in
61 sorry 6 120 also at 7pm that's on
februari 11th friday those two events
coming up and you're welcome to check
our website for other events throughout
the coming semester so today we have two
speakers and I will just briefly
introduce both of them and then we'll
let them go at the end of their remarks
at the end of Professor chomsky's
remarks will Tate we'll have a Q&A
session for both and there are mics set
up on either side and we'll just
alternate so when the time comes just
line up behind the microphones if you
have a question or a very brief comment
we have to end pretty promptly 5 30
today
per speaker however is Nancy Murray who
has been an activist for peace and
justice in the Middle East since 1988
when she paid her first visit to the
west bank and the Gaza Strip and
subsequently founded and directed the
Middle East justice network for the past
23 years she has been director of
education at the American Civil
Liberties Union of Massachusetts the
author of Palestinians life under
occupation published in 1991 she has
written numerous articles on the
israeli-palestinian conflict including
very recently a chapter entitled
Israel's war on gaza Zionism Pyrrhic
victory ? in the forthcoming vol.1 state
for Palestine Israel a country for all
its citizens she co-founded in 2001 the
Gaza mental health foundation and has
since its inception served as its
president among several other activities
in this area Nancy will speak for about
15 minutes or so and then of course Noam
Chomsky who as I said here a couple of
years ago doesn't need an introduction
I'm not going to try but i do want to
point out his his book which was
published I just misplaced the flyer for
at Gaza in crisis I believe Haymarket
press which came out of a month or two
ago so without further ado please help
me welcome Nancy Marie
thanks very much I would like to thank
the organizers of this event for
inviting me to speak today and I am NOT
going to do so in my ACL u-- capacity my
direct engagement with Gaza as you heard
goes back some 22 years and my most
recent visit was november 2009 now as
founder and president of the gaza mental
health foundation i have been supporting
the efforts of internationally known
psychiatrist dr. adel siraj and his
colleagues at the gaza community mental
health program to alleviate trauma and
instill hope in population of one and a
half million people seventy percent of
them refugees and more than half
children they are caged in a territory
26 miles long and a few miles wide and
denied all the basic freedoms we take
for granted so imagine what the mental
health needs are like in a territory
which over the past four years has
served as a kind of laboratory to find
the breaking point of human beings and I
mean that quite literally as revealed by
some of the WikiLeaks cables which were
published recently in a Norwegian
newspaper Israeli officials informed the
United States in 2008 that it's
draconian blockade was designed to keep
Gaza quote functioning at the lowest
level possible end quote calibrating the
calories people would be permitted while
the whole population was pushed towards
a state of semi starvation was a matter
of government policy carried out with
the collusion of the United States then
came Operation Cast Lead which gave the
IDF the opportunity to try out weapons
that caused the kind of injuries never
before seen in Gaza's hospitals these
weapons include and I more dense inert
metal explosive armaments developed in
the Lawrence Livermore Lab
which shredded everything in a 10-mile
radius the boeing corporation small
diameter gb you 39 bombs which quote
provide the warfighter with increasing
kills per sortie on current and future
manned and unmanned aircraft unquote and
the intensive use of white phosphorus
which under international law was not
permitted to be used near populated
areas but in gaza it was before the war
and before the partial blockade of gaza
that had been in place for over a decade
was replaced with a medieval-style siege
a 2006 study showed that ninety eight
percent of Gaza's children had been
tear-gassed had their homes searched or
damaged or witnessed or directly
experienced the violence of military
attack and that over half suffered from
some form of post-traumatic stress
disorder Operation Cast Lead as you can
imagine push these figures off the
charts and it is not just the children
of Gaza who are in urgent need of mental
health services a large percentage of
Gazans have endured torture mostly at
the hands of Israel but also in prisons
run by the PA and Hamas and every family
has experienced grief over the past 10
years some 4,000 gazans that's the per
capita equivalent of 800,000 Americans
have been killed by the israel defense
forces between the year two thousand and
two thousand and eight thirteen Israelis
had been killed by the crude rockets
fired from the gaza strip now for all
these reasons the Gaza community mental
health program regards mental health and
human rights as inseparable and has been
in the forefront of the struggle for
both so when I last visited Gaza the end
of 2009 the wreckage of war was
everywhere to be seen people were living
in a landscape still strewn with the
rubble of school
those clinics municipal buildings homes
and american-made weapons I was told
that the functioning hospitals did not
have the equipment medicine or expertise
to treat many of the badly injured
patients who could not leave to go to
hospitals outside of Gaza because of the
blockade Israel was blocking the entry
into the Gaza Strip of the emergency
water and sanitation equipment and
resources needed to fix the badly
damaged water and sewage systems in an
oktober 2009 report Amnesty
International found that between 90 and
95 percent of Gaza's water was unfit for
human consumption Israel was not just
permitting the entry on what had called
security grounds of everything from toys
to cement it was also refusing to allow
the UN to bring in the equipment which
was needed to dispose of the huge
stockpile of unexploded ordnance left
over from the war including bombs
weighing as much as a ton anti-tank
missiles mines and illumination rounds 5
tons of the explosives reportedly
disappeared from the stockpile before
that equipment was finally permitted to
enter on March 10 2010 what is the
situation like today you may recall the
international outcry that followed its
deadly attack last May on the mavi
marmara and other ships that were
attempting to break the siege that
outcry forced Israel in June of last
year to say it would be easing its
blockade not ending it as human rights
groups demanded the International Red
Cross and human rights groups have
repeatedly condemned the blockade as the
collective punishment of an entire
civilian population of Gaza which is a
clear violation of international
humanitarian law so what did the easing
of the blockade amount to a court
to Amnesty and 24 other human rights
groups that late last year issued a
report entitled dashed hopes
continuation of the Gaza blockade
Israel's announcement has had little
that little real change on the ground
however the international pressure on
Israel to end the blockade has in fact
been eased here is a passage from the
report quote while the government of
Israel committed to expand and
accelerate the inflow of construction
materials for international projects it
is so far approved seven percent of the
building plans for unrestricted azza and
of that seven percent only a small
fraction of the necessary construction
material has been allowed to enter four
projects including schools and health
centers end quote oh let me continue the
quote in fact the UN reports this is
part of the quote that Gaza requires
670,000 truckloads of construction
material while only an average of seven
hundred and fifteen of these truckloads
have been received per month since the
easing was announced end quote now as I
said these are supplies needed to
rebuild schools clinics and hospitals
Gaza schools are already running double
shifts and using old shipping containers
as classrooms and still 40,000 children
have had to be turned away at the start
of this school year the report states
that more foodstuffs have been permitted
to enter but raw materials necessary for
the economy to function are still being
kept out and nearly eighty percent of
the houses that suffered major damage
during the war have not been rebuilt the
houses that have been rebuilt have done
so using recycled rubber and cement
carried through the tunnels I'm sure you
all know about these hand-hewn tunnels
connecting Gaza in Egypt the report also
says that there has been no easing of
fuel restrictions and vital water
equipment
is still barred meaning that power
outages last four to six hours a day or
more the majority of residents receive
running water only for a short time
every four to five days and 50 to 80
million litres of untreated or partially
treated sewage are dumped into the sea
every day now although Israel has said
it would permit the population some
freedom of movement streamline the entry
and exit permits for medical and
humanitarian reasons and expand
operations of its crossings none of that
has been done on January fifth of this
year a young man died of liver disease
while he was unable to leave Gaza for
life-saving medical treatment and far
from easing the entry of goods through
the border crossings Israel announced a
week ago that it would be closing
entirely its major mechanised crossing
point at Kearney leaving only one minor
crossing suitable for the transfer of
goods from Israel to the Gaza Strip the
economic strangulation of the Gaza Strip
is being intensified by Israel so-called
buffer zones that are killing gauzes
fishing and agricultural industries
although the Oslo Accords had specified
that Gaza's fishermen could access the
maritime area up to 20 nautical miles
from the shore the Israeli Navy fires on
fishing boats that approach a
unilaterally imposed three-mile limit
and it is deprived the densely packed
Gaza Strip of thirty-five percent of its
best agricultural land by declaring an
area between one and two kilometers wide
all along the land perimeter to be a
no-go zone people who enter that zone
are routinely shot at with live
ammunition that includes schoolchildren
who tried to access the seven schools
within the area it includes farmers who
tried to reach portions of their land
wells and greenhouses that have not been
entirely destroyed and it includes
armed demonstrators several of whom have
been killed by snipers while they were
protesting the zone what then lies ahead
for Gaza if the ruinous breach could be
healed between Hamas and Fatah
Palestinians might have more options but
there is no sign that this will happen
soon last August the insightful
Palestinian journalists lamas and Oni
wrote about a proposal by Israeli
Foreign Minister of darla berman that
was leaked to the Israeli press this
proposed under this proposal Gaza would
be placed under European control as an
internationally supervised ghetto
permanently severed from the West Bank
this would accomplish Israel's plan to
fragment the Palestinian territory and
relieve it of responsibility as occupier
for Gaza's battered population quote I
would like Gaza to sink into the sea end
quote Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin had told the US delegation
visiting Jerusalem on sep tember second
1992 some Israeli leaders might see
Lieberman's plan as the next best thing
meanwhile Gazans are threatened with an
even more terrible war a WikiLeaks memo
published in the Norwegian newspaper
summarized an Israeli military briefing
that chief of staff general gabi
ashkenazi gave to a u.s. congressional
delegation in November 2009 when I was
there the general said Israel was
planning for a quote major war end quote
and that quote Israel cannot accept any
restrictions on warfare in urban areas
end quote he seemed to have both
Hezbollah and Hamas in mind as targets
and expressed concern that both groups
were stockpiling rockets and other
weapons if the general was so worried
about a stockpile of weapons in Gaza why
would it be another five months from the
time this memo was drafted before Israel
would finally permit the entry of the
equipment the UN
needed to deal with a huge stockpile of
unexploded bombs and other devices left
over from Operation Cast Lead given what
we know now know about idea of planning
the speculation that Israel's Israel
wanted Hamas to make use of these
weapons so it could have an excuse for
the next major war cannot be dismissed
out of hand the Israeli historian Ilan
Pappe co-author with professor Chomsky
of Gaza in crisis has referred to
Israel's policy in the Gaza Strip as
quote genocide end quote and he is not
the only Israeli who has used the term
as commonly understood of course the
emotive word implies the systematic
massacre of an entire people which does
not describe what is happening in the
Gaza Strip but genocide has another
meaning under international law it was
defined by the 1948 Genocide Convention
a definition that is reiterated in the
2002 Rome charter of the International
Criminal Court as quote any of the
following acts committed with intent to
destroy in whole or in part a national
ethnical racial or religious group as
such killing members of the group
causing serious bodily or mental harm to
members of the group deliberately
inflicting on the group conditions of
life calculated to bring about its
physical destruction in whole or in part
end quote when we see Israel's war and
ongoing blockade of Gaza as the latest
most violent chapter of a six-decade
long project of destroying Palestinian
resistance to dispossession and when we
consider that Israel may be preparing to
launch another all-out war on a people
still in shock from the last one the use
of the word seems both appropriate and
accurate now I hope that you in this
room will refuse to be bystanders to
genocide
in immediate terms you can support the
u.s. boat the aptly named Audacity of
Hope which is due to sail for Gaza
within a few months as part of the
second freedom flotilla it signifies the
refusal of American civil society to go
along with the policies of our
government that are fundamentally
opposed to human rights and
international law we must all raise our
voices to demand not just the easing of
the blockade but its end and freedom for
Gaza and all the people of Palestine
unless the day comes soon when gazans
can again imagine a future in which they
can live dignified lives the rising
generation will be conditioned to think
not in terms of the potential for a just
peace but only a violence and death
thank
well let's pick up where Nancy left off
she emphasized what I think we ought to
concentrate on namely our role in all
this which is enormous and that's the
one thing we can do something about of
course Nancy mentioned that cast lead
was a us-backed Israeli invasion which
is quite correct and she also mentioned
that the the weapons that are used were
used or us weapons they are used in
violation of US law which is quite
explicit that weapons transferred
anywhere have to be for self-defense or
for internal order and was plainly
neither of those they were used in
violation of international law as Nancy
mentioned Amnesty International released
a call for a embargo on all weapons to
Israel that's almost entirely us because
of their violation of international law
and as we can add of US law as well but
nothing has been done about that the
Nancy also mentioned the Genocide
Convention and the Rome Statute for the
International Criminal Court it's worth
bearing in mind that the u.s. rejects
both of them the US did in fact sign the
Genocide Convention after 40 years but
with a reservation saying that it
doesn't apply to the United States
meeting according to our law the United
States is entitled to carry out genocide
that's actually come to the World Court
the after yugoslavia brought a complaint
to the World Court about the u.s. NATO
bombing of Serbia and part of they
charge was genocide the u.s. pleaded at
the court that it had to be excluded
from the proceedings and the court
agreed because of the u.s. reservation
with regard to genocide so case you
didn't know it we were entitled to carry
out genocide as far as the International
Criminal Court is concerned as I'm sure
you know the u.s. refuses to accede to
it so we're free from that to actually
we were also free from World Court
proceedings when the US did accept and
in fact the u.s. initiated helped
initiate the World Court in 1946 it
accepted jurisdiction but with a
reservation the reservation was that the
United States could not be brought to
the court under any international treaty
meaning the UN Charter Organization of
American States charter in fact anything
with any teeth to the u.s. is excluded
aggression as fine terrassa T's are fine
they're all perfectly legal under US law
this also came to the World Court in
nineteen mid-1980s 1984 Nicaragua
brought a case to the World Court
Nicaraguan case was in fact a run by a
distinguished Harvard Law Professor but
his case was mostly thrown out by the
court because he was that Nicaragua was
charging the United States correctly
with violation of international treaties
and the US is self entitled to violate
international treaties to ignore them
and therefore the case had to be
restricted to a very narrow narrow issue
the US bilateral treaty which was enough
for the court to condemn the United
States for what it called unlawful use
of force just a fancy way of saying
international terrorism these are things
we had to know about ourselves in fact
they'd be taught in elementary school in
a free society they certainly should be
known by college students and everyone
else this is part of our international
stance and it relates very explicitly to
the israel-palestine conflict there are
a lot of complicated issues in the world
where it's even hard to conjure up a
possible solution but in this case
there's an obvious settlement which is
at least the first stage towards
something more in fact a necessary first
stage there's an overwhelming
international consensus includes
essentially everyone on a two-state
settlement on the international border
the internationally recognized border
one thing we'll includes essentially
everyone the Arab states the
Organization of Islamic states includes
Iran Europe Latin America non-aligned
countries and affects essentially
unanimous except for the u.s. Israel and
occasionally some Pacific dependency
which say palau which goes along with
the US and this it's right in front of
us right now on the front should be on
the front pages actually it's in the
back pages but right at this moment
Lebanon has just brought a resolution to
the UN Security Council and backed by a
sign also by another 120 countries the
resolution calls for Security Council to
to demand an end to a settlement
expansion in the West Bank and also adds
that wants to declare that all
settlements are illegal as in fact the
Security Council has done in the past
and is incidentally uncontroversial that
was affirmed by the World Court couple
years ago with the support of the US
Justice and a separate declaration
Security Council as i mentioned accepted
by the entire world the in fact even
formally the United States accepts it
but not actually this is not the US has
announced that it will not permit this
resolution to come to the Security
Council and if it does come it will veto
it so here we have the usual story a a
year ago in december two thousand eight
at the General Assembly there was a
resolution passed simply affirming the
right of self-determination for
Palestinians didn't pass unanimously the
US and Israel were opposed and US picked
up I think palau that timer maybe
Micronesia that I don't think was even
reported what's happening right now at
the UN sort of his report that if you
really read the New York Times carefully
yesterday you would have found
underworld news briefs a 5-line mention
of the fact that the u.s. is once again
vetoing the these the the settlement a
peace settlement in the terms accepted
by the entire world actually this goes
pretty far back in 1976 the art of the
major Arab states Egypt and Syria Jordan
others a broth of the Security Council a
resolution January 1976 calling for a
two-state settlement on the
international border the proposal
resolution incorporated all the relevant
wording of you n 2 42 which everyone
agrees is the operative diplomatic
declaration and the US technically
supports in fact helped initiate which
recognizes the right of all states in
the region to the right to exist within
secure and recognized
borders other similar wording that was
vetoed by the United States the first of
such vetoes and long series of them
including votes in the general assembly
right up to yesterday that's the
consistent policy and that's what blocks
peace just as the illegal delivery of
huge arms flows to Israel violates
international and in fact US domestic
law and a matter that and they're used
of course as Nancy pointed out if I
write during cast led middle of cast led
in the middle of the ferocious attack
the US Israeli attack on Gaza two years
ago right in the middle of that the US
the Pentagon was shipping arms to Israel
right in the middle of the attack
actually that was prevented they were
supposed to go from Greeks and the Greek
government refused to send them least
there's one civilized spot in Europe
maybe that explains why Gaza why Greece
was not regarded as part of Europe until
nineteen seventy-four to backward and
uncivilized the the pennant when this
was brought to the Pentagon and they
pleaded that the arms were not intended
to be used for the ongoing attack they
were going to be pre-positioned in
Israel in fact one of the services that
Israel provides to the United States and
part of the reason for the massive
support is it's an offshore military
base in a commercial region of the world
the u.s. pre positions weapons in case
it wants to which it uses in fact when
it's carrying out further aggression in
the region well you know all this is
part of the background which is worth
keeping in mind we and the crucial point
is we play a fundamental role in all
this and until US policy changes until
the US joins the world on this there
isn't going to be a peaceful settlement
even a stage in a settlement like a
two-state settlement well let me go back
to Gaza
to 1948 pre 1948 that Gaza was a fairly
typical mediterranean region fairly
well-off peaceful beautiful beaches port
hinterland which is crucial part of wolf
Palestine it had it's an arid area but
it had arable land and was producing
from it that all changed in 1948 during
the war the war that established the
State of Israel include on in fact half
of what was designated as to be
Palestine the other half was taken over
by Jordan and essentially in collusion
with Israel there was a huge flow of
refugees to Gaza as well as the Lebanon
short the West Bank the the refugee flow
was partly people fleeing in terror
partly just forcefully expelled the
expulsion continued long after the war
so in October 1950 that's year and a
half after the peace treaty the Arab
population of the city of mud doll now
called ash Cologne Israeli Court they
were trucked out expelled into the Gaza
Strip and so it continued well I won't a
lot happened in the subsequent years but
I'll skip to 1967 1967 Israel conquered
Gaza the West Bank and Syrian Golan
Heights that's the political issue now
will there be a peace settlement back to
the international border the major
planners in Israel were two generals
General alone and general Diane they had
slightly different plans about how to
keep control over the West Bank but on
Gaza they agreed they both agreed that
Gaza should become what they called an
integral part of the state of israel
now actually the cabinet didn't accept
that at the time instead it turned to a
policy that has been called d
development adi development is different
from under development actually the term
is due to Sarah Roy she's the leading of
Harvard she's the leading academic
specialist on Gaza and the guy's an
economy and has discussed this in
considerable detail if you're interested
the policy in her words is a d
development she defines as a deliberate
systematic and progressive dismemberment
of an indigenous economy by a dominant
one we're economic and by extension
societal potential is not only distorted
but denied I'm not talking about now I'm
talking about 1967 and that's the policy
that has been followed very
systematically carefully planned Israel
works all these things out the United
States knows all about them contributes
to them and help support them in crucial
ways under D development a no economic
base is to be allowed as Roy discusses
and as she points out this precludes
development of the kind that takes place
in colonized areas where there is a form
of under development that is permitted
and sometimes supported but not in Gaza
there it's d development separation from
the outside total dependency no possible
economic base remember that's 1967 that
I'm talking about there was also plenty
of repression and violence and one
crucial feature which should be familiar
to anyone who's ever visited Israel is
just humiliation Arabs have to be taught
that they are not to raise their heads
it's the term that's used they have to
be humiliated and degraded Thomas
Frieden and the correspondent for the
New York Times
as he puts it Arabs have to be educated
by the use of force to ensure that they
remain submissive and obedience that's
the way you become a famous
correspondent he actually was referring
at that time to the israeli invasion of
lebanon in 2006 murderous destructive
invasion which he strongly approved of
because it was going to help educate
arabs everywhere actually it's an old
position of his in 1988 he won his
second Pulitzer Prize he was then the
New York Times correspondent for Israel
and he was interviewed by the Israeli
press he was asked what he thought the
solution ought to be for the occupied
territories West Bank and Gaza and his
answer was that Israel should treat them
the way they handle southern Lebanon
southern Lebanon at the time it was
occupied by Israel in violation of
long-standing security council orders
that continued until the year 2000 when
Hezbollah essentially drove Israel out
of Lebanon southern Lebanon was run by a
terrorist mercenary army with Israeli
troops in the background to ensure that
everyone was properly educated and
submissive in case there was any trouble
there was a big torture chamber in p.m.
horrible place Red Cross not allowed
actually visited a couple of years ago
and then 2000 invasion Israel wiped it
out that's just the are a couple months
ago because they don't want any
recollection of what they were doing
there so that's the solution for the
West Bank and Gaza according to Thomas
Friedman cold surprise as he won the
Pulitzer Prize but he's a liberal
remember so he said the Palestinians
should get something if we give in his
words if we give achmad a seat in the
bus he may lessen his demands like some
racist Alabama sheriff if we give Sambo
seat in the bus
and maybe he'll sort of stay quiet
that's the liberal version the harsher
version is degradation humiliation
killing repression violence and it was
pretty ugly well very few people were
paying attention as usual as long as
things were more or less under control
and Gaza in the West Bank the in
December 1987 the dam broke that was the
beginning of was called the Intifada
began in Gaza later in the west bank
shortly after it was a real mass protest
against occupation most unexpected
mostly nonviolent by decision there were
plenty of guns around but the leadership
which was a local leadership at the time
decided not to use them it was also a
very impressive social revolution nancy
was there i was there too it was pretty
astonishing to Italy to see it was great
surprise to people who had not been
paying attention to what was happening
and we don't pay attention when things
are quiet Tunisia right in front of our
eyes a perfectly good example the United
States knew perfectly well we again
though this from WikiLeaks cables if you
know it before that it was a brutal
vicious regime of kleptomaniacs and the
population was kept under controlled by
violence and intimidation but we
continue to support it diplomatic
military and so on because things were
quiet I should mention an extenuation of
Washington that Europe was much worse
Frances the leading criminal in this
case and brought Europe along with it
but as long as things are quiet it's
okay that matter how much people are
suffered actually things had been
happening just to give one example a
couple of weeks before the Intifada
broke out in December 1987a
a palestinian school girl teenager
intisar al attar it was shot and killed
in a schoolyard in gaza by a resident of
a nearby Israeli settlement illegal
settlement she mountain gif rock he was
arrested right away he was released on
bail because the Israeli courts
determined i'm quoting that the offense
is not severe enough to warrant
detention he was later acquitted on all
charges apart from negligence the judge
concluded that he only intended to shock
the girl by firing his gun at her in a
schoolyard didn't intend to kill her so
this is not a case of a criminal person
who has to be punished deterred and
taught a lesson by imprisoning him he
Frost was given a seven months suspended
sentence well he's really press reported
settlers in the courtroom broke out in
song and dance well that's the way you
educate people looks a little different
to them but that's the way it looks to
us events like this and there are plenty
of them tell you more about the
occupation I think then the bear figures
which are shocking enough for example
Human Rights Watch which tends to be
rather cautious on this other things
they concluded that quoting them the
number of Palestinians tortures are
severely treated while under
interrogation during the intifada from
this number nineteen eighty seven is in
the tens of thousands out of an adult
male population of less than
three-quarters of a million only a
fraction were eventually charged and
some sentenced almost always on
confessions confession as a euphemism
for torture people don't confess
otherwise the unaffected Israel remains
a major torture state just like us well
throughout the uprising indeed was
overwhelmingly nonviolent
was a social political revolution of an
important kind but the Israeli response
response was extremely brutal and
sadistic there's plenty about this in
Israeli press very little here although
there's enough material and
english-language literature for you to
get a good sense of it in 1989 after two
years of the Intifada a delegation of
peace now leaders doves in Israel met
with Prime Minister Robin who was in
charge of the violence they wanted to
express concern about what was going on
but he assured them he reassured them
his words the inhabitants of the
territories are subject to harsh
military and economic pressure and they
will be broken and accept Israel's terms
which happened there's only so much that
flesh and blood can endure violence is
pretty effective sometimes claimed that
it's ineffective that's just wrong it's
effective from almost all the time
especially when it's unconstrained and
there's no who and authorised by the
owner of the world us and as rightly as
certainly after it was broken Israel
instituted a new policy 1991 that's the
policy of closure the goal was to turns
it into a prison essentially the goal
was to separate the West Bank from Gaza
break them up it's one way to ensure
that they'll never be a viable
Palestinian entity that would be its
seaport its access to the outside and so
on and they've maintained it I say they
because the u.s. backs it so every time
I talk about Israel it's the US and
Israel the US and Israel have maintained
the closure since the Oslo agreements
came along in 1993 it was evident at
once that it was going to be a disaster
for Palestinians Nancy you'll probably
remember a meeting that she sponsored
right here maybe not in this room but at
MIT on the
famous Declaration of Principles into
the day of or the Boston Globe called it
I gave a talk there saying why I thought
it was going to be a disaster and it was
the pace of settlement in the Oslo
agreements did state explicitly that the
West Bank and Gaza are single
territorial entity this is right in the
middle of the time that the US and
Israel are acting two completely
separate them but remember we're talking
about rogue states lawless states that
do what they like because they're
powerful enough to get away with it and
because their citizens don't stop them
so yes Clinton piously signed the
statement saying they're territorial
heading and a TN meanwhile continue to
support the Israeli program of a
separate breaking them apart and that's
been going on since also the pace of
illegal settlement increased some extent
in Gaza but much more in the West Bank
all illegal Keith increased steadily
right through the 90s the peak year was
actually two thousand the year 2000
Clinton's last year course picked up
more later the leading israeli authority
on gaza is a great journalist amira hass
really few serious honest journalists
there now Gaza's been one of the main
places she's written about you lived
there for a couple of years she writes
that now that the total separation of
the gaza strip from the west bank is one
of the greatest achievements of Israeli
politics whose overarching objective is
to prevent a solution based on
international decisions and
understandings and instead dictate an
arrangement based on Israel's military
superiority it's mostly accurate she
should have said it's the greatest
achievement of us Israeli politics and
the consequences are the kind of thing
that Nancy described apart from the
misery and oppression and violence
students say in Gaza can't
attend the West Bank universities were
their students patients who have to get
to a East Jerusalem hospital can't go
there they can't get medications can't
go on family visits left starts one
territory this family's on all sides
totally broken that meanwhile the
repression was intensified and they
strip now a prison was reduced to misery
next big step was in august 2005 as
under Prime Minister Sharon the most the
toughest and harshest of Israeli leaders
up till that time he's been exceeded in
august 2005 he declared what was called
a disengagement from Gaza the roughly
8,000 settlers who were there taking
about thirty percent of the land
including military installations and
infrastructure and a good deal of the
scarce resources particularly water they
were to leave they were to leave their
subsidised homes in Gaza and go to
subsidized homes in the West Bank much
more valuable territory for Israel now
that was quite sensible by this time the
Gaza was a hopeless disaster there was
very little point keeping a couple
thousand settlers they're protected by a
substantial part of the Israeli army and
transferring them to the west bank made
a good deal of sense now this could have
been done very easily very easily it
would have been enough for Israel to
announce that on August first the IDF
the Israeli army will leave Gaza at that
point the couple of thousand settlers
would climb into the lorries provided to
them and move from there subsidized
homes in Gaza to better subsidized homes
in the West Bank but though that could
have been done easily it wouldn't have
had any prep
ganda effect so what was none was
something quite different a very
carefully staged national trauma if you
were around reading the Boston Globe at
that time you would have seen front page
pictures of a little boy you know
pleading with soldiers not to destroy
his home subheading never again you know
reminding you of the Holocaust and it
was a wonderful performance the smarter
people in Israel ridiculed it but it
played it was meant for the American
audience primarily in Europe I don't
played well you know so this means we
were doing this amazing thing we're
destroying people's homes we have to
have the West Bank never again what made
it particularly ridiculous was that this
was a replay a virtually exact replay of
something that had happened in nineteen
eighty-two in 1979 Israel in the United
States were compelled to sign a treaty
with Egypt which required that Israel
evacuate Egypt and particularly evacuate
a city that they had illegally built in
the Egyptian Sinai and there was the
same stage drama almost identical to
1985 in fact the Israeli press it was
headlined national trauma 1982 part of
the whole propaganda system aimed mainly
at you and other people who fund and
support all of this replayed in 1985
this is kind of important because if the
u.s. does we throw out support for from
Israeli occupation in the West Bank and
the illegal settlement and Israel will
do what it's told because there's no
choice they will stage another trauma
but they don't have to to get the
settlers out of the West Bank it is
sufficient to do exactly what
scribe withdraw the IDF help them leave
subsidize them to homes in Israel mostly
over if a couple of people from Brooklyn
want to hang on to every rock they can
stay there and be in a Palestinian state
no need for any trauma or forceful
relocation or anything else that that
doesn't play well well that's the as is
our way through what happened I won't
describe it but i'll quote two leading
israeli scholars you need their tolland
Akiva Eldar the store and Israel's
leading diplomatic correspondent at the
standard book on the occupation
scholarly book they write that after
israel withdrew its forces from gaza in
august 2005 the ruined territory was not
released for even a single day from
Israel's military grip or from the price
of the occupation that the inhabitants
pay every day Israel left behind
scorched earth devastated services and
people with nearly neither a present nor
future the settlements were destroyed in
an ungenerous move by an unenlightened
occupier which in fact continues to
control the territory and kill and her
assets inhabitants by means of its
formidable military might they're
talking about fall 2005 and that might
of course can be exercised with extreme
savagery that thanks to firm us support
and participation and silent
acquiescence on the part of the American
population well the attacks continued
I've got worse in January 2006 when
Palestinians committed a major crime
January 2006 important event took place
the first free election in the Arab
world carefully monitored and supervised
recognized to be free and fair but
Palestinians didn't commit a crime they
voted the wrong way you don't vote the
wrong way and expect to get away with it
people in Haiti recognize that they're
suffering from it right now and
elsewhere too soon as they voted for
Hamas which the US and Israel didn't
like instantly and quite publicly
incidentally front pages of the
newspapers Israel in the United States
said about punishing the population for
the crime instituting harsh sanctions
intensify the siege and so on in June
that play military attacks as well that
escalated in June destruction of power
stations of sewage and so on picked up
again very intensively after jun 25th on
jun 25th Hamas captured an Israeli
soldier at the border alleged shall eat
that led to a very sharp escalation it's
called Operation summer rains will run
through it but it was horrible she'll
eat has become a household name that
kind of a symbol of Hamas terror he's
the main justification for offered for
Israel siege and violence it's an
interesting case of very brazen
hypocrisy they get away with certainly
shall he should be returned and some
kind of prisoner exchange but Israel
been doing this for years in much worse
cases not capturing soldiers and
attacking army whatever you think that
is but capturing and kidnapping
civilians in Lebanon and piracy and the
high seas the mother you Mauro Mauro is
nothing to going on for decades to bring
him to Israel putting him in prison
holding them there for many years often
as hostages sometimes in secret prisons
furthermore just to heighten the
hypocrisy one day before Charlotte was
captured Israeli troops entered Gaza
City and kidnapped a two civilians a
doctor and his brother one hour
they spirited them across the border in
violation of the Geneva Conventions and
they disappeared into Israel's prison
system where unknown thousands of people
are there without trial and they're sort
of gone well well whatever you think
about capturing a soldier of an
attacking army the kidnapping civilians
and imprisoning them without charge is a
far worse crime but then it did get a
few words of mention here and there but
it's gone nobody ever heard of them just
yell at cheley another indication of our
hypocrisy in which is monumental i
should say in november there was another
military operation attacking gaza autumn
clouds june two thousand seven another
major event took place the US and Israel
with the cooperation of the Palestinian
Authority tried to carry out a military
coup in Gaza to get rid of the offending
government that had been popularly
elected was run by a Fatah strongman
Muhammad aztlan it was preempted Hamas
preempted it beat it back and the
complete control of Gaza that has ever
since been offered as a proof of Hamas
as extreme violence aggression and so on
how dare they beat back a military coup
that the United States was carrying out
to overthrow an elected government I
mean that's just another major crime the
siege tightened harshly in response to
that crime continued jun 2008 Egypt
sponsored a ceasefire between Israel and
from us a very important event Hamas
lived up to it completely the Israeli
government officially recognizes that as
long as the ceasefire held not a single
Hamas rocket was fired Israel did not
accept the siege the ceasefire it
violated it in
Lee part of the ceasefire agreement was
to open the borders but Israel
maintained the siege and the excuse was
gilad shalit the captured soldier so
therefore they were free to violate the
siege Hamas did live up to it in
November on November fourth day of the
US election under cover of the election
Israeli troops entered Gaza killed half
a dozen Hamas militants then the totally
fabricated pretext and then the rocket
firing started again of course Israel's
firing was much worse there were
casualties all Palestinian as usual in
December the formal truce ended Hamas
called for it to be revived the Israeli
cabinet considered that rejected it and
decided instead to invade that's cast
lead here comes another massive exercise
of hypocrisy universally in the West
this even includes the human rights
groups the invasion was justified maybe
not the manner in which was carried out
it was criticized as disproportionate
and so on but it was justified because
Israel has the right of self-defense yes
Israel has the right of self-defense so
as so does everyone but the issue is
totally different try to find a word
about this anywhere the issue is the
right of self-defense by force that's
the issue you don't have a right of
self-defense by force unless you've
exhausted peaceful means in this case
Israel in the US had decided not to try
peaceful means because there was every
reason to believe that they would work
that the ceasefire would be instituted
so it's just pure outright aggression in
fact if one bullet had been fired into
Gaza would have been a crime
disproportionate yes or all the
atrocities yes everything on the
Goldstone report true but those are
basically footnotes the real issue is
straight outright aggression legitimate
because
The Godfather in Washington approves of
it and participates and commentary goes
long press goes long and so on and we
keep quiet well December 27th came the
murderous assault they will describe it
the assault was very carefully planned
it was planned to end hours before the
inauguration of Barack Obama that was
quite important during the attack Obama
the incoming president he was asked what
he thought about all this he says well
I'm sorry I can't talk about it there's
only one president January 18th there
was one president it was him so
therefore the attack had to end before
the inauguration not because Israel
expected him to say anything he was
strongly in support of it lucky's in
support of every Israeli atrocity even
more than Thomas Frieden but it saved
him the embarrassment of having to
figure out a way to avoid saying
anything about it so that ended that at
that point Obama made one decent move
the only one so far with regard to
Israel Palestine he appointed a
negotiator George Mitchell good choice
however he made it explicit right away
this is end of January 2009 that
Mitchell would not be able to do
anything fact he did it in a very
interesting way which sold here he gave
a speech is one major speech about the
Middle East and he said that there are
now opportunities for peace George
Mitchell moved towards it he said he
referred to a constructive proposal
namely by the Arab League of Arab League
had proposed repeating what had been on
the table for a long time they had
proposed a full peace settlement with on
the international border usual
conditions and they added something more
they said that after the peace agreement
they would proceed to normalize
relations with
Israel and Obama referred to it he said
very constructive proposal he called
upon the Arab states to live up to their
proposal and normalize relations with
Israel he's an intelligent person he's
literate he can read he knows perfectly
well that that was not the proposal the
proposal was to establish a two-state
settlement and queries accord with a
long-standing international consensus
and in that context to normalize
relations Obama carefully omitted the
content and kept to the footnote yes go
ahead and proceed to normalize relations
while Israel continues with our help to
take over your territory anybody who was
thinking for a minute could see that
that signal that Obama was going to do
precisely nothing about the occupied
territories except to continue the
Israeli occupation and settlement which
is exactly what has happened up till
yesterday when as I said the u.s.
announced once again that it's going to
block or veto any resolution about
Palestinian rights that comes to the
Security Council Mitchell was a good
choice but not allowed to do anything he
had shackles and that's finished anyway
just a couple of weeks ago rather
quietly Mitchell was pretty much
displaced by a dennis ross who comes
straight out of the israeli lobby it's
the end of that last May as Nancy
mentioned the Israel attacked a Turkish
ship in international waters killing
nine people one of them an American
citizen forcing it to Israeli port in a
way there shouldn't have been any
reaction to that Israel been doing it
for decades piracy on the high seas
killing people kidnapping them and so on
but this one did receive an
international outcry in almost the
entire world not in the US where it was
endorsed the congressional resolution
and so on more legitimate self-defense
but outside the United States there was
a substantial out pride especially
Turkey as you can imagine turkey almost
broke relations and in reaction to the
international outcry Israel did pledge
to relieve the siege and Nancy already
described you what happened I won't
repeat just repeat one sentence that she
properly quoted from the Amnesty
International report they said that the
so-called easing of the Gaza blockade
does not change the fact that there is
still a cruel and illegal blockade
collectively punishing the entire
civilian population the only real easing
has been the easing of pressure on the
Israeli authorities to end this cruel
and illegal practice that's the point of
propaganda exercises i should add
however that there has been no easing of
pressure here because there is no
pressure in the first place so it can't
be eased the u.s. and us alone not only
exerts no pressure but participates
actively directive lee and crucially in
the crimes that means that the roadblock
to peace remains right here which is
actually good news for us it's an
optimistic conclusion because right here
is the one place where we can do
something about what's going on
so do people want to line up there's one
there and one there okay we can start
there thank you very much and my name is
a comer was child I'm among other I'm
Israeli and although I share some of
your viewers I also object many of them
and I hear a lot about the blockade and
about that Israel doesn't allow the
transportation of oil and many important
things such as good and everything but I
must say that someone might think that
Israel seats Israel surrounds Gaza but
Israel does not surround gaza gaza has
an important border with egypt and my
question is how can you explain that the
Egyptian regime which actually ruled
Gaza until 67 and many families are part
of them in Gaza and part of them are in
a raffia in Egypt how come they don't
supply oil food a medicine how come you
expect Israel which is in war with Gaza
to open the borders why not you expect
their brothers in Egypt to support them
furthermore if you read in WikiLeaks you
find out that the Palestinian Authority
by itself asked Israel to crash Hamas so
maybe the real picture is the Hamas is a
great threat to not only to Israel but
also to the Palestinians which share the
vision of peace and also to Egyptian
switch unfortunately they have a
roofless regime but is for peace and
I then protect the peace agreement well
a gyp tis like Tunisia when we talk
about Egypt we may need Ipsen
dictatorship not the people of Egypt the
Egyptian dictatorship is harsh and
brutal it's closely allied with Israel
it's the second largest recipient of US
military aid after Israel and it's
perfectly true that our friends the
vicious Egyptian dictatorship don't have
anything new with Gaza Strip for one
thing because Hamas is an offshoot of
the Muslim Brotherhood and if Egypt
Egypt understands and the u.s.
understands that if they ever permitted
anything remotely like a free election
in Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood would do
pretty well in fact the one time they
did kind of symbolically open up an
election they did very well at which
point the US instantly stopped it's
critical talk about let's bring
democracy to Egypt that expanded its
support for the dictatorship Obama once
again has broken new ground and support
for the dictatorship you may recall when
Obama made his famous trip to Cairo to
deliver a conciliatory speech to the
Muslim world much propaganda about it
there was a press conference on the way
and one reporter sort of got out of
control i suppose and asked a perfect
question he said what are you going to
say about the authoritarian regime in
Egypt authoritarian is a big
understatement incidentally Obama answer
he said his answer I'll quoted he said I
don't like to use labels for folks
whenever a political figure uses the
word folks you wait and see what lie is
going to come out otherwise you talk
about people but they're you know maybe
gangsters or something but he didn't
like to use labels for folks so he was
not going to call Mubarak authoritarian
he went on say Mubarak was a good man
he's doing good things he's keeping the
country stable he's helpful to us so
everything's fine so yes that's another
brutal dictator who we happily support
as long as he keeps things under control
with regard to Hamas yeah they the
Egyptian dictatorship certainly hates
Hamas even more than Israel does that
because they are as I said offshoot of
the Muslim Brotherhood major would be
the probably the biggest political force
in Egypt is they if they allowed as far
as the Palestinian Authority is
concerned well I I already discussed
that the Palestinian Authority
cooperated with the United States and
Israel try to carry out a military coup
to overthrow the elected government they
don't want if they don't want an elected
government in which they are not the
ruling editing so sure that's true it's
only that's a very typical of colonial
regimes I almost any just take a look at
history of colonies the Imperial country
almost invariably is supported in fact
relies on the domestic collaborators
that's the way they maintain things I
mean the British Red India you know huge
place with very few British soldiers
they relied on Indian see poison Gurgeh
is a collaborative Indian ruling class
us read the Philippines that way it's
run its central american colonies that
way sure that standard in fact about 15
years ago israeli industrialists
approached the government and urged them
to change policy they said instead of
trying to maintain a colonial policy of
the West Bank they should establish a
new colonial policy which they said
would be much more effective a deal
colonial policy take a look at eight
world the tendency most of the
population sort of lives in misery but
there is a small elite which does very
well you go to the poorest Central
African country and the elite in charge
backed by us or France or some other
gangster state live in extreme luxury
better than people do here and they're
responsible for maintaining the control
I'd like to penology or not and his
family in Tunisia or the Shah of Iran or
the Mubarak in Egypt and so on that's
the standard neo-colonial system in
effect now if you go to Rome Allah kind
of like Paris telling restaurants
theaters high life and so on there's
also a military force there's an army
paramilitary army was run by an American
general general Dayton now it's replaced
by someone else and the goal that
purposes the armies to control the
population for example during Operation
Cast Lead the Dayton army was so
effective that there weren't even
protests in the West Bank people
couldn't produce the violence being
carried out against Gaza of course
wanted to they couldn't because the
Dayton Army prevented it until they're
very proud of that so was our senator
senator john kerry who's you know
basically obama's point men in the
middle east shortly after the this he
made a speech an important speech in
which he said that finally israel has a
legitimate negotiating partner after all
these years legitimate negotiating
partners the Palestinian Authority why
because they're now passive and obedient
and they're under the control of a
neo-colonial army which the US runs and
trains in alliance with Israel which is
quite happy about it and Jordan another
dictatorship that we support and as long
as they keep things under control
cares so sure the Palestinian Authority
is our neo-colonial subordinate and
you're absolutely right they would very
much like to undermine the election and
as I said participated it eagerly in a
military coup to try to do so and the
Egyptian dictatorship the same so as
long as our friends the ones we are
happy to have on our side are brutal
dictators neo-colonial collaborators and
so on yeah everything looks good if I
could just add to that recently I think
just like last week subsidiary of
Blackwater was given an 85 million
dollar grant by the US government to
basically perfect the new police state
which is emerging in the West Bank
should we go over here yes um mr.
Chomsky when you were talking about how
the Israelis treat the Arabs you kept
using words like degradation humiliation
that they need to keep be taught to keep
their heads down I don't know about
anyone else in the room but the thought
that came to mind was the Nazis
treatment towards Jews were you trying
to make some connection do you really
believe that Israel is these terrible
monster aggressors and Hamas is the
victims in this case oh you can pick
your adjectives but I'm just describing
the facts yes standard practice was to
make sure that they don't raise their
heads you can read any Israeli press you
see it if you go there and sometimes
just say I didn't see that sorry I not
interesting sometimes it is really
disgraceful so for example about 20
years ago and the Town Hall who happen
to be in the West Bank they were the
mayor and
I reckon kill expelled Jean things
happen that we're so ugly that Israeli
Hawks the ultra Hawks brought it to the
government and complained about it what
was happening is that the Israeli
soldiers I'm sorry I don't have the
exact words but I can get them for if
you like entered the town compelled all
the men got the women into the houses
compelled all the men I think they drove
him into a mosque and they compelled
them to crawl to crawl through the dirt
and other degrading things and then they
actually wrote on their wrists numbers
of the kind that mimicking the
concentration camps it was it was
discussed in the Israeli press your own
Perry is one of their main maybe the
main authority on civil military affairs
wrote a horrified article about it maybe
he would probably in English I don't
know in which he said that Yahweh we
treat Arabs although he said we don't
treat Arabs that way we treat our
ablution that way if you know any modern
Hebrew our abou shame is kike or nigger
so they're not really people so that's
the way you treat our bhushan so yeah it
happens you pick your adjectives okay
this side my name is Tina shrivastav and
I'm one of the engineers at MIT one of
the students that you referred to at the
beginning of your speech who is an
informed of these types of things that
are going on and we come to these types
of forums to understand and what I'm you
know hearing as I've heard from other
such lectures is that for decades
Amnesty International and other such
efforts haven't been able to make the
type of impact that needs to be made to
stop the genocide and stop what's going
on so what is your advice to engineers
students that have professions that
we're following but we don't want to be
complacent with
going on we don't want to stand by and
let this happen but what is your advice
as to what specifically we should be
doing about it I'm sorry I'm good here
what is your advice about summations I
think it's d it's typical chaplain what
is what is your advice about what they
can do so they're not complacent and
just bystanders yes I apologize it
wasn't loud enough what I was saying is
I'm sorry that's not that you're not
allowed the Nessie transmitted so what
can we do you know anything we want this
is a very free society we don't have to
stand by and let the US government to
take the stand that it's not subject to
the Genocide Convention that it's not
subject to World Court rulings that it
doesn't have to obey treaties that it
can carry it can participate actively
and murderous and vicious actions that
we can stop that yes but protesters and
Amnesty International haven't been
effective at maintaining effective
because we haven't picked it up the
empty international appeal international
is a pretty conservative organization
when they call for an arms embargo it
ought to be really easy to organize
people here to say okay let's force the
United States to stop sending arms just
a couple of weeks ago Human Rights Watch
which is even more conservative very
careful about what it says about Israel
with course its funding base they came
out with an appeal saying that the US
should stop any aid to Israel that goes
into the occupied territories because
also jade is illegal so we stopped all
such a they also added something else
they said the United States autumn
monitor tax-free organizations and see
if they are violating the law which of
course they are so the Jewish National
Fund which is tax freeze that means
you're paying for it they are involved
all over an illegal
a takeover of land and settlement and
the occupied territories they do it kind
of beanie ously through subsidiary but
it's not very profound well you know
picking up on what is advocated by Human
Rights Watch and Amnesty International
is a very conservative position you can
organize Americans on that it has to be
done students can start where they are
there are other things you can do for
example there are programs have been
many campuses could happen here too
which are insisting on a boycott for
flow and divestment from any corporation
that's involved in the occupation there
are many of them including high-tech
ones so it's interesting to us on a
boycott of products from the settlements
of any Israeli institution that's
involved in the settlements and so on
that makes good sense that's a growing
movement can be done very well sometimes
it's done not so well there was such a
campaign here about 10 years ago Harvard
and MIT would you do the wording just
happened to be badly chosen so it
backfired but if you do it correctly
it's very effective and people can
understand it they can start thinking
about their own what they themselves are
doing you know why are we supporting
this I mean remember foreign aid is not
popular in the United States and the
Republican leadership in the house is
very well aware of that Republicans are
farm work stream and supportive Israeli
atrocities and the Democrats or even
though most of the Jewish money in vote
goes to the Democrats there the
representative of the business community
and the eric cantor the new isn't the
majority leader in the house or whatever
he is he recently proposed don't know if
it's been implemented that aid to israel
be taken out of the foreign aid budget
and put in a pentagon budget because if
it's if it's in the pentagon budget it's
centrally untouchable but if it's in the
foreign aid budget people who don't like
foreign aid
she's almost everybody I will sooner or
later recognized that the foreign aid is
out of sight in fact Obama work all
records he agreed to not to give Israel
like 30 billion dollars over the next
decade and 30 billion translates into
roughly twice that because of various
techniques that are used to amplify the
aid so they're trying to protect it they
understand that there could be popular
opposition and it's up to people like
like us you know to organize the popular
opposition if I could add if you go to
the website and the occupation org there
is a lot of material about military aid
how to end it there's a lot you can get
on their mailing lists and really take
part in a lot of activities that they're
coordinating around the country that's
an umbrella group of about 400 different
organizations there are also
organizations in Boston one of them is
one I work with called be CPR Boston
Coalition for Palestinian rights which
also the website is bcp rights org so
there's there are things going on I
think what has happened over the years
is these efforts have really had great
problems getting beyond the usual
suspects the people who turn out you
know to all the meetings will turn out
to the next meeting but to to break
through that's been difficult and going
to see say senator Kerry with his
powerful position on the Foreign
Relations would be much more effective
if people who were not the usual
suspects who he's heard from you know
endlessly would you know start writing
him start going to him start calling him
then he would think hmm something is
afoot it's not just the people i'm
getting sick up and you know i don't
have to pay attention to so you know you
might think oh it's such a huge problem
but if there can be some sign of forward
movement i think that would be very
effective in making people take another
look at this over here we
you I just would like to make a brief
comment I think that one of the reasons
that this is such a difficult conflict
is because it touches on so many larger
issues it touches on Zion is aman Arab
identity it touches on even the
Holocaust it brings up such fundamental
ideas like state sovereignty it brings
up you know people's religious identity
and in addition people are very
connected and very personally affected
by many of these issues and Minh
international affairs major but it did
strike me that a lot of both of your
discussions were quite limited with with
a few touches on 48 and 67 there was a
lot of focus on the last few years and
well I think it's important to to keep
in mind that you know we we have to
focus on what's happening now I think
that the reason that this is such a
complex issue is because of so many
larger things and keeping that in mind I
would have a question for ms murray
about her definition that you were
discussing about of genocide and the
more recent one being that it's
attempting to destroy in whole or part
etcetera etcetera a group of people
based on their ethnicity on their
national identity and i think that as in
a lot of international treaties
resolutions it's a very vague
description so i think it's quite easy
to say that it is it that the
palestinian plight currently should be
considered a genocide and while i agree
with you i was wondering if you could
elaborate on that a little bit you want
me to elaborate on on why you think that
it's a very vague definition of genocide
so it's not all that vague if you look
at in fact that the definition includes
any of the following not all of the
following so you could look through what
the following are and you can apply that
to what Israel is doing sin
when people object to the use of the
word apartheid applied to what Israel is
doing there is the convention on the
crime of apartheid and if you look at
what it says apart ideas and that by the
way is a universal definition it is not
about South Africa after south africa's
apartheid fell this convention of
apartheid was basically restated as part
of the 2002 Treaty of Rome so you can
actually look at what apartheid is
defined to be and see how Israel is
doing that in his practices so I wasn't
using it rhetorically I was you know
saying that okay maybe this word we
should just drop from our vocabulary but
if we're not going to drop it from our
vocabulary it certainly seems applicable
given the definition I can just say a
word about the complexity I think it's
both simple and complex as I mentioned
it's extremely simple the United States
unilaterally has been blocking a
peaceful settlement for 35 years that's
simple okay if the united states joined
the world you could move towards a stage
in a political settlement so that part
simple the complex part is why the
United States doesn't do it why is the
United States an outlier on this and so
many other things like the Genocide
Convention the World Court you know the
International Criminal Court and so on
well partly it's just us power so
overwhelming it can do every lights
nobody can say anything about it if
partly it's a passive population partly
it's an extremely obedient intellectual
class which simply conforms and fringe
elements may say something but they're
extremely conformist another thing
really is complex and here I think
you're right about bringing up these
other dimensions Christian Zionism goes
back way before George Zionism long
before and it's not just Christian
evangelicals it's all through the elites
drew wilson was you know read the Bible
every day in the Roosevelt
administration top figure said the
return of the Jews to Palestine is the
greatest event in history and so on and
so forth I mean this is a very religious
country off the spectrum always has been
and leadership a lot of them you know
about half the population thinks the
world is created a couple thousand years
ago just a couple of days at weeks ago
one of the new Republican Congressmen
one who's taking an important committee
said we don't have to worry about global
warming because God wouldn't allow it
you don't hear things like that in other
countries literally it'd be hard to find
it anywhere so it's a very religious
country so all the way through the
elites they study the Bible the Bible
said that the chosen people should
Massacre and slaughter the indigenous
populations Bible after all maybe the
most generous idol X literary canon and
and the in fact when Alan me during the
First World War British general Allenby
that conquered Jerusalem you could read
in The Washington Post The New York
Times of British press that this is
fantastic event we finally won the
Crusades you know we have rescued
jerusalem from the pagans who have been
legitimately saying there since the
since rich Allenby was regarded as
Richard the lion-hearted literally and
and you know part of what is memorized
by the people who go through this
experience is God promised the Palestine
to the Jews so therefore they have to go
back now the Christian evangelicals who
are not a small group that's another
maybe thirty percent of the population
the people who believe in the literal
truth of every word in the Bible that's
again a unique u.s. phenomenon far as I
know for them it
on there the most extreme anti-semites
in the world they are also the strongest
supporters of Israel in the world now
that goes together their position their
interpretation of the revelations and
all that business is that there should
we should do something to create
Armageddon fantastic battle and this
place in Palestine where everyone
slaughters each other the saved Souls go
to heaven we have Christ returns we have
a thousand years of peace of the Jews a
hundred and forty-four thousand are
going to survive I suppose that's not
sure what the story is I supposed to 12
times the maybe 12 information twelve
tribes or something like that outside of
those 144,000 all of them are damned to
eternal damnation I mean it Hitler
didn't say that those are the strongest
supporters of Israel in the United
States and Israel cultivates them that
they kind of with a wary eye because you
know when they're going to get our
control that's the so that special
newspapers for them and so on and that's
a big part of the electorate so you have
a deeply Christian country fanatically
religious all the way up to the top
elite level saying yeah God said this so
it has to happen and you have a
substantial part of the population which
is really extreme like kind of nothing
maybe Islamic radicals in Pakistan or
something but other than that there's
almost nothing like it so yeah that's
these are big currents there's another
factor in the United States to remember
that the United States is a settler
colonial society that's the worst form
of imperialism by far settler colonial
society is one we exterminate the
natives and take over and in the case of
the settlement of the United States like
our famous forefathers when they came to
New England they were the pilgrims they
were waving the holy book they were
turning to the promised land they were
the children of israel following God's
orders to murder the Amalekites down to
the last moment child donkey and so on I
they were doing it in God's name also
for the benefit of the people that goes
right through American history and
settler that when Americans kind of look
at Israel it's like an instinctive
reaction that that's the right thing to
do that's what we did after all and
anything we did it's got to be right by
definition and they're in fact using the
same holy texts that we used well you
know that's an element too so the long
way to go there are other factors like
the American business community is
strongly pro-israel the military
industry loves so there are a lot of
factors there's also a big Bobby so sure
there's plenty of complexity when you
get to the American scene on the other
hand in the international scene you
notes of course these complexities but
it's unusually straightforward you have
virtual unanimity and I have four
decades over here um hey everyone my
name is Sebastian Leon I'm an
undergraduate here at MIT freshman and a
professor Chomsky at the beginning of
your speech you mentioned some very
astounding features about u.s. foreign
policy that I was unaware of such as
their reservation from the World Court
and the genocides and i was wondering in
this political with leon politicized
media that essentially control and very
much defined what we think about world
affairs how would you suggest young
people to become informed regarding
these issues i wouldn't just talk about
the medium did you learn it in school um
yeah briefly you didn't learn that your
civics courses makes grade you should
have those are very important facts
about the united states if we really
respected our freedom and photo was
something to be honored that's what you
would teach in elementary school
certainly it call
everybody in college want to know this
stuff backwards and forwards there's
nothing secret about it now it's all
correct quite public I mean
uncontroversial you know court records
official documents anything you like
what can you do about it well you know
as a college student it's really easy I
don't you guys know how to do in
research and you know how to inform
others so it takes work doesn't happen
by itself they can't take a pill but
it's not hard to do I mean I can look if
you want a written about it with the
sources you can look up the sources and
check it out for yourself Dewey library
i'll have it all okay this is the last
question thank you um one thing that
struck me was when you mentioned the
Blackwater contract that kind of
expenditure should always be accompanied
by a country asking the hard question of
what it is trying to achieve and is it
worth what what it costs what was the
Blackwater contract for that you cited
well it's going to be to discipline the
population help train you know to this
whole new emerging set of police
officers and army that professor Chomsky
mentioned in the West Bank what was the
cost of the 85 million dollars um what
is that 85 million getting for the
United States what does our involvement
in Israel which is obscenely expensive
every American citizen in this room
should should cringe at at the number I
and I don't know it off the top of my
head but it it it's obscene it seems to
me that the more effective way to argue
against us involvement in this would be
to point out that we're spending a
tremendous amount of money a tremendous
amount of political capital in really
not seeing any meaningful benefit
I was just wondering for you thought
about your thoughts on like utilitarian
argument well you know policies aren't
designed for the benefit of the
population accidentally policies are
designed for the benefit of the
policymakers and their constituencies
the constituencies of policymakers in
the United States are major
multinational corporations and financial
institutions the extreme wealth and so
on if that's a secret I'm it's certainly
not a secret you can find out details if
you like so if you want to find out what
we're benefiting who's benefiting go to
the website as a intel since weird MIT
world's biggest chip maker it's a couple
of days ago they announced that they're
expanding their major facility for the
new generation of chips which they hope
is going to take over the world market
in Israel good place to invest high-tech
population that's a lot of poverty and
all sorts of other things but the second
population is well-educated often back
from MIT and so on and it's a they're
very closely linked to it so is a
military industry fact the linkages are
so tight that if you looked at WikiLeaks
and one of the interesting revelations
about Israel was that the u.s. lists a
number a series of locations in the
world that are of very high significance
for us purity and one of those near
Haifa it's the Raphael plant it's a
Israel's major military industry which
is so tightly linked to the united
states that they shifted a lot of their
management to Washington because if
they're operating from Washington it's
easier to get contracts and influence
policy and so on it's kind of like a
sign economy it's an officer of the
military repositioning are
joint exercises a common intelligence
interest go back to the 1950s this it's
always been regarded as part of the
system for controlling the Middle East
region that's really important you know
the energy regions notice the
controlling the middle east is entirely
independent of getting popular support
because remember we count always on the
dictators we support to control the
population so it doesn't matter what the
public thinks actually that came out
very clearly in WikiLeaks to maybe the
most intriguing revelation at least that
I've seen in WikiLeaks and the one that
got all the headlines you know is that
the claim that the Arabs support US
policy against towards a grant big
headlines Jilly ran and soul missing all
of these reports I couldn't find one
word about it was the fact that the
Brookings Institute major Institute had
just released the poles of Arabic
opinion by the major polling agency in
the United States very respected polling
agency they found that in the Arab world
there were some who regarded Iran as a
threat ten percent seventy-seven percent
regarded the US as the major threat
eighty-eight percent regarded Israel's
the major three the fact that tagging
ISM towards US policy is so extreme that
a majority I think fifty-seven percent
said the region would be better off if
he ran had nuclear weapons well nobody
talks about that because that's just the
population and who cares about them as
long as we have nice folks like Mubarak
and ben ali as long as you think
and King Abdullah and Saudi Arabia and
so on as long as they can crush the
population who cares it's not just the
Diplomatic Service in the State
Department that don't care the
intellectual community doesn't care
there's no commentary on this no
discussion the Imperial mentality is so
profound and the contempt for democracy
is so deep that these things don't even
reach the radar well you know that's the
community we live in that's something
certainly we can do something about okay
well thanks everybody I guess
well I think it everywhere to say I
agree with everyone
