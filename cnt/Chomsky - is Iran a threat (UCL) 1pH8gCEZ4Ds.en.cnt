>> In Western policy making circles
and among political commentators the Iranian threat is considered
to pose the greatest danger to world order and hence,
must be the primary focus of US foreign policy;
Europe's trailing along politely as usual.
This year is called the Year of Iran, because of the danger
of that enormous threat,
which does raise a question: what exactly is the Iranian threat?
If you read the public commentary you don't get much
of an answer, but there actually is an authoritative answer,
which is ignored.
The authoritative answer is provided by the regular
reports to Congress by the Pentagon
and US intelligence agencies that come every year,
reports on the global security and of course,
they include a section on Iran;
the most recent was  almost a year ago.
The reports make it very clear
that whatever the Iranian threat is, it's not military.
So I'll quote, "Iran's military spending is relatively low
compared to the rest of the region."
In fact, it's less than a quarter of that of Saudi Arabia
and minuscule as compared with the US, of course.
Iran's military doctrine is strictly defensive,
designed to slow an invasion
and to force a diplomatic solution to hostilities.
Iran has only limited capacity
to project force beyond its borders.
They, of course, bring up the nuclear option and say that
"Iran's nuclear program and its willingness
to keep open the possibility
of developing nuclear weapons is a central part
of its deterrent strategy."
Well, the brutal clerical regime
in Iran is undoubtedly a major threat
to its own people - hardly outranks US allies
in that regard - but the threat lies elsewhere and it's ominous.
The one element of the threat is Iran's potential deterrent
capacity; notice that that's an illegitimate exercise
of sovereignty because it might interfere with US freedom
of action in the region.
And it's, of course, glaringly obvious why Iran would seek a
deterrent capacity; just take a look at the disposition
of forces in the region, including nuclear forces.
Seven years ago one of Israel's leading military historians,
Martin van Creveld, wrote that,
"The world has witnessed how the United States attacked Iraq
for, as it turned out, no reason at all."
Had the Iranians not tried
to build nuclear weapons they would be crazy, particularly
when they're under constant threat by--
constant threat of attack by the United States,
of course in violation of the UN Charter but,
remember that that doesn't apply to the United States.
Whether they are, in fact,
developing a nuclear capability we don't really know but,
perhaps so.
Well, the Iranian threat as described in the documents
and the reports goes beyond deterrents.
Iran is also seeking to expand its influence
in neighbouring countries and thus
to destabilise the region, as it's called.
Notice that when the US invade and
occupies Iran's neighbours, that's stabilisation.
When Iran tries to expand its influence,
say commercial relations, with its neighbours,
that's destabilisation.
That is actually routine usage in foreign policy commentary
so for-- sometimes it becomes almost comical.
Here's prominent foreign policy analyst, James Chase,
former Editor of Foreign Affairs,
rather on the liberal side incidentally.
He was properly using the term stability in its technical sense
when he explained that in order to achieve stability in Chile,
it was necessary to destabilise the country [Laughter] namely
by overthrowing the elected
government installing a vicious dictatorship.
Sounds contradictory, but it isn't
if you understand the technical meaning of the terms.
Well, other concerns about Iran I have no time to go into.
They're interesting to explore but,
I think they simply show,
underscore what the guiding doctrines are and 
their continuing status in imperial culture.
That's very much in accord with the doctrines that were laid
down by FDR's planners during the Second World War.
The United States cannot tolerate any exercise
of sovereignty that interferes with its global designs.
And the United States and Europe are of course engaged
in punishing Iran for its threat to stability and trying
to get it to become a more civilised country, but
it's useful to recall how isolated the US
and Europe are.
The non-aligned countries, which is most of the world, they have
for years been vigorously supporting Iran's right
to enrich uranium.
Within the region, as I mentioned,
the irrelevant public even strongly favours Iranian
nuclear weapons.
The major regional power, Turkey,
voted against the latest US sanctions motion
in the Security Council, along with Brazil,
which is the most admired country
of the South, as polls show.
Turkey's disobedience led to sharp censure at that point, but
not for the first time.
Turkey was bitterly condemned in 2003
when the government committed a major crime:
it followed the will of 95%
of the population and refused to take part
in the US-British invasion of Iraq
and that demonstrated its very weak grasp of democracy,
which [Laughter] led to its sanctions and sharp censure.
It's the same today; after the 2010 Security Council misdeed,
Turkey was warned by Obama's top diplomat on European affairs,
Philip Gordon, that it must demonstrate its
commitment to partnership with the West:
follow orders in other words.
A scholar with the Council on Foreign Relations asked,
"How do we keep the Turks in their lane?"
They're departing; something wrong;
'in their lane' means following orders
like good democrats, our style democrats.
Brazil's Lula was admonished in a New York Times headline.
He was warned that his effort with Turkey
to provide a solution
to the uranium enrichment issue outside the framework
of US power is a spot on the Brazilian leader's legacy.
In brief, do what we say, that's your function.
There's kind of an interesting side light to all of this,
which has been effectively suppressed.
The Iran-Turkey-Brazil deal had been approved in advance
by President Obama, presumably on the assumption
that it would fail and that would provide an ideological
weapon against Iran.
That was revealed by the British Foreign Office,
which released the letter of support for it
after Brazil was censured.
When the effort succeeded, approval quickly turned
to censure and Washington ran
through a Security Council resolution, which was so weak
that China readily signed and is now chastised for living
up to the letter of the resolution,
but not following Washington's unilateral directives,
which go far beyond it.
