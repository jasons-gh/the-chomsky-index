you made an observation that surrounding
the campus of MIT which I think you've
been there since around 55 I didn't get
there till around 89 but you said you
noticed how the companies around there
changed over time they went from kind of
electronics companies in the 50s and 60s
and then moved on into biotech and and
what that said about how our kind of
society was being co-opted can you
explain that point you made because
again I think it's about observing
something that most people wouldn't look
at but it shows you what's happening
with the government and industrial
complex there's that we're taught in
econ 101 that we live in a free Morgan
Society entrepreneurial capitalism and
so on if you look around you it's right
in front very partial truth so take this
example in the 1950s when I got to MIT
fifties and sixties the surrounding
industries were mainly electronic firms
she walk around the MIT campus today but
what you see is Pfizer you know
Genentech Novartis and so on but why the
change well the reason is that in the
50s and 60s the cutting edge of the
economy was electronics based the
government was pouring huge amounts of
money and to develop into doing the
basic research and development that
private corporations were learning from
so they could adapt it to working for
the market and profit so IBM could learn
from the electronics lab when I was
working how to move from punch card
computers to electronic computers but
then they were able to develop after
many years of marketable computers now
the cutting edge of the economy is often
biology based
the big pharmaceutical companies can
learn from the research being done under
government subsidy of course at the main
research universities so they can learn
something that they can turn into drugs
that they can market and so on no of
course they get plenty of straight
subsidies from the government itself so
right now there's a lot of interest of
course in vaccines and drugs that might
alleviate the effects of covin 19 great
deal of that research is done the basic
core research the hard creative part
it's done within fundamentally the
public sector even if it's in a private
lab it's often with government funding
and there's good reasons for that the
private enterprise doesn't want to take
risk some things that may not pay off
it's not their business their business
is to make profit but the the creative
part risky work is very often done in
the public sector I mean it's not too
much of an exaggeration to say we have a
system of public subsidy private profit
and that goes way back as you can trace
it back to hell
England robbed technology from India so
you want to go back to the 18th century
I mean this goes way back so yes there's
a story about free markets and the
wonderful they are and so on so you
start looking at what's in front of you
like your computer the screen that we're
both looking about you see quite a
different story these are again things
that people don't think about it's in
front of your eyes but you don't think
of it just where if we're well trained
it's not the kind of thing you think of
