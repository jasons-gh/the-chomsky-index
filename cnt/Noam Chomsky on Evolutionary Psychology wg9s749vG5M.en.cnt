One of the trends I think people should be skeptical of 
It is when you read this, it is a common topic these days to discuss what evolutionary psychology is now called social biology. 
As we knew it, it is a science that studies human nature, but the problem is that it teaches us nothing 
It is a very difficult scientific problem to understand the nature of any living being 
To transmit insects, we can make any experiments with them 
But when we go into something as complex as humans 
You will find almost everything you are looking for 
If you want to find aggression, violence, and cruelty, you will find it 
We do not need evolutionary psychology to tell us about it. We find it in the world 
And if you want to find altruism, courage and honesty 
And the desire to sacrifice yourself to some totally outlying college 
Like wading in the winter waters of Cape Kad Island (in Massachusetts) and saving dolphins 
You can find this, you can find what you are looking for, and humans have all these capabilities 
Different people display themselves, different circumstances, different backgrounds, etc. 
But science has not gone far enough to answer questions like this 
Low merit to deserve to be seen 
I mean there is an interesting work like Robert Treivers' work on mutual altruism 
Which is interesting 
How do! The desire for an altruistic relationship with another person can be divided as an optional stay 
Yes it is. 
And that probably tells you something very important about the origins of this idea. It is not a new idea by chance 
The first book on this topic is called "Mutual Cooperation: A Factor in Evolution." 
Written a century ago, written by "Kropotkin". 
He is a thoughtful anarchist leader, who is also a natural historian 
And try to show, I think this is in 1902 or something 
But he found a lot of evidence, and he tried to prove that in the natural world and to humans that mutual cooperation is an obligation and a requirement for helping others and helping society 
There will likely be value to stay and choose 
So, Rima thinks this is kind of what we are as a living being 
On one side, yes, that's who we are 
We are also, unfortunately, any kind of creature that you would like to be
