okay with rebel conflicts and separatist
complex being waged in various parts of
the globe do you believe what role can
federalism play in destabilizing these
conflicts yep takes a Europe again one
of the great achievements of post-war
Europe now under threat incidentally is
a slow move towards a kind of federalism
so the Schengen Agreement which permits
free passage among the countries of
Europe is a step towards more tolerant
civiles it's a kind of federalism it has
positive and negative aspect because of
the ways of to implement because of the
way it was integrated into the euro zone
which is something separate from the EU
it has led to a situation where
sovereignty has passed from populations
to the bureaucracy in Brussels with the
German banks and over their shoulders
that's where the basic decisions are
made
doesn't matter who people elect for
for the wrong governments the major
decisions are made out of their hands
that's led to extreme resent not
justified resent it's taking
self-destructive heads but then resent
that's understandable that's part of the
background for the right for the rise of
his ultra-right parties which appealed
to the population on the grounds that
they no longer control their own destiny
if flip n wins and Frances she might she
might very well implement
Bredesen referendum this bull threat
seven European Union which would destroy
it now we're back to Europe of competing
nationalities very lovely cast how
