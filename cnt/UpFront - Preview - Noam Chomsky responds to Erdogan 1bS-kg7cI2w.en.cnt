the Turkish president mr. Erdogan
recently attacked you by name saying
it's time for so-called intellectuals
like you to quote pick aside you are
either on the side of the Turkish
government he said or you're on the side
of the terrorists you responded by
saying Iran and Turkey had been aiding
ISIL in the past you've accused turkey
of carry out a terrorist war against the
Kurds he's undoubtedly carrying out
vicious repressive actions attacking the
Kurdish population you can call it what
you like
what would you call it I'd call it a
murderer he's a murderer of course
deeply authoritarian regime continued
reconstituting policies which in the 90s
were totally horrendous you'd accept
that he would say the people he's
fighting and carrying out massive acts
of terrorism and murder
I don't you wouldn't deny that I don't
and Assad says the same thing about the
people he's talking about
