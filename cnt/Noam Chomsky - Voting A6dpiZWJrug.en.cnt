the Western democracies have been
evacuated a very meaning and the
plutocracy is what we have I just wonder
do you vote in general elections in in
America or would you advise somebody in
UK to go and vote next year in general
elections it's a decision but it's the
kind of decision that's kind of 10th
order I think it should be made in five
minutes sometimes there's a point in
voting like listen you know it could be
work there's worse and less worse okay
it might make a difference and iocation
times but sometimes I voted for
Republicans because they were better you
know not in presidential elections but
most of the time you know it's a very
small decision maybe if you can you just
have to compare the alternatives and see
if there's unbalance any difference but
it doesn't seem to me a fundamental
question the real problem is what to do
about the fact that we don't live in
political democracies that's the real
problem
so take the United States which I know
better and has been studied more
intensively in the United States it is
literal you can read an academic
political science not on the left that
about 70% of the population lowest 70%
on the income scale is entirely
disenfranchised meaning their opinions
have a zero impact on policy even their
own representatives they're simply
ignored one of the reasons why they
don't vote they may not read the
scientific journals but they know it in
their lives as you move up the income
scale you can start getting a little
more influenced as measured by the
relation between attitudes and policy
okay when you get to the very top which
is a fraction of 1% policy is made okay
what kind of a system is that I mean
does it matter if you pick one or
another
presentative sometimes it does that kind
of way out at the margin but the real
problem is the nature of the system I
don't think it eclipses that much
