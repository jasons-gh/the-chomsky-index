should be the goal but we do go there we
talked to others who go there we talked
to those who are there we talked to to
all factions we we travel around we try
to get the best sense we can of what's
taking place and then we report it and
we act on it and some training since the
invasion of team war the US has trained
more than 2,600 indonesian officers
through i met one of the more notable
examples of us training is general Benny
more Donnie now the Indonesian defense
minister long very close to the US a
fluent English speaker and the man who
personally planned the invasion of East
Timor who personally sought to the
removal of the previous Tim Ariz
archbishop and who came in to team or
two years ago gathered the local to
marie's elite and gave a speech in which
he told them don't even think about
independence if you even try to think
about it we will crush you it's this is
the this is general Moore Donnie and
again i think it's i think it's truly
insulting to the Indonesians for the
u.s. to be suggesting after all these
years after all those millions and
millions of dollars worth of weapons and
helicopters and planes after all those
years of constant political ratification
and re ratification that in these
training sessions the u.s. is somehow
saying to the Indonesians no no don't do
what you what you've done up to this
moment do something else and the
Indonesians go out and disobey that us
training and then the u.s. responds to
that by rewarding them with still more i
mean it's it's insulting both to the
Indonesians into the to the intelligence
of the listener clearly the US and the
Indonesian military are pursuing the
same policy in each team yes this
channel thank you um first I'd like to
thank mr. dinger for us so eloquently
reading the Assistant Secretary of State
Kenneth Quinn's testimony before
Congress lost februari and I think that
that report there does a very dutiful
job of echoing the Indonesians national
investigation commission's report issued
last December
and I think it has a number of very
serious holes practically on every point
and i think i would ask somebody else to
address those just one point on that
before i asked my question oh do ask
your question we're really pressing like
thank you he's going to do it okay else
I'll skip the obvious factual error I
was just the quote the question I would
like to ask is a question about
witnesses about testimony about
credibility of testimony the all
indications including the two to
tourists Australian also Australian
journalist who were deported just last
week Dennis Schultz last week and Peter
Goodman for example this is all well
after the massacre have testified saying
things like dilly is now a city under
siege there are 10,000 troops stationed
there probably 40 in every village this
is now professor Anderson has has has
alluded to Theo show face very obvious
statements that that the that the
oppression and repression in East Timor
have gotten quite obviously worse and
Indonesia is making no secret about that
whatsoever there there are there
statement is a clear reversal and
there's no denying that is a clear
reversal of their previous attempt at
opening up the territory they've now
gone back to a policy of divide and
conquer they've forced people to go into
the hills sorry you must ask your
question I'm sorry the question is how
do you hug how does this US State
Department verify in the face of all of
this testimony what school that's coming
out of East Timor what is actually
happening there Amos Wako the UN Special
Rapporteur on torture for example but
one example was was preceded by troops
Theo shafi went two miles ahead of him
as he was walking a lot to make sure
that there was no sign of the sense he
even interrupted a football match for
example I thinking that it was a
political presentation so how does it
with within this kind in this kind of
conditions how does how does the State
Department in 10 and how can it possibly
verify that there are not continuing
human rights abuses even now in east
timor and that's my question the State
Department does not deny that there have
been human rights abuses Andy's team
continuing even now and they're there
may be there probably are human rights
abuses that have continued since they
have not been on the scale anything like
the scale of what happened in November
twelfth nor had there been in recent
years prior to November twelfth that was
that was an aberration from the trend
that had been taking place for the past
two years how do we go about trying to
figure out what's happening in East
Timor first we visit there we've had
five visits there since November twelfth
if our budget were larger we'd visit
there more often but we visit there as
often as we can we've had I think it's
ten visits in the last two years that's
not full time but that's something there
are other embassies in Jakarta that
visit there too we talked with them we
compare notes there are Westerners there
are Indonesian 'he's in dili in in other
parts of East Timor with whom we
communicate and we talked to them about
what's happening there re steamer ease a
number of them who with whom we
communicate when we visit we wander the
streets and talk to people do you feel
that you're free to wander the streets
wherever you'd like to go American State
Department they can wander into they
like what is the motif p murray
memories with one gray cell would ever
talk to anyone from the State Department
because the next thing will happen is
they'll end up in the torture chamber
and let me come in and the idea that's
that's not accurate personal experience
about that affair well it just a comment
to comment on that governor caress kalau
and Bishop Bello both told us that that
is precisely the case and we interviewed
great numbers of people who had exactly
the experience who because they spoke to
foreigners or tried to pass out
information about the killings and the
tortures they were arrested in fact
right now one of the people who was just
put on trial in dili was charged with
the crime of trying to send out to the
outside world a transcript of a public
interview that was given by the governor
this was considered to be subversion
leaking of classified information and
they were arrested and put on trial by
the Indonesian authorities the idea this
is very important point the idea that
the massacre was an aberration from a
positive trend is pure fantasy we spoke
to Bishop bello before the massacre well
before the massacre he compared the
situation at that time to 1983 which if
you know that the history of Timor was a
particularly grim period with several
major massacres this was when the army
was convening people throughout the
countryside telling them if you if you
speak to the Portuguese UN delegation
you will be killed and your families
will be killed to the seventh generation
and these threats were being backed up
with increased assassinations and
disappearances and tortures and so on it
should also be pointed out that the
military people who are now facing
internal military trials although
details of what they're being charged
with has not been released amnesty
testified to the Senate that the report
from the military honor commission
indicates that it seems that the thing
these soldiers are being charged with
four November twelfth is for being too
lenient for being too lenient for
allowing the demonstration to take place
in the first place and the sackings of
the intelligence people that have
happened since the massacre have been
publicly announced as being in
punishment for them allowing the
demonstration to take place and let me
just quote briefly from an interview
from the current commander
safi given to compass the indonesian
publication on march 17 the interviewer
asks so what attitude will the armed
forces take and the general says I'll
say to my troops win over the people the
people are obliged to follow if not and
this is what the soldiers are to say to
the people please flee to the bush if
they go to the bush they then become gpk
the security disrupter gangs and the
policy on GP k is that you can shoot
them on sight he said I'm only restoring
Aubrey Armed Forces I'm only restoring
Aubrey standards demonstrations don't
exist according to Indonesian law and
neither i might add to those people who
engage in them mr. Naren is my ass there
sorry on time do you want to say
something mr. doing I had one short
question for mr. Naren I wondering if
that's the same article in comp us in
which general chef a gave his plans for
the Indonesian military's role in East
Timor in the future in which he he
stated that it says every intention to
one reduce the number of troops there
and to speed up the transformation of
them from combat troops to civic action
troops at the same article it let's look
at you idle to read that i don't i don't
know if that is the same article it is
the article in which he says the crux of
the matter is that in many cases we have
not been decisive enough and he has said
that they want to reduce the number of
troops that's quite true and as as
general Sutrisno has explained they hope
to reduce the number of troops after
they have in his word annihilated all
those who oppose the rule of indonesia
sathi also said that it was his policy
to hunt down all those who oppose
Indonesia clearly they would like to
reduce the number of troops but they
feel they can't because the opposition
among the to marie's is so persistent
final comment comment um I'm oscillating
between wondering if the if your
comments mr. dinger are absolute
ignorance or outright lies and I think I
won't insult you by saying their
ignorance I wanna
I just want to make two quick points you
said that the reason one of the reasons
you found the preliminary study of the
Indonesians credible was that they
increase the number of people they found
that more people had died in the
massacre going from 19 to 50 I will
point out then when Jelani came back the
head of the investigation to Indonesia
he said he agreed with the army estimate
of 19 at that point there was
international outcry sat whom this is
going to be a whitewash a week later not
having learned anything new already
having come back from his team or the
week before when he said 19 he upped it
to 50 at which point the State
Department said it's a credible report
now I want to make two quick points and
that is we have gone around speaking
around the country and at every place we
speak the Indonesian ambassador or
representative is invited I'll use the
example of brown where we spoke recently
in every case the Indonesian embassy
refers us either to you mr. dinger to
speak or gives us the testimony of the
State Department they feel that you
represent them accurately enough that
they don't have to speak and I want to
finally ask what would it take to cut
off aid we all agree a third of the
population has been killed about 200,000
people we all agree that more than a
hundred people with us weapons were
killed on November twelfth what would it
take for the State Department to say we
should cut off aid you wish to have a
final comment mr. doing is it up
first of all I I'll try to remain civil
I don't represent the Indonesian
government I represent the United States
government I represent the United States
government and I'm proud to do that I
think we have a very recent policy on
this issue and I'm happy to discuss it
with you but I would like it to remain a
civil discussion what does it take to
cut off aid as I understand that
American law says that the information
is classified as a gross violator of
human rights then age should be
restricted to basic human needs
deliverance the State Department
including the Human Rights Bureau of the
State Department which looks at the the
broad range of human rights around the
world does not consider than Indonesia
class qualifies for that classification
it has never considered that and it
doesn't today there are serious human
rights problems in Indonesia there's no
doubt about that but there are also some
positive signs in Indonesia and the
response the November twelfth tragedy is
one of them the Indonesian government
accepted that it was a tragedy it
accepted responsibility for it it's
going about punishing the people who
took part in that tragedy the punishment
will not be because they were too
lenient it will be because they
participated in a massacre thank you I
am instructed by Authority much too high
to question that there is at least one
occupation which was immediately end and
that is our occupation of the arco forum
we've apparently exceeded the time
available to us and I'm afraid I have to
first thank very much our panelists I
knew something about East Timor not
negligible but I have learned a lot from
this evenings discussion I think in an
extremely good one I thank the students
who put this together for performing a
really very useful and important service
of ventilating a fighting issue I thank
you for coming and I should remind
anyone who wishes to continue to discuss
this issue that informal discussion will
continue in room 152 the rear
good night
