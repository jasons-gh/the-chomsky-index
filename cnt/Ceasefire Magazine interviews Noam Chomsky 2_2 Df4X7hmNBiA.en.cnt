almost every major significant movement
for democratic expansion of democracy
for civil rights human rights in general
and I think health reform whatever it
may be and I think that's probably going
to continue if the labor movement is a
disoriented the suppressed marginalized
atomized as it's been happening since
the Thatcher years I think that does not
bode well for the chances of significant
developments you can see it right now in
the United States in fact it's been a
major attack on on democracy on rights
and so on and on labor and bringing it
down on the other hand right at the
moment that we're getting the first
major popular uprising and a significant
one against the process of moving
towards a kind of corporate tyranny and
it's labor based it's based on it's a
reaction to attacks on unions remaining
ones to try to take away their
collective bargaining rights and that's
led to a significant popular uprising a
surprising effect my next question is
you have mentioned grumpys work before
and the way you describe intellectual
culture in the West is similar to his
own analysis of intellectuals is he
still worth reading today and do you
think his work offers valuable insights
don't think it's worth a really
important thinker like most commentators
I don't exclude myself you can pretty
well figure it out for yourself I mean
he says it's there are things that are
said well they're suggestive provocative
we're thinking through but if there's
anything profound I've missed it since
the 1940s and all the 50s you've had to
take position publicly on hundreds if
not
as of issues are there any of that you
regret or that you feel you took the
wrong decisions on oh yeah usually
because I didn't do enough so for
example and I was very heavily involved
in the Indochina war involved in
resistance facing jail sentence and so
on but it was much too late and I didn't
become seriously involved till the early
60s at that point the United States had
already invaded South Vietnam and was
practically destroying it in the ten
years before 1950s the client government
that the u.s. installed after it
dismantled and the peace agreement
probably killed 60 or 70,000 people and
was so violent it to it instigated
resistance but that during that period
that was unfortunately no protest
including me just some talk about it
nothing more and there are many other
cases like that there's a lot more that
you'd be done um I want to ask you about
the Middle East on the one hand we have
Egypt and Tunisia and on the other we
have what's going on now in Libya what
is your reading of the situation in
Libya well Libya is quite different from
all the other countries in the region
Libya is the one place where there was a
very violent state reaction repressing
the popular uprisings actually Libby is
not the only place the other place which
isn't talked about very much is Western
Sahara the current wave of uprisings and
there have been many in the past but the
current wave actually began in western
sahara in November just write a couple
of weeks before the Tunisia of rising
there was a nonviolent protest of sorrow
ease the digis people against the quite
brutal and illegal Moroccan invasion
Iraq Morocco invaded Western Sahara was
subject to decolonization under the UN
auspices and Morocco in violation of
Security Council other resolutions
invaded and occupied the country
transported a lot of people in which is
illegal and has run out very repressive
and brutal regime and has rejected every
effort at the negotiation and settlement
and in November that happened again and
this time the Moroccan forces came in
crushed the uprising it was harsh enough
so that it did come to the United
Nations which theoretically is
responsible for what happens there it's
au supposedly UN administered territory
for decolonization there were
initiatives to have at least an inquiry
but the France enters the main protector
of Morocco intervened and blocked so
nothing happened and it was barely
reported but Libya was the reaction was
far too extreme to avoid and besides the
West is addie Qaddafi anyway so it was
an easy it was easy to become outraged
at what indeed was out and remains
outrages the violent repression of the
uprising so it's it's different than the
other cases on the other hand if you
know if the uprising spread to Saudi
Arabia I wouldn't be surprised to see
the same thing that's in fact the US and
its allies have already shifted their
rhetorical positions in the case of
Egypt Tunisia then like the popular
uprising of overthrowing dictators that
they had strongly supported but it could
sort of tolerate it as long as there was
no significant regime change and
really hasn't been but if you get to
Saudi Arabia it's quite different and
that's the jewel in the crown that's
where most of the oil is and any Mook
serious move towards democratization
there would be pretty harshly resisted
by the US and its allies I final
question to you professor Chomsky is
about Palestine in particular I wanted
to know what your opinion was on the
Palestine papers recently leaked to the
press and also your broader view of
Palestine and the israeli-palestinian
conflict and what you think will happen
there in the future the Palestinian
papers if they didn't give us a lot of
new information and some but not a lot
but what they revealed is the very weak
position of the Palestinian negotiators
I mean they have I don't blame them for
this they simply are in a weak position
and that showed in the offers that they
were making the same time it showed the
total arrogance and contempt of the
Israeli negotiators who assume and the
basis of distribution of power in the
region it's understandable they assume
they can get what they want and it also
showed the contempt of the United States
on the statements by Condoleezza Rice
and Hillary Clinton were not dismissive
of the Palestinians we pretty ugly so it
showed something about the attitudes of
the participants which is not a great
surprise but unfortunately it's pretty
realistic as for the prospect I think
the the options are not being described
accurately by those who are who have
Palestinian interests at heart either
the Palestinians themselves or the
Solidarity groups the way it's almost
always discussed is that there are two
opt
either there'll be a two-state
settlement along the lines of the
overwhelming international consensus or
else as Palestinian leaders have said
we'll give Israel the keys they can take
over the whole territory and there'll be
an anti-apartheid struggle on the South
African model Israeli leaders have said
the same thing those who were in favor
of some sort of partial settlement that
said go if we don't do it will face this
terrible demographic problem there will
be a huge Arab population and what we
want to be a Jewish state how are those
are not the two options there's a third
option which is much more significant
one the third option is exactly what's
happening the US and Israel working
together are instituting a form of
control and domination which is neither
a two-state settlement nor of taking
over the whole territory which Israel
doesn't want they've they've created a
framework it grows out of old plans
going back to the alone plan took
another form under the Chevron plan and
Olmert had his own version but basically
Israel takes everything to the west of
the annexation wall that's misleadingly
called separation wall includes an
arable land control over a lot of the
water resources the pleasant suburbs of
the major cities in Israel linked to
them by super highways and so on take
over the Jordan Valley from which
Palestinians are put by now pretty much
excluded and drive san it's the country
there several going breaking up the rest
into pretty much unviable Canton's that
way Israel will take over about half the
territory and
integrated into Israel a huge
infrastructure projects for Israelis and
visitors only not for local people so
you can drive quite easily from mala do
me immuno halfway into the West Bank to
kill Aviv lit today they're not even
seeing an hour though there is one maybe
some man up on a hill leading a code or
something like that but and the air the
remaining our population will they they
may have an economically sustainable
existence in fact in Ramallah the elites
may live pretty well you know on foreign
money and so on but you know in theaters
concerts sort of a western-style life
but a neo-colonial arrangement with no
prospects for any form of independent
development and the rest old drift away
and as far as these real concerned
that's fine they don't want them so
there won't be a demographic problem too
many Arabs in a non-jew in a Jewish
state and there won't be two states
that's the ongoing option and there
isn't going to be any handing over the
keys as we're not going to take them
meanwhile Gaza will be kept separate
from the West Bank that's in violation
of international agreements but that
Israel in the US have been dedicated
since 1991 actually two separate Gaza
from the west bank by now it's a very
sharp separation that Gaza will just a
open-air prison as it's often called
professor Noam Chomsky thank you very
much for speaking to cease fire
you
