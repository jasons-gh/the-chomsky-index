this is Pervez Hoodbhoy and today's
discussion will be about America and the
shape of global power
protects to come I'm in the office of a
person who is recognized as America's
leading intellectual he's also America's
leading critic critic of its foreign
policy I am of course with professor
Noam Chomsky he is at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology
he's been here for 55 years the author
of more than a hundred books he is in
fact the person who founded modern
linguistics or rather the mathematical
structure of Newton of linguistics owes
to his work done in the 1950s professor
Chomsky thanks very much for agreeing to
be on this program very with you
professor Chomsky the United States
after the Cold War was the only power in
sight there was enormous hubris in the
United States there was the program for
the new American Century you had people
like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and
Scooter Libby and so forth who said well
now the United States is the only power
around it has no pure no rival it can
shape the world as it likes and yet
today as we see the u.s. is losing
control over its empire had you foreseen
that this would happen in a certain
sense remember that the people you just
mentioned are way out of the fringe
there there is a spectrum of opinion on
foreign policy issues and domestic
issues it's not very broad but it's not
zero and they were so far out on the
fringe that you could barely find them
that's why they came under very
considerable criticism right from the
mainstream so yet George W Bush followed
their policies he did he happened to be
elected but I mean actually wasn't
elected but the Supreme Court put him in
and at the beginning his positions were
sort of mild after the 9/11 attacks
there was a very sharp change then they
thought they had their opportunity and
then they went ahead
invaded Iraq but if you take a look at
the invasion of Iraq there was a very
substantial criticism that they were
regarded as a dangerous group so is this
what one would should call in Peter
overstretch well that became clear very
soon they got themselves into real
trouble with the in Vietnam in first of
all they destroyed Iraq killed hundreds
thousands of people spread sectarian
conflict throughout the whole region and
was a total disaster a couple of million
refugees but from the point of view of
US power it was severe blow back to the
US suffered a defeat in Iraq you know
admit it but that's what happened and
perhaps the penalty is that now much of
the Middle East is is being removed from
American control starting from Tunisia
going on to Egypt then to Bahrain Libya
and so on and so forth so does this
represent something some drastic change
in America and its relationship to the
world well we should it does but I think
it's useful to look back a little bit
starting in the actually in 1990s the US
began to lose control of what has always
been considered the safe backyard namely
at Latin America South America which has
by now drifted pretty far from us
control that's the first time in 500
years that South America has begun to
emancipate it from foreign control but
let's come back to the Middle East
Middle East is much more important if
you go back to the Second World War when
the United States was displacing England
as the primary world power there were
extensive plans as to how to control the
world and they're worth rereading this
is is the Roosevelt administration you
know it's not far right they through the
through the Second World War there were
planning sessions the State Department
the Council on Foreign Relations the
main extra governmental input to the
foreign policy establishment
they had a group called the war Peace
Studies group went on for six years
right through the war and they laid out
plans they assumed that the United
States would emerge from the war in a
position of enormous power the early
years they thought there would that
Germany would survive as a major
European power but after the Russians
started driving back the German armies
after Stalingrad they realized that
wouldn't be true they developed the
concept of what they called a grand area
within this grand area a u.s. domination
would be total and no exercise of
sovereignty would be permitted in the
grand area that conflicts with us design
except of course for Israel now Israel
there was no girl then this is the early
nineteen forties the way would you put
the peak of American power 1945 at that
point the u.s. just reigned supreme
I'm the Soviet it was there but it was
minor engine but then the Soviet unity
eventually goes away but let's let's
come back to the Middle East no us
support for Israel has been unstinting
it has it's worth looking at that
carefully u.s. support for Israel in the
current form was established after 1967
and something happened in 1967 which is
quite crucial remember the situation in
the Middle East then there was a major
conflict going on between radical Islam
based in Saudi Arabia and secular
nationalism based in Egypt acted as a
proxy war going on between them and the
Yemen the US was and Britain strongly
supported radical Islam these
revolutions have consumed so much of the
Middle East and now the u.s. power over
there is on the wane so is this a
consequence of the support that the US
had given to Israel I think it it's a
small element of it but here too we have
to pay careful attention to what the
reasoning has been I mean as far back as
the 19th let's go back to the 1950s
before Israel was a major issue at that
in the 1950s President Eisenhower
was concerned with what he called the
campaign of hatred against us in the
Middle East not among the governments
but among the people and the National
Security Council the major planning
agency came out with memorandum in 1958
which explained it it said there's a
perception in the Middle East in the
Arab world that the United States
supports harsh and brutal dictators and
blocks democracy and development and
that we do that because we want to gain
control over their energy resources and
it said furthermore the perception is
fairly accurate and that's what we
should be doing so what you see as the
future of the Middle East after all
these revolutions settle down what are
the alternative forces that are going to
come in and determine the future of Arab
societies in the let's say the next
decade
well that's very much open this
morning's New York Times there's a
discussion of the position that the
United States government should take and
the discussion and what it is taking
they say the US should pick the winners
as long as the dictators are controlling
the populations it's fine support them
if things get out of control you have to
adjust tactics and how it will turn out
is very unclear but it's important to
recognize that the United States and
Europe cannot support democracy in the
Middle East
and it's enough to see why it's enough
to look at Arabs so in other words you
don't see any difference in essence
between the policies of Richard Nixon
onwards until Obama Nixon was the last
liberal president hasn't been one since
and he whatever you think about him he
was a kind of a statesman
you had a conception of world affairs
but you know the difference is a pretty
slight
but the crucial point I think is but yet
President Obama is coming out strongly
in support for the revolution that's
sweeping across absolutely not
he's been very hesitant said very little
people are very angry about it about Li
ba it said maybe he said almost nothing
partly a part of the reason for that is
that they're still diplomats trapped
there to can't say much Marcus and the
Philippines Davidian Haiti
treinen South Korea it's a heart to an
Indonesia in a long series and there's a
standard reaction support the dictator
as long as possible if it becomes
impossible
maybe the army turns against him
professor Chomsky if I may let's turn to
a different aspect of US policy and what
it is likely to become in the years
ahead it is in strong competition today
with China China is the emerging
superpower at least in economic terms if
not militarily although militarily -
it's now building up quite a bit let's
assume for the moment that Chinese that
that China was to take the place of the
United States as being the most powerful
nation on earth in terms of its
corporations its companies being all
over the world
the yuan being the world currency
instead of the dollar policing be done
by Chinese forces rather than US forces
what would be the shape of that world
would it be a better world do you think
then that dominated by the United States
I don't think it would but the
possibility is so remote it's hardly
worth talking about
let's take the careful and there's a lot
of inflated and talk about this but
let's look a look at the facts take a
look at the Human Development Index UN
Human Development Index China has
approximately 90th India the other great
powers about one hundred and twentieth
these are very poor countries GDP per
capita it
according to the World Bank is maybe 10%
of the u.s. that's probably actually
higher maybe 20% they have enormous
internal problems that China has extreme
inequality there tens of thousands of
labor struggles every year or even
according to official statistics China
is at the moment primarily an assembly
plant you take a look at the trade
deficit of the United States with China
that everyone talks about there's a big
trade ok but if you were to look at
statistics put out by let's say Goldman
Sachs they make predictions of where
China's GDP will be where India's will
be and where the United States will be
and there's going to be a crossover
point I think in 2025 if unless I'm
mistaken so the GDP of the Chinese well
exceed that of the united cerebral event
question is GDP per capita
you know GDP didn't in itself doesn't
mean much furthermore if you take a look
at it right now
it'll change over time but for the
moment the Chinese production is mostly
foreign based agreeing with what you
said nevertheless if you take China and
India together they are definitely
producing they will be producing much
more wealth than the United States they
will because the wealth of your major
players in determining the politics of
the countries around them then there's
Europe which is an altar center of power
all this means is that the US will not
have that preeminent position that it
once had how is this going to reflect
upon the global international order it's
certainly not going to be that of the
post Cold War era but that as I say
again that's been that's a steady
process since 1945 by the early 1970s
the world was already tried polar
economically it was the term that was
used there's a North American area
there's a German based European area
there was at that time a Japan based
Asian area now it's Japan China based
Asian area and it's been expanding and
now the world is even more diverse the
leading problem and what's going to lead
to the decline of the United States in
my opinion it is not so much the rise of
China and India which is it's there but
I don't think it's that significant it's
internal the United States internally is
becoming a kind of a third world power
it was once the source of all technology
our most innovative technology it had
well the population that was very well
educated informed the 1950s in the 1960s
were the biggest growth period in
American history in fact that's where a
lot of the technology comes from that
that comes in right we were sitting ok
so we see the decline of the u.s.
because its internal economy is no
longer able to sustain that kind of
growth which is essential for it to be
the dominant or power today we see the
United States mired down in conflicts
across the globe but particularly in
Afghanistan what is your prescription
for the solution of Afghanistan is it
instant American withdrawal no I think
what has to be done is us planners and
the military understand that they're not
going to win a military victory they
don't want to withdraw with something
that looks like a defeat so they have to
find some palatable way to pull out now
that has to be a regional settlement
first of all has to be a regional
settlement externally but internally
there has to be some kind of
negotiations among Afghans and the
Taliban whether we like it or not are
Afghans professor Chomsky there's been
an enormous deterioration in the
relations between Muslims and the West
we've seen this after 1979 where there
were two events one was the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan and then the US
and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia get
together to launch the great global
jihad
then the consequences that follow from
that and 1979 is also the Iranian
Revolution what do you think is the
direction of relations between Muslims
considered as a whole and the United
States and Europe there certainly have
been changes but there I think the
continuities are more striking I
mentioned it before long before this in
1950s the u.s. British French policy was
that as long as our favored dictators
control the population we don't care
what they think
there can be a campaign of hatred we
don't care we'll rely on the dictators
that is exactly the position held today
and not just by governments but even by
the general intellectual culture
professor Chomsky there is a lot to be
discussed and I'd like to pick your
brains for ours but we have to move
towards again I want to ask you what are
the principles that should govern the
relations between nations is it as
you've been very critical of the United
States and justly so in many cases but
after all it's not just the US which has
been nasty to the world and to people's
around it's also been practically every
other country the countries which have
which have performed genocide upon other
populations is this the Beast within man
is it our inability as human beings to
live together what is it that makes us
so incapable of living together in peace
I don't think we're so incapable of
living together in peace in fact there's
a lot of progress to them takes a Europe
for centuries the Europe was the most
brutal and savage place in the world
French and Germans had no higher goal
than to slaughter one another it was a
violent place Europe for centuries while
state formation was taking place in fact
that's how Europe developed the culture
technology of savagery that enabled it
to conquer the world well that changed
so you have an optimistic view of human
nature that somehow we can transcend the
kind of propaganda that each one of us
is subject we're not different
environments
you've been primarily a critic of the US
and you recognized as such across the
world but what is the message that you
really want to give to peace activists
to those who want to struggle for a
better society in their own respective
environments is it to be against America
or is it to be against what against
power against power and the institutions
in which power is based so I happen to
have been writing for the last 15 16
years when the United States has been
the dominant global power furthermore
I'm in the United States I can to some
extent influence actions taken in the
United States
I can't influence what happens in Iran
or China so just on elementary moral
grounds of course it focused on the
United States Plus on geopolitical
grounds but if you know if I was living
in France right now I'd be focusing on
French crimes if you were living in
Pakistan Pakistan you know I'd be doing
what I'd be trying to do what you're
doing I mean the problems of Pakistan
are very severe I don't have to you can
tell me more than I can tell you
Pakistan is a very dangerous country for
reasons not unrelated to US policies as
you mentioned before the Saudi US
involvement with zeal Huk kind of set
off the global jihadi movement which is
no joke
but in inside Pakistan I might I hate my
feeling at least you know limited
information is that there ought to be
major efforts in Pakistan
to try to implement something like the
1973 Constitution which allowed for a
degree of autonomy among the separate
regions Pakistan's pre artificial and a
shift of a radical shift in the shift
back in the educational system towards
secularism and against religious
fanaticism and also elimination a sharp
reduction finally elimination of the
nuclear system and the crazy strategic
doctrine which says that that Pakistan
has to match India and military force
and some can't do it in any other way
has to exceed indeed a nuclear power
nuclear weapons all of this has to be
radically changed and those are problems
internal to Pakistan I can't do anything
about them you cannot do thank you very
much professor Chomsky it was a pleasure
