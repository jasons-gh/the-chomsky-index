for analysis of the egyptian uprising
and its implications for the Middle East
and beyond we're joined now by the
world-renowned political dissident and
linguist Noam Chomsky professor emeritus
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
author of over a hundred books including
his latest hopes and prospects known
welcome to Democracy Now your analysis
of what's happening now in Egypt and
what it means for the Middle East well
first of all what's what's happening is
absolutely spectacular writes the
courage and determination and commitment
of the demonstrators is remarkable and
whatever happens that these are moments
that won't be forgotten and are sure to
have long-term consequences as the the
the fact they overwhelmed the police
took dr. square are staying there in the
face of organized pro-mubarak mobs
organized by the government's try to
either to drive them out or to set up a
situation in which the army will claim
to have to move in to restore order and
then to maybe install some kind of
military rule whatever it's very hard to
predict what's going to happen but the
events have been a truly spectacular and
of course it's all over the Middle East
the the in Yemen and Jordan just about
everywhere there are the major
consequences the what the United States
so far is essentially following the
usual playbook I mean there have been
many times when some favored dictator
has
lost control hours in danger of losing
control there's a kind of a standard
routine Marcos the VA Ceausescu strongly
supported by the United States and
Britain so hard to keep supporting them
as long as possible then when it becomes
unsustainable typically say if the army
shift sides switch 180 degrees claimed
to have been on the side of the people
all along erase the past and then make
whatever moves are possible to restore
the old system under new names that
succeeds or fails depending on the
circumstances and I presume that's
what's happening now they're waiting to
see whether muguara can hang on as it
appears he's intending to do and as long
as you can say what we have to support
law and order regular constitutional
change and so on if he can't if he
cannot hang on if the army say turns
against him then we'll see the usual
routine played out actually the only
leader who has been really forthright
and is becoming the most maybe already
is the most popular figure in the region
is Turkey's Prime Minister Erdogan who's
been very straight and outspoken no I
wanted to play for you what President
Obama had to say yesterday we have
spoken out on behalf of the need for
change after his speech tonight I spoke
directly to President Mubarak he
recognizes that the status quo is not
sustainable
and that a change must take place indeed
all of us who are privileged to serve in
positions of political power do so at
the will of our people through thousands
of years Egypt has known many moments of
transformation the voices of the
Egyptian people tell us that this is one
of those moments this is one of those
times now it is not the rule of any
other country to determine Egypt's
leaders only the Egyptian people can do
that what is clear and when I indicated
tonight to President Mubarak is my
belief that an orderly transition must
be meaningful it must be peaceful and it
must begin now that was President Obama
speaking yesterday in the White House
Noam Chomsky your response to what
President Obama said the disappointment
of many that he didn't demand that
Mubarak leave immediately more
importantly the role of the United
States why the US would have any say
here when it comes to how much it has
supported the regime well Obama very
carefully it didn't say anything there's
Mubarak would agree that there should be
an orderly transition but to what a new
cabinet some minor the recent
rearrangement of the constitutional
order it's empty so he's doing what the
US leaders regularly do as I said there
is a playbook whenever a favored
dictator is in trouble try to sustain
him hold on if at some point it becomes
impossible switch sides the the US has
an overwhelmingly powerful role there
Egypt is the second largest recipient
over a long period of US military and
economic aid Israel's first its
it's Obama himself has been highly
supportive of Mubarak worth remembering
that on his way to that famous speech in
Cairo which was supposed to be a
conciliatory speech towards the Arab
world he was asked by the press I was
the BBC whether he's going to say
anything about what they called
Mubarak's authoritarian government and
Obama said no he wouldn't he said I
don't like to use labels for folks move
arc is a good man he's done good things
he's maintain stability will continue to
support him he's and he's a friend and
so on this is one of the most brutal
dictators of the region it's and how
anyone could have taken Obama's comments
about human rights seriously after that
is a bit of a mystery but the support
has been very powerful in diplomatic
dimensions military the planes flying
over a tougher square or of course us
planes the u.s. is the has been the
strongest most solid most important
supporter of the regime it's not like
Tunisia where the main supporter was
France there the primary guilty party
there but in Egypt it's clearly the
United States and of course Israel
Israel is there of all the countries in
the region Israel and I suppose Saudi
Arabia have been the most outspoken and
support of the Mubarak regime in fact
Israeli leaders were angry lease
expressed anger that Obama hadn't taken
a stronger stand in support of
the friend Mubarak talk about what this
means for the Middle East Noam Chomsky I
mean we're talking about the massive
protests that have taken place in Jordan
to the point where King Abdullah has now
dismissed his cabinet appointed new
prime minister in Yemen there a major
protest there is a major protest called
for Syria what are the implications of
this the uprising from Tunisia to Egypt
now well this is the most remarkable
regional uprising that I can remember I
mean it's sometimes compared with
Eastern Europe but that's not much of a
comparison for one thing in this case
there's no counterpart to Gorbachev
among the in the United States or other
great power supporting the dictatorships
it's a huge difference another is that
in the case of Eastern Europe the United
States and its allies followed the
time-worn principle that democracy is
fine at least to a point if it accords
with a strategic and economic objectives
so therefore acceptable in enemy domains
but not in our own that's a
well-established principle and of course
that sharply differentiates of these two
cases talk about the only moderately
reasonable reasonable comparison would
be to Romania where which were church
ask you the most vicious of the
dictators of the region was very
strongly supported by the United States
right up till the end and then when he
the last days when he was overthrown and
killed the first Bush administration
that followed the usual rules postured
about being on the side of the people
opposed the dictatorship tried to
arrange for
continuation of the close relations
that's a but this is completely
different where it's not a lead and
nobody knows i mean the the problems of
the the problems of the protesters
trying to address are extremely deep
seated they're not going to be solved
easily there's a tremendous poverty
repression a lack of not just democracy
but serious development Egypt and other
countries of the region have just been
through a neoliberal period which has
led to growth on paper but with the
usual consequences high concentration of
extreme wealth and privilege tremendous
impoverishment and dismay for most of
the population and that's not easily
changed we should also remember that as
far as the United States is concerned
what's happening is a very old story as
far back as the 1950s President
Eisenhower was seconds in this segment
now for 10 seconds left in a statement
make your point on eisenhower yeah just
15 seconds if you could we'll save that
for our web exclusive right afterwards
we've been speaking with noam chomsky
can go to our website at Democracy Now
or RG we'll play more of our interview
with him tomorrow and democracy now I'm
