other big news in the u.s. these days is
what we can glean about something called
the trans-pacific partnership what can
you tell us about this trade deal that's
being described as NAFTA on steroids
well actually you can't tell you very
much because it's being kept secret not
entirely secret major corporations are
part of the process they know what's
going on the public is kept almost
entirely out probably there's some
selected elements of Congress that are
allowed to know a bit but it's
essentially an executive agreement
jointly with multinational corporations
we can imagine what it's like and
there's leaks here and there it appears
to be basically within the kind of
framework of the World Trade
Organization and after rules these
things are called free trade agreements
they're not there for one thing a lot of
what they're involved with doesn't even
isn't even trade it's just called trade
to sneak it into the these agreements so
a good deal of NAFTA and the World Trade
Organization rules are investor rights
provisions that has nothing to do with
trade it's called you know trade related
investment mechanisms or something a lot
of it is pure protectionism
very high protectionist elements
obviously undermines free trade for the
benefit of pharmaceutical corporations
Disney
it's not just to try to protect their
exorbitant profits and harm the
population these are patent rules so
high that if they had existed in the
19th century had been enforced the US
would be an agricultural producer today
could never have developed nor could any
other country in fact England couldn't
have developed because it was violating
what we now call piracy is the way the
rich countries developed now they is a
phrase for it and trade theories go up
kicking away the ladder first you
violate all the rules market rules and
then by the time you've succeeded in
developing you kick away the ladders of
others can't do it - and you prayed
about free trade the pharmaceutical
corporations for example claimed that
they need these exorbitant profits for
research and development but it's been
shown free well particularly by
economist Dean Baker and couple of
others that most of their serious
research the hard research is done in
the public sector anyway and if it was
all done in the public sector and they
were forced onto the market
there'd be a huge saving to consumers
but of course reduction in profit and
that's the kind of thing that's going on
and what happens to all worker rights
and well labor rights and environmental
protections such as they are in deals
like this what do we know from NAFTA
about whether the standards of all the
countries involved in which took about
17 countries in the Pacific Rim
including Vietnam whether they rise up
or or trickle down
labor rights don't exist in fact the
NAFTA is a good case it's been studied
quite well it's one of those rare trade
agreements where the working class and
the peasants and farmers and all three
countries suffered a lot of profits but
one of the reasons for exact for example
is take the Mexican that is Elizabeth
supposedly an immigration crisis in the
United States why why are people fleeing
to the United States well some are
actually still fleeing from the ravages
of reagan's wars in the 1980s and walla
islands and so on
plenty are coming from mexico the
mexican US border used to be an open
border pretty open border and pretty
much same people live on both sides like
most borders it was established by
conquest in fact a very aggressive war
us conquer half of Mexico in nineteen
ninety-four Clinton started militarizing
the border 1994 is the year when NAFTA
was pushed through
we don't have internal documents so you
have to speculate but I think it's
likely that the Clinton administration
understood that NAFTA was going to
undermine Mexican farming Mexican
campesinos are quite efficient but they
can't compete with highly subsidized the
US agribusiness the US doesn't observe
the free-trade principles those are for
the weak
so the agribusiness is highly subsidized
and pours products into Mexico drives
out Mexican farmers maybe they try to go
into the cities now if jobs support them
so they flee across the border if that's
what happened under NAFTA what can we
expect if the trans-pacific partnership
goes forward well probably on steroids
like the critics are saying but we
really can't be sure because it is kept
secret from the population though not
from the corporate sector from which we
can draw
some plausible conclusions and anything
this is being rammed down the throats of
the populations of the world by state
corporate pet arm acting in tandem so we
can make guesses as to what it's likely
to be now quite apart from the record
we've seen what the others got another
topic security we meet as the Obama
administration is defending having
secured FISA Court requests from
internet corporations to essentially
sees not only telephone records but
email records we don't even know what
they seized they say it was important
for fighting terrorism well and if we
had anything like a free press there
would be headlines saying this is a bad
joke the Obama administration is
dedicated to increasing terrorism in
fact it's doing it all over the world
Obama's running the big first ways
running the biggest terrorist operation
and that exists maybe in history that
drone assassination campaigns which are
just part of it there's Special Forces
operations and so on all of these
operations are they are terror
operations why well suppose that you're
walking down the street and you don't
know whether two minutes from now the
guy across the street and everything
around him is going to be blown away by
a sudden explosion run by somebody a
couple of thousand miles away you're
terrorized and in fact villages regions
countries are terrorized by these
operations and that has a reaction
people just don't say final I don't mind
if my cousin was murdered they do my and
they become what we call terrorists
the this is uncomplete li understood
from the highest level that as you carry
out these operations you're generating
terrorism they're a terrorist first of
all they are terrorist operations and
they're generating more terrorist
operations sometimes it's almost surreal
like take the Marathon bombing that's
supposed to be the excuse for a lot of
it's a couple of days after the Marathon
bombings in Boston there was a drone
strike and Yemen
usually we don't know anything about
these things but this one happens to be
known because there was a young man from
the village that was attacked who was in
the United States and by fortunate
accident he was testifying before a
Senate committee he described what
happened in his village he said for
years the jihadi groups in Yemen had
been trying to get the villagers to be
anti-american and they'd failed because
the only thing they knew about America
was what he was telling them and he kind
of like liked adhering to the tongue so
they're very pro-american he said one
drone attack turned them all into a
fanatic anti-american what we call any
Americans people who hate the country
that's just de terrorizing them not
surprised that's just considered the way
we react to acts of terror yeah that's
the other people react to acts of terror
and
they Osama bin Laden cases quite
dramatic and for one thing is talking
about it it almost led to a nuclear war
the way they tracked bin Laden was by a
fake vaccination campaign they the US
CIA was carrying out a pretend pretended
vaccination campaign in a town about
about where they thought he was in poor
area that's a violation of principles go
back to the Hippocratic oath in the
middle they stopped it
which is another grotesque violation
because they thought they'd found him
somewhere else well the there's a lot of
throughout much of the third world
there's a lot of fear and concern when
rich white people come around and start
sticking things into your arm and what
are they up to
you know sensible fear actually have a
history after all okay this showed that
the Fuhrer was correct one of the
consequences right away was that attack
son there is a polio vaccination
campaign underway in Pakistan by the
last places in the world that has polio
it could be eradicated if it weren't for
this kind of thing there were attacks on
polio worker to polio vaccination
workers by now the charges are credible
that these rich white guys are just
trying to gather intelligence and
undermine you and maybe send more drones
to attack you it was so severe that the
UN had to pull out their vaccination
teams there are some estimates one
epidemiologist at Columbia les Roberts
has worked on these things estimated
that it may lead to maybe a hundred
thousand polio cases in Pakistan and he
made an interesting comment he said one
of these days somebody in Pakistan is
gonna point to this child sitting in a
wheelchair and say you did it to him and
they'll react so we're generating more
of what we call terrorists meanwhile in
the course of this terrorists generation
campaign
for Obama to claim you know I'm really
worried about terrorists so I have to
read your ain't you know I claim they
don't read it have to get information
about your email where you are who
you're talking to you know what you have
on Facebook I've got to put that on my
big database I should we're moving into
a world which was described pretty
accurately I think by one of the
founders of Google I don't know if you
followed the stories about Google glass
well Google has some new ridiculous
thing that they make marketing glasses
which have a small computer on them so
you can be on the Internet
24 hours a day just just what you want
that's a totally district it's a way of
destroying people but quite apart from
that this little device has a camera and
presumably if it doesn't already a
little soon have a recorder which means
that everything that's going on around
you goes up in the Internet and some
reporter asked Eric Schmidt didn't he
think this was an invasion of privacy
and his answer was exactly right comes
right out of the Obama administration he
said if you're doing anything that you
don't want be on the internet you
shouldn't be doing it
this is a dream that or will couldn't
have fun cocked we're moving into it and
it's not the only case if you read the
technical journals there's more stuff
coming along so for example the right
now are corporations that are concerned
about using computers with components
made in China because it's technically
possible to build into the hardware
devices which will record what the
computer is doing and send it to those
bad guys well the articles don't point
out that if the Chinese can do it we can
do it better and probably are so it may
end up in Obama's database the next time
you hit the computer so what do we do I
mean there's right now
rebellion happening in
I'd love you thoughts on that and the
gays e-square is extremely important
what's happening in Turkey the from the
very brave people in Taksim Square
they're trying to protect the last
remnant of the Commons
you know what's held in common public
spaces protected from the attacks of the
wrecking block gentrification and
commercialization autocracy it's
destroyed Turkey's a real treasure
Istanbul you know ancient treasure it's
being destroyed and they're trying to
protect the last piece of the last piece
of the Commons now that's very important
for Turkey images accurate article this
morning in The New York Times I should
say which said that they're fighting for
the soul of Turkey will it be controlled
or will it be freedom but it's more than
that this is the Commons which is held
together globally we're destroying the
comment the that the the environment the
atmosphere what's held in common it's
being destroyed by the same wrecking
bull magnified and here we're back to
Bolivia there are various reactions the
rich and powerful countries are trying
to wreck as much as possible you know go
off the cliff as soon as you can extract
every drop the hydrocarbons out of the
ground and destroy the environment the
the opposite extreme at countries like
Bolivia and Ecuador indigenous people
around the world and First Nations and
kind of so-called Adivasi tribal people
in India compasses in Colombia they're
trying to retard it to try to save the
Commons and I think you can look at tuck
same squares kind of a microcosm of
development of the much broader issue so
what the it's an extremely important
event it's broader meaning as well I
went from you that the Commons are
enshrined in an 800 law 800 year old
piece of law the Magna Carta that's half
of the Magna Carta was protecting the
Commons from the king the Robin Hood
myths kind of reflect that you know
Robin Hood was protecting the forest
from the predator the Commons were the
source of food of wood of sustenance of
welfare I mean you know the image of a
widow gleaning from the forest is
traditional image that's the welfare
system
it was nurtured it was a common
possession so if we look at out of it
and the half of Magna Carta is effort to
protect it from predatory state power
well over the next couple of centuries
that Britain began to move towards
capitalism capitalism is based on the
principle that everything has to be
privately owned can't be held in common
there's even a Dogma which is today
called tragedy of the Commons which
holds that if things are held in common
they're going to be destroyed felt if
they're privatized like you give them
the you know Vic doll or that's not the
Exxon Mobil then they'll be preserved
because that's the capitalist religion
it's exactly the opposite the Commons
are being and what's happening in
England the enclosure proceed programs
and others kind of destroyed the
comments United States that happen later
but
and now it's happening in the world the
last remnant of the Commons is the
environment which indigenous people who
are still back eighty eight hundred
years ago we're trying to preserve and
we sophisticated rich people are trying
to destroy it so what can we do to
celebrate the eight hundred years we can
try to gain some of the sensibility of
the indigenous populations of the world
or our predecessors 800 years ago we can
laugh at them as being naive and
unsophisticated but unless we can gain
that sensibility that there have to be
rights of nature as Bolivians and others
put it then we're just we're gonna be
destroyed you have a message for Bradley
Manning Bradley Manning is should be
regarded as a hero he's doing what an
honest decent citizen ought to be doing
letting the population know what your go
put the people who rule you are doing
they want to keep it secret of course
that's just like the trans-pacific trade
agreement they don't want that are like
Obama's programs they don't want it what
they're doing known for good reasons the
public has a right to know what's being
done to them by their so-called elected
representatives not really for all kind
of reasons but and Bradley Manning's
hoping and do it there's a principle
that he's violating namely that power
has to be protected from scrutiny it's
the principle of every dictatorship of
every autocracy I can hear it from the
high priests at Harvard and the
government department the power has to
be kept secret otherwise it will fade
and won't work but Bradley Manning's
violating that printer Bob Thompson
thanks so much for sitting in with us
for just a little bit receiving
you
