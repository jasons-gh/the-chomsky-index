could you please tell us what you see is
the alternative and if there are any
examples of a well-functioning
alternative and how we would transition
from our current system to that
alternative no there's alternatives just
as there were alternatives to feudalism
and slavery and Bolshevism and fascism
namely dismantle the repressive
institutions and place power in popular
hands it's always it's never an
all-or-none business you know so there's
elements of it all over the place for
example unions let's say were a big
attack on the privileged character of
the private power of the opulent
minority these the sort of social
contract that developed from around the
mid 19th century was the result of a
social reaction to the new science and
its doctrines I mean what basically
happened is the if you look at the
history the vibe around 18 the 1830s it
looked like the masters had won the day
you know end of history
and all that sort of thing the in
England that is they had legislated you
know the rules of the new science people
have no rights you can't live on the
market go somewhere else
etc the only problem was that it turned
out that the British army he was
spending all of its time putting down
riots because people got the weird idea
that if we don't have a right to live
then you don't have a right to rule you
know and then it got worse because they
started labor organizing and the
Chartist movement came along and so on
well you know unfortunately the science
is rather flexible since it largely is
an instrument of ideological warfare and
it just changed so the same people who
were giving the old story like NASA a
senior now said yeah turns out according
to the new science that the people who
have other rights by the time you get to
say John Stuart Mill you have sort of no
kind of a social democratic picture of
political economy and that leads the way
to the social contract and the welfare
state okay
that was an improvement took a long time
to reach the United States the United
States didn't really come until 1930s
and it was always weak at how weak it is
you can see by looking at the newspapers
right now for example in South Korea
workers are struggling rather bitterly
right now to protect themselves from
laws that have always been enforced in
the United States in the United States
the laws have always permitted
corporations to fire workers and replace
them not just with scabs which is bad
enough but with permanent replacement
workers meaning kick em out if they try
to organize I mean that the United
States has been censured for that but
the International Labor Organization
I think it's the only industrial country
to have been censured but here it's kind
of taken for granted in South Korea you
know they don't accept it and that's
what the big struggles are going on with
industries trying to impose it in the
government and the working people are
rejecting so you know we don't the idea
that we have to go teach people how to
be free you know funny idea but all of
these are steps have been steps forward
there are a lot of rights that were not
recognized before voting rights for
example franchise economic right social
rights are always under attack right now
it happened to be under sharp attack and
there have been more serious attacks
against the whole conception of
absolutist rule so they're all over the
place but maybe the biggest one is in
Spain the big Mondragon enterprises
which is one of the most successful
economic enterprises in Spain you know
industry banks communities and so on
it's essentially worker owned this came
out of a kind of a left Catholic
tradition and it's you know it's not
utopia like it has managers and so on
but it's worker owned and been very
successful one of the more successful
parts of the Spanish and European
economy is in fact and there's other
things all over the place that you can
look at but these are just constant
battles
I mean there's a constant effort to
construct you know to intensify the
system of absolutist control and state
power supporting the rich Reagan and
Gingrich for extremes and there's always
a popular struggle against it as to the
asking is there a viable alternative to
absolutist rule that doesn't really mean
much it's like asking in the 18th
century is there a viable alternative to
kings and princes well you couldn't
point the one you can point to a
parliamentary democracy in the 18th
century did that mean you couldn't have
parliamentary democracy no didn't mean
that I mean you could have it but you
have to create it
