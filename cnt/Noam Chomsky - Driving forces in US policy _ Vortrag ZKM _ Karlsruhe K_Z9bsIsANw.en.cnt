thank you the topic that was announced
as a large one
I can't review it in great detail but
I'll try to give some indication of how
I think it can be productively explore
the issues are general but I'll keep to
the United States for several reasons
one reason is that it's obviously the
most important case in the contemporary
world a second reason is that it's an
unusually open society uniquely so I
believe and so we have a great deal of
evidence about the internal forces that
drive planning much more so than
anywhere else that I know of and thirdly
it's simply the most important case for
us for American citizens that's
perfectly obvious but it's plainly true
for Europeans as well more than any
other area of the United States is
influenced that considerably by Europe's
stance and she we saw a graphic
indication of that pretty recently when
Obama backed away from his plan to bomb
Syria on rather questionable assumptions
after the British Parliament withdrew
the usual British support for u.s.
violence so with this in mind let's ask
what are the driving forces of policy in
the United States in fact again in any
global actor but the u.s. is the most
important of these by a large margin
there is a receive version
it's a common to academic academic
scholarship of public discourse
diplomatic usage so I'll just quote a
few leading figures to illustrate but
it's quite general so it takes a George
Kennan one of the people who've shaped
the modern world according to him
government is created to assure order
and justice internally and to provide
for the common defense take a leading
realist scholar John Mearsheimer the
structure of the international system
forces countries concerned about their
security to compete with each other for
power pick a leading scholar of US
Middle East policy William quanto has
long diplomatic experience he writes
that the driving force of US policy is
to ensure security and well-being of the
population and all therefore agree that
the primary concern since 1945 some say
since 1917 has been the Russian threat
there are a number of ways to evaluate
the doctrine let's start with the
Russian threat and return to the search
for security one obvious question to ask
is what happened when the Russian threat
disappeared in 1989 very clear test of
the universal agreement the answer is
everything continued as before
completely inconsistent with the
standard doctrine so a couple of weeks
after the fall of the Berlin Wall the
United States invaded Panama that
bombarded slums killed probably
thousands of people poor people we don't
care count our own crimes so that's an
estimate stole the client regime
completely routine practice in u.s.
though men's but not quite routine there
was one difference for the first time it
was not justified by an alleged Russian
threat rather there was a series of
fraudulent pretexts concocted that
collapse instantly on examination as
usual the media chimed in
enthusiastically lauded the heroic
achievement of defeating Panama totally
unconcerned with the fact that the
pretext were ludicrous was a radical
violation of international law also
overlooking the fact that it was very
harshly condemned elsewhere the most
most dramatically in Latin America also
ignored was the u.s. veto of a unanimous
Security Council resolution condemning
u.s. crimes carried out the troops
carried out by troops during the
invasion of Britain abstained politely
all completely routine all completely
forgotten in the United States and
probably Europe though not in Panama not
surprisingly which is also routine well
with the Russians gone the the
government that was the first Bush
administration quickly issued a new
national security policy and a new
military budget same as before but with
new pretexts so we need a huge military
establishment and not to defend
ourselves against the Russians but
because of the technological
sophistication of third world powers
well-trained intellectuals are not
supposed to laugh when they hear that
and they didn't it's necessary to
maintain what they called the defense
industrial base that's a euphemism for
high-tech industry which is based on
extensive state intervention
in the economy in what's called our free
market economy most interesting was the
Middle East the new strategy said we
have to maintain intervention forces
aimed at the Middle East and then
followed an interesting phrase where the
serious threats to our interests could
not have been laid at the Kremlin's door
so sorry we've been lying to you for 50
years but can't do it anymore so we now
have to concede that the main concern
was always and now explicitly stated and
what's called radical nationalism
meaning independent nationalism all of
this passed without any comment but it
has quite evident bearing on the
standard doctrine now there were other
important events that took place
immediately after the fall of the Berlin
Wall ending the Cold War that one of
them was in El Salvador now that was the
leading recipient of US military aid
it's apart from Israel and Egypt a
separate category also had one of the
worst Human Rights records in the world
that's a familiar correlation
immediately after the Berlin Wall fell
the Salvadoran High Command which is in
close contact to the u.s. embassy
ordered the avocado brigade to invade
the University Jesuit University and to
murder six leading intellectuals six
leading Latin American intellectuals
Jesuit priests also to murder anybody
else who might be around so there
wouldn't be any witnesses so their
housekeeper and her daughter had their
heads blown off to the brigade had just
returned from advanced training at the
John F Kennedy School of Special Warfare
in in the United in North Carolina and
already had left a bloody trail
of thousands of the usual victims in the
course of the us-run the state terror
campaign in El Salvador one of broader
when part of a much broader tortured
terror campaign throughout the region
all completely routine little interest
very little comment all forgotten here
too I presume we can just imagine and
what had happened but would have
happened if anything remotely similar
would have taken place say in
Czechoslovakia under Russian rule that
tells us quite a lot about the factors
that drive policy and if we're honest
tells us a lot about ourselves as well
another illustrative example is Cuba
Cuba gained independence in 1959 and for
40 years this is 1989 the United States
had subjected it to a murderous
terrorist attack that was particularly
extreme during the Kennedy years and of
course a crushing embargo the pretext
was the Russian threat 1989 no more
Russian threat so what happened the
attack on Cuba became harsher it was
spearheaded by Liberal Democrats in the
next election 1992 a Clinton outflanked
Bush from the right on Cuba
that's Cuba actually none of this would
have come as a surprise to people who
paid any attention to the Declassified
record of internal planning documents
from the Kennedy years the early 60s
they made it clear that the threat of
Cuba was what the government called
successful defiance of US policies going
back to the Monroe Doctrine in 1823
the doctrine declared u.s. intention
to dominate the hemisphere and the
Cubans were defying it and worse defying
it successfully so no Russians but the
u.s. intention to dominate the
hemisphere
all of this passed without any impact on
the standard doctrine that another
important event took place right away in
Europe Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev agreed to allow unification of
Germany and its membership in NATO the
hostile military alliance in the light
of the history of the century there was
a pretty astonishing concession don't
have to comment on it but there was a
quid pro quo the pret US President
President Bush a secretary State James
Baker agreed that NATO would not expand
one inch to the east that was the
official phrase that was referring to
East Germany instantly they expanded
NATO the East Germany that Gorbachev was
naturally outraged but when he
complained he was instructed by
Washington that this was only a verbal
promise it was a gentlemen's agreement
and if he's stupid enough to accept a
gentlemen's agreement from the United
States it's his problem
so it's without force all routine as was
the silent acceptance and approval in
the United States and in fact in Europe
Clinton then came into office he
expanded NATO further right along the
Russian border today the world faces
quite a serious crisis that is in no
small measure a result of these policies
all passing without comment well there's
a great deal more that took place after
the Cold War ended I think it's highly
revealing
but instead of proceeding with that
let's turn to a couple of other ways to
evaluate the standard doctrine one
source of information which is
particularly valuable in the United
States because it is such an open
society is secret documents that have
been released made public Declassified
now they give very revealing accounts of
the actual motives of state policy
that's why they're always consistently
ignored now there's no time to review
the matter here but it's worth
mentioning some persistent themes one of
them a major one we find consistently is
that a major force driving policy is
concern about what Henry Kissinger
called viruses that spread contagion
that's dangerous
the Kissinger was referring specifically
to a n days Chile which spread and
threatened to spread the contagion of a
peaceful parliamentary path towards
independent development and social
welfare we know the outcome in that case
and it's it's duplicated in case after
case throughout Latin America Southeast
Asia Africa and the Middle East
always with the same reasoning can't
tolerate viruses if you have a virus
that might spread contagion of the
proper reaction is to kill the virus and
protect those who might be infected from
contagion that means destroy the country
or it's government kills out huge
numbers of people and install harsh
brutal military dictatorships all around
the region that's the main pattern of
the Cold War after 1945 well a lot more
to say about that but I think that the
historical record demonstrates quite
clearly that the standard doctrine has
little mirror and in fact security in
the normal sense is not a prominent
factor in state policy to repeat in the
normal sense but in evaluating the
standard doctrine about security there's
some questions that we have to ask that
are rarely raised the security for whom
and security from what malevolent forces
well one answer is security for state
power
there are many illustrations of that let
me take an interesting current one last
couple of weeks a couple of weeks ago
the United States agreed to support a UN
Security Council resolution which called
on the International Criminal Court to
investigate war crimes in Syria but the
u.s. added a proviso there cannot be any
inquiry into possible war crimes by
Israel or by the United States
that's outlawed as they made clear
actually with regard to the United
States it's redundant the United States
has explicit legislation that granting
the president the right to use force to
rescue is the term that's used any
American who might be brought to the
Hague for trial sometimes called the
Netherlands invasion act now but it's
much more general the United States is
of course uniquely self immunized from
the international legal system that's a
prerogative of the most powerful state
it's quite an interesting topic no time
to pursue but it illustrates the
importance of protecting the security of
state power well who are the dread
enemies from whom the security of state
power must be protected that one
prominent enemy is the domestic
population it's always been understood
to be a threatening enemy the leading
public intellectual of the
twentieth century in the United States
Walter Lippman Wilton Wilson Roseville
liberal political analyst progressive
Democratic theorist and he explained
that policymakers and quoting him and
the responsible intellectuals who
cooperate with them must be protected
from the trampling and the roar of the
bewildered herd that's the public who
are ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders
who have to be put in their place that's
Liberal Democratic theory and liberal
intellectuals quite generally have
agreed in similar terms well to achieve
that end to put the meddlesome Outsiders
in their place
one essential device of course is
secrecy you take a look at government
secrecy run through internal documents
it rarely very rarely has a genuine
security motivation but it definitely
does serve to keep the population in the
dark in sharp contrast to that the
population cannot be secure from state
power there's a obvious striking current
illustration of that the NSA revelations
of Edward Snowden which are a radical
attack on the US Constitution by the
constitutional lawyer in the White House
released as you know by the courageous
fighter for freedom Edward Snowden
expertly summarized analyzed in a recent
book by his collaborator Glenn Greenwald
very much worth reading the document
says you know reveal an assault on basic
rights of quite astonishing scale
they're designed to retrieve every
possible bit of info
but every person who falls within the
grasp of the Colossus and that means in
principle every person linked in any way
to the modern electronic society
computer or phone including phones that
are turned off or in any other way and
nothing anywhere near so ambitious was
ever envisioned by George Orwell or
other dystopian prophets of grim
totalitarian worlds ahead and it says no
slight significance that the project is
being conducted with enthusiasm and
fervor in one of the freest countries in
the world and it is indeed in quite
explicit violation of the US
Constitution the founding document of
American freedom take a look at the Bill
of Rights it protects citizens from
unreasonable search and seizure it
ensures the privacy of their persons
homes papers and effects and much as
government lawyers may try there's no
way to reconcile these principles with
the assault on the population that's
revealed in the Snowden documents it's
also well to remember that defense of
these fundamental rights the rights of
privacy were a major factor in sparking
the American Revolution at that time the
tyrant was the British government which
claimed the right to intrude freely into
personal life now the tyrant is the
American government Britain hasn't
changed it's retained its traditional
tyrannical principles though on a much
more restricted scale given the
relations of power so the British
government approached Washington the
u.s. asking that the US National
Security Agency all quote analyze and
retain any British citizen
mobic mobile phones and fax numbers
emails and IP addresses anything that
swept up in the dragnet which picks up
essentially everything it's also
worthwhile for Europeans and others to
know that the NSA routinely receives or
intercepts the routers servers other
computer network devices that are being
exported from the United States so that
can implant surveillance tools and in
principle every keystroke
that can be sent to President Obama's
huge expanding database in Utah and
presumably China does the same lease
tries to all of this is justified by
security but it's important bear in mind
that when a state pleads security that
should be disregarded it carries no
information literally the plea is
completely predictable whatever the
facts so it's uninformative that's true
of all states when they're caught in
some crime or other malfeasance and
indeed it was true in this case as soon
as the Snowden documents were released
the president and top officials stated
that the NSA dragnet had stopped 54
terrorist acts it's pretty serious
on inquiry it was reduced to a dozen
terrorist acts then a congressional the
congressional legislation set up a
high-level inquiry access to top-level
documents and so on and it found one
case that one person had sent $8,500 to
Somalia that's the total yield of this
massive system system
protecting our security again completely
routine there's another concern the
security from private power for for
private power and this is some
interesting current illustrations of
that which Europe is involved in there
are huge trade agreements being
negotiated a trans-pacific and
transatlantic they're called free-trade
agreements but they've almost nothing to
do with free trade that's obvious when
you look at them and they're of course
being conducted in secret because the
general population is not supposed to
know about such things actually not
completely in secret they're not secret
to the hundreds of corporate lawyers who
are writing the detailed proposals you
can guess what they are now some of them
in fact have been leaked through
WikiLeaks the ones that were leaked were
about what's called intellectual
property rights now that's a euphemism
for state guaranteed monopoly pricing
rights designed to ensure enormous
profits for pharmaceutical corporations
other beneficiaries of taxpayer largesse
and what are laughably called free
enterprise economies well there are
other examples too numerous to mention
and not at all surprising as a recent
study released by Princeton University
by two leading political scientists
Martin gilens Benjamin fit page they
carried out a careful study of a couple
of thousand policy decisions and the
study reveals all quote that economic
elites and organized groups representing
business interests have substantial
independent impacts on US government
policy while average citizens and mass
based interest
groups have little or no independent
influence the results provide
substantial support for theories of
economic elite domination fancy term
meaning the rich run the world and for
theories of what they call biased
pluralism not for theories of majority
or majoritarian electoral democracy or
majoritarian pluralism in other words
the United States and remotely resemble
at democracy it's a plutocracy there's
nothing new about this there's plenty of
evidence about it the same another
political scientists have shown quite
effectively that the lower
three-quarters roughly of the population
lower on the income scale are
essentially disenfranchised the
government pays actually no attention to
their own opinions one of the reasons
they're so little voting it's kind of
sensible it's also been shown mainly by
political economist Thomas Ferguson's
major student of this that a campaign
spending is a very good predictor of
policy take a look at who's funding the
campaigns you can predict the policies
that goes back to the 19th century and
right up to the present and again it's
nothing new about a century ago that was
a great campaign manager Mark Canha the
most famous in American history he was
asked what are the most important things
in a political campaign and he said
there are three the first one is money
the second one is money and I can't
think of the third one that was
over a hundred years ago it's much more
extreme today but it's useful to have a
new one very careful confirmation of
what would be taught in elementary
school in a free society that includes
Europe there's also ample evidence that
security of state power and of
concentrated private power their
security is indeed a driving force in
state policy security from enemies
primary primary among them the domestic
population which is always a potential
dangerous threat to structures of power
and domination and furthermore that's
entirely natural it's to be expected
when we look at how policies formulated
quite that simple there are some
interesting cases where these
commitments conflict but time to talk
about them but this is a very close
approximation to reality and radically
opposed to the standard doctrine let's
turn to another question what about
security of the population it's easy to
demonstrate that that's a very marginal
concern of state policy planners so let
me take two current examples of
overwhelming significance global warming
and nuclear weapons any literate person
is doubtless aware that these are both
or should be that these are dire threats
to the security of the population so
it's therefore interesting to turn to
state policy and we found find that it
is dedicated to accelerating the threats
in both cases in the interests of the
primary concerns enhancement of state
power concentrated private power that
largely determines state policy in the
case of global warming it is so
this that I won't even go on to
illustrate it it should know it without
comment and it does illustrate very
clearly the concern for security is
certainly done for the population it
also illustrates the moral calculus of
contemporary neoliberal state capitalism
the fate of our grandchildren counts as
absolutely nothing in comparison with
the need to make more profit tomorrow
that's the driving principle of what's
called capitalism today
it's it's interesting to look at how the
propaganda system works in the United
States is a huge public relations
campaign it's completely public nothing
secret about it organized by the
business world to try to convince the
public that either global warming isn't
happening at all or if it is it has
nothing to do with human activity and
it's having some impact the United if
you take a look at international polls
the United States ranks somewhat lower
than other countries and public concern
about global warming and indeed the
results are stratified among Republicans
the u.s. ranks far lower practice low is
anywhere in the world the Republicans
are the party that is most totally
dedicated lockstep dedication to private
power and its rights and privileges
there's a the leading there's elite the
leading journal of media criticism in
the United States is the Columbia
Journalism Review Columbia University
it's current issue has very interesting
article on this topic it attributes'
this outcome to the media doctrine of
what they call fair and balanced which
means that if a journal publishes say an
opinion piece reflecting the conclusions
of 97% of scientists it has to run a
counter piece presenting the claims of
the energy corporations actually that is
what happens and it does lead to
confusion on the part of the population
but there certainly is no doctrine of
fair and balanced so suppose that
journal runs one of the thousands of
opinion pieces denouncing Putin for the
criminal act of taking over Crimea
Crimea certainly doesn't have to run a
piece pointing out that while the act is
no doubt criminal the Russia has a far
stronger case than the US
in holding on to southeastern Cuba
taken over a century ago at gunpoint
includes Cuba's major port rejecting the
demand of Cuba ever since independence
to turn it back and the only
justification for this is that it
contributes to the 50-year program of
terrorists war and economic
strangulation of the country guilty of
successful defiance of US policy since
1823 and the same is true of quite a few
other current cases no need to run
opinion pieces about that the actual
media doctrine of fair and balanced
holds for one case when the concerns of
concentrated private power are involved
nowhere else and though this is obvious
enough it cannot be perceived in the
elite culture in the educated culture
you can verify that very easily by
checking well let's turn to the threat
of instant destruction by nuclear
weapons the record on that is extremely
interesting and it demonstrates quite
clearly that from the earliest days the
security of the population has been a
non-issue and remained so to the present
the record is shocking and
insufficiently recognized I'd really
urge you to look at it closely it
strongly supports the lament of the
General Lee Butler it's the last
commander of the Strategic Air Command
which controls nuclear weapons and
weapons policy in his words we have so
far survived the nuclear age by some
combination of skill luck and divine
intervention and I suspect the latter in
the greatest proportion and he goes on
to say that we can hardly count on
divine intervention
as we continue to play roulette with the
fate of the species in pursuit of the
driving factors in state policy he
didn't add that I added it so take a
couple of illustrative examples
beginning at the start of the Atomic Age
at that time this is 1950 the US was
overwhelmingly powerful enjoyed
remarkable security nothing like it in
history controlled the Western
Hemisphere controlled both oceans
controlled the opposite sides of both
oceans if had 50% of the world's wealth
is just incomparable power and security
there was however one potential threat
potential at that time that was ICBMs
with hydrogen bomb warheads they didn't
exist but they might exist someday there
is actually a standard scholarly review
of nuclear policies written with access
to high-level documents it's by McGeorge
Bundy who was the national security
advisor for the Kennedy and Johnson
administration's and what he writes is
that he describes the development of
ICBMs with nuclear warheads is one of
the great achievements of the Eisenhower
administration but he then adds that
it's useful to recognize that both the
United States and the Soviet Union might
be in much less nuclear danger today if
these missiles had never been developed
and they had it's a very instructive
comment he says I am aware of no
proposal could find no proposal in the
litter
either in or out of government that
these missiles should be banned by
agreement
nobody even considered it there was no
thought at all of trying to prevent the
sole serious threat to the United States
threat of utter destruction and this
striking fact merits a phrase in the
standard comprehensive history and has
been ignored in commentary I can't find
anyone who's ever even referred to it
well could it have been prevented
would a treaty have been possible can't
be sure of course but some indication
that it would have been possible one
suggestive indication is remarkable
proposal by Stalin in 1952 he offered to
allow Germany to be unified with free
elections which of course the Communists
would lose but with a condition that it
not join a hostile military alliance
again hardly an extreme condition in the
light of history while Stalin's proposal
was received in the United States but it
was ignored or whenever mentioned just
ridiculed actually recent scholarship
which now has access to Russian archives
has begun to take quite a different view
and an illuminating one that one cases
out of Mulan is a bit early and
anti-communist Harvard scholar leading
specialist on Bolshevik Russia here's
what he says he says the status of
Stalin's proposal is an unresolved
mystery Washington wasted little effort
in flatly rejecting Moscow's initiative
on grounds that were embarrassingly
unconvincing the leaving open the basic
question was Stalin genuinely ready to
sacrifice the GDR on the altar of real
democracy with consequences for world
peace and
real security that would have been
enormous that one of the most prominent
cold war scholars Melvin Leffler
reviewing recent research and Soviet
archives writes that scholars are
surprised to discover that Lavrentiy
Beria the sinister brutal head of the
secret police proposed that the Kremlin
offer the West a deal on unification and
neutralization of Germany agreeing to
sacrifice the East German communist
regime to reduce east-west tensions and
of course to improve political and
economic conditions in Russia
opportunities he points out that were
squandered in favor of gaining West
German participation in NATO well under
those circumstances it's not at all
impossible that agreements might have
been reached that would have protected
the security of the population from the
gravest imaginable threat total
destruction but the possibility was not
considered another striking indication
of how slight a role authentic security
plays in state policy accidentally this
tells us quite a lot about intellectuals
in the United States and Europe try to
find any discussion of this well that
was revealed again in the years that
followed a couple years later Nikita
Khrushchev took office he recognized
right away that Russia could not compete
militarily with the United States the
richest most powerful country in history
and he recognized that if Russia hoped
to escape from its economic backwardness
and of course the devastating effects of
the second world war it would be
necessary to reverse the arms race so he
proposed sharp reductions in offensive
weapons mutual reductions the incoming
Kennedy administration considered the
offer and rejected it
instead they turn to rapid military
expansion the late Kenneth waltz one of
the leading most respected international
relations scholars describes it like
this
he said the Kennedy administration
undertook the largest strategic and
conventional peacetime military buildup
the world has yet seen as Khrushchev was
trying to carry through a major
reduction in conventional forces and to
follow a strategy of minimum deterrence
and we did so the u.s. did so though the
balance of strategic weapons greatly
favored the United States again a
decision to harm national security story
the population while enhancing state
power
that's Kennedy a major reason why
Kennedy barely squeaked the victory in
1960 was his charge that Eisenhower and
Nixon had permitted the Russians to leap
ahead in offensive weaponry creating
what they called a missile gap that
severely threatened u.s. security that
frightened the population enough so that
Kennedy barely won the election in
reality the US was far in the lead the
Russians had four operational ICBMs
tiny fraction of the u.s. arsenal and
this was quickly understood and speaking
for the administration McGeorge Bundy
again he explained that they had
nevertheless been right in emphasizing a
fake missile gap because as he put it
the phrase had a useful shorthand effect
of calling attention to our basic
military posture that's an illusion to
the posture of rapidly expanding
overwhelming US dominance and threat and
rejecting security and
the prospects for survival well the
Russians did react the reaction was to
place missiles in Cuba in nineteen
nineteen sixty-two that move was
motivated also by Kennedy's huge
terrorist campaign against Cuba which is
mostly suppressed but this plenty of
evidence about it which was scoutship
scheduled to lead to invasion in October
1962 the month when the missiles were
emplaced that brought the world to the
most dangerous moment in history kennedy
advisor arthur schlesinger 'he's phrase
historian as the crisis peaked in late
october the kennedy received the secret
letter from Khrushchev offering to end
the crisis by simultaneous public
withdrawal of Russian missiles from Cuba
and US Jupiter missiles from Turkey
these Jupiter missiles were obsolete
missiles withdrawal order had already
been given for them because they were
being placed by far more lethal
essentially invulnerable of Polaris
submarines the Kennedys subjective
estimate was that if he refused this
offer the probability of nuclear war was
between 1/3 and 1/2 a war that would
have destroyed the northern hemisphere
as President Eisenhower and stated he
refused
it's hard to think of a more horrendous
decision in human history and worse he's
praised for his cool courage and
statesmanship ten years later Henry
Kissinger called a nuclear alert in the
last days of the 1973 Israel Arab War
the purpose was to warn the Russians not
to interfere with his delicate
diplomatic maneuvers these were designed
to in
an Israeli victory but a limited victory
so that the US would still be in control
of the region unilaterally and the
maneuvers were indeed delicate the
United States and Russia had jointly
imposed the ceasefire but Kissinger
secretly
informed Israel that they could ignore
it and therefore he called a nuclear
alert to frighten the Russians away the
security of the population had its usual
status zero ten years after that the
Reagan administration came in and they
decided to launch operations to probe
Russian defenses the way they did it was
by simulating air and naval attacks
against Russia and also calling the
highest level nuclear alert which of
course known to the Russians
all of this was undertaken at a very
tense moment pursing two missiles had
were being deployed in Europe he's had a
five minute flight time to Moscow Reagan
announced the so-called Star Wars
program missile defense which the
Russians understood to be a first-strike
weapon
that's how missile defense is understood
on all sides for good reasons and other
tensions were rising well naturally the
Russians were quite alarmed by this
unlike the United States Russia's quite
vulnerable had repeatedly been invaded
almost destroyed and that led to a major
war scare in 1983 there are
newly-released archives that reveal that
the danger was much more severe than
historians had previously assumed
there's a CIA study that just appears is
called the war scare was for real they
conclude that CIA conclude
that the u.s. underestimated Russian
concerns and the threat of a Russian
reaction the major journal on this topic
Journal of Strategic Studies that writes
that these Reagan exercises almost
became a pre prelude to a preventive
nuclear strike which would have wiped
out the northern hemisphere and in fact
it was more dangerous than that that we
learned last September there was a it
was revealed that right in the midst of
these world threatening developments
Russia's automated early warning systems
detected an incoming missile strike from
the United States sending the highest
level alert
well the protocol for the Soviet
military like the American military is
to retaliate at once
with a nuclear attack of its own now
there was an officer on duty stanislav
petrov he decided to disobey the orders
and not to report the warning to his
superiors and thanks to his dereliction
of duty we're alive to talk about it
that was 1983
you can determine how much publicity has
been given to all of this well security
for the population was no more a
priority for the Reagan planners for
there than for their predecessors and
that continues right to the present in
fact pretty obvious when you take a look
at what's going on in Ukraine and plans
for the future or even more frightening
Obama came into office with nice
rhetoric about cutting back the arms
race in fact he's exceeding his
predecessor George Bush in expanding the
nuclear weapons arsenal the United
States under Obama is now planning to
spend more than a trillion dollars on
the nuclear arsenal in the next thirty
years and of course the United States is
not along though it's in the lead so
going back to general Butler it's a near
miracle that we've escaped destruction
so far and the longer we tempt fate the
less likely it is that we can hope for
divine intervention to rescue us from
error folly well we're all surely aware
just to conclude that we now face the
most ominous decisions in human history
there are lots of problems that should
be addressed but two of them are
overwhelming and they're significant
environmental destruction nuclear war
for the first time in history we face
the prospects of destroying the
possibility of decent existence and not
in the distant future for this reason
alone it's imperative to sweep away the
ideological clouds face honestly and
realistically the question of how policy
decisions are made and what we can do to
alter them before it's too late
