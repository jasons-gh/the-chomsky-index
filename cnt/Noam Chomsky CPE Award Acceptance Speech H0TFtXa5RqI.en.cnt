that's a great pleasure to be with you
and a great honor to be awarded this to
be given this award from a group that
I've admired enormous Lee for many years
for the remarkable and a quite crucial
work that it's been doing and I would
like to say a little about that and also
put it in a what I think is a useful
context that we're in the middle of this
quadrennial extravaganza which is mostly
irritating but has some at some good
sides one is that I do think it provides
a relevant context for discussing the
critically important work that CPE has
been doing and must continue to do and
we can also learn something from it
about how the country works both see a
political and social and economic aspect
I mean it's obvious to anybody who pays
any attention that the elections are
mainly a huge PR operation they're run
by the PR industry and they follow its
guidelines and they understand it very
well so you may recall that after the
2008 election immediately after the
election there was the annual meeting of
the advertising Association national
advertising Association every year they
give an award for the most successful
marketing campaign of the year in 2008
they gave it to Obama he beat out Apple
computer and the
the business press was kind of
interesting potential times and so on
they reported the responses of
executives to this they were quite
euphoric about it they said Obama has
presented us with a new model for
diluting people we were following the
Reagan model we thought that was pretty
good one but Obama's now presented a new
one so that's the one we're gonna try to
make use of from now on I don't usually
quote Sarah Palin but she had something
to say about this which which I'm sure
you heard which wasn't totally false she
asked where's all this hopi changing
stuff well it's a good question by
looking into the industry and how it
developed and what it does we can gain a
good deal of understanding of the
political process and how to confront
the shredding of what little remains of
political democracy and not least in the
economic dimension which is tightly
tightly related to it the primary
functions of the PR industry were very
clearly and frankly laid out by its
founders was founded pretty much in the
1920s the leading ageru of the industry
was Edward Bernays he was no reactionary
he was a Wilson Roosevelt Kennedy
liberal and a pretty decent person and
he was in fact expressing views which
are quite standard in those circles he
wrote it in a book which had the honest
title propaganda this is the 1920s the
term at that time was used honestly now
as a bad connotation so it's not used
anymore
in his book propaganda which was a
manual for the industry he explained
what it's about and I'll just quote it
he says the goal of the industry should
be conscious and intelligent
manipulation of the organized habits and
opinions of the mass
is an important element in democratic
society but clearly it is the
intelligent minorities which need to
make use of propaganda continuously in
systematically because only they
understand the mental processes and
social patterns of the masses and are
therefore able to pull the wires which
control the public mind to mold the mind
of the masses so that they will throw
their strength in the desired direction
of the direction understood by the
intelligent minorities who must as he
said regiment the public mind every bit
as much as an army regiments the bodies
of its soldiers that's the noble mission
of the PR industry and this process of
what he called engineering consent is
the very essence of the democratic
process he wrote that when he was being
honored for his contributions by the
American Psychological Association well
Vernice was not only a wilson roosevelt
kennedy progressive but as i said also a
decent person and an intelligent person
it's hard to believe that he was unaware
that the intelligent minorities are
granted the opportunity to control the
public mind and the desired direction
only when that's the direction approved
by the paymaster's and like other decent
persons he was caught in the structure
of the prevailing socio-economic system
the industry obviously works for those
who can pay
Bernays his first major success back in
the 1920s was to run a campaign to
induce women to smoke that was a
contribution to what one recent
technical study calls the tobacco
Holocaust it estimates that the industry
was responsible for a hundred million
deaths worldwide in the past century and
a projected billion deaths by 2100
and calculated that the industry kills
one person for every 10,000 dollars in
profit that was his first major
contribution the second one and the
other one that he's known for is in
working for the United Fruit Company
where he was molding the mind of the
masses to support the military coup in
Guatemala in 1954 that wasn't quite as
successful they only killed a couple
hundred thousand people and left a
ruined country ever since in fact to
this day that people are still fleeing
from the Mayan highlands from the
virtual genocide carried out there the
under Reagan's war
Bernays was particularly successful in
molding the minds of the Free Press he
was working together with Thomas McCann
who was the press director for the
company the Fruit Company and McCann was
asked later with whether he thought it
was appropriate to work together with
Verne eyes to tell outrageous lies to
the media to try to prepare the
background for the military coup that
took place with all its horrible
consequences and he said he thought that
it was because as he put it the media
were so eager for the experience he
didn't want to deprive me well that's
the liberal progressive end of the
spectrum he can move over to the Karl
Rove Koch brothers and and maybe even
find some differences but they're not
phenomenal well when the PR industry
runs elections they of course work for
the funders which is not surprising and
it's by no means new in fact it goes
back before the industry was founded in
the nineteen twenties so if you go back
roughly a century you recall the great
campaign organizer and rich businessman
Mark Hanna who was asked once what was
necessary for a political campaign and
his answer was that there are three
things
the first one is money the second one is
money and the third he said I can't
can't remember but that was during an
earlier Gilded Age and by now there's
quite good scholarship on how this works
some of the best work I noticed by Tom
Ferguson at the other UMass his
investment theory of politics I think
gives very convincing evidence that over
a long period more than a century you
can pretty well predict the policies
that a an elected governments gonna
follow just by looking at the
concentration of campaign funding he's
brought it right to the present so
what's new is what's happening now is
not new in any fundamental way but
actually I think it is one of those
cases where quantity turns into quality
it's dramatically different in that
respect so it's natural that the
elections should be farcical displays
run by the PR agencies and the interests
of concentrated private power and it's
also very natural that they should keep
away from issues which they do very
successfully it's important not to bring
up issues and the reason is just what
Bruno's pointed out almost 100 years ago
the ignorant people don't understand and
in order to get them into the desired
direction you've got to continue to some
figure out ways to delude and
marginalize them and that's evident in
fact from studies of public opinion
which are pretty good an informative us
opinion is better studied than anywhere
in the world I presume because the
business world which funds the studies
wants to keep its finger on the public
pulse if you want to learn how to
control and misdirect people in the
desired direction you got to know what
they're thinking well the primary
business of the industry of course is
commercial advertising and here it's
basic commitment is quite simple
it's the destroyed markets anyone whose
in an economics course except maybe if
it's taught here learns that a market is
based on informed consumers making
rational choices then comes some
interesting theorems you can prove from
that well anyone who's turned on a
television set and those that business
is spending hundreds of billions of
dollars a year to prevent that if
advertisements were creating designed to
create informed consumers making
rational choices and say you know GM or
toothpaste maker or whatever would put
up a short ad with the description of
the project maybe some quotes from
consumer reports to guide people but
that's not exactly what you see what you
see is dedicated efforts to create
uninformed consumers will make
irrational choices and that's
understandable and when the industry
turns to the quadrennial task of running
elections they do the same thing they
use their talents to create uninformed
citizens will make irrational choices
which is what we watch every day and
there's no need to elaborate on how it
works but it's worth bearing in mind
that it's highly functional and very
rational
the intelligent minorities should be
dedicated to the task not just in the
liberal democracies of course although
it's takes a different form there in
fact if you look at the history of the
PR industry its kind of interesting it
it developed first in the most free
countries in the world in England in the
United States for good reasons which
were stated it was becoming harder to
control people by force so you had to
turn to the next best method namely
controlling their opinions and attitudes
or at least figuring it ways to
marginalize them go back to the business
literature that 1920s is it's important
to drive people to the insignificant
things
of life like fashionable consumption and
insofar as they're concerned with things
that are happening in the world to
follow the directives that nice spelled
out so well and there are some successes
in creating uninformed voters who make
irrational choices one poll that came
out a couple of days ago of southern
whites as illustrative it poll about
what they think about taxes and it turns
out they my substantial majority think
that there should be more tax higher
taxes for the very wealthy but by the
same majority they think Romney's
programs on taxes are better than those
of the Democrats well that's a success
there are careful studies of the sector
of the population that calls themselves
that answer this poll questions by
saying that they're in favor of small
government you know get the government
off my back you look at them the
basically Social Democrats they're in
favor of increasing spending on
education on health help for women with
dependent children but not welfare
because welfare was effectively
demonized by Reagan on racist grounds
and then pretty well killed by Clinton
foreign aid is an interesting question
that a lot of polling questions on that
it turns out that when people are asked
what they think about foreign aid
overwhelmingly they're they say it's way
too high we're giving everything away to
the undeserving poor and when they're
asked what they think it oughta be they
give a figure which is far higher than
it is but that's again success in
creating uninformed people making
irrational choices the most interesting
case right now is about the basic issues
facing the country domestically it's
pretty obvious that the basic issue is
jobs but that's not what the financial
institutions care
about their care and care about the
eventual sometime in the undetectable
future a possibility of inflation which
is bad for Landers so they're they want
you to worry about deficits and if you
look at the press and the elections and
so on there's just a drumbeat of
propaganda about elections and very
little that makes any sense at least
about jobs now it's not that the
political leaders don't understand this
so for example
christiana Romer and chair of Obama's
Council of Economic Advisers argued that
this is the timeless she put it to press
the accelerator we can worry about the
brake later and that's accepted by the
business press so Bloomberg Businessweek
uses the same metaphors as that's what
we ought to do same with the London
Financial Times the major world
newspaper but the paymaster's have
different priorities and they would
prefer to delude the public about the
horrendous problem of the deficit
ultimately the debt well there are
estimated twenty three million people
unemployed or underemployed
or given up and that's a huge problem
utterly the worse the deficit it's a
human problem because destroying lives
and on an enormous scale it's also an
economic problem
it's depriving the country of their
contributions so this is really
something deeply wrong with society
where there's huge resources available a
huge number of people wanting to work
tremendous amount of work that has to be
done but it just can't put them together
that should be the central component of
any campaign that was concerned to with
informed voters making rational choices
but it's totally missing not a word and
the campaign's of the media elsewhere
which simply means they're doing their
job they're doing the job that Bern eyes
described very well
the public is understandably quite
confused but actually public instincts
are often pretty sensible already
indicated part of it there are actually
good Studies on all of this on the gaps
between public opinion and public policy
some of the best ones have been carried
out by Ben page at Northwestern and his
colleagues take a look at the polls that
regularly not depends how questions are
asked always but typically in the recent
years there people have said that jobs
are a lot more important than the
deficit there are some studies of
people's attitude toward the deficit and
what to do about it actually the best
one is run by world public opinion most
detailed one director Stephen Cole coat
what he his conclusion he says clearly
both the administration and the
republican-led house are out of step
with the public's values and priorities
with regard to the budget the biggest
difference in spending is that the
public favors deep cuts in defense
spending more spending on job training
education and pollution higher taxes
especially on the rich all the opposite
of policy the gap gets particularly
extreme that when you look at people
like Paul Ryan who in my opinion is the
most dangerous person in the political
sphere and that's the fault of the
Liberals because they take him seriously
he's considered the great thinker
because he carries around pages that
have some numbers on him so you gotta be
a big thinker to do that
but is a this position is interesting I
don't want to give a biased view so I'll
quote The Wall Street Journal this is
The Wall Street Journal on Ryan's budget
proposals under mr. Ryan's plan the
Congressional Budget Office estimates
estimates spending on each 67 year old
Medicare beneficiary in 2050 would be 42
percent lower than the cost of
maintaining the status quo on Medicaid
spending would be 78 percent lower and
the author adds that's not a typo mr.
Ryan doesn't hide his priorities he puts
numbers on them like mr. Reagan he
emphasizes the import of defense
spending his budget calls for spending
16 billion dollars or 3% more on defense
in 2017 and mr. Obama's budget in short
radically not a radically different from
what the public wants but exactly the
opposite including the most conservative
sectors like Tea Party people's say the
opposite so perfectly naturally the
campaign has to spend suppress issues in
favor of glitz and delusion like on
television ads it's often said these
days that there aren't any more moderate
Republicans but that's not quite
accurate
there are plenty of moderate Republicans
they just named differently they're
called New Democrats and they've
actually been driving the Democratic
Party in pretty much the same direction
deeper into corporate pockets not quite
with as much gusto and dedication as the
Republicans but the same processes same
reasons so therefore they too have to
suppress issues and the PR understands
it all very well as the 2008 prize to
Obama illustrates the gap is quite
normal on many issues including some
related to the deficit and it's been
pointed out by good economist Dean
Baker's discussed it often that if the
United States had a healthcare system
like other industrial countries which is
not exactly a utopian dream there
wouldn't be any deficit in fact we'd be
moving towards a surplus
I'm sure you know the data about that
it's a dysfunctional system it's an
international scandal twice over twice
the per-capita expenditures of oacd
countries and relatively poor outcomes
and plenty of people just left out the
public has been in favor of a national
health care system for a long time it's
been interesting to see the occasional
comments on it
so in 2004 the election 2004 the last
debate late October Kerry Bush debate
was on domestic policy and in the air
times had an interesting article on it
it said it pointed out that no one
brought neither candidate brought up
health policy 2004 and it said they
recognized that the public is pretty
much in favor of something like national
health care but they said there's no
political support for it which is true a
political support means banks insurance
companies rich CEOs and so on and they
don't want it changed in 2008 slightly
for reasons that I think are
understandable American manufacturing
industry is being hit very hard by the
dysfunctional health system so GM for
example estimated that it costs them
twelve hundred dollars more to produce a
car and Detroit then across the border
and Windsor Canada simply because the
health care systems more effective well
you know manufacturing industry isn't as
powerful as it used to be but as some
kind of clout and as a result something
entered the 2008 and since campaign with
some form
health care system which is in fact an
improvement over the totally
dysfunctional system that exists but
it's far below what it ought to be or
even what the public wants that was
pretty evident than the two crucial
issues one the public option which was
the last residue of the public concern
for a national system that was just
given away Obama didn't even try even
though there was an overwhelming but
two-to-one majority in favor of it even
more striking which didn't get much
coverage was the the giveaway to the
pharmaceutical industry I mean there are
many of them like trips and many other
things but one very striking one is the
law which I think exists only in the
United States which bars the government
from negotiating drug prices except for
the VA which is the one part of the
system that works because it's
nationalized and much lower drug prices
as much better outcomes and so on so
this that was a poll by car Kaiser right
at the time and they found that 85
percent of the public is in favor of
getting rid of this provision so the
government can negotiate drug prices
just like the Pentagon negotiates you
know paperclip prices but that wasn't
even considered it was just like not
even possible to mention it well and as
I say a very you know non utopian
policies like picking up the programs of
every other comparable country would end
the famous deficit and open the way to a
surplus well in all of these domains the
work of CPE is quite crucial the task of
the PR industry is straightforward its
to delude and confuse the public for
very good reasons so as to drive them in
the desired direction has very nice put
it and the task of CPE is the opposite
it's to reverse the process to create an
informed public capable of making
rational decisions
that's a
a mental choice a task it's facing a
huge juggernaut but it necessary to
overcome the impact of the huge
propaganda offensives that are
manifested very dramatically during the
electoral cycle but are going on all the
time
the public has to learn how the economic
system works has to become a aware of
informed about economic realities and
crucially it has to understand that
there are alternatives an illustration
is a recent publication of peri the
political economy Research Institute
here which found that an interesting
study which found that financial the
banks and non-financial corporations are
holding about a trillion and a half
dollars in excess cash cash meaning
excess beyond what they need for safety
needs and I went on to show how these
resources can be put to work and how
they could create 19 million jobs that
would substantially overcome the
fundamental problem in the society not
to speak of the human benefits the
millions of lives saved the living wage
campaign is another example others are
publications of the kind mentioned that
field guide the economic policy for the
99% design for occupy workshops other
programs educational materials in those
ways the center helps bring to the
public the idea that an economy can be
designed to satisfy human needs not
profit for the few and the today's world
very few doesn't have to be that way but
the only way it can changed if an
informed and engaged public becomes
dedicated to the task that would make a
difference that's why there are such
massive efforts to prevent it and that's
the task that
Center has carried out successfully for
now a quarter of a century with much
more to do as powerful forces mobilized
to drive the country to disaster
