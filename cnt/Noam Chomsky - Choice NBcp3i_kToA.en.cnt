so for example the human choice or
animal choice it's completely
unintelligible to us I mean you can't
deny that it happens we all know
perfectly well that we make choices and
we make decisions but it's completely
it's not I be on the range of existing
science and no one has a coherent idea
of how you could explain it probably
because it lies beyond the bounds of the
human cognitive capacities I mean if you
think of the things we can understand
they pretty much reduced to determinism
and randomness so we understand things
being determined like a machine you know
you turn a lever and something else
turns that are a thermostat I mean that
kind of thing we understand the concept
of random behavior that was understood
in the 17th century you know some things
just happen randomly but suppose
something falls beyond the bounds of
determinacy and randomness well it's
beyond our cognitive capacities and
that's what we'll enjoy seem to be like
