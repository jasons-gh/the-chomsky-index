who in your opinion is the most
important amethyst
thinker well any person I would mention
is automatically disqualified because
any honest anarchist thinker would
simply immediately reject the
description of being the most important
anarchist thinker actually the most
probably the most important diner kiss
thinkers at least that I know of or poor
illiterate peasants in Aragon and
Catalonia and the 19:36 who actually
constructed a successful live anarchist
society over a large area industrial and
agricultural most of them were
illiterate they left documents so there
there are some documents left which are
extremely interesting they was and it
wasn't it wasn't spontaneous this had
been after efforts that have been going
on for seventy years
efforts that were attempts crushed to
try again you know educational programs
all sorts of things finally in the first
year of the Spanish revolution it broke
out and flourished and it was so
terrifying to everyone that every single
power combine to Crusher fascists russia
liberal democracies put aside their
differences to ensure that this would be
crushed and after they crushed it they
went you know they the war that's
the war of succession well you know they
were probably the most important
anarchist thinkers and the same is true
everywhere you take a look at the SE IWW
in the united states i mean those were
important anarchist thinkers who
actually carried out actions which led
finally to the development of the
American labor movement which had been
bitterly suppressed the US a very
violent labor history actually you know
about it around here and the but their
activities and others like them finally
did lead to
substantial successes there's major
attacks against them since but those are
successes of people who are constructing
worker managed community run societies
which is a kind of an anarchist ideal
and that this is very deeply rooted in
the United States people forget what
it's like there was a period in American
history of in which there was a
substantial there was substantial
victories for democracy through the 19th
century it was called people write about
I call it the period of self-rule it was
based on the assumption which is very
widespread in the United States that
wage labor is not very different from
slavery I mean that was the slogan of
northern workers who fought in the Civil
War I fact was even the slogan of the
Republican Party was slavery of course
unacceptable but so as wage slavery you
have to control your own fate you read
the newspapers written during the period
of the freest press in the United States
the late 19th century where working
people were running running around
newspapers communities and others people
in the mills and eastern Massachusetts
origins of the American industrial
revolution their press is what we would
call amicus these are you know Irish
artisans from the slums of Boston farm
girls from what they called factory
girls young women coming off the farms
into the mills they just took for
granted that those who work in the mills
are done and that we should have we
should create our own self managed
society integrating with others that's a
deep part of American history takes a
lot of effort to crush it
