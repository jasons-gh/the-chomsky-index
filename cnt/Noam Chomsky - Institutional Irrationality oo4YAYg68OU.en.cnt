you say there is something about us our
intelligence that were capable of acting
in ways that are rational within a
narrow framework but our irrational in
terms of other long-term goals do you
see any optimism well I think there that
we have to make a distinction here
between individual rationality and
institutional rationality individual
stupidity and institutional stupidity so
for example recently at Davos there was
a poll of CEOs when they were asked to
rank risks and I think they had 19 risks
that they thought were serious climate
change was not among them the top risk
was regulation the one possibility of
eliminating the disaster now that's
institutional stupidity if you act if
you would ask those individuals what do
you think about climate change they'd
probably say I'm contributing to the
Sierra Club as individuals they may be
perfectly rational and sensible but in
their institutional role they have there
are certain requirements that they must
meet if you're the CEO of say Exxon
Mobil and you're not trying to maximize
the use of fossil fuels you're out and
somebody else is in because that's the
nature of the institution in these kind
of quasi market systems in which we live
transactions ignore externalities like
if I sell you a car we make a deal for
ourselves we don't care about the effect
on them and there's an effect more
pollution more traffic jams and so on
and it adds up in the case of extraction
of fossil fuels the externality happens
to be survival your grandchildren but in
the institutional framework that's not
considered that's a footnote like in an
economics test ok but that's
institutional irrationality individual
rationale
is different which means that we as
individuals have the capacity to modify
and overcome the institutions that are
driving us to disaster that's the
element of hope
