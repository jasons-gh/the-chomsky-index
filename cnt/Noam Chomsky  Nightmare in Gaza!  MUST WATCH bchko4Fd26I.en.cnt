okay thank you for waiting I'm John
chairman of the Center for International
Studies which is sponsoring this talk
today along with the program on human
rights and justice before we begin a few
quick announcements one is that we will
have some time for questions at the end
of professor Chomsky's talk and what
we'll do is at the end of the talk we
can line up on either side in front of
the microphone I think is the best way
to do it will just go back and forth
with questions I hope rather than
statements or manifestos also the center
is sponsoring a couple of talks that
potentially of interest to this audience
in the next month or so one is of coming
on january 29th I think in late
afternoon you'll have to check our
website for exact time and location on
refugees remarkable book assembled on
refugees refugee voices by the actress
Mia Kirshner and she will be here
actually for an iap activity for the
next two weeks starting next week and
will cap it off with a public talk
that's on the 29th and then on the
nineteenth of februari we will have
aisle weitzman who is a israeli
architect and critic social critic who
will be here also a late afternoon
lecture on februari 19th again location
you can find on our website today I am
introducing the man who
needs no introduction so I won't give
him much of one except to say that we're
really delighted that Noam Chomsky can
join us today certainly one of the
world's most important intellectuals and
activists and speaking today on a
subject he knows well so please help me
in welcoming Noam Chomsky as you know on
Saturday december twenty seven the
latest US Israeli attack on hopeless
Palestinians was launched it had been
meticulously prepared we know from the
Israeli press that both aspects of the
campaign had long been carefully
prepared both the military aspect and
the propaganda aspect learning from the
lessons of the 2006 invasion of Lebanon
which it was argued was not planned well
from a military point of view and was
not advertised properly so this time
both of those aspects were under control
with extensive programs and that means
we can be reasonably confident that
anything that's happening or that is
said is purposeful its planned that way
maybe not everything but most of it one
thing that was planned carefully was the
time of the launching of the war was
carefully chosen it was shortly before
noon on Saturday when children are
returning from school and crowds are
milling around in the streets of densely
populated Gaza City and it took only a
few minutes to kill well over 200 people
and wound around 700 which
is an auspicious opening to the mass
slaughter of defenseless civilians
trapped in a tiny cage with nowhere to
flee that was saturday december 27th
last saturday two weeks later israel
barred humanitarian shipments to gaza
strip because we have to after all honor
the holy days none of this is at all
surprising it's familiar just to mention
one parallel which is relevant come to
it later in june nineteen eighty-two
when israel launched its us-backed
invasion of lebanon the first target
attacked was a Sabra and Shatila refugee
camps later to become famous because of
a major massacre the bombing hit the
hospital the Gaza hospital killed more
than 200 people that was the opening day
of the invasion which killed maybe 15 to
20,000 people destroyed much of southern
Lebanon large parts of Beirut it was
able to proceed as usual because of us
sport us authorization us arms
diplomatic support which included the
vetoing a series of Security Council
resolutions calling for an end to the
carnage the aggression was undertaken
also as usual and as conceded in fact to
defend Israel namely from the threat of
a peaceful political settlement that's
contrary to much routine deceit in the
United States particularly but it's all
so will document it it's hardly
necessary to talk about it oh this is
normal and it's not concealed by high
Israeli officials
just give one example 30 years ago the
chief of staff of the army more fagor
pointed out that quote him since
nineteen forty eight we have been
fighting against a population that lives
in villages and cities israel's major
military analyst Ze'ev Schiff summarized
his remarks it said the Israeli army has
always struck civilian populations
purposely unconsciously the army Merced
has never distinguished civilian from
military targets but has purposely
attacked civilian targets and the
reasons were explained at the same time
by the distinguished statesmen Abba Eban
considered dove he said there was a
rational prospect ultimately fulfilled
that affected populations would exert
pressure for the cessation of
hostilities satisfying Israel's goals
haven't happened to be commenting on a
speech by Menachem beggin which
presented a picture Evan said of an
Israel wantonly inflicting every
possible measure of death and anguish on
civilian populations in a mood
reminiscent of regimes which neither mr.
Vega nor I would dare to mention by name
Evan did not contest the facts he
criticized beggin for speaking about
them so frankly which could be harmful
the Israeli image his own views which I
just quoted could also be attributed to
countries that we they are not mentioned
by name well as the latest us Israeli
assault on Gaza began a small boat the
dignity was traveling from Cyprus to
Lebanon there were doctors and human
rights activists award and they intended
to violate Israel's
criminal blockade and to bring supplies
to the trapped population the boat was
intercepted far out at sea in
international waters of the Israeli Navy
rammed it without warnings really
damaged the boat it managed to limp to a
Lebanese Harbor Israel provided the
routine lives of terrorists etc and
claimed that the boat wasn't around but
unfortunately for the propaganda system
there were respected journalists on
board including CNN correspondent Karl
Penhaul who reported other other al
Jazeera reporters but Penhall was hard
to dismiss though he was dismissed also
a board was Cynthia McKinney the former
representative a candidate presidential
candidate for the Green Party and she
and other passengers verified Karl
Penhaul account which I've just stated
this is all quite a serious crime for
example a ramp ramming and almost
thinking about in international waters
is much more serious crime than piracy
off the coast of Somalia for example it
received very little notice in a few
words here and there it's which reflects
a tassantassuk the acceptance of the
principle that Israel is authorized to
carry out crimes on the high seas in
order to defend itself against any
interference with its illegal military
occupation by trying to provide some
suffer to the victims also tacit ly
accepted is that the Gaza Strip isn't is
occupied territory that is Israel has a
right to impose a siege on it well that
lack of attention again makes good sense
it's all very familiar for decades
Israel has been hijacking
ships in international waters between
cypress and Lebanon killing passengers
kidnapping them many of them brought the
Israel some held as hostages for a long
time in prison sometimes in the secret
prison torture chambers which have been
exposed in Israel in Europe but not
reported here and it's known
occasionally see a mention of it and us
commentary but never considered very
serious so there's no particular reason
why this new crime should be greeted
with anything more than a yawn these
regular practices are quite significant
they underscore the utter hypocrisy of
the standard claim that Israel had the
right to invade Lebanon once again in
2006 fifth invasion because soldiers
were captured at the border actually as
I say this has been Israeli practice
over many years has been far more
extreme killing intercepting ships
killing people they're capturing them as
hostages oh that is far more extreme
crime than capturing soldiers out of
order boast think what you do about that
but it doesn't rank anywhere near it so
if that justifies the invasion which
again once again devastated southern
Lebanon parts of Beirut if principles
operated you can draw your own
conclusions but fortunately they don't
operate fortunately fortunately for the
US and its clients this cross-border
operation of Hezbollah in 2006 was its
first cross-border action of any kind in
six years since Israel had withdrawn
from southern Lebanon where it had
occupied southern Lebanon with us
support for 22 years in violation of
Security Council resolutions meanwhile
Israel daily
violates the border throughout these six
years as indeed it is doing today and
again that's with impunity and nothing
were they on if it's even mentioned well
these new crimes that began on December
27th there they don't fit easily into
any of the standard categories except
for one namely familiarity they do fit
into that category I've given a couple
of examples and there's time I'll return
to more literally the current u.s.
israeli invasion falls under the
category of terrorism at least according
to the US official a definition of the
word but that does not capture the
enormity of the crime it cannot be
called aggression and the reason is that
it's taking place in occupied territory
that's accepted in the West passively
and it's basically beyond question it's
recognized by Israeli scholarship so the
most important case i know is
comprehensive the one and only
comprehensive scholarly history of
israeli settlement in the occupied
territories it's been translated into
english called lords of the land by ed
zaire tellin Akiva Eldar they point out
that quote after israel withdrew its
forces from gaza in august 2005 the
ruined territory was not released for
even a single day from israel's military
grip or from the price of the occupation
that the inhabitants pay every day
israel left behind scorched earth
devastated services and people with
nearly with neither a present or a
future the settlements were destroyed
the jewish settlements in an ungenerous
move by an unenlightened occupier which
in fact continues to control the
territory and kill and her assets
inhabitants by means of its formidable
military might which is x
exercised with extraordinary savagery
always with firm us support and
participation crucial fact for us even
before the latest onslaught the
us-israeli assault on Gaza escalated in
January 2006 a few months after the
formal withdrawal because Palestinians
committed a real crime they voted the
wrong way in a free election and that's
a serious crime you have to they have to
learn that like others easy to add
examples that there's a cost to
disobeying the commands of the master
who incidentally continues to pray about
is yearning for democracy without
eliciting ridicule from the educated
classes which is quite an achievement of
our educational and cultural system one
of many well since terrorism the terms
terrorism and aggression are inadequate
some new term is needed for the sadistic
and cowardly torture of people who are
caged with no possibility of escape
while they're being pounded daily by the
most sophisticated products of US
military technology provided in the
certain knowledge that this is how they
will be used it happens to be in direct
violation of US law of course also
international law but for self declared
outlaw spades that's just another minor
technicality so there's no need to
comment on it just how serious these
weapons are remains to be completely
verified they apparently include white
phosphorus according to Human Rights
Watch which is another violation of the
laws of war and who knows what else one
of the heroic volunteers in Gaza a
Norwegian doctor
my Gilbert describes his sense of her as
an all-out war goes on against the
civilian population of Gaza he estimates
that half the casualties are women and
children the men who are killed are also
civilians by any reasonable legal
standards almost all he says that he has
scarcely seen a military casualty among
the hundreds of shredded bodies but
that's in accord with the gore eben have
on principles which I mentioned and in
fact with consistent practice his
estimate is confirmed by the UN
humanitarian chief john holmes who
informed reporters that it's a fair
presumption that most of the civilians
killed were women and children in a
humanitarian crisis that is worsening
day by day as the violence continued
those who don't like that story can be
comforted by the words of CP Livni who
is the leading dove in the electoral
system who assured the world that there
is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza thanks
to Israeli benevolence like others who
care about the human beings and their
fate Gilbert and homes called for
pleaded in fact vs. fire but not yet the
u.s. blocked the Security Council from
issuing a formal statement calling for a
ceasefire there was an official reason
which I'll quote there was no indication
that Hamas would abide by any agreement
of all the justifications that have been
offered for delighting in slaughter this
must rank among the most cynical of
course that was Bush and rice there are
soon to be replaced by Barack Obama who
compassionately repeats that if missiles
were falling where my two daughters
sleep I would do everything everything
in order to stop that he's talking about
Israeli children beyond that he's
maintained its silence
a few days later under intense
international pressure the US did back a
Security Council resolution which called
for what they called a durable ceasefire
it past 14 20 United States abstaining
Israel and US Hawks were angered that
the United States did not veto it as the
usual practice is the Upstate abstention
however does give Israel if not a green
at least a yellow light to continue with
the slaughter the resolution called for
stopping the flow of arms into Gaza
though not into Israel in fact vast
quantities of arms continued to flow
into Israel on December 30th three days
after the latest invasion the Pentagon
released the fact that huge but the USS
commissioned several German ships to
bring huge quantities of arms from
Greece Israel they're just nobody knows
they are they're labeled ammunition i
think it was 3,000 tons the very few
inquiries to the Pentagon about what's
going on Oh were answered with assurance
that the arms would arrive too late to
be used in the current assault against
Gaza which is probably correct and it
can also said that they're not really
intended for Israel which is also
probably correct but rather they are
being pre-positioned in Israel Israel is
regarded as an offshore US military base
ran in the periphery of the most
important region of the world the oil
energy producing region it's one of its
contributions one of its services the US
power and the arms that are
pre-positioned there will be if the
Pentagon is accurate not for Israeli
violence but for us violence so the next
act of aggression in the region can make
use of
the arms stored there for the purpose is
much more if it ever gets reported it
will be you can predict that it will be
explained that this is to defend a to
protect the free flow of oil and to
assure stability those are the technical
terms used for aggression and a criminal
violence standardly well going back to
the UN resolution did call for stopping
the flow of arms into Gaza in fact but
it also quote ensures the sustained
reopening of the crossing points on the
basis of the 2005 agreement on movement
and access between the Palestinian
Authority and Israel what was the 2005
agreement that determined that the
crossings to Gaza would be operated on a
continuous basis that is never closed
and that Israel would also allow the
crossing of goods between Gaza and the
West Bank the two parts of Palestine in
January 2006 the US and Israel abandoned
the agreement that's part of the
punishment of Palestinians for voting
the wrong way in a free election we take
democracy very seriously here must be
understood there's a good deal of sober
debate these days on what the attackers
hope to achieve I don't think that's
very obscure when we took a take a brief
look at recent history Israel abandon
Gaza in September 2005 why well rational
Israeli hardliners like Ariel Sharon as
the patron saint of the settler movement
understood that it was senseless to
subsidize a few thousand settlers
to live illegally of course in the ruins
of Gaza protected by a large part of the
IDF the Israeli army while they took
over used much of the land and scarce
resources of the territory including its
water it made much more sense to turn
Gaza into what's properly been called
the world's largest prison and to unlit
the people just rot and to transfer the
settlers to the West Bank which is much
more valuable territory and they can be
subsidized illegally to live there a
couple other places Israel is quite
explicit and its intentions about the
West Bank in Word and in deed the goal
is clearly too and they say it to annex
the air the arable land that's the water
supplies the pleasant suburbs of
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv all of those that
lie within what they call the separation
wall annexation wall it was declared
illegal by the World Court the US
Justice agreeing but of course that's
again irrelevant in outlaw states the
territory to be annexed includes vastly
expanded Jerusalem that's in violation
of security council orders that go back
to 40 years in addition Israel will take
over in fact has been taking over the
Jordan Valley it's about a third of the
West Bank that imprisons what's left the
part that's imprisoned is broken into
fragments by settled salience to major
said ends that basically trisect the
territory and many other settlements and
hundreds of mostly arbitrary checkpoints
which are designed to make life
impossible for the two-headed beasts who
may remain and will be like a drugged
roaches scurrying around
bottle I'm quoting the highest Israeli
political and military leaders in this
case the revered Prince's as they're
called the owners of the land may grant
the drug roaches a few scattered parcels
but that's out of good will not buy
right Prime Minister Olmert you may
recall addressed a joint session of
Congress and me 2006 and two rousing
applause and a standing ovation he said
I believed and to this day still believe
in our peoples eternal and historic
right to this entire land his start the
entire land includes at least everything
from the Jordan to the sea and given his
background it may include Jordan as well
to which it laid this party laid claim
the he also announced the program for
what he called convergence that's for
taking over a program for taking over
whatever is valuable in the West Bank
leaving the Palestinians and isolated
Canton's that a such plans trace are not
new you know maybe the details are but
they traced back to the earliest days of
the occupation a few days after the end
of the war defense minister Moshe Dayan
who among the Israeli leadership is
perhaps the most sympathetic to the
palestinian plight he explained
poetically that the situation today
resembles the complex relationship
between a Bedouin man and a girl he
kidnaps against her will you
Palestinians as a nation don't want us
today but will change your attitude by
forcing our presence on you you will
live like dogs and whoever will leave
will leave and meanwhile we'll take what
we want that's 1967
at the very moment there was no doubt
that these announced policies were
criminal immediately after the 1967 war
the Israeli government was informed by
its highest legal authority Theodore may
run well-known international figure in
international law they were informed
that the civilian settlement in the
administered territories which with a
Coulomb contravenes the explicit
provisions of the Fourth Geneva
Convention that's a serious crime and
it's incumbent on all of the High
Contracting Parties that a parties that
signed the Geneva Convention it's
incumbent on them to act to prevent such
crimes of course they don't do it the
United States no it doesn't do it but
that's the crimes but again in an outlaw
state that's an irrelevant so he's no
discussion of it that's Theodore may
wrong he was supported by the israel
israel's justice minister concurred in
his judgment and the World Court
unanimously endorsed that conclusion and
it's a decision in 2004 on the
annexation wall meanwhile the Israeli
High Court formally agreed with the
World Court while disagreeing in its
usual convoluted style if you look at
the judgment in the West Bank Israel can
pursue its criminal programs with us
support and with no disturbance that's
thanks to its effective military control
and by now also the cooperation of the
collaborationist Palestinian security
forces that have been armed and trained
by the United States and its allies it
can also carry out regular
assassinations and other crimes while
the settlers rampage under IDF
protection but while the West Bank has
been effectively subdued by
terror there still is resistance in the
other half of Palestine the Gaza Strip
that too has to be quelled for the
us-israeli programs of annexation and
destruction of Palestinians to proceed
hence the invasion of Gaza the timing of
the invasion was probably presumably
influenced by the coming Israeli
elections a hood Barack who runs the
invasion had been lagging badly in the
polls but one Israeli commentator run
huh kahane in the early days of the
slaughter calculated that for every 4
840 Arabs killed a barrack gains one
parliamentary seat however the reasons
why much deeper than winning an election
I think the reasons are those that I
mentioned and they're really on the
surface doesn't take much insight to
perceive them well aggression always has
a pretext in this case there's a mantra
that's endlessly repeated you heard it a
thousand times in Israel and the United
States and in Europe and the mantra is
that Israel has the right to use force
to defend itself against custom rockets
and that's partially accurate the
rocketing is a criminal act and it's
true that a state has the right to
defend itself against criminal attacks
but the claim that a right that the
state has the right to use force to do
so goes far beyond any principle that we
would or should accept so for example I
doubt that there are many people here
who think that Nazi Germany had a right
to defend itself against the terrorism
of the partisans which was quite real
Kristen often 1938 was not justified by
the fact that Hershel greenspun
assassinated a German embassy official
in Paris the British were not justified
in terrorizing I
catholics in response to ira terror and
incidentally when they finally sensibly
turned to the sensible policy of
addressing legitimate grievances in the
territory they occupied the terror ended
it's not a matter of proportionality a
widely used word it's a matter of choice
of action in the first place
proportional or not is there a more
justified response than violence
forgetting proportionality well any
resort the force always carries a heavy
burden of proof and in every case
including the present case we have to
ask whether it can be met can it be met
in the case of Israel's effort to quell
any resistance to its criminal actions
both in Gaza and in the West Bank where
the criminal actions continue
relentlessly perhaps I may quote myself
if you don't mind in an interview in the
Israeli press a couple of years ago on
all Nertz announced convergence plans
for the West Bank what I said is that
the US and Israel do not tolerate any
resistance to these plans preferring to
pretend falsely of course that there is
no partner as they proceed with programs
that go back a long way we may recall
that Gaza and the West Bank are
recognized to be a unit so if resistance
to the us-israeli annexation Canton
ization programs is legitimate in the
West Bank then it is in Gaza too I think
that's correct the respected a separate
question is whether the modality of
resistance is legitimate the totally
separate question we may agree that
Hershel Greene spend committed a
criminal act and that the partisans
committed terror but has nothing to do
with a question whether Germany had a
right to respond with force same in the
British case so those are just two
questions that can be separated well dr.
Mustapha bar goodies
highly respected Palestinian
parliamentarian and official he reported
that since George Bush's Annapolis
extravaganza in november two thousand
seven may recall much impressive
rhetoric about dedication to peace and
justice he reports that since november
two thousand seven Israeli attacks on
Palestinians escalated sharply with an
almost fifty percent increase in the
West Bank along with a sharp increase in
settlements and Israeli checkpoints
quite obviously these criminal actions
are not a response to rockets from Gaza
although the converse may well be the
case as in fact suggests Israel has a
straightforward means to defend itself
easy put an end to the criminal actions
and they occupied territories that means
except the long-standing international
consensus on a two-state settlement on
the international border with perhaps
minor neutral modifications that's has
been a overwhelming international
consensus for over 30 years blocked by
the united states and by israel that
began officially in 1976 washington's
first veto of a Security Council
resolution calling for a two-state
settlement I'm not going to run through
the rest of the record there's no time
but it's very clear today us-israeli
rejection ISM is even more blatant than
it has been in the past in part because
of the Arab League's formal proposal for
a settlement that goes beyond the
international consensus calling for
normalization of relations a shin of
relations with Israel every time you see
the word Hamas in the newspapers it's
accompanied by Iranian supplied Hamas
not us supplied Israel and Hamas which
is committed
destruction of Israel what you don't
read is Hamas which long ago joined the
international consensus on a two-state
settlement that the US and Israel bar
that would be excluded in the Free Press
biased but it's a fact so the Arab
League's calling for normalization Hamas
is calling for a two-state settlement
Iran and Hezbollah have made it clear
explicitly that they will not they will
abide by any agreement the Palestinians
accept that leaves the United States and
Israel in splendid isolation both in
Word and also of course in actions
they're acting to undermine it and make
it impossible day by day now there is
one exception crucial exception to the
persistent rejection ISM of the United
States and Israel you'll recall that in
two thousand year 2000 there were
negotiations in Camp David which
collapse contrary to the standard story
the President Clinton recognized that
the us-israeli proposals at Camp David
were quite unacceptable and in december
two thousand he presented what he called
his parameters they were kind of vague
but they were more forthcoming you could
at least imagine a settlement in those
terms clinton also pointed out gave a
speech in which he pointed out that both
sides had accepted the parameters and
that both sides had reservations they
then met in Taba egypt in january two
thousand one to resolve the differences
and they came very close to a settlement
in fact in their final press conference
they said if they'd had a few more days
they could have reached a settlement the
negotiations were cancelled at that
point by Prime Minister Barack of Israel
that's the one break in 30 years of us
Israeli rejects
ism and I should say that it's not that
many years ago there's no reason why
that one break can't be resumed if an
American president decides to allow it
to be resumed in which case there will
be no shrieks from the famed Israeli
Lobby just as there were none at that
time and it could easily be implemented
well it's up to us to determine well
that I've just reported the fact it can
easily firm the urge that you verify
them it's not that hard give you the
sources if you like but there's a
preferred version which as usual is
quite different from the facts the
preferred virgin quote ethan bronner the
New York Times correspondent in Israel a
preferred version is that many abroad
recall mr. Barack as the prime minister
who in 2000 went further than any other
Israeli leader in peace offers to the
Palestinian only to CC the deal fail and
explode in a violent Palestinian
uprising that drove him from power well
he's partly right it's true that many
abroad believe these fairy tales thanks
to it brunner and all too many of his
colleagues called journalism there's
also a narrower question and the one
i've just been discussing let's the
narrower question puts aside resistance
to Israel's ongoing West Bank crimes and
again when I say Israel I mean us Israel
crimes because can't be done without us
automation and material and diplomatic
and in fact ideological support so put a
put aside all bad and just consider Gaza
alone does Israel have peaceful
alternatives to the use of force in
response to attacks on its territory
just keeping to Gaza alone well the
answer is it surely does it could accept
the ceasefire sometimes in fact it has
except the deceased
well instantly violating it the most
recent case crucial case is jun 2008
there was a ceasefire that was
instituted it called for opening the
border crossings quoting to allow the
transfer of all goods that were banned
and restricted to go into Gaza Israel
agreed but immediately announced that it
would not open the borders until Hamas
released gilad shalit an Israeli soldier
who was captured by Hamas in June 2006
the end of that ceasefire well that's
another mantra incidentally everybody's
heard about you lot shall eat and the
terrible crime of capturing him and how
till he's released you know how can you
move towards peace but that's just more
hypocrisy in fact the Apocrypha so
blatant it really is an impressive feat
for Western journalism especially
American journalism and intellectual
culture to suppress it one day before
Hamas captured shall eat Israeli
soldiers entered gaza gaza city and
kidnapped two civilians the Muammar
brothers their names are not known they
brought them to Israel and course in
violation of international law to join
the thousands of other prisoners held
there close to a thousand without charge
and of course that had been regular
Israeli practice for a long time I
mentioned some of the cases now
kidnapping civilians is a far more
serious crime than capturing a soldier
of an attacking army but all that
remains in memory allegedly blocking
peace is the capture of shall eat again
that reflects the difference in
treatment between human beings on the
one side and two legged beasts on the
other surely should be returned in a
fair prisoner exchange but try to find
an honest comment on this anywhere
it was after the capture of Shalott that
Israel's military attacked passed from
vicious to truly sadistic but it's well
to remember that even before his capture
in june two thousand six israel had
fired more than seven thousand seven
hundred shells at northern Gaza since
its September withdrawal of listening
virtually no comment maybe none Israel
has maintained the siege ever since it
rejected the jun 2008 ceasefire that it
accepted a siege is an act of war
justifying massive violence in response
that's a point on which Israel has
always insisted when its own access to
the outside world is hampered in any way
in facts the justification for major
Wars so if that's true surely should be
a justification for Rockets the Israel
went so far in the siege is to prevent
the UN really from works administration
the UN agency that keeps Palestinian
alive I kept them from even replenishing
their stores so when the ceasefire broke
down we ran out of food for the 750,000
people who depend on us it's John King
the Irish director of lanois forming the
BBC well despite the continuing Israeli
siege again a serious act of war
rocketing sharply reduced during the
period of the ceasefire the ceasefire
broke down last November November forth
with an Israeli raid into Gaza the raid
was very carefully timed as usual it
came shortly before from us talks with
Hamas Fatah talks in Cairo that were
aimed at reconciling their differences
and creating a single unified government
that would have been the first such
meetings since the Civil War
in june two thousand seven that left
hamas in control of gaza and it would
have been a significant step towards
advancing diplomatic efforts so it was
quite useful to undercut that danger by
violating the ceasefire and invading
Gaza killing six people the civil war
itself was instigated by the United
States and Israel it was a very crude
attempt to set up a military to carry
out a military coup to overthrow the
democratically elected government that
the United States opposes again pretty
standard practice well the blockade was
tightened further after November fourth
disastrous consequences for the
population both Scott sides escalated
violence all the deaths were Palestinian
and that continued until the ceasefire
formally ended on December nineteenth
and Prime Minister Olmert authorized the
full-scale invasion a few days before
that about a week before Hamas had
proposed to return to the original July
ceasefire agreement which Israel had not
observed the that offer was transmitted
to a senior official in the Israeli army
by Robert past or he's a academic
historian on a firm former carter
administration high official but israel
did not respond except by launching the
invasion of course Israel was aware that
the head of Shin bait that's the
Internal Security Agency was quoted in
Israeli sources on December 21st saying
that Hamas is interested in continuing
the calm with Israel while its military
wing is continuing preparation for
conflict okay so no calm we'd rather
have conflict
Israel's senior diplomatic correspondent
Akiva Eldar reports that shortly before
Israel launched its full scale invasion
on Saturday December 27th Hamas I'm
quoting him Hamas Politburo chief solid
Michell proposed ceasefire and return
the arrangement of 2005 which permitted
continuous opening of the cross at
crossings 24 desperately needed supplies
the response was the invasion in a
front-page think piece on the latest
Gaza invasion New York Times
correspondent Steven Lee Myers writes
that in some ways the attack on Gaza was
reminiscent of the gamble Israel took in
Lebanon in 1982 when it invaded to
eliminate the threat of Yasser Arafat's
forces is correct there is a similarity
and the threat is the same he's correct
but not in the sense he had in mind in
1982 as in 2008 the threat was the
threat of political settlement and it
was crucially necessary to eliminate
that threat that's again standard
practice and it's not that Israel does
not want peace of course it wants peace
everyone wants peace Hitler wanted peace
for example the question is on what
terms from its origins long before the
establishment of the state the Zionist
movement has understood that to achieve
its goals it would have to delay
political settlement that mean while
slowly building facts on the ground as
the basis for some eventually settlement
even the occasional agreements as in
1947 were recognized by the leadership
to be temporary steps towards further
expansion the 1982 war is a dramatic
illustration of the need for
undercutting the threats
of political settlement it was called a
pretty openly in Israel a war for the
West Bank if we can get rid of the
diplomatic efforts of Palestinians which
were becoming very annoying we can
continue to take over the West Bank at
the cost of the destruction of Lebanon
and the killing of thousands of people
the 1982 lebanon war was followed by
israeli support for hamas so as to
undermine the secular PLO and it's
dangerous peace initiatives another case
that should be familiar if it isn't is
Israeli provocations before the 1967 war
which were designed to elicit a Syrian
response that could be used as a pretext
for Israeli violence and for the
takeover of more land that's at least
eighty percent of the incidents
according to defense minister Moshe
Dayan the F pneus efforts persistent
effort to delay political accommodation
has always made perfect sense it's not
irrational and the same is true of the
hysterical lies about how there is no
partner there simply is no other way to
take over land where you're not wanted
so it's sensible and for the same reason
similar reasons Israel has consistently
preferred expansion through security
particularly that's been particularly
evident since 1971 when Israel made a
really fateful decision I think backed
by Henry Kissinger namely the decision
to reject the offer of a full peace
treaty by President Sadat of Egypt which
incidentally offered nothing to the
Palestinians it's an agreement that
Israel in the United States were
compelled to accept at Camp David eight
years later it's after a major war which
was a near disaster for Israel and
immense suffering that goes down in
history as a wonderful achievement of
u.s. involvement in
bringing peace in fact it was a
diplomatic tast raphy for the reasons I
mentioned but that's you know beyond the
capacity of educated people to discuss
or think about again I urge you to look
at the facts if you're interested now a
priest peace treaty with Egypt in 1971
which the US and Israel rejected that
would have ended any significant
security threat it was none from the
Palestinians and Egypt is the major Arab
military force by far but there was an
unacceptable quid pro quo so that
insisted that Israel abandon its
extensive settlement programs in Egypt
mainly in the northeastern Sinai and as
usual security was a lower priority than
expansion as it still is today Israel
could have security normalization of
relations integration into the region
but it very clearly prefers illegal
expansion conflict repeated exercise of
violence and to teach lessons to the
two-legged beasts actions that are
severely eroding at security even if it
gains short-term military victory one of
the wisest voices in Israel
unfortunately a tiny minority weary of
nari I recently wrote that after an
Israeli military victory in Gaza what
will be seared into the consciousness of
the world will be the image of Israel as
a blood-stained monster ready at any
moment to commit war crimes and not
prepared to abide by any moral
restraints this will have severe
consequences for our long-term future
our standing in the world are a chance
of achieving peace and quiet in the end
this war is a crime against ourselves to
a crime against the state of israel it's
good reason to believe that he's right
if I can quote myself again so
decades ago three years ago I wrote that
those who call themselves supporters of
Israel are in reality supporters of its
moral degeneration and it's probable
ultimate destruction and regrettably
that judgment looks more and more
plausible meanwhile we're observing a
very rare moment in history that's what
the late Israeli sociologist bar
kimberling called politicized politicize
that's the murder of a nation at our
hands thanks
if you have questions for professor
Chomsky we should go to the mics as I
said earlier and just line up and will
recognize you as time permits I see one
or the other oh you know you'd never see
okay okay yes good morning out of all
good evening professor Chomsky and my
questions about the consensus the
American census about the support or
Israel's role as part of America's
geopolitical future recently there was a
letter in the Financial Times about how
our support for Israel is such a huge
you three geostrategic gift to China and
other competitors it's a huge one geo
strategic gift to China to try and the
other competitors yeah does our we sing
a crack in the consensus about the role
of Israel it's a serious question one
can debate whether it's been wise for
the United States to take the position
of extreme support for Israeli violence
and terror expansion criminal acts to
reject political settlement that's a
question it can be asked what we do know
is that the American elites think it's
right I mentioned the military which is
very happy with it partly because Israel
is just a major and obedient military
base in fact back in nineteen fifty
eight US intelligence concluded that
support for Israel is a what they said
the cold I think a logical it's a
logical corollary of our opposition to
what they call radical Arab nationalism
radical just means independent not
following orders so yes it's a logical
corollary to support for two opposition
to Arab independent Arab nationalism and
if you look at in 1967 when the
relations really became firm there was a
reaction
reaction to a major service that the
United States that Israel performed for
the United States and for its major
allies Saudi Arabia namely destroying
the basis for secular Arab nationalism
in the region Abdel Nasser is Egypt and
so it continues and up till today the
military is quite happy to have a an
obedient powerful military force
according it's a Israel's air and
armored forces small country but its air
and armored forces are larger and
technologically more advanced than any
NATO power outside the United States of
course it's because it's an offshoot of
the United States Israeli in the US
military industry are very highly
integrated so much so that one of
israel's major arms producers actually
shifted its executive offices to the
United States American high-tech
industry is very enthusiastic about
Israel you can tell that just by looking
at investment flows they've been
shooting up including the major
corporations if you look back or
Microsoft Intel Warren Buffett and so on
so they apparently think it's fine
American educated elites think it's fine
ever since nineteen sixty seven they
were very impressed by Israel's military
capacity and have maintained that you
know that delight in being supportive of
a major powerful military force of
course always with a humanistic cover
but that's normal so the fact of the
matter is that across the spectrum of
major actors well they seem be pretty
happy about it is it wise you could
debate it I mean I don't think it's wise
as I said I think I don't think it's
good for Israel I think they made a
terrible mistake in 1971 by refusing
peace security and insisting on
expansion and in fact they were later
compelled by force to back away from
that expansion that's Camp David and
continue with other expense
but you know that's my judgment I don't
determine policy but yes it's a fair
question could be asked thank you first
of all I just would like to offer my
condolences I would like you to
elaborate a little on on you talked
about the plan this was planned planned
in a military sense and planned in a
propaganda sense and I would like to ask
you to elaborate on aspects of the way
in which the propaganda side has been
given expression in a couple of areas
first of all I noticed that CNN and
Reuters among other major corporate
media used the term incursion repeatedly
secondly another reporter from the New
York Times you mentioned ethan bronner
Steven Erlanger who's reporting from
Jerusalem had a story reporting on what
Israeli military sources had reported
had discussed with him apparently
regarding people with weapons in Gaza in
civilian clothes popping out of holes
and and and and went into other details
and thirdly there was interesting timing
to me of a major front page feature
story based presumably on timed leaks
regarding Iran and Iranian the the fact
that the Bush administration had
supposedly said to Israel that they
would not be authorized to fly over Iraq
to bomb alleged nuclear facilities but
that instead the Bush administration
were intensifying covert operations
against those alleged programs in Iran
and finally the interesting fact that
all merit supposedly spoke out against
the occupation only weeks before
launching this major invasion
okay I not sure I got everything but the
meticulous planning of the invasion is
discussed extensively in the Israeli
press and to some extent here too so and
it describes both aspects the military
planning on the propaganda effort and
it's how effective it's been you know
one could argue it's there's one area
which is very effective in American
elite opinion and in the press but
probably not among the population the
only poll I've seen shows the population
very divided roughly 5050 on the
invasion despite the massive propaganda
which is just replicated on us without
deviation in the media including
examples you mentioned as for reliance
on Israeli military sources well of
course that's part of the part of the
propaganda system kind of like the US
and Iraq where reporters could do in if
they were embedded and meaning
propaganda agents and the freelance
reporters have tried to report some of
them were just dropped out of the
corporate media others could do it as
freelancers the in the case of Gaza
Israel has simply borrowed all reporters
foreign or or it's even Israeli because
they don't know I make sure that there's
no direct reporting I mean what you get
is you know cell phone calls or
something like that and reports from
people like not Gilbert this Norwegian
doctor and UN officials and so on but
you know that's all part of what they
call their house of Arak campaign that
Israel has to word Hebrew their two
words for propaganda one of them is
standard word for propaganda the other
hospira is for their own propaganda and
the word means explanation the tacit
assumption is that everything we do is
so obviously right that all we have to
do is explain it to people so
and then they'll understand why we're
actually exactly right and that hospira
campaign it does work among the American
intellectuals and Western European
intellectuals generally as for the
populations it's an open question I
should say even on the rejection ism
although it's almost a hundred percent
supported by the educated sectors and
the media and so on of course it's not
cold that the facts are always
suppressed it's not a month population
roughly two-thirds of the population is
in favor of the Arab League plan
normalization of relations within the
international borders basically the
international consensus but as usual
public opinion has almost no effect on
policy it's an interesting fact about
American democracy it's in fact a matter
of principle there's kind of principal
reasons which go back to James Madison
or why that has to be the case and it
clearly is the case and the public knows
it so about ninety-five percent of the
public objects that public opinion is
not taken into account by the government
but you know there are two legged beasts
to they don't really understand
important things the but that's part of
the control about the civilians popping
out of holes may I even pull that
straight out of Nazi propaganda British
propaganda during the Revolutionary War
in fact any Imperial War I mean any
invading imperial power would be
delighted if resistance if people who
are resisting put on uniforms and stood
out in an open field so they could be
destroyed by overwhelming military force
and they get very upset when Minutemen
and others don't accept these rules they
should be wearing red coats like the
Hessian soldiers British mercenaries so
sure that's standard I mean what's
interesting is that I think he said air
langer could even repeat such nonsense
without collapsing and ridicule
about Iran that's we don't know the
details but the reports are interesting
they do indicate two things one that the
u.s. barred Israel from overflying Iraq
which would make it very difficult for
them to attack Iran and the other aspect
is that they apparently admitted that
they're carrying out terrorist actions
inside Iran that's not the first time
that's been evidence of that for some
time including major terrorist acts from
from Pakistan and Afghanistan but again
that's normal for an out outlaw State
the failure to the lack of support for
an Israeli attack is interesting I mean
I think it's pretty clear that Israel
does not want that the United States
does not want Israel to attack Iran that
could lead to a major conflagration with
huge effects for American troops for oil
supplies everything else it wasn't much
discussed but there was a resolution
congressional resolution debated in the
house HR 362 I think it was which called
for the u.s. to and put in effect impose
a blockade on Iran bar shipping in the
Gulf and so on it had an enormous
support a pack the Israeli Lobby was
passionately and supportive with pulling
out all the strings it initially had
some very overwhelming congressional
support but it was voted down it was
voted down in part thanks to lobbying by
the anti-war movement which is hardly a
massive lobby in the United States but
it was voted down mainly because the US
government didn't want it and the lobby
consistently slinks away silently when
it comes into conflict with us power for
good reasons they know they haven't got
a chance and they want to harm
themselves and this past very calmly as
well any other such cases as for
Oh marked he did say in basically in his
resignation speech had to resign because
of charges of corruptions so he resigned
and still in office but basically resign
and he did make a speech at didn't make
a speech he had an interview in the
press at that time and which he withdrew
all of his earlier positions all of them
and said that Israel must accept the
international consensus as to withdraw
from the occupied territories and maybe
a some shit modification of borders
agreed upon mutual modification agreed
upon by both sides in fact he went back
to the essentially futaba proposals
which as I say were almost realized
except that Israel block them at the end
that was his resignation speech and it's
interesting it shows that he understood
and as you say it was followed very
shortly by rejection of possibilities of
political settlement crucial rejection
several times and the US Israeli
invasion of Gaza which is now underway
you can make of all of that what you
want professor Chomsky you've almost
entirely glossed over the numerous war
crimes and violations of international
law which have committed by Hamas the
ruling party in Gaza these include this
targeting of civilian populations by
sending thousands of rockets into
southern Israel and Hamas is well
documented use of human shields by doing
things like hiding their armaments in
preschools ambulances and hospitals I
was wondering if you had a response to
these crimes yeah well actually I did
talk about the first as I pointed out
Israel's Hamas is targeting of Israeli
civilian targets yeah that's there's a
criminal act as well as politically
stupid but and therefore I think it
would make good sense for us to stop our
enormous
military diplomatic an ideological
support for from us okay that's what we
can do about it of course these crimes
like Hershel Greene spun's are like
those of the partisans during the Second
World War it didn't come out of nowhere
these are a reaction to ongoing Israeli
crimes gnarly in Gaza but extensively in
the West Bank and those who have another
proposal as to what come assorted is
what resistance ought to take do have a
moral ground to moral grounds to
criticize those actions okay just as
those in Germany who were calling for an
end to Nazi aggression you know they
couldn't because they did killed but
we're free to do it here would have had
a justification in condemning the
terrorism of the partisans they didn't
have a justification for supporting the
Gestapo slogan a terror against terror
you commit their will commit worst
terror the only people in Germany who
had a right to criticize the terror that
they were attacking were those who were
trying to stop the far greater
atrocities of the Nazis same with
cristal knock same with many other cases
the same with the American Revolution
I'm in the American you know the
Patriots as we call them with Karen
we're terrorist forces Kerry I mean
those days terrorism wasn't as Extreme
as it is today nor was military conflict
but yeah it was serious I mean that's
why the number of people who fled the
colonies after independence was higher
or approximately the same as the
proportion of the population that fled
Vietnam after after the u.s. withdrew
they fled the terror of the of the
victors I mean there were people fleeing
from Boston Harbor writing pathetic
letters about how they were dying in the
snow and Nova Scotia because they just
had to get away from these terrorists
who won the war this is not a major
theme of American
three you can find the facts if you like
and they had good reason to because yes
nathanael greens forces for example
we're straight to eros forces and of
course the British careful objected to
this how dare they hide you know in
civilian places to shoot at our soldiers
as for the well documented facts that
you mentioned the documentation is zero
the sole sole source for those claims is
Israeli Armed Israeli propaganda maybe
it's true maybe it isn't there it's hard
to imagine where you could hide in Gaza
or live in Gaza except near a civilian
target Israel of course does it all the
time so if you ask where the Israeli
military command is that's right in the
middle of the cities where they going to
put it so sure this even though the
documentation happens to be zero not
well documented nevertheless it's almost
certainly true and it offers no
justification whatsoever for destroying
the university's destroying schools
mental health clinics attacking
hospitals shooting at ambulances all the
other crimes that you can read about if
you want to bother looking and the
crimes are really serious so actually I
brought with me a report which I have
not seen reported in the American press
from the find it from the Gaza water
utility this is January 10th the press
release they described won't bother
reading it but they essentially describe
how hundreds of thousands of people in
Gaza or without water because it is
really a tax on water systems and also
attacks on sewage systems and in fact
power plants which make everything run
so that one discharging pond is leading
to a major catastrophe that threatens
the lives of thousands of people just by
drowning and sewage
flooding well okay sure some Israeli
propagandist can tell you yeah there was
a mortar hidden in the sewage system
maybe there was does that have anything
to do with these atrocities nothing you
know for very simple reasons the ones I
mentioned there is a right to resort to
violence in self-defense if there are no
alternatives and in this case there are
very clear alternatives stop the
criminal activities that except the
peace treaty okay not very hard stop
your crimes metal end the the rocketing
that you're concerned with professor
Chomsky while this may seem obvious
because you've touched on a time and
time again why is it that the US media
appears to completely lap up the
propaganda while appearing to not do any
sort of objective journalism which is
what every single journalists student
has you know study to do what in the
world is going on well for one thing I
think I'm in the US meteor just as good
as any others if I had one newspaper in
the world to read I couldn't read any
other pics New York Times doesn't you
know I don't love it as you know and the
reporters themselves not so much in the
case of Israel but in many cases are
courageous honest you know they report
what's before their eyes objective if
you like but very typically consistently
within a framework of interpretation
that's subordinated this state corporate
propaganda that's unconscious and it's
true of the intellectual community
generally but I mean I one of those are
right about the media is because easier
to study the New York Times
systematically then say to study
academic scholarship systematically
that's a huge effort beyond my resources
but it's basically the same you know
there are many differences
it's the same in the general educated
population we can be there is an
assumption that the u.s. cannot do
anything wrong it can make mistakes but
can't do anything wrong individuals may
do things wrong like there may be a bad
apple here and there but we can't do
anything wrong as a people so it takes a
the invasion of Iraq Barack Obama is
praised even by the left for what's
called his principled opposition to the
Iraq war what was his principled
opposition basically we can't get away
with it he says it was a strategic
blunder okay you go back to Providence
when the Russians were invading
Afghanistan there are plenty of people
saying it's a strategic blunder we don't
call that principled opposition to the
war after Stalingrad there were plenty
of Nazi generals who say look was a
state blundered open a two front war are
they principled opponents of the Nazis I
mean the very idea that this is called
principled opposition is a very
interesting insight into our own
intellectual and moral culture it's
totally unprincipled it's based on
nothing except cost to us and maybe
there's a couple of words about you know
I don't like civilian casualties but it
is very hard to find any principled
opposition in the culture in the
intellectual culture generally and it's
also true of things that go way back I
said pace they take the Vietnam War
amazing you know dreams of material on
that but try to find a principle
criticism of it in the mainstream if you
look at the literature of say diplomatic
history today or anything that goes way
back you find two positions there the
hawks who say with more force we could
have won and there the doves who say it
was a lost cause which was a mistake say
take take Arthur Schlesinger this
leading American historian Kennedy
advisor and
one of the most outspoken does it did
become his strong supporter the war
under Kennedy to the extent that he paid
any attention to it at all effective
paid almost no attention to it even
though Kennedy did directly attack South
Vietnam and carried out many atrocities
but if you look in schlesinger's
journals which just appeared almost
day-to-day record of everything he did
there's even a mention of Vietnam until
the Johnson years there's a lot about
swimming pools and who jumped in naked
and that sort of thing but nothing about
the Vietnam but by you know 1966-67 he
was like others becoming critical of the
war and he wrote a book which is
considered one of the important
criticisms of the war it's called bitter
heritage it was very explicit you know
nothing hidden he described his
controversy with his friend Joseph Alsop
major journalist it was a strong
supporter of the war and Schlesinger
said something like this she said we all
pray that mr. Alsup is right and that
with more force you know the surge of
the day we will be able to win victory
in a land of wreck and ruin with
everything destroyed and so on and so
forth that's what we all pray but it
probably won't work and then he said if
mr. Alsup is right and we do win victory
in this devastated land we will all be
praising the wisdom and statesmanship of
the American government it wasn't ironic
he meant it you know and yes that's the
attitude of liberal does that's why when
US casualties decline in Iraq you know
people say well you know maybe it really
was a success okay killed a million
people drove millions out of the country
destroyed the society left it as a total
ruin ok but not too many American
casualties and the big problem is
they're not doing what we say you know
they're not all there is mass nonviolent
resistance interact actually a major
triumph of nonviolent resistance has
compelled the invaders to back down from
there at least in words will live up to
from their major goals okay but who
describes things that way where can you
find a principal criticism and this is
not a critique of the press because the
press are reflecting the educated
culture they're reflecting the mentality
of Harvard MIT Yale so on that's the
culture from which they come and i think
the reporting is very accurate in fact
it a large part of what I've written is
actually defense of the press for its
professionalism and objectivity you may
know the book that Edward Herrmann and I
wrote called manufacturing consent it's
about the media there's a lot of
condemnation of the book but nobody
looks at it that's this material not
allowed to look at it doesn't keep the
party line but a large part of if
anybody wants to look at it is a
detailed analysis of media coverage
after the of the Tet Offensive Tet
Offensive is crucially important event
and after the Tet Offensive Freedom
House you know great defender of freedom
published two thick volumes denouncing
the press for their lack of patriotism
because they didn't report the Tet
Offensive in a manner glorifying the
United States sufficiently gone straight
out of Stalinist Russia that's freedom
house two volumes one of commentary one
of documents and they claimed the volume
commentary you know condemned the press
for being on the side of the Viet Cong
and hating America and all the usual
stuff there was a volume of kind of
documents that supposed to back it up
well you know I carried out the heinous
act of actually reading the documents
the volume of documents completely
refuted everything that they said in the
volume of commentary line by line if you
want details look at the book we went
through it and we concluded that
contrary to the Freedom House Stalinist
style attack the press was very
courageous competent accurate people
described what they said but entirely
within the framework of us doctrine you
know us propaganda so like everything
we're everything we're trying to do is
right and noble but you know we just had
to destroy half the place because what
the choice willows choices we have but
it's described accurately now it's
interesting that the media hated that
defense of their objectivity and
professionalism that would much rather
be portrayed the way Freedom House
portrayed them and it's stolen a style
attack as traitors you know challenging
us already so on and so forth they like
that what they don't like is you're
doing your job very competently and
courageously but you're completely
subservient to propaganda and the party
line nobody likes that so that part of
the book can't be read but yeah I think
it's generally true and I think those
are the reason I mean there are other
reasons to like the media after all our
big corporations you know selling the
product audiences to other corporations
that surely hasn't effect and so on I
forget which side you've said a lot
about sources that you've cited versus
propaganda from various governments and
I'm I imagine that a lot of the
propaganda is written to look very
similar to what you're citing as
appropriate sources and to act like
facts and my question is how do you
personally differentiate between facts
and facts like how do you decide what
you want to trust her you an MIT student
yes because you've taken science versus
yes how do you decide what to believe
it's the same in this case you know you
don't believe every paper you see in the
journals because some of them don't seem
to make sense and if they don't you look
back and see whether their data correct
and are the sources right was the
doctor who wrote it in the pay of the
drug companies and so on and so forth
sure that's the same here you just used
the normal common sense that you use
when your act as a scientist I'm it's a
little different and in the case of
Public Affairs and science I mean mother
nature is a hard taskmaster asst but she
doesn't purposely put up barriers in the
way of understanding okay as when you're
reading say the press or academic work
and so on but it's pretty on the other
hand it's a lot easier in the case of
Public Affairs because it's all on the
surface now there's no series to speak
of and try to find a theory in
international relations theory what's
called a theory is laughable there's a
you read just what's called Just War
theory I could go through details if you
like well what it comes down to is I
believe you know that's why every
argument runs and so it's all on the
surface everything that I talked about
today is on the surface you can check it
it's just you know like bear data if you
don't think it's right look it up that's
why I continually said verify very
simple you'll find plenty of propaganda
like a couple of examples that I've read
but you can also find the facts and you
can make your your own mind it's way
easier than in the sciences in that
respect though harder and that you have
to overcome barriers but there's no
special tricks I think you know them all
if you've taken science courses
perfect professor some chomsky good
afternoon in your opinion what is the
responsibility of the Arab League the
response with who the Arabic there is
particularly the neighboring countries
like Lebanon Syria Jordan and even the
oil-producing countries like Saudi
Arabia and going back to Lebanon why do
you think as well as and took any action
firm action yet either like tactical
action or I mean you just they just talk
to speeches thank you well with regard
to Hezbollah I mean I'm not privy to
their internal thinking but I can guess
that the reason they're not reacting is
they know if they do Lebanon gets turned
into a journal house remember Israel has
a repeat what I said armed air armed and
air force greater larger in scale and
technologically more advanced than any
native power outside the US and if they
unleash it against lebanon okay as for
the Arab League they've taken mixed
positions for example Prince Turkey
office if I saw one of the leading
figures in Saudi Arabia and one of those
considered the most moderate you know
pro-american he gave a very powerful
speech at the Gulf forum a couple of
days ago and which he bitterly condemned
the US israeli invasion said we're all
palestinians now we have to martyr
ourselves to defend the palestinians we
should do it now the government's aren't
doing much but exactly what are they
supposed to do they've got a controller
on populations which is hard it's one of
the reasons the US send some armaments
tons of armaments and in fact Israel has
always been regarded as part of the
defense of the ruling clerics against
their populations but first of all
they're not inclined to oppose us power
because they more or less except agree
with it for themselves they have no use
for the Palestinians of the population
does and even if they wanted to do
something there's not much you can do
you know it's pretty hard to stand up
against the Godfather it is
international about the only theory i
know of international relations theory
that's moral that's not trivial or
obviously false is that international
relations is very much like the Mafia
and the Godfather does not Brook
disobedience and has plenty of ways of
reacting to it and you take your fate in
your hands if you do something like vote
in a election of the way the master
doesn't want well on it interfere in
some fashion so you know I don't like
their position at all but it's pretty
hard to blame and you mentioned one of
the one of the reasons for the strong us
support of Israel being and the military
base that they provide us in the Middle
East and it seems that the more support
we give to Israel the less secure the
area really is a week the less popular
America seems to be in that region and I
don't know if there's a point at which
that will actually are supportive Israel
actually undermine our security so my
real question is can you shed any more
light on other reasons that America is
so strongly allied with Israel other
places it says strongly aligned no other
reasons that US is so strongly allied
with Israel besides it being just the
best place to park our tanks so
supportive oh I see me yeah well yeah
its causes plenty of anti-american
feeling among the population but yeah
nobody cares about that as long as
they're under control and that goes long
before way way back long before us
support for Israel I'm in u.s. support
for Israel as I mentioned it was always
there but it became really strongly
Alliance was really established in 1967
well 10 years before that in 1958 which
happened to be a pretty turbulent period
there President and Eisenhower inquired
with his staff this is a secret that's
been
public for a long time he asked though
why is there such a campaign of hatred
against us in the Arab world among the
people not the government's the
government's mostly go along with but
why is there such a campaign of hatred
against us among the people that's
George Bush's why do they hate us and
there was a response there was an
analysis which had just been produced by
the National Security Council the
highest Planning Council which explained
the reasons it said there is a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States opposes democracy and
development and supports Tara knees
because the United States wants to get
control of our energy sources and it
said basically the perception is correct
and that's what we ought to be doing
okay because okay so there's a campaign
of hatred against us but as long as
we've got what we want what are we here
you know I mean back to the Mafia done I
mean maybe the people on the street hate
him you know long as in the runners
affairs who cares about the two-legged
Beast and that remains true and that
Israel was not an issue at that time but
after after nine eleven one newspaper to
its credit the Wall Street Journal did a
study of opinions and among Muslims not
all Muslims just the ones they cared
about what they called money Muslims
like managers of you know multinational
corporations and lawyers and people like
that just and this is after Bush's why
do they hate a speech and they did an
analysis of what the opinion was and
they found the same answers not
opposition to you know globalization or
capitalism but so called capitalism or
us power or anything in fact the right
in the middle of it that said that they
found overwhelmingly pretty much with
the NSC reported in 1958
they oppose the u.s. support for brutal
autocracies its opposition to democracy
and development because of its interest
to gain control of our resources now by
19 by 2001 they added other reasons one
of them was US involvement in a crushing
of the Palestinians and the second
another topic we're not allowed to talk
about here was the sanctions against
Iraq which were Jenna Seidel no I mean
Clinton probably killed more Iraqis than
Saddam Hussein and they protested
against that well it's kind of like off
the agenda here but the reasons well I
mentioned some of the reasons I'll just
go over it again one is two major
military base 2 is what I quoted from US
intelligence back in 58 it's a logical
corollary of us opposition to Arab
nationalism to support Israel as the
only reliable base in the region third
is it's a very closely integrated with
the US high-tech France big part of the
US economy we got to know that at MIT
when microsoft and HP and those guys are
in love with israel that has an effect
on policy and of course they are in love
with it as you can just tell by
investment patterns for good reasons you
know it's a nice relationship and same
another respect it's a there's an
ideological connection especially among
intellectuals since nineteen sixty seven
since israel's victory there are other
reasons that go sort of deep in the
culture what Israel's doing has been
doing resonates pretty well with our own
history I mean the you know forcible and
violent displacement of the two-legged
Beast and settlement by a superior race
that's American history very explicit
American history back to the 17th
century
very explicit and the same is true of
the providential ISM look back over
American history and American culture a
very strong theme all right to the
present and you know including people
who call themselves secular is that
everything that's happening is
fulfilling God's will God has a has a
plan for the universe and we're filling
it we're carrying out a mission by
wiping out the indigenous population by
stealing their lands by conquering half
of Mexico you know evading Vietnam
whatever it may be we're fulfilling the
divine mission it's providential ISM
very strong theme in u.s. culture all
the way back and it's very similar in
Israel if you read them take to say the
book that I mentioned the book on the
settlement it's a very valuable book one
of its main a lot of it is concerned
with the thinking of the major groups of
the settlers go shamu name who are not
marginal in Israel in fact they're
highly honored as capturing the real
essence of Israel and Zionism and what
it is and it's basically providential
asst by settling every inch of the land
we are carrying out God's will we're
bringing the Messiah if you think
Ahmadinejad is extreme you ought to read
American history and the ideology the
settler that's I don't know how to
measure it but I suspect that this
resemblance between our own history what
we call our own history and Israel's
settlement replacement of the two-legged
Beast by a superior race is probably
significant and it's inside in the
United States it's not it's not the
right wing you read this in Walt Whitman
for example then amerson people like
that so there are plenty of reasons and
they may not be good reasons but
certainly not insignificant
and when Israel goes against US policy
us stops them of course the case I
mentioned about attacking Iran is one
but there are many others dr. Chomsky
I'm Jim Schneider i sell the herald in
the globe in front of a donut shop in
Bunker Hill Mall in Charlestown I was
wondering if you had a chance to notice
the october sixth article in the oil and
gas journal which describes the
delineation of some super giant oil
fields off the coast of israel and there
also and i also say that it's an arc
that goes from Syria follows the coast
of Israel and then goes over to Egypt
and what's kind of embarrassing is to
look at this full color chart on the
first page and there's a nice the
positive higher-quality condensates
under Gaza but there's no reference in
the article that the Palestinian
Authority is going to have any access to
whatever monies are derived from what
offshore territorial rights they would
have I guess evidently they don't have
any because the you can if you can have
a the Israeli Navy off the coast well
you probably can't have your own oil
field business but they found 15 billion
barrels of oil and a hundred trillion
cubic feet of gas so far but nobody
seems to mention that he knew it's about
well it's about rockets and it's about
who killed whose kids first it's not
about dirty old oil especially if it's a
hell of a lot of it you know I'm kind of
skeptic I didn't read that article but
there has been reporting and reporting
but there are plenty of studies about
that and it's been known for a long time
that there are a gas and oil mostly gas
i think i think as you said mostly gas
resources off the coast of Gaza not much
off of Israel or they would have
exploited but I frankly doubt that
there's much to do with what's going on
I mean it's suppose that the United
States stopped its rejection ISM and
permitted weak defenseless unarmed
palestinian state to survive and accord
with the national consensus they'd have
no trouble getting that oil yeah thank
you sir they don't have to let Israel
conquer it to do the fact they probably
get it more easily from a Palestinian
state than from Israel which is strong
enough to have its own interest suicide
doubt very much that that's a factor in
what's going on professor Chomsky given
the fact that there are dozens of
schools in the Boston area and over at
least over a hundred thousand students
that could pretty easily organize
themselves would you support an area
divestment campaign divesting university
and college funds in those businesses
that are doing business with Israel on
the model of the south african
anti-apartheid part I divestment
campaign I'm not hearing very well I'm
afraid would you support a divestment
campaign publicly on the model of the
South African boy huh yeah well that
Naomi Klein is cadet analogy is brought
up a lot but I'd urge you to pay some
serious attention to the South African
boy could it was important and it had an
effect but look at when it had an effect
on the South African and there was an
academic boycott of South Africa back in
the 60s but on very narrow grounds
because the universities were excluding
lags okay so you know it didn't want to
support racist universities but that
doesn't work in this case the the real
boycott that you know began to be a mass
movement with effects was mostly in the
1980s that was after decades of serious
education and organizing it was at a
time when American business was opposed
publicly opposed to apartheid when
congressional resolutions were
condemning apart height when mayor's
were getting arrested
you know protesting this in that by the
time you had really mass public
opposition to apartheid yes then you
could have a boycott movement but that
preliminary work has not been done and a
call for you know a call for a boycott
is a tactical move it's not a principled
move it's a tactic you know I have to
ask what its consequences are and I
think if you think through the
consequences before you've done the work
the educational organizing work and
probably backfire it'll be just you know
screams about anti-semitism more support
for Israeli atrocities and so on so take
a look at the history it's worth looking
at incidentally by the 80s it did get to
the point where Congress passed
legislation and barring a US trade with
South Africa that's very different from
where we are now where Congress almost
unanimously supports every Israeli
atrocity that comes along with Dennis
Kucinich to other people voting against
it also it's worth remembering that the
Reagan administration violated the
Congressional legislation and in fact
trade with South Africa increased after
the legislation and at the peak of of
the administration that's Reagan Colin
Powell and the rest as late as 1988 just
right before the collapse of apartheid
the US the Pentagon Palace Pentagon
declared that the African National
Congress was one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world that's
Nelson Mandela in the African National
Congress in Colin Powell's Pentagon 1988
in fact Mandela was on the terrorist
list until a couple of months ago they
finally took him off because the African
National Congress was a terrorist
organization that did carry out terror
doubtedly and I'm don't know the South
African literature but i'm sure they
condemned it for you know hiding in
public places and not standing out in a
field with uniforms so they could be
shot down and so on and so forth so yes
I think it's something to think about
that also to think about see in fact if
we could ever get to the point where you
had enough active activism and
organization to even think about a boy
cut you could do something much simpler
get the u.s. to join the international
consensus as the majority the population
already wants them to do then talk about
the way good so I don't think it's a it
just doesn't seem to me like a sensible
tactic that's quite apart from any
question of principle professor Chomsky
I just had a two-part question what the
first part of the question is what
exactly is the planned outcome is
Israel's plan to come after the recent
bombings and recent action against the
Gaza Strip and post-invasion do they are
they really after just disarming Hamas
is military wing or do they have a
complete coupland and also my second
question is where could people find
reliable death tolls and information
about destruction in Gaza and in Israel
because I see you know a variety of
numbers being thrown around about how
many thousands of rockets are launched
into Israel but I never see much of a
death toll associated with the thousands
of rockets I'm not sure really what
their capacity is and you know some
people say that they're resembling of
bottle rockets I don't know but I'd like
to know more about them and I'd like to
see if there is legitimately collateral
damage in being you know conducted in
Palestine or if it is in fact overkill
well you know I don't think there's any
question that its massive
overkill let me just look at the
official casualty figures in the current
invasion the latest i saw it's coming
close to a thousand palestinians which
is almost undoubtedly and under estimate
because they don't count people who died
because you know they starve or can't
get water or can't go to a hospital and
so on and i think i don't know i think
there's like a maybe half a dozen
israeli soldiers or something like that
some of them killed by friendly fire I
mean you can't talk about overkill you
know we're out of that League for
reliable information about the questions
you're asking the best place I know to
look is in the major Israeli human
rights group of Attila which has regular
publications in English pamphlets you
can find them on the web be ' TSE LEM
and they give very two dishes careful
analyses of everything that's going on
as to the numbers killed by the Rockets
in the last year's I mean you know I
forgot the exact number maybe it doesn't
or something like that and it's just you
know this but you can find them and as
for numbers of rockets well you can find
them to like I quoted the figure 7700
shells attacking northern Gaza before
the onslaught in July in jun 19 2013
2006 that comes from Human Rights Watch
and you know they do analysis one
information on white phosphorus it's
coming from Human Rights Watch which is
which tends to be pretty supportive of
Israel incidentally no although they do
good work but it's elemis best source i
know has to israel's plans well maybe
you know I told you what I think about
the reasons for the invasion and I
presume that's correct that the plans
are to
make those reasons work the plan is to
get quiet peace and quiet quiet at a
graveyard if has to be which will enable
Israel to carry out its criminal acts on
the west bank with us support and
without any air feirense I presume
that's the plan thanks
