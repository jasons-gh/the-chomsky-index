my way and I learned that just my second
visit here I was here 30 years ago
apparently a lot of talk since then
since Michael mentioned the 14th
amendment I might add another fact about
it that's worth bearing in mind the 14th
amendment which essentially repeats the
wording of the fifth amendment and
extends it to States says that no person
can be deprived of life or Liberty
without due process of the law and as
Michael said it was passed to apply the
intention was to apply it to free slaves
that was virtually never applied to free
swift slaves
almost entirely to corporations the
wording of the first the fifth and the
Fourteenth Amendment is problematic it
refers to persons and it was quickly
understood that that won't work the
normal meaning of person is somebody
like you but that won't work it's too
narrow and too broad so the courts over
the years have modified it both narrowed
it and extended they've extended it in
the way that Michael Mansion about a
century ago the courts determined that
corporations and fictitious legal entity
is established by the state or persons
and over the years they've gotten more
and more rights by now rights waving on
persons of flesh and blood but it's also
too broad because it included
take it literally it includes people who
don't have citizenship and we certainly
can't agree to allow those creatures to
have human rights so the courts over the
years have narrowed the notion person so
it doesn't include those human-like
creatures who don't happen to have
formal citizenship so it's both extended
and broaden and both in ways which are I
think we should recognize to be deeply
anti human flight apart from the literal
meaning of the word person well the
topic that was announced is a very broad
scope I can't possibly even try to do
justice to it oh we can you can bring up
many other phenomenon events and so on
that fall within the range of the topic
later I'll just talk about a few I
actually want to focus on just two
places that are of particular
significance right now and both of which
have a lot to do with social justice and
people centered society one of them is
Madison Wisconsin the others Cairo and
different parts of the world but the
same issues are being addressed actually
in quite different ways and the
difference between those two ways ought
to be of considerable concern to us I
think the rant of that the two cities
were brought together
just a couple of days ago I come
al-abbas he's a leader of the long and
hard struggles of Egyptian workers for
and the ways in which they're both
similar and crucially different and the
differences ought to be a matter of
concern to us they were brought together
a couple of days ago by Kemal Abbas he's
a leader of the Egyptian workers
movement of contrary to what you might
think the uprising didn't begin January
25th and going on for years there's been
a long hard struggle for workers rights
and other rights and Egypt and repressed
by violence he's also one of the leaders
of the January 25th movement this
spectacular movement that developed in
the last couple of weeks which is
historically almost unique maybe unique
he sent a message to Madison and rich to
Wisconsin workers in which he said we
stand with you as you stood with us and
he's quite right to appeal to the notion
of solidarity and it's the core element
of the union movement for 150 years and
it's the is the traditional driving
force he's also right to compare the
Egyptian and the u.s. struggles for my
labor rights a little so for a democracy
and to link them together because
they're very close
the intertwine and always have it
everywhere Egypt the United States
generally the labor movement has almost
always been right at the forefront of
struggles were to preserve and expand
democracy and human rights not just
labor rights civil rights almost
everything and that remains true today
well right now the trajectories of the
Egyptian and US labor movement are
crossing but they're moving in different
directions the in Egypt they're moving
towards gaining rights that have been
denied in the United States they're
focused on defending rights that had
been won and are being attacked have
lost so we're crossing and we're going
the wrong way they were going the right
way
the it's worth taking a look at each of
these cases let me say something about
each of them starting with Egypt the
January 25th uprising as I'm sure you
know was sparked by tech-savvy young
people from what's called the April 6th
movement what's not too well-known is
that the April 6 movement takes its name
from a labor struggle in April 6 2008
it's not the first but
a major strike planned and the major
textile industry that Mahalo textile
industry one of the biggest industries
were on April 6 there were also
substantial solidarity actions planned
from the community and elsewhere the
they had won some local rights in the
past but the April 6th actions were
crushed by state power state violence
and nevertheless Mahalo became in the
words of not a montage the young woman
who Palestinian woman actually who
studies the labor rights and labor
movement in Egypt and has worked in
Mahalo as she says that
Mahalo then became a symbol of revolt
and challenge to the regime and a number
of ways the early labor struggles had a
kind of narrow focus on wages working
conditions and so on and by the time of
the April 6th events that were crushed
by the state they had expanded to a
minimum wage for all Egyptians and to
the formation of a an independent unions
board by the regime they still haven't
gained the an independent union like the
Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker or
the Koch brothers fundin and the
business work gent world generally they
understand that this is a real danger if
the labor movement goes beyond saying
five cents more an hour and it's talking
about the rights of the population in
general and the right to act
independently to associate independently
to organize then the consequences for
expanding democracy are quite real and
power systems in general state of
private do not want democracy extended
for pretty good reasons that tends to
threaten privilege and that's in fact
that what we're seeing that right now
actually that's is very very important
part of American labor history
take a look say at the United States in
Canada - very similar societies the
United States has a completely
dysfunctional healthcare system
international scandal that's about twice
the per capita costs of every other of
comparable countries the outcomes are
among the poorest it's the primer it's
the main source of the famous deficit
that we're supposed to worry about if we
had a health system like other
comparable countries we'd actually have
a budget surplus at this point the other
half of the health
as military spending it's about as much
as the rest of the world combined and if
you look at the discussion about the the
help of the deficit which is you know
flaming all over the place there are two
things that aren't mentioned namely its
causes the causes are first military
spending and secondly the dysfunctional
health care system and it's not utopian
to imagine that we could have a
healthcare system like like other other
societies that are similar to us the one
of them is Canada back around the 1950s
the unions in the United States and
Canada that went in different directions
with regard to health care the American
unions which had been already somewhat
tamed didn't take the concept solidarity
very seriously
they got health care for themselves so
the UAW workers were able to get pretty
good health packages for themselves in a
bargain with corporations and they were
naive enough to think that the
management of the corporations we keep
the bargain come to that later they
didn't it Canada was different the same
unions very same unions tried wanted to
get health care for everyone and in fact
they won so Canada has a functioning
health care system for everyone that the
United States does not we have a
virtually unregulated privatized system
which is
hopelessly inefficient of bureaucratized
a huge administrative costs profit
essentially leaning to the consequence
that we have today twice as much twice
per capita expenses and poor outcomes
well that's one of the meanings of
solidarity that's one of the reasons why
Scott Walker and his backers and others
are trying very have been trying very
hard to prevent unions from have been
informed unless they can be properly
tamed just disciplining the workforce
and not doing anything else and that's
not easy to sustain so unions are a
constant enemy not just as you might
recall that on its way to Egypt to Cairo
2009 to give his famous speech
addressing the Muslim world and
President Obama a lot of fanfare about
that there was less reporting of the
press conference that he had on the way
to Egypt he was asked at the press
conference with her he would say
anything about what the report called
the authoritarian regime in Egypt that's
pretty much an understatement one of the
worst most brutal dictatorships of the
Arab world and there's 28 competitions I
said he would not talk about that he
said he said I don't like to use labels
for folks when a political leader uses
the word folks you wait for the lie
that's coming along otherwise
when you're talking about folks
something's being set up so he didn't
like to use labels for folks he said
that marks a good man he's doing good
things for you he's keeping it stable
he's good Ally so I'm not going to
criticize him that was not very long ago
2009 and it's consistent with
traditional support for dictatorships
it's not just only on the part of the
United States but other powerful states
as well there are analogs that's what I
said about the mahalo strike in the
April April 6th workers movement is
supported operated by Joel Heyman he's
the leading US academic specialist on
Egyptian labor teachers at Stanford and
he points out that after recently that
after many years of struggle workers in
Egypt had come to know when you trust
each other form the bonds of solidarity
and were able to mobilize rapidly and in
fact that's what happened after January
25th a couple of days later they
mobilized rapidly they joined the
January 25th movement these amazing
events in tougher to square or in other
cities and Egypt and at that point that
I was basically cast the military high
command shifted its position that pull
Mubarak the dictator that the time has
come
to disappear off to Saudi Arabia enjoy
yourself for the rest of your life and
that was an Obama went along with that
and that was really a major victory for
the democracy movement and extremely
courageous and quite remarkable movement
it's hard to think of counterparts they
want to be a victory but there are
plenty of barriers that remain internal
ones and external ones as far as the
internal ones are concerned if you look
at Egypt and the same is true Tunisia in
other places that the military still in
command it in fact has been running the
country since 1952 now in a different
form and they're not going to give up it
actually this splits in the military
wouldn't be too surprising to see it an
officer's coup overthrowing the high
command that's what happened in 1954 in
nature the high command is pretty much
disliked by the officer corps there
militarily totally incompetent they're
not military leaders and they're
businessmen corrupt businessmen who
owned a large part of the economy that
deeply involved with the business elite
that's been robbing the country blind
particularly during the neoliberal
period in west 30 years or so and
they're not the high command's not going
to give up its holdings easily nor will
the rest of the business elite and those
are significant internal
problems and they're helped by external
problems the u.s. position on Egypt in
the last couple of weeks is extremely
familiar I mean there's case after case
where it's over the past years where
it's become impossible for one or
another reason to maintain a favored
dictator in power and maybe the army
turns against him or business glasses
turned against him of this like it's too
much of you know people's power in the
streets and you've got to do something
and there's a standard procedure in that
case you support the dictator up to the
last minute as long as possible when it
becomes impossible send about the pastor
issue ringing declarations about how
you've always been on the side of the
people of democracy we love freedom and
so on and try to restore as much of the
existing system as possible maybe
there's a couple of new names that's
happened over over Marcos in Philippines
division Haiti Trenton South Korea
during the Reagan years Suharto in
Indonesia under Clinton just a case
after case and what's being played out
now far as Washington planning is
concerned is pretty much the same and
it's not just Washington remembered
Washington the United States having to
be the biggest player we're you know the
super fellow but us analyze behavior
exactly the same way so in northwest
Africa its France that's the main agent
supporting the dictators and in fact if
you look at the current wave of
uprisings in throughout the Arab world
the one that made the headlines was -
this year was surprising throughout the
dictator at West Western back dictator
now there France was the primary outside
agent involved and maintaining
supporting the dictatorship and had to
go through this routine but it actually
started a couple of weeks earlier in
Western Sahara Western shower isn't
talked about much but it was a Spanish
colony it was due for a decolonization
under UN auspices but and this was
supposed to happen in the 1970s the
period of decolonization but Morocco
invaded it crushed the subways Western
our independence movement
pretty brutal and they invasion it's
been brutal repression and occupation
since but the independence movement
still survived the last November there
was a peaceful and nonviolent movement
to try to call once again for the
independence that technically has been
guaranteed but
nations of tent city set up and so on
Moroccan army swept did and crushed it
killed people and so on there was brutal
enough so that it made it to the United
Nations and there was an effort to try
to at least have a you an inquiry into
what happened but that was crushed by
France France blocked that we're usually
the one who blocked actions of the
Security Council the Sun was friends
supporting Morocco there that their
favorite dictatorship than these former
French colonies regions but mainly it's
we're the ones who were carrying out
these actions with their allies and
support well in this case the there is
an external this is a major external
force the United States and its allies
are very are going to do just about
anything they can to prevent a democracy
from spreading in the Arab world at
least if it's anything more than just
formal democracy but maybe we permit and
Central America or something it's real
democracy democracy in which the popular
opinion will have a significant effect
on policy but that can't be tolerated
and there's a very good breezy to find
out why all you have to do is look at
the studies of public opinion in the
Arab world now they exist they don't get
reported but they exist they're taken by
major Western polling agencies released
by prestigious institutions a major one
was released by the Brookings
Institution last August not reported
surely known to intelligence agencies
planners and so on now what they should
be they explain very clearly why
democracy is intolerable in the Middle
East in fact here to look for similar
reasons but in the Middle East it would
be a catastrophe it turns out that about
you know by overwhelming majorities you
know a 90% of the population in the Arab
world regards the major threat as the
United States in Israel when WikiLeaks
came out you may remember there was a
lot of euphoria big headlines claiming
that the Arab states support us the Arab
support us in our attitude towards you
grant it take a closer look what it
meant is that the Arab dictators
allegedly support us not the population
among the population there are some who
regard to bread as a threat about 10
percent nothing like the United States
and Israel 8090 percent but that's just
the people and who cares about them
as long as the dictators support us
we're fine that's Express that reveals
the general attitude towards democracy
not just in the government and the
Diplomatic Service but in the general
intellectual culture that's why you had
the headlines in the euphoria
population hate us makes no difference
as long as the dictators support us and
that goes way back the fear and contempt
for democracy in elite educated cultured
circles no environment which we live is
very profound and understandable so when
you think about what the consequences of
democracy would be in fact opposition to
US policies in the Arab world it's so
strong that a majority the population
thinks the region would be better off
more secure if it ran had nuclear
weapons to counter the power of the two
major threats the United States and
Israel which are pretty much the same
images for imagine offshoot of us power
well that's the population if you look
at Egypt the figure is even more extreme
more opposition to US policy more
support for Iranian nuclear weapons and
so on well just to bring just a look at
those numbers tells you immediately why
the United States and its allies are
going to pull out all the stops to
prevent any democracy develop
that progress and democracy in the
Middle East region that would mean
unraveling the entire imperial system of
control which because way back and just
crucial to controlling the world that
right after the Second World War
Liberal planners of the Roosevelt Truman
administration recognized that if we can
control them at least we can with its
energy reserves we can control the world
and if we lose control of these energy
resources we're in trouble we're not
going to be able to manage to dominate
the world system and that remains true
under access if the United States was a
100 percent on solar energy it would
still be true because that's the way you
control other countries so this is no
small thing and whatever there is of
course plenty of talk about our yearning
for democracy our love of democracy and
so on and you know maybe the people who
say the word taxes believe it nervous
but in fact it's just for propaganda and
ideology there's a long record about
this not just in the Middle East and has
been well established even by
conservative scholarship was forced to
conceded that the United States supports
democracy just insofar as it contributes
to strategic and economic objectives so
right now for example we calling for a
democracy in Iran but we're going to do
anything possible to block it in areas
that we control and that is systemic
that goes over every administration goes
far back as shared by
allies and so that's the meet the true
meaning of democracy promotion actually
in the case of Egypt there's an earlier
history which may sound exotic now but
it's never talked about but it's great
for you if you go back to the early
American industrial revolution early
part of the 19th century Egypt was at
that time in a pretty good position
pretty well placed to carry out an
industrial revolution of its own Egypt
had a rich agriculture in fact that's
why it was conquered by Napoleon it had
cotton cotton was the kind of oil and
today cotton was the fuel of the early
Industrial Revolution sort of both with
textiles and so on Egypt had its own
cotton quite a lot of it it didn't need
slaves to didn't have to bring in slaves
to cultivate the cotton the way we did
it had what a man deserves but peasants
on the land who would do it
it had a nationalist leader Muhammad Ali
who was committed to trying to carry out
an industrial revolution there was one
difference between fundamental
difference between the United States and
Egypt the United States had won its
independence the Egypt had Egypt was
still under British control the u.s.
wasn't and that made all the difference
the United States was there for
to disregard the precepts for
development that are handed down by the
powerful they're usually transmitted by
economists and they were the same then
as they are now but back then it was
Adam Smith who gave his instructions to
the colonies he he was in favor of
wasn't opposed to their liberation he
said that they have to be economically
rational the American colonies once
liberated I had to follow water nowadays
called neoliberal principles pursue your
comparative advantage ship the
agricultural products and and fish and
fur don't you import fire british
industrial goods which would much higher
quality don't have any tariffs or
anything to try to prevent to try to
produce your own industrial goods and
encouraged on try to gain a monopoly
over the commodities that you have in
abundance like cotton which is than
anyone so don't try to have a monopoly
of cotton and economic theory proves
that it's much better for everyone if
you follow these precepts well the
United States was independent so
therefore it could throw the economists
out the window and do exactly the
opposite of what they Madame Smith and
others prescribed and in fact follow the
path that England itself had followed
for its own development state and every
other
countries followed namely reject all of
these principles is no exception from
England and starting the sixteenth
century up to the Asian Tigers in China
today certainly the United States so the
u.s. established a set up very high
tariffs to block superior British goods
that continued through this textile off
later steel and so on it that was there
was a state directed the economic
development policy it was pretty extreme
it's not even talked about by economic
historians but conquering the national
territory and exterminations population
and slavery that are pretty significant
interferences with the market you know
not discuss much but for ideological
reasons and as far as the cotton was
concerned the u.s. worked very hard to
maintain them near monopoly that's the
reason for the conquest of Texas and the
half of Mexico which were sitting on it
was explicitly to try to gain as much as
close would a monopoly of cotton and the
purpose was to bring England to its feet
River Britain was a big enemy they were
the powerful state they were barring the
u.s. expansion and so on but the
Jacksonian Democratic presidents
hiller bulkin so they recognize that if
we could gain a monopoly of cotton we
could bring Britain to the speed of ions
say that exactly the opposite of what
was proposed then it worked the United
States got a big industrial revolution
Egypt couldn't do that
the British British power quite
explicitly said we're not going to allow
it Lord Palmerston and others said
Britain will not permit any competition
in the eastern Mediterranean and they
were powerful enough to repress it this
is not the only case but it's one of the
many cases where gaining independence
enabled countries to pursue economic
policies that are declared to be
irrational and that succeed instead of
keeping to those that are declared to be
rational we did become the third world
none of the evidence for this is just
overwhelming a few exceptions slight
exceptions here in there but it's
overwhelming and the same is true today
the same precepts are given now by the
World Bank and the IMF and the economics
profession by Adam Smith David Ricardo
and others but pretty much the same I'm
not suggesting any bad faith in an
abstract sense some abstract world that
doesn't exist these precepts could in
fact work but not in the real world in
the real world the opposite is what
works when the UN buy after the second
world war that the United States
essentially displaced written as the
dominant world power including in the
Middle East and the u.s. orders to Egypt
right after the Second World War were
essentially the same as Lord Palmerston
you have to follow neoliberal order now
called neoliberal principles and he was
simply declared that would withhold any
Agers for it
Egypt that kept to those standard rules
the u.s. possibility which of course
doesn't keep to the rules themselves nor
did Britain so the u.s. a protist high
tariffs contrary to the rules in order
to keep Egyptian cotton out that's in
order to maintain the wealth and power
your monopoly of American cotton growers
that still goes on until this moment we
still have huge subsidies and tariffs to
subsidize the cotton industry and others
that's the usual double edged the
economic policy
I like the mantra see we follow free
trade principles if and only if it's
supportive of the power interests of the
dominant sectors here we're helping a
man as far as Egypt it's so easier to
state the third-world country it's
conceivable by now it's hard to imagine
but after almost 200 years but hundred
eighty years but it's conceivable that
Egypt might move on a course of
independent development South Korea did
it not very long ago from an even poorer
position you know there is an earlier
history and it has its consequences for
example right up till the moment this
moment you recall I'm sure that after
9/11 George Bush made a speech in which
he explained why they hate us they hate
our freedom right
that the Pentagon a pentagon study group
defense science word looked into why
they hate us and drew the conclusions
that any rational person who knows
anything about the historical region
would conclude this is they don't hate
our freedoms they hate our policies and
the particular hater policies of
supporting dictatorships blocking
democracy development and doing it
because we want to control their
resources that's what they hate now they
were not saying anything novel back in
the 1950s President Eisenhower was
concerned about what he called the
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and not among the rulers they
were mostly of okay kinda like the
WikiLeaks reservation of revelations
but among the people and the National
Security Council is planning body in
fact issued a study secret then
Declassified some years ago in which
they said yes there's a campaign of
hatred against us because there's a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States supports harsh and brutal
dictators the block's democracy and
development and we do it because we want
to control their energy supplies and it
went went on to say that the perception
is pretty accurate and that's what we
should be doing as long as the dictators
stay in control and that runs right up
to the moment that's the reason for
those
the general reactions to the revelations
on alleged Arab support for US policy
towards Iran dictators have everything
under control don't worry about it
that's fine it's our conception of
democracy and that's what's being
challenged and it's a serious problem
you're not gonna read about it in
commentary but you can be sure that
those are the problems that planners in
the United States and its allies are
really concerned about well let's turn
to the United States Wisconsin and other
places going back a little bit after
World War two by World War two the
United States was in the position of
just overwhelming power and had about
half the world's wealth other industrial
countries that had been destroyed in
comparable security and the Second World
War
got the United States as a depression a
huge state spending huge deficit but
nobody cared because you pay it off with
economic growth and in fact the next
couple of decades again with plenty of
state involvement that's why you have
computers in the internet and flying
airplanes and so on most of it comes
from a state subsidized or state
initiated development there was a period
of tremendous developed a progress
economic progress
that's called by economists the Golden
Age
fifties and sixties a very high growth
unprecedented growth and quite
egalitarian growth so the bottom sector
the public income distribution didn't
out as well as the higher sectors and
furthermore there was progressive
legislation a lot of things the New Deal
legislation was already there it was
preserved the people like Eisenhower for
example if he were alive now I'd he'd be
a Liberal Democrat but if he's way to
the left of the Republican Party his
position was that the New Deal
legislation is firm cannot be touched as
to the honor extended but continued
affecting continued right through the
next administration and Nixon was the
last liberal president and initiated
quite a number of the serious
progressive measures we'll call this a
poll the business community as you can
imagine there was an immediate attack on
the labor movement starting in the
shortly after the second world war but
it really escalated in the mid 70s late
70s there was a backlash to two major
events first of all the activism of the
60s which terrified elites it was
leaning to a democratization of the
society in fact it was called that too
much democracy gonna beat it back those
leaders students only interested in and
there may be collapsing under tuition
debts it should be should recognize that
this started in seventies and it started
as an indoctrination technique a
disciplinary technique you come out of
college within $50,000 dead you're
trapped and it was conscious no economic
reason for not in the countries that are
much poorer than you know
with Mexico a poor country there's quite
a good national university get some
talks there couple months ago
very high-level well if it's free you
know here the public education systems
being systematically destroyed and more
than half the state there's more public
higher education is being funded more by
tuition than by the state that's hitting
the state colleges you're to probably
Bridgewater I don't know I know it's
hitting other ones and of course the
other state universities two in
California the greatest public education
system in the world with this being
carefully and systematically destroyed
by essentially privatizing the major
universities and reducing the others to
vocational schools with support coming
from students and their parents hike
tuition and so on well this starts in
the 70s and it was part of the concern
over what was called it simply called it
the liberal end of the spectrum right
and was much worse at the liberal end of
the spectrum was called the failure of
the institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young that means
the schools the universities the
churches and so on that not carrying out
their task of indoctrinating the young
properly and something is not about that
educational curricula that change the
high tuition as a discipline
and other measures that's what you're
living with and it was the backlash went
way beyond that there was deep concern
about the class treachery of the Nixon
administration mainly his carrying
forward the essentially progressive
policies of the New Deal Great Society
and so on
now that led the real changes not for
one thing that was a huge increase in
lobbying in the early seventies try to
make sure you can trick or patience
control the legislative agenda there
were new think tanks American Enterprise
Institute Heritage Foundation and so on
to try to control the ideological
spectrum there was a sharp change in the
nature of the economy starting from the
mid 70s the economy shifted dramatically
from production to finance at that stage
mid seventies financial institutions
were a small percentage of the corporate
profit and there were no financial
crises because the New Deal regulatory
arrangements were sustaining so no
financial crises and financial
institutions did what they're supposed
to do you know take certain unused funds
and convert them to productive
enterprises because starting in the 70s
had changed radically and now the
financial institutions are mostly there
for speculation games with money and so
on the contributor was nothing to the
economy and it probably Harman but their
growth their increase in power that was
spectacular by the peak right before the
latest crash and they probably had about
40% of corporate profits if not more
from a few percentage in 70s at the same
time that was a hollowing out of
and not that it stopped it was just
being done abroad so for sale or general
like like for whoever it's much cheaper
to produce in Mexico or China or Vietnam
that the produce in the United States so
for the management and the owners it's
the bank's great not so great for
American workers who we call the middle
class you're not allowed to talk about
working-class years and everybody's
middle class but people who in other
countries are called working-class
unless indoctrinated country's
inequality began to rise very sharply as
you all know inequalities extreme in the
United States now inspector the worst
moments of American history there was a
little less known is that that
inequality is mostly traceable to the
top one percent of the population or for
that matter even the top one-tenth of
one percent in that tiny sliver of the
society wealth has increased enormously
skyrocketed since the 1970s and it
didn't happen by accident it happened by
what amounts to a kind of a vicious
cycle as income gets more concentrated
partly through the financial
institutions that yields political power
which lies in the hands of wealth and
the political power in turn leads to
legislation which increases inequality
and that vicious cycle has gone on and
a society in which you know totally out
of balance enormous wealth and the very
top end and pretty much stagnation for
the majority of the population for over
30 years now began in the late seventies
really took off under Reagan and
successors and it's very carefully done
so if you take a look at say the Bush
tax cuts it was devastating the Reagan
himself practically destroyed the
economy when he came in the US was the
world's largest creditor when he left it
was the world's largest debtor tripled
us okay talk about financial
conservatism is hogwash this is the most
everything else but and this was then
continue especially Bush latest Bush the
Bush tax cuts which are now a very
serious burden on the economy were
designed very carefully at the beginning
of the tax cuts 2001 it began with
everyone getting a small check that was
to make everybody feel yeah is this good
for us let's support the tax cut so you
got a couple hundred dollars in the mail
but the they were designed so that the
proportion of the tax cut the benefits
the extreme wealth is delayed keeps
coming in later on when they were paying
attention there by the end it was a
tenure program by the tenth year I think
over half of the tax cuts were going to
top 1% of the population but you don't
notice it then you know that's the idea
and fiscal policy is that corporate
governance policies deregulation the
whole range of government policies were
set up to make this
cycle continued and it has people who
were repeated financial crises once you
start deregulating for almost obvious
reasons the financial institutions gonna
have crises and they did there were
several during the Reagan years Reagan
left office with a major when the worst
since the depression saving the Clinton
left office with a tech bubble crisis
and of course we had the housing bubble
crisis of the last couple of years which
that completely tanked the economy that
has led to depression level standards
for a good part of the population lower
income half for manufacturing workers
it's very unemployment about at
depression levels and worse in some ways
because jobs aren't coming back
under the current financialization
offshoring regime the depression the the
population is beginning behind by
sharply increasing working hours now
well above the earth and by debt went
deeply into debt and by asset inflation
like putting it right into your house
with promises the prices are going to go
up forever well I know there was an
eight trillion dollar disappearance of
wealth starting in 2008 and that's a lot
that's where people's wealth was well
that's what's that's what's been going
on for the past roughly 30 odd years and
it's been combined with its early it's
not a secret so for example in 1978 this
union does crazy condemned the business
leaders are quoted for having chosen to
wage of one-sided class war in this
country a war against working people the
unemployed the poor the minorities the
very young the very old and even many in
the middle class of our society and
having broken and discarded the fragile
unwritten compact previously existing
during a period of growth and progress
yet it was an unwritten compact that was
that compact between unions and
corporations in which the unions took
seriously naively corporations didn't
they were continuing the fight of bitter
class war and when it just became too
costly they want to destroy it now
that's what's happening in Madison well
that's this at the same time over the
past 30 years and parallel to what I
described the costs of campaigning have
shot way up if you want to in effect you
the business press announced a couple of
days ago that the estimated cost for the
2012 presidential campaign is going to
be two billion dollars or more and
that's been going up steadily and it has
an effect it means that the political
parties candidates if they want to stay
in the
are going to have to cater to those with
super wealth that means the CEOs the
head nod managers and so on those are
way at the top the rank of the economic
ladder and that's what they've been
doing for the Republicans it comes
naturally it's not an effort they're
mostly they're already the Democrats the
Democrats today are mostly what we used
to be called moderate Republicans that
they've moved well to the right and
partly for the same reasons partly
because they want to do it anyhow but
partly because if you want to be in the
game that's which do in the 2008
election the main reason he won is he
was favored by the financial
institutions now they poured money into
his campaign they figured he'd do better
for them than McCain and of course they
expected to be rewarded and they were
they were the ones who were basically
rewarded by government policies under
Obama they came they caused the
recession but there Richard bigger and
better than before they have a pretty
good game right for them with the
financialization of the economy and the
deregulation you can predict that
they're going to be financial crisis for
good pretty obvious but it's predictable
and they keep coming they didn't come at
all during the regular touring period
but they're not a problem so if you're a
Goldman Sachs executive very much
JPMorgan Chase Citigroup or whatever you
can make very risky transactions which
means you get a lot of profit and then
when it all collapses as it will you
have a government insurance policy
it's called too big to fail so the
government insurance policy which allows
you to carry out these transactions also
guarantees that you don't suffer for now
because the taxpayers brought in after
it crashes to bail you out
which is exactly what
so for example right at this moment yeah
last couple of weeks during all that
talk about how we all have to share
austerity this is that the goldman sachs
is one of the biggest gangsters
announced but in the business press you
know like not in the headlines of your
local paper announced that they're gonna
have that they just announced seventeen
and a half billion dollars in
compensation for their executives last
year and the CEO of goldman sachs
lloyd blankfein and he gets twelve point
six million dollars as a bonus and his
base salary is more than tripled given
the way the laws of corporate governance
have been established by the federal
government
that means he's giving that money to
himself because the ceos are allowed to
pick the boards that decide on their
compensation well you know that's the
way the vicious cycle operates meanwhile
the business is very highly class
consciously bitterly opposed the unions
for the number of reasons for one thing
goes unions defend workers rights and
that includes not just wages print that
could include in some countries does
they're right for some degree of
participation in management and the
business classes who can take a little
bit ahead who recognize that that could
mean worker takeover of the industries
why do you need managers we can run them
better ourselves there's something kinda
like that just happened and talking a
few miles away from you where the
multinational
was one to close down a pretty
successful production unit it wasn't
making enough profit for them the union
workers offered to buy it but the
multinational preferred to lose money
and to give it up rather than to allow a
successful worker managed to enter price
to be established as might have happened
there class-conscious they're deeply
committed Marxists they're fighting a
class war all the time
and if they don't have any
countervailing force they of course want
to win for all the unions are the main
countervailing force they important to
get rid of it private sector unions have
been almost eliminated now that like
seven percent of the workforce not those
workers don't want to join unions in
fact polls show a very first day
good to have somebody to keep you on
private sector in suits say like 7% of
the workforce the polls demonstrate that
the large majority of workers want to
join unions but they can't not because
the the laws are set up unlike other
countries so you're pretty much barred
from doing also there are the union
busting tactics that have been carefully
honed over the years they're comfortable
sure you know this there are companies
that specialize in techniques on strike
breaking and breaking organizing efforts
it's mostly illegal but when you have a
criminal state you can carry out illegal
actions the government just doesn't
enforce the laws and it says so they're
pretty successful anyhow you have a huge
pool of workers who want to join unions
and can the United States is again
almost unique in the world in this
respect certainly unique among the
industrial societies the what's left is
the public sector unions they've managed
to sustain themselves so you have to go
after them and that's what's been
happening dramatically in the last
couple of months and that's what's
happening right now in Wisconsin the
let's claim that it's because of the
deficit have nothing to do with the
deficit the attack the issue is
collective bargaining rights that
doesn't affect the deficit one way or
another that's an effort to destroy
unions and that's why the brothers and
others are funding it maybe we can get
rid of this last shred of countervailing
power to corporate tyranny you get rid
of the unions you're not going to have
these barriers to taking over everything
and that's exactly what
happening there the in order to gain
some public support you have to divert
the people are angry and for pretty good
reasons been a pretty brother 30 odd
years with most of the population but
you have to divert that anger not to
Goldman Sachs and huge bonuses you know
people look at that diverted to the two
same teachers and firefighters and
police and librarians and the other
people who are really responsible for
the fiscal crisis that's all total
fabrication but if you don't have any
counter force and you keep repeating it
often enough people come to believe it
and you know there's some element of the
population that believes all that it's
growing in fact polls demonstrate all
teachers are a particular victim but
that's also for another reason because
there's a major effort underway to
destroy the public education system now
that's true at all levels from
kindergarten up through research
universities at the public level the
goal is to try to privatize it the
handed over to private hands then we'll
be gonna work for the rich won't work
for anyone else if you want to privatize
a system but there's a standard
technique for doing it
defunded if you define some system say
railroads or whatever it is and
therefore it doesn't work properly and
then people get angry because it's not
working you can come along and say well
the reason it's not working is it's
public so let's hand it over to
corporate power and then everything will
be great
done over and over that's exactly what's
being done with the public education
system way they funded the salaries are
too low class sizes are growing
infrastructure is collapsing and so on
some people don't like it and a way to
enter this entering wedge for
privatization techniques but the goal is
the same just get rid of this thorn in
our sides public education public
education is a thorn in the side for
several reasons for one things of no
value whatsoever to the rich they can
send their kids to private schools and
they do anyway
and for another it has a dangerous
ideological effect public education is
based on the same principle as the labor
unions
solidarity public education is based on
the principle would say me I don't have
kids in school obviously but I should
public his patience based on the idea
that I have a responsibility for the kid
across the street that he gets a public
education and you got to knock that out
of people's heads
the idea that you care about each other
and sympathy and solidarity really
dangerous idea if you supposed to be out
for yourself
I'm care about in my house and they kick
other people in the face is there in a
way and do what you want that's great
for the wealthy and the privileged and
there's a huge effort to impose that
doctrine and certainly it's the same
reason why there's an attack on Social
Security you read the take anything you
like that say about the deficit then
first of all there is a question whether
we should even care about the deficit
probably we shouldn't deficits a good
idea in a recession but put that aside
everything you read is we gotta do
something
the deficit so New York Times editorial
you know rush limbaugh whoever it is
it's always the same in order to deal
with the deficit we've got to face the
problem of entitlements and not the
Pentagon which is half the deficit not
the health care system which is the
other half
but entitlements and what is
entitlements mean it's less than Social
Security's always listed first and
Medicare and Medicaid the Social
Security contributes zero to the deficit
not a penny and those who make these
statements know it perfectly will Social
Security payments come in a payroll tax
separated into a separate trust fund
which can't be touched and takes care of
Social Security
therefore the road is pretty well funded
for decades ahead and can be tweaked to
go on indefinitely but you have to kill
Social Security
again it's of no value to the ridge no I
mean like I get Social Security but
barely notice of high enough on the
income levels of the matter much and if
you're a billionaire can't notice at all
and it has it is based on this
conception of solidarity it's based on
the idea that you care whether you know
some disabled widow across town has
foodie and that's a very bad idea has to
be knocked at your head just like the
Solidarity of the union movement another
element of Social Security is is a huge
amount of money stored up in the trust
funds and the financial institutions
would love to get their hands on it so
then they could make risky investments
make a ton of profit when it crashes
rely on the government insurance policy
and everything's great so you have to
attack Social Security yeah what about
Medicare and Medicaid well they are a
problem costs are going way up but it's
not Medicare and Medicaid they are very
efficient so Medicare administrative
costs are a tiny fraction of the
insurance company administrative costs
prices are going out because they have
to rely on the privatized insurance
policy and on the big pharmaceutical
corporations which are to begin
untouched by the government the threats
of negotiation of like other countries
well that's what we're seeing in front
of our eyes and it has a has a certain
effect like Scott Walker Governor of
Wisconsin he's not gonna get the charges
worked in fact a large majority are in
favor of collective bargaining but
there'll be a sufficient minorities
rammed through the attack on unions the
Obama administration is actually helping
but I go into that since it's late but
just to end I think there's no it's not
not an exaggeration to say that the fate
of democracy and and basic human rights
is its take in Cairo and in Wisconsin
where the directors are moving in
opposite directions fundamental ways I
mean the incompatibility can be reduced
you know so for example a regulatory
system that public funding of elections
now there are a lot of saved labor
rights legislation there are a lot of
ways or it takes a the new Kotex a Nixon
the last liberal president as I
mentioned he introduced measures which
infuriated the business world and in
fact partly responsible for this huge
backlash but they did help the public
like OSHA for example you know safety
and health legislation for the EPA which
the right-wing Republicans right now are
trying to destroy or the Earned Income
Tax Credit which did help were people
well these are ways of softening the
incompatibility welfare state measures
so-called but at a deep sense they
really aren't compatible
other they can't be the capitalism is
based on private ownership private
management and what in the 19th century
Americans called wage slavery
I mean you it's kind of interesting to
go back and look at the debates about
the Civil War slavery they're pretty
interesting southern slave owners get
had an argument which nobody ever
responded to because they couldn't they
argued that they're more humane than
northern capitalists because they own
their workers and if you own something
to take care of it like if you own a car
you take care of it that northern
capitalists rid of their workers like if
you rent a car you don't take care of it
so there are more humane they had a
capital investment in their workforce
and northern workers accepted that in
the around the time of the Civil War it
was pretty well taken for granted among
a large part of the population that wage
labor is the same as slavery with the
difference that it's temporary
that's Abraham Lincoln that was actually
their slogan the Republican Party at the
time the Civil War and and it's real
let's take a lot of effort to knock that
idea out of people's heads and I don't
think it's knocked out very far and you
could see that in taunton reasonably no
it was right there waiting to be
realized okay we'll take over the
factory and run ourselves
just the realize this is very different
from the caricature you learn about in
school I mean I quoted a case where Adam
Smith was presenting the standard
precepts then no but there's a lot more
so for example with Adam Smith had a
pretty jaundiced view of he's kind of
pre-capitalist in the modern sense he's
a figure the Enlightenment you know
modern capitalism was just beginning but
he didn't like it he talked about what
he called the the vile Maxim of the
Masters that all for ourselves nothing
for anyone else and we got to do
something about this if you've taken a
course in college or maybe high school
you've read the first paragraph of Adam
Smith's Wealth of Nations where he talks
about now how our wealth comes from the
fact that the butcher does his thing and
the carpenter does his thing and
everything works out fine that's such a
vision of labor is wonderful you go in a
couple hundred pages into the book and
you find a bitter condemnation of
division of labor because he's a figure
in the Enlightenment and he recognized
that a human intelligence in any serious
sense is based on independent creative
activity and he said the division of
labor is going to turn
people into creatures as stupid and
ignorant as a human being can possibly
be and in any civilized society that the
government's going to have to step in to
prevent it you didn't read that
paragraph when you're in college and in
fact if you take a look at the
University of Chicago's scholarly
edition of Wealth of Nations that came
out on the 200th anniversary look at the
index under division of labor that
parrot isn't even listed in the index
and you don't want anyone to find that
one and that kind of goes on for the
text say the phrase invisible hand
whichever Kreisler how wonderful the
invisible hand is well actually the
phrase invisible hand appears once and
wealth of nations so it's not hard to
find it turns out to be a critique of
what we call net neoliberalism what he
was saying was that he said suppose they
interested in England of course he
wasn't talking about the world they said
suppose in England merchants and
manufacturers said the court for the
economy
decided that they could make more money
by investing abroad and purchasing from
abroad neoliberalism in other words
globalization suppose they decided on
that well he said that'd be good for
them but it would be very harmful for
England however he said they're going to
have a certain loyalty to the home
country and a confidence in the home
country so they'll choose to invest at
home import from at home and as if by an
invisible hand
England will be saved from the ravages
of what we call neoliberal globalization
now if you david record of its famous
other major you know founder of modern
economic said about the same thing and
in fact all the way through you find
things like this actually adam smith
have also recognized very well how
government policy is made so he points
out that in england again his concern
he said that government policy is made
by the people who own the economy why
would he put the merchants and
manufacturers and they make sure that
their own interests are very well cared
for and however Grievous the effect on
others including the people of england
but particularly in the colonies mainly
india where they're subject to we call
the savage injustice of the british and
other europeans he's a figure of the
Enlightenment and not of the modern age
if you say those things now you're
considered of radical left-wing
conspiracy theorists but that's the
vicious cycle
two minutes worthless
I think we should give him enough credit
to suppose that he understands what he's
doing
intelligent person that are to think
things through such as they write about
Kentucky and Indiana and Ohio that's
going on all over the place spreading
just like it did in Egypt you know
wasn't just tougher or square or was no
exaggerating so as Western Egypt and so
on and here too were lots going on it's
exciting well it's fake Obama
there's take the last couple of months
and we could go back earlier Obama is
very much praised by the Democrats too
for his achievements during the
lame-duck session you know
bipartisanship they worked together
Republicans
everybody's happy issues we could work
together that what happened in the
lame-duck session well there was one
major achievement extending the Bush tax
cuts and the is only one issue there
extending the Bush tax cuts for the very
rich and when I say very rich I mean
very rich look as I said I'm pretty
well-off complaining about my income but
it wouldn't have affected me it's for
the very bridge tax cuts for them that
was the issue now remember at the same
time everyone's screaming about the
deficit I mean wrongfully but they are
what he succeeded in doing was giving
away tax cuts for the rich without even
an effort to prevent it and in fact the
population was strongly opposed to that
but about two to one but there wasn't
any effort to try to mobilize the
population to prevent this giveaway
which is also expanding the deficit well
at the very same time and with all this
talk about how we have to cut taxes
Obama instituted a tax increase for
federal workers now they didn't call it
a tax increase they call that a freeze
but if you think for 30 seconds a freeze
on public sector workers is exactly the
same as raising their taxes exactly
fiscal consequences are identical so
what he did was declare a tax increase
on federal workers and then a state of
the union goes on for five years which
means it's a substantial tax increase
because if you freeze wages for five
years the effect is expanded year by
year just because of population growth
and inflation okay so a major tax
increase for public sector workers and
he got away with that partly just
because it wasn't reported that way with
you know people didn't think of it that
way that's exactly what it is but also
because of this the success of this
propaganda campaign which has been going
on for the last couple of months really
and it's pretty spectacular of to try to
blame the fiscal problems on librarians
teachers and so on not on lloyd
blankfein you know the CEO of Citigroup
l'm not then where their cohorts in
government but on teachers and pensions
and so on and so kind of core
Terral unions which keep them so he got
away with it you think he doesn't
understand it
I mean look he can talk about this to
sixth graders they understand it so he
understands it perfectly well but that
those risk mitigant about the financial
institutions and he's not coming to he's
not gonna break with that in fact
everything is doing illustrates it for
example he recently had to appoint
someone to be in charge of a job
promotion activism the English language
the American version of the English
language has a dirty word which you
can't pronounce I'll have to spell it
the 7-letter dirty word PR Oh F i TS
there's a way to pronounce that it's
pronounced jobs so if a politician has
committed to increasing profits for the
wealthy he's in favor of job promotion
it's like universal so Obama had to pick
somebody in charge of job promotion who
do you think the jury mmm the CEO of the
General Electric the General Electric
went out and there was a big talk about
how they produced things here and so on
actually most General Electric
productions abroad this shipped jobs
abroad that's about half a financial
institution not even in production but
if you want to get your hand deep into
corporate pockets for the next election
that's what you do you pick the CEO of
General Electric and if you know you can
read the business press and you know
anyway that the next election is going
to cost billions of dollars well that's
where you go I don't say anything naive
about this in fact it's pretty
reasonable I think I mean maybe terrible
for the country but that's not the goal
of an elected official so suppose that
there'd been no bill oh this is a good
question we don't actually don't know
one thing that would have happened was
that the people who own say you know
shareholders and say AIG the insurance
company it would have taken what's
called the haircut in the economic
literature they would have lost money
the owners the managers the baby the
shareholders yeah they would have lost
money and in fact the the these
institutions someone was just going out
of business the way Lehman Brothers did
what happened was that they were
reconstituted on taxpayer funds and are
richer and more powerful and bigger than
they were before well you know there are
choices in between those two extremes so
that it would have been possible to you
know patch up the Christ
that they cause without you know without
this country's kinds of consequences and
furthermore the government could have
just nationalized okay of course less
way less to take over Citigroup than to
bail it out and if you took it if you
took it over you know in a democratic
society it could be it it's active it
could be return to being a financial
institution that serves a purpose but in
a capitalist society gonna have to have
financial institutions like you're gonna
have a bank which people can somebody
can borrow money from because you know
they want to buy a house or invest in a
company or whatever
that's what financial institutions are
supposed to do they're supposed in
principle and take an economics course
that's what they do they you take unused
funds like money that say you put in
your bank account and they try to divert
them to productive activities like
sending your kid to college or starting
a business or whatever it may be okay
we're not gonna we're not talking at the
moment about a different society just
this society well okay Citigroup could
have been turned into over the financial
institution I mean it's quite
interesting if you look at the
professional economics literature today
really for the first time seriously
there's a beginning of raising this by
Nobel laureate know there's raising the
question what are these things for these
institutions that you know went up to 40
percent of corporate profits what are
they doing they're mostly moving money
around and making a lot of you know
a ton of profit and getting bailed out
when I cry and they're also draining a
lot of talent like you go to say MIT
where I teach in a math department
now and most math departments there's a
section in the Graduate math department
which is called financial mathematics
that's people getting their PhDs in
mathematics so they can figure out ways
of milking the taxpayer more there is no
social utility to working out some
complicated method by which Goldman
Sachs can save a couple of seconds on
its transactions and beat out the next
guy there is no social utility it's
draining talent away from productive
activities it's it's it's player and
games with money and getting away with
it because you have the government
insurance policy and the deregulation
means you can do July so yeah there
would have been alternative approaches
even accepting some kind of you know
keep the institutions turn them into
socially useful ones and there's a whole
range of options between just letting
them crash and say nationalizing
everything that's same with the auto
industry I mean is when Obama took over
essentially took over most of the auto
industry it was owned by you actually at
that point now there were a number of
things that could have been done the one
was what actually was
keep selling off dismantling plants keep
exporting jobs try to fix them up
through their incompetence management is
to run out try to fix them up so that
they can be handed back to the old
owners pretty much and function more
efficiently that's what was done there
were other possibilities now for example
the country has vast needs I mean I
don't know how many of you take trips to
New York say but you go to New York you
go buy the fanciest train in the country
the Acela I wish my wife and I took 60
years ago it's now I think 15 minutes
faster than it was when we took it in
1950 any other country in the world
practically would get there in half the
time without knocking you all over the
place so you can't read and so on and so
forth and that's just a scam we're like
a third-world country well those are
things that the skilled workers and the
auto companies could have done something
about you could hand the I mean if banks
don't want to fund it fine and that over
the workforce has almost happened in
Taunton let them reconstruct it maybe
sometimes you know maybe some federal
funding much less than it was actually
given and let it be turned through
socially useful production like
high-speed rail instead what happened
and this is kind of surreal at the same
time that the government was continuing
the policy of dismantling plants and
remembered dismantling a plant means
destroying a community not just the
lives of the workers but usually the
whole community depends on the plant
so not only dismantling them
but well Obama's Transportation
Secretary was often Europe trying to get
contracts from Spanish companies to
build high-speed rail for us you know
that's a sign of the bankruptcy of
social and economic planning which is
very matter so yeah there were things
that could have been done and still can
be done plenty of options even without
any significant social change
okay well actually they're not different
there according to the information
available they are someone rethinking
their planning to ask how they can make
use of the new situation to their
benefit
first of all al-qaeda remember is a bit
of a fiction I mean there is you know it
exists but it's what's called the
leaderless Network you know there's some
symbols like Osama bin Laden and maybe
some plans come down but mostly they
would it be actions attributed to
al-qaeda are if you trace them though
they're due to independent cells all
over the place which share some kind of
an ideology and maybe you know share
some kind of allegiance to semi-mythical
figures but are carrying out actions on
their own that's almost entirely the
case there's plenty of research into
this as you can imagine so they're
called a network of networks with
leaders this organization pretty much so
yeah they're probably rethinking their
plans I'm after all their major goal has
been the major target of the al Qaeda
Network that was the dictatorship and
want to get rid of the mainland Saudi
Arabia their main enemy main US ally and
you know the status of the dictatorships
is very much in question now hasn't
reached Saudi Arabia yet for the mine so
there doubtless rethinking what they can
do under these circumstances and I think
that's I think you can read this in the
newspaper
but I think it's correct this time
that's probably the reason for the
temporary silence which would they be
announcing put the little words the
politicians have to encourage works out
there you know purchase the vehicle
necessary and I it was simple they have
no vested in Wisconsin he's personally
interested personal financial interest
and the interest of the citizens of
Wisconsin is that they were talking
about Walker's personally yes
is it possible democracy would happen
for government personal financial
interests his citizenship and for
democracy to flourish it could but you
know that's peanuts I mean you mentioned
the Koch brothers that's more
significant I mean I don't know whether
Scott Walker has a big bank account or
not than if he does it doesn't matter
that much it's not going to affect
things the issue is not the person Scott
Walker
it's the institutional structure which
is operating and the funding for it is
coming from these huge right-wing
funders like the Koch brothers on the
other ones were prominent and they're
you know they're kind of in the lead of
the campaign to try to dismantle what's
left of American democracy including
unions of anything else and you don't
understand that well from their point of
view makes me outside my window at my
office at MIT I've got a stare at the
Koch building that just went up next
door that's how they prettify their
image by funding a count of Cancer
Center but the main thing they're doing
is you're trying to them I guess I don't
know this my suspicion is that they are
kind of you know puppet masters they
pretty much dominate the American
Conservative caucus and so on my guess
is they're probably trying to groom
Walker for a presidential run on the run
a program which they suspect may be
pocketed or may be able to bring popular
support it's a tricky business being
what's called a conservative
right-winger you know right-wing
extremism has nothing that won't serve a
disability old stunts you've got to your
policies have to be to enrich and
empower a tiny sector as a population
and harm everyone else but at the same
time you have to gain popular support
that's a tricky operation that there are
ways of doing it so the Republicans in
the West whether the last 20-30 years
more or less stuff being a political
party in the traditional sense but they
have gained popular support for one
reason by mobilizing Christian
evangelicals and they've been there
forever but they were never organized
into a political force until till the
Reagan years really and that gives you a
pretty solid voting base I mean remember
this country is just off the spectrum
and religious fundamentalists are
totally off the spectrum always has been
since the colonists but by now you have
these the polls can be believed about a
third of the population believing that
every word of the Bible is literally
truth do you have more than two
Republicans who's the head of some
Committee on the environment explained
that you don't do worry about global
warming because God promised Noah that
there wouldn't be another flood
than any other country in the world
where is nobody could say that not being
left out of the room but that passes
here so you can move a lot that's a
pretty solid base of voting support you
throw them some raw meat every once in a
while Russian or whatever don't care of
that and at the other but I think a
bigger one is this new technique of
blaming public sector workers for the
financial crisis you read the time you
read the New York Times let's say when
they give you reporting from Wisconsin
they select carefully people who are
maybe union workers or flats or you know
wife of a worker and so on who they can
get to say honestly I'm sure look I
don't have a job why should I be paying
the pension for these teachers who have
jobs and you know why should they be
getting pensions when I don't even have
a job well you know if you can direct if
you can direct anger and frustration
against vulnerable people you can get
somewhere there's some pretty unpleasant
models about that like Adolf Hitler for
example there was plenty of anger and
frustration in Germany and if you get
diverted to Jews and Bolsheviks and gays
and so on yeah you could get the 90% of
the populations 42 which is what
happened with consequences they weren't
keep straight so it's like it's not some
new idea you know Reagan was a master at
this so you're old enough to remember
will remember the
about the black mothers being driven in
their chauffeured Cadillacs to the
welfare station to pick up their welfare
check and go and spend it on you know
fur coat or something and that's old in
fact you look at polls today it's very
interesting by and large the populations
kind of Social Democratic they want more
spending on health and education and
pretty progressive things and they do
want more spending on health for the
poor but not wealthy
so they oppose welfare but more spending
on you know mothers with dependent
children people are a lot whatever it
may be in other words we'll through but
they're against welfare and that's a
triumph of Reaganite propaganda welfare
means that rich black mother instill and
steal your money and I think that you
know the cook brothers whoever does
their thinking for them are probably
planning a campaign with a guy like
Walker was the front runner who run on
that program we got to take our country
back and get it away from these school
teachers who were ripping us off and so
on and this combines the schoolteachers
are particularly you can't go too far
after the police and firefighters maybe
a little but not too far but the
teachers really they do want to get rid
of not that there won't be any teachers
but you want to make public education
Janka privatize the police department
yet at least but you can privatize
public education maybe pretty soon
they'll turn the police over Blackwater
but as
Scott Walker's not custody mubarak maybe
he is personally but the institutions in
which the two of them exist very
different that's why I said that
trajectories are meeting and crossing in
the United States the trajectory is down
its to taking away rights that have been
won in the case of Egypt it's up its to
gaining rights that were denied them and
a disappointment we actually see them
cross it incidentally there are attacks
on freedom of speech and some of the
worst ones are coming from the Obama
administration one of the didn't get too
much publicity but it was a court case
last year which is pretty ominous it was
initiated by the Obama administration if
you don't look it up it's a folder the
humanitarian law project and if you sort
of look at what was at stake I think
it's the worst attack on in freedom of
speech since the Smitha in 1941 it
essentially says that any material
support including speech advice for
example any material support to an
organization on the terrorist list is
that criminal now first of all the
terrorist list itself is completely
illegitimate totally the government just
says you're on the terrorist list
there's no surveillance no supervision
you know nothing and so some of the
things that happen are just comical like
for example breagan in 1982 that wanted
to support this friend Saddam Hussein
and send him you know support help build
up this army and so on
well Iraq was on the terrorist list so
they had to take him off so they took a
rack off the terrorists list so the
United States have been support so I'm
saying through his worst atrocities
incidentally well that's what the
terrorist list is like the Asian I mean
it should not exist in a decent society
but now under the Obama initiated ruling
which passed the Supreme Court with the
support of the right-wing justices you
can be penalized for say giving advice
to an organization on that terrorist
list for example advising them to turn
to nonviolent means or to join the
political process or something like that
that's pretty serious and in fact it's
already being used I mean the FBI has
raided apartments in Minneapolis and
Chicago and given out subpoenas and are
charging people with supporting one
another group that they don't like so
there are attacks on freedom of speech
but sure it's not Egypt though we want
to make sure we don't go there well
they're going the other way
well you know there's a lot of them that
kind of criticism of the Fed and frankly
I think it's misguided there's a lot
wrong with the Fed so for example take
the housing crisis I mean this is a
trillion dollar so you know that little
hard to miss or they missed it not my
day but correctly all economists it's
not they didn't notice it they were in
the in thrall to a religious doctrine
and called the efficient market
hypothesis which is study if you study
if you're in economics course and
according to that hypothesis it can't be
a problem that's about as realistic as
this congressman I'm saying don't worry
about global warming because God
promised Noah there won't be a flood and
there's no empirical basis for the
efficient market hypothesis the only
reason that people it's accepted and the
profession because it makes it easy to
prove theorems and things like then but
there was no reason to believe it but if
you accept this religious doctrine then
if you see the housing housing crisis
shooting off into space after a hundred
years of tracking GDP you don't notice
it and as late as 2007 Bernanke the head
of the Fed was saying can't be a problem
we kind of like this congressman and
NOAA well okay that kind of criticism
the Fed makes sense but at modern
economy cannot function without a
central bank and the century that's what
the Fed is so you can all kind of things
wrong with it like maybe it shouldn't be
owned by private banks it should be
public or something else but some sort
of the central financial institution is
it really essential in you know an
economy anything like ours that you
could imagine totally different
economies
it seems like the government of the
United States default on the interests
of the corporation and it seems mighty
good political debates that go on that
the middle class and the poor for
example that are supported in Germany by
governmental actions are in this country
totally and only do the discussions of
no wanna seem that have nothing to do
with the interests of that middle class
for that quarter class and so I like
that representation for those people I
don't know if we should go into this but
I don't think we should look at East
Germany isn't any kind of a model there
may have been some I did you know
theoretical idea
about working for the benefit of the
people but that's not what any of the
Leninist governments have been doing
since 1970 yep
yeah West Germany has a kind of social
market economy like most of the
industrial world so for example in
Germany there there's a health system
that works there's a educational system
that works there's a technically
co-determination and Industry doesn't
mean that much but it means there's 50
percent you need representation on
management boards if it's a software
system it's a softer state capitalist
system the nurse and there's more of
their it also has a parliamentary system
so you can have small parties running
and things like that there but
advantages to it on the other hand there
are a lot of things wrong like Germany
you know all of Germany but West Germany
is committed to a very conservative
central bank policy which imposes
austerity they dominate the European
Bank which is pursuing austerity
policies which are pretty harmful for
the economy are they want to be here
Obama I think is right they should be
stimulating not reducing the government
spending and this is what those traces
back to the German kind of apparent
about inflation you know which was a
real problem in the 1920s but if there's
nothing to do with what's happening now
so there's a downside plenty of them now
also in many ways the United States as
much of a free country I mean take what
I started off by saying about the 14th
amendment in compared with Germany for
that the United States is a unusual
maybe unique I think the United States
with the first country I'm pretty sure
to grant the citizenship by birth 14th
amendment says if you're born in this
country or citizen in Germany you want
to get citizenship that you've got to
show that you know you're ethnically
racially German you know like you had
enough blue eyes and blond hair the
ancestors it's been slightly modified
but that's been the way for a long time
and that's the way most countries are
there is an effort here by the far-right
to take away that progressive element in
the 14th amendment but still there
in Germany it's it's been worse all
along that's where you get until America
kill you know making that speech about
the multiculturalism and how it's
failing because the Turks who are doing
the dirty work in German society somehow
can't figure out how to get blue eyes
and blond hair and become
so they're kind of extraneous feature in
the society so there's a good in bed I
don't want to say it's utopia but it's
true that the social market economy is
more protective of the population and
we're democratic in that sense however
you know you can't if you look at
American history and there have been ups
and downs there have been periods when
pretty much like this one
see you back to the 1920s they I'm the
labor movement was totally destroyed
just not functionally at all it was
mostly destroyed by Liberal Democrats by
Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare and it was
tremendous inequality very much like now
you know the financial wild financial
speculation well the country came out of
it in the 1930s there was a revival
significant revival labor movement
progressive legislation which was sort
of forced on the on a rather willing
government but forced on it by mostly
militant labor activism and you got you
know you ended up with a situation like
I described this Golden Age you know
rapid growth gala Terry and growth
progressive legislation not utopia but
progress and it can happen again
I mean it the last thirty years have
been a period of regression but it's not
the first period like that of the Gilded
Age and the late 19th century it was
another and there have been popular
struggles which revived the more free
and democratic society and in fact even
during this period the last thirty years
this period of regression on social and
economic
policy there's been plenty of progress
and we shouldn't overlook that and the
progress didn't come by magic it can by
activism it's a much more civilized
country than it was 40 years ago in a
lot of dimensions women's rights
environmental concerns global justice
concerns
none of this stuff all that stuff is
extremely weak in the 1960s it developed
in the wake of the 60s activism I
changed the country a lot for the
Veterans Day so things aren't that
simple there's plenty of opportunities
here to recover what we had and to go
forward
