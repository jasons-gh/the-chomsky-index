commend outside of kgn you I don't want
to sound dismissive but I really think
it's the wrong question nothing is
unbiased no everything is presented from
a certain point of view if you're honest
you make your point of view clear if
you're dishonest you pretend your
objective and so on and so forth all
right and then it's really it's really
up to you to decide what you think is
telling something that sounds reasonable
to you and you really ought to be
triangulating you know you look at
different things and see how the world
looks from different points of view and
then you make your own decisions it's
just as if you're us you know your
chemist working and some problem in
chemistry there is nothing that gives
you an unbiased point of view that takes
work and it's a lot harder when you are
trying to deal with human affairs so I
mean I know what I think is important
but it's really up to you to decide what
you think is important I mean trick for
example I learn a lot by reading The
Wall Street Journal so I was quoting
imac can't stand what you know we
disagree on every imaginable topic but
if you read it you can learn a lot about
the first of all what's happening
because they have pretty honest
reporting remember they're reporting for
the business world which has to have a
semi-realistic picture of what the world
is like and you also learn what's being
thought about and centers of power
that's important I don't say that's the
only thing you should read and I think
you to read zeemagazine too but from
then on you've got to decide yourself
you you are next you're nasty
and I'm not going to miss this
opportunity it's I've been waiting for a
long time you mentioned that the next
region that it's going to be in the eyes
of the United States aria didn't hear
you mentioned that the next region could
be the engine region that's you know the
United States is going to go propagate
the young democracy and freedom that we
like we've done in Latin America yeah a
century yeah I would like you two to
give us a Bolivian the last five years
another bully did i was born in believe
about on the US citizen now i believe in
the last five years has discovered quite
a bit of natural gas and it said
probably the next five years we will or
get close to the to the US and reserves
in the American continent in there is a
quite a bit of opposition about a
project that has been taking place the
government's trying to implement the
project that it's called pacific lng
liquefied bolivian natural gas in
exporting it to southern california
there's quite a bit of opposition about
that project from local people because
it doesn't benefit there's not going to
benefit bolivia in any way if you know
anything about that of if you could give
us a little bit more details and also i
have a request from a lot of civic and
organizations and we'll leave it to
invite you down there to give us an idea
about the devastating consequences of
the american free trade that the u.s.
government is trying to propagate all
over South America
well III mean you probably know more
about Bolivian resources and I do so I
won't answer but I doubt that the
resources are on that scale I think
they're significant but I doubt that
they're on the North American skill
however it is true that if you there are
intelligence projections a document you
ought to read its public it's called the
the name global forget one it's the year
2000 the national intelligence community
that's the CIA and the rest of them
published the projection for the next 15
years that if you want a reference to it
send me an email it's got a website or
you get it under the CIA website if you
look and it's a long detailed projection
of what they expect the next 15 years
and it's pretty interesting parts of it
have to do with this they described the
Andean region they don't mention Bolivia
well except that insofar as it's part of
this region at the periphery but the
Andean region they say they expect to be
one of the main sources on which the US
will rely for its energy requirements
not the only one but one and it's that's
why I mentioned that it's a possible
target aside from the fact that it's out
of control Bolivia as you know is almost
out of control came very close to
elective populists president main would
have if it hadn't been for violence
there's a lot of opposition in Bolivia
to the so-called drug war it's been a
lot to do with drugs but has a lot to do
it driving people off the land and
things like that and it's been a
disaster in Bolivia for the population
for almost 20 years now alternative
development programs that have been
talked about having been realized as
they haven't been anywhere else and it's
pretty bad news and so a lot of a lot of
tension and violence the US as I
mentioned his military bases all over
the region and
undoubtedly is looking for their plans
to go further including Bolivia as to
the free trade agreements well you know
there's one region where they've been
implemented North America Canada United
States and Mexico and that's NAFTA it's
opposed by the populations in all three
countries was implemented over the
objections of the populations of all
three countries it's one of Clinton's
other achievements it required a
tremendous media campaign to prevent
people from knowing about what was
happening I mean to this day ten years
later the official position of the labor
movement has not been allowed expression
a lot of denunciation of the labor
movement but their own position which
was pretty reasonable wasn't allowed
expression still isn't but the
population is still opposed back in at
the hemispheric summit and what was it
april two thousand and one in quebec the
that was supposed to be the summit that
was going to establish the free trade
agreement for the americas okay and they
were going to NAFTA was the model
everyone read the headlines so about how
magnificent NAFTA was now we have to
extend the benefits to the hemisphere
well here's another propaganda
achievement for you I the two major
organizations pretty well known
organizations the leading human rights
group in the world Human Rights Watch
and the Economic Policy Institute in
Washington is one of the major think
tanks that does regular economic
analysis both of them published major
documents on NAFTA timed for release at
the summit Human Rights Watch dealt
their document dealt with effects of
NAFTA on labor rights in the three
countries economic policy institute
document had experts from the three
countries describing discussing in
detail the effects on working people of
NAFTA and the
countries had a friend through a
database search on that it wasn't
mentioned in the United States except
for one op-ed and a small-town newspaper
well why because Human Rights Watch
concluded that NAFTA had been harmful to
labor rights in all three countries
mostly Mexico which is the most
vulnerable and the economic policy
institute give a detailed analysis in
which they concluded that it's one of
those rare agreements which had been
harmful to working people which means
the majority of the population in all
three countries most harmful in Mexico
which is the most vulnerable and you
don't want people to know that when the
headlines are talking about how
marvelous NAFTA is and how we have to
extend it to the hemisphere but if you
read those reports you get a pretty good
assessment of what the effect of
so-called free trade is and it's not
free trade that's propaganda it's a very
special form of an international
integration which gives rights to
investors not the people so under say
NAFTA one of the provisions of NAFTA
like the World Trade Organization is
that corporations are permitted to claim
national rights so GM can go to Mexico
and claim the rights of a max of Mexican
businesses what happens if a Mexican of
flesh and blood that tries to go to New
York and claim the rights of an
Americans at the person of flesh and
blood you know don't have to bother
asking these are that's just only one
example of special rights that are given
to private Pyrenees that people don't
have when NAFTA was passed you know it's
implemented in 1994 there was another
legislation implemented in 1994
by the Clinton administration was called
Operation gatekeeper it militarized the
us-mexican border that's an artificial
border like most borders established by
conquest the United States conquered
half of Mexico and the border has been
pretty porous in both directions no same
people live on both sides they've been
moving up and back Clinton understood
that when NAFTA is passed you have to
block the movement of people okay free
trade if you go back to Adam Smith is
based on free movement of people you
have to stop that and the reason is
because they anticipated an economic
disaster in Mexico that they were going
to call an economic miracle and it was
going to mean there would be a flood of
people from Mexico fleeing to the United
States and he got to block that so they
militarized the border and hundreds of
Mexicans have been killed since then
trying to cross the border it's one of
the effects of NAFTA these are not free
trade agreements their agreements which
provide which are carefully calibrated
to be a mixture of protectionism and
liberalisation designed for the
interests of those who are designing
them that's not very surprising the
people are designing the maze mainly
corporate sector or designing them in
their interest it includes very highly
protectionist measures and a lot of and
the kind of liberalisation will benefit
them but they're not free trade
agreements and NAFTA at least appears to
have been harmful to the majority of the
population in all three countries
there's no particular reason to think
that if he extended the hemisphere it's
going to be any different all right
before I leave I have to convey the
message of some of the people that
wanted to invite you there I know you're
put for the next two years or three
years but can I contact you somehow and
I maybe we can discuss if you did
something no because they want to have
you there in the one there won't love
you involved
yeah I have a one of my many thick files
of invitations is from friends in
Bolivia oh and I got that like you can
just email me but all I can do is add it
to the phone how do I get your email
underwear it's the obvious one just my
name chomsky at mit.edu educational
institutions so just what you'd yes
thank you i'll do that thanks okay
what-what stoop of rat but I have to
tell you that I probably have to send
the form response I mean I get hundreds
a day and even spending four or five
hours a night I can't really reach me
about it but I saw so a lot of them have
to say if it's an invitation you know
just going to his file what's to prevent
mr. Bush from carrying out a plan which
i believe is part of his national
emergency policy and that is to cancel
the 2004 elections I don't know yeah I
think I mean you know these guys are
pretty bad but I don't think that's in
the cards I mean I think that probably
would lead to a rebellion in the country
unless you know with an exception if
some major terrorist action takes place
all bets are off you know and I don't
say that they're trying to stimulate one
but the policies that they are pursuing
are increasing the likelihood of
terrorist operations and they know it
you know they come and they read their
own intelligence reports they read CIA
reports they read what strategic
analysts are saying and they're almost
uniform and saying that the policies
that are being pursued are likely to
increase the threat of terrorism and the
threat asere you want to know how severe
it is and recommend some reading there's
a high level task force heart Redmond
task force organized by council on
foreign relations which just came out
with its report a couple of months ago
on some title like terrorist threats to
the United States like everyone else
they said the threats are going to be
increased by the attack on Iraq
everybody says that
and but the threat then they run through
a it's kind of a cookbook for terrorists
I mean it has a series of threats which
I hadn't even thought of never been
there and they're very extreme so for
example they point out and they
apparently unstoppable so they forget
the numbers but they point out that a
huge number of containers but most of
what comes into the country is in
containers you know container ships I
think it's tens of millions a year some
extremely high number and those
containers are uninspected okay anything
could be in them you know furthermore
there's no way to inspect them they come
from three or four places around the
world singapore Amsterdam or maybe
Rotter down and some other place and if
you tried to inspect them you would back
up commerce you know for months if
trucks clogging all of Europe you know
waiting to be inspected I'm in the whole
economic system
