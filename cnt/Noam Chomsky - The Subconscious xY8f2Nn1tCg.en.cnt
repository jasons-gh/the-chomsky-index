language that we call subconscious or
unconscious can it be considered to be
language does it have a structure or is
it when it reaches conscience that this
can be considered to be language so our
subconscious language in what sense is
it your language what kind of structure
does it have what kind of properties can
we attribute it I think it's it actually
is language what's not beyond the level
of consciousness looks like just some
kind of fragments that reach
consciousness occasionally or
externalize usually not and that doesn't
seem to me surprising most most of
what's going on in the mind is
completely inaccessible to consciousness
and by now this even experimental work
showing it it's against that's contrary
to dogmas there's a philosophical
thought move it's pretty strong that
says anything in the mind has to be
accessible to consciousness goes way
back modern versions attributable the
WVO Quine and cyril others but old
doctrines just seems to be completely
false but most of what's going on is it
appears to be inaccessible to
consciousness
so what properties does it have well as
the properties that we try to discover
by looking at the scattered evidence
that does is available to us and that's
just normal science you don't see in
fact a couple of days ago there was the
first picture ever of what happens to a
molecule in the course of a chemical
process plenty was known about it lot
was assumed about it and nobody ever saw
it before so there's a nice
technological development that's not
going to change chemistry for hundreds
of years the chemical theory just
developed just looking at whatever data
you have
and that's the way science works when
one famous line is that science is
concerned with discovering hidden simple
Invisibles that account for complex
visibles that's science
in fact this rational inquiry and we
shouldn't be surprised that the same
holds in this case does make think aside
so what properties does this internal
system have well apparently it has the
kind of problems that properties I
mentioned so for example it doesn't use
linear order it just uses minimal
structural distance which probably
follows from minimal computation which
probably means this is a further guess
that when language emerged it emerged
without any selectional pressures so it
just took the form of a natural object
kind of like a snowflake it since there
were no selectional pressures that's
mutation whatever it is is happening to
an individual it's just going to take
the form of a an object naturally formed
and accord with the principles of
natural law probably minimal computation
in this case as far as we understand
anything which is pretty limited that
seems to be pretty much the case and not
surprising if you think about if
Tattersall is right you know that this
is sudden emergence of something at a
narrow time scale that's what you'd
expect
