and talking about standards of where we
go and that's how I would set up a
Democratic candidate Doug Bailey I don't
know there it's a wish or a prediction
I'm sure it's the former I hope it's
both the winner will be the candidate if
there is only one who defines what
America can and should be in the year
2000 and asks for a mandate to get there
that's called leadership that's what the
job is all about and I think the public
knows that that's truth that's 30

question and answer period we ask that
you please line up behind the microphone
at the end the aisle and that you keep
your questions brief and precise finally
by way of an introduction I'd just like
to offer a few comments I'd like to
begin by saying that some of the most
basic questions about foreign policy are
the most important and yet they are
rarely addressed today we will look at
the New World Order and explore the
disturbing answers
some of these questions in a speech
titled the challenge of building peace
delivered before the United Nations
General Assembly on September 23rd
George Bush said the following the new
world order really is a tool for
addressing a new world of possibilities
this order gains its mission in shape
not from shared interests but from
shared ideals and the ideals that have
spawned new freedoms throughout the
world have received their boldest and
clearest expression in our great country
the United States never before has a
world looked more to the American
example never before has so many
millions drawn hope from the American
idea and the reason is simple unlike any
other nation in the world as Americans
we enjoy profoundly mysterious bonds of
affection and idealism we feel our deep
connections to community to families to
our faiths but what defines this nation
what makes us America is not our ties to
a piece of territory or bonds of blood
what makes us America is our allegiance
to the idea that all people everywhere
must be free the New World Order's
prescription for freedom is clearly a
blueprint for intervention the New
Republic in a recent cover story defined
the fundamental law of the New World
Order as follows when the existing
international rules of rules conflict
with basic American values
to hell with the rules and the corollary
the New World Order should be an
assertion of American interests and
values in the world if necessary
asserted unilaterally where possible we
should act in concert with others we're
not we should proceed any way we are
very fortunate today to have Noam
Chomsky of MIT here to offer his unique
and penetrating analysis and the true
nature of the New World Order his work
has ranged from groundbreaking research
in the area of linguistics to variety of
books including manufacturing consent
the political economy of the media
necessary illusions thought control and
democratic societies the culture of
terrorism and two volumes on the
political economy of human rights and
many others he has combined his fearless
criticism of u.s. foreign policy with a
role as a tireless activist working with
organizations such as the Jewish
Committee on the Middle East fairness
and accuracy
courting and the war resisters Lee he
has written for numerous publications
such as lives of our x and z magazine
wean the progressive Student Union hope
today's inquiry will inspire you to
become involved with any of the
important organizations addressing the
terrifying reality of American foreign
policy please help me in welcoming Noam
Chomsky
the first struggle today is going to be
the struggle against the heat those
television lights in fact I'll start
believing in the miracles of Japanese
technology when they figure out a way to
televise without roasting the person
who's standing up in front the the
announce topic was the New World Order
Central America in the Middle East which
touches quite a few bases and the title
like that leaves essentially two options
one option is to speak in general terms
about the New World Order which as far
as I'm aware as the old world order
adapted to changing contingencies as
happens all the time the most important
of these changing contingencies have
having been about 20 years ago when the
post-war international economic system
essentially was torn apart and has been
reconstructed a second option would be
to pick some crucial issues some
particular topics and to use them to
illustrate the way the the general
contours of the New World Order and that
means the old world order and thinking
about it seemed to me that the second
attack might be more informative and in
fact almost any current issue could be
used because they all illustrate the
same essential features of policy and
given us power u.s. policy has an
overriding and often determinative
influence and furthermore they all
illustrate the same aspects of the
ideological cover within which policy is
presented to us examples of which you
just heard from our illustrious leader
the two examples that are listed in the
announcement the Central America in the
Middle East are perfectly natural ones
both regions Latin America and the
Middle East are covered by what has been
the long-standing central doctrine of US
policy the
a doctrine which says in effect that
certain regions of the world are us turf
no one else raises their head
no foreign entries certainly but
crucially no indigenous groups and if
they do their heads are cut off if they
get out of control as the doves like to
put it the monitor doctrine is of course
devised for the Western Hemisphere in a
period of in less ambitious days its
meaning for the Western Hemisphere was
recently clarified in the gates hearings
one may be the only interesting thing
that happened in the gates hearings as
far as I noticed was a memorandum that
was released in from December 1984 in
which gates was dressed from gates to
William Casey the head of the CIA on US
policy toward Nicaragua and it opened by
saying that we have to start talking
tough about Nicaragua let's stop the
pretenses about preventing arms to el
salvador and all of this other nonsense
which is so easily exposed although I
should say the media continued to trot
it out when it was useful and let's talk
we have to start talking tough and then
he said we have to rid the hemisphere of
this regime by any means necessary and
he means that we can use up to bombing
and that and he pointed out correctly
that if we don't accept this commitment
to rid the hemisphere of anybody we
don't like we will have abandoned the
Monroe Doctrine which confers upon us
that right well it was interesting
actually the the day that that appeared
I happen to be talking somewhere in
Detroit and I suggested to the audience
that they keep their eyes open to see
what the reaction will be to these two
this memorandum predicting that there
would be an OLE reaction and in fact
that's true it never came up in Congress
the media didn't mention it it wasn't
considered one of the big issues and
that's exactly correct because
essentially everyone agrees across the
spectrum it's agreed that we have a
right to rid the hemisphere
for that matter the world of anybody we
don't like by any means that we that we
find feasible and possible and that he
is quite right and saying that is the
meaning of the menorah doctrine
well the Monroe Doctrine was extended to
various in this particular sense meaning
we have a right to ridden any area of
anyone we don't like if there was
extended to large parts of the world
after the Second World War that's just a
reflection of the extraordinary power of
the u.s. at the time and in particular
it was extended to the Middle East which
was described by the State Department
right after the Second World War as the
most important area in the world in the
field of foreign investment and as
General Eisenhower described it the
strategically most important area in the
world because of its enormous energy
reserves which have two crucial features
first of all whoever has influence and
control over them has a considerable
amount of leverage in world affairs and
secondly there's a huge flow of capital
that comes from the profits from oil
production and the cheapest and most
abundant areas and that has to flow back
to prop up the both the corporations and
the general economy of the United States
and the country that in internal
discussion is called
our lieutenant namely written at
addition to this is our lieutenant a
fashionable word is partner as Mike
Mansfield put it in the Kennedy years so
we have to prop up the economy of our
lieutenant and of course ourselves more
crucially and control over the energy
resources and the profits that flow from
them is a major factor in that that's in
fact discussed and in turn ohms
Declassified secret op planning
documents but it's also very evident in
policy and we saw examples of that a few
months ago so in other words Latin
America and the Middle East are the
these are the obvious areas to discuss
if you want to consider the
the core of American US foreign policy
interests they both areas reveal to us
quite a lot about ourselves the reason
is because of our overwhelming influence
in Latin America for over a century in
the Middle East for half a century and
what we find there can tell us a good
deal about who we in fact are a topic
which should be of interest to any
honest person
well discussion of Latin America could
open for example with a Latin American
strategy development workshop in
Washington Pentagon just a year ago
which involved noted academic
specialists and others they concluded to
be mostly quotes they concluded that
current relations with Mexico the
Mexican dictatorship that means it's a
rather brutal dictatorship with a
democratic cover current relations with
the Mexican dictatorship they said are
extraordinarily positive that means that
they're untroubled by such trivialities
as stolen elections death squads and
then I torture scandalous treatment of
workers and peasants ecological
destruction and the interests of private
power and so on but they said that
everything is not rosy there's some
problems on the horizon and the main the
only problem they note is our quote a
democracy opening in Mexico could test
the special relationship by bringing
into office a government more interested
in challenging the United States on
economic and nationalist grounds so
right now everything's fine because it's
just a brutal and murderous dictatorship
but if there's a democracy opening we
may have some problems because a
democracy opening might mean that
various popular interests might be
reflected and that would be harmful to
the u.s. concern which is of course
investment opportunities and the
wealthy classes and so on well that hits
the nail on the head the primary concern
of the United States in the third world
has in fact always has been the problem
of meaningful democracy which is in fact
a threat to power and privilege and that
has to be crushed has to be crushed
abroad and it has to be crushed at home
and without understanding that you
understand very little about domestic or
foreign affairs and or about American
society and culture now of course the
methods for crushing democratic forces
abroad and at home are different abroad
you can do it pretty much in the way
it's done by totalitarian states they
can use violence in fact unrestricted
violence at home over centuries of
popular struggle the capacity of the
state to coerce and control has been
limited so a whole variety of other
devices have been needed but it's been
well understood and it's a major theme
of intellectual discourse if you like
for centuries that methods have to be
found to control and divert what used to
be called the rascal multitude and to
keep them from interfering in what is
none of their business
namely the management of public affairs
as walter Lippmann put it the elements
that rule have to be protected from
meddling and ignorant Outsiders that is
the mass of the population and if you
can't do it by force you do it by other
means well a few weeks after this report
on our extraordinary on the
extraordinarily positive relations with
the Mexican tyranny a leading journal in
Mexico published an article by a
recording on a conference in Mexico
conference on international traffic of
children minors the report quotes a
leading researcher at the National
University the autonomous university in
Mexico from the Institute for law
research who writes that every year
20,000 Mexican children
are sent illegally to the United States
for the use of for organ transplants or
sexual exploitation or various
experimental tests the conference report
also quotes a report of the United
Nations saying that over a million over
a million children a year suffer from
slavery forced participation in criminal
acts prostitution organ transplant sale
to rich countries well is any of this
true the answer that is nobody really
knows and more importantly nobody cares
at least nobody important cares it's not
the kind of thing we discuss around here
but it is the most whether it's true or
not it may be it may not be the interest
and interesting fact about our domains
is that this is very widely believed
there's lots and lots of reports like
this one from all through Latin America
and other parts of the third-world
domains of the United States largely of
the United States that report such
things you can get similar reports from
the London anti-slavery society and
others and whether they're true or not
the fact that they're widely believed
alone is a reflection of the reality of
life in the areas where our influence
has been overwhelming this became much
worse during the Reagan Bush years which
was a period of an enormous catastrophe
of capitalism throughout the entire
world in the aside from the state
capitalist industrial countries
themselves which in various ways were
able to protect themselves from it Latin
America is a striking example we might
proceed with Latin America by quoting
how just pick something that happened to
arrive in the mail yesterday a Latin
American church journal which has an
article from Uruguay by Uruguayan
journalist called the war waged on Latin
American Street kids his translation of
it
and he describes the war I'll give some
quotes the war being waged against
millions of abandoned children
throughout Latin America where death
squads run by the police and financed by
the business sector target and
exterminate street kids who are trying
to survive as beggars thieves
prostitutes drug runners or cheap
factory workers some of the victims are
gunned down while they're sleeping
beneath below bridges on vacant lots and
in doorways others are kidnapped
tortured and killed in remote areas in
Brazil where US influence has been
decisive the takeover the 11 overthrow
of brazilian democracy was described as
the greatest victory for freedom in the
mid 20th century by the administration
when it took place with no little US
support the in Brazil the bodies of
young death squad victims are found in
zones outside the metropolitan areas
with their hands tied showing signs of
torture riddled with bullet holes street
girls are frequently forced to work as
prostitutes in one play town in the
first six months of 1991 a thousand
so-called disposable children were
assassinated in Guatemala City another
place where we have succeeded in
imposing the kind of values we like the
majority of the 5,000 street kids work
as prostitutes they're found in with
their ears cut off and their eyes gouged
out and so on in rio de janeiro and san
paulo reports indicate an average of
three children under the age of 18
killed daily by these death squads
financed by the business business
communities almost all murders have been
attributed to those death squads going
on the journalist points out that this
is a region where a hundred and eighty
three million people live in abject
poverty so that death by violence is
only one of the threats for street
children regional statistics show that
every minute twenty eight children die
from hunger according to UNICEF 69
million children survive by doing
labour robbing running drugs and
prostitution in Ecuador about a hundred
thousand children from age four work ten
to twelve hour shifts in one region in
Western run mostly us run corporations
Panama had some a system for protection
of minors but the minors protective
tribunal buildings were bombed during
the 1989 US invasion rendering work
they're nearly impossible following the
invasion the number of criminal gangs
robbing stores in search of food
increased in Peru 50,000 of the 600,000
children born this year will not survive
their first year in one resilient state
on the Bolivian border
approximately a thousand children work
as slaves extracting ten another two
thousand adolescents work as prostitutes
according to union sources children work
18 hours a day in water up to their
knees and are paid a daily ration of
bananas and boiled yucca reported
according to labor union reports going
on I won't go on reading it and the
journalist ends up saying that until
recently the image of the image of the
abandoned Latin American child was the
was of a ragged child sleeping in a
doorway
today the images of a body lacerated and
dumped in a city slum well we may feel
proud of our contributions to this
picture of capitalist democracy
triumphant in the New World Order and
that's what the New World Order is all
about an intensification of the horrors
of the Old World Order well instead of
continuing through the Latin American
horror chamber which is what it is
I'll turn to the second area the Middle
East and let me just talk about there to
talk about some of their exploits in the
Gulf for example but instead let me talk
about the topic that's on the front
pages right now and has been for the
several last several weeks the what's
called the middle
peace process and in particular the
conference in Madrid this is not now I'm
not going to be giving continuing with
Latin American atrocity stories but
talking about diplomacy nice clean topic
so it won't be so bloody the but let's
have a look and see what we can learn
about ourselves from that well I'm sure
we all read the newspapers and you've
noticed that there is universal acclaim
for the diplomatic triumph of George
Bush and James Baker in Madrid so let me
just remind you of some of the
boilerplate our hero is a quote now our
heroes exploited the historic window of
opportunity opened by their victory in
the Gulf to breathe light into on the
stalled Middle East peace process
showing remarkable courage and vision
that happens to come from Anthony Lewis
who is one of the most critical of US
government commentators on US government
policies anywhere in the mainstream and
it sort of goes from there over to the
real accolades the United States can at
last try to bring about its traditional
goals of land for peace and territorial
compromise and an autonomy for the
Palestinians in the context of a general
peace now that the rejectionists are in
disarray and the Russians are no longer
causing mischief and the bad guys
everywhere know that what we say goes as
the president put it last February
that's also true in Latin America where
what we say goes has been true for a
long time with consequences of the kind
that I've already indicated the news
columns turning from they report with
considerable law that the president is
dreaming great dreams of peace and
justice and of course marching forward
to implement them that's diplomatic
correspondent RW Apple and the New York
Times James Baker is praised for his
diplomatic skills and his tenacity and
putting together what The Times calls
the room
markable tableau in Madrid I should to
be accurate point out that not everyone
agrees that the US has really shown
itself to be an honest broker there are
people who claim that Bush and Baker
have gone too far in allowing their
pro-arab
sympathies to influence what they do but
it's agreed that we're that they're both
well on their way to a well deserved
Nobel Peace Prize well that's sort of
standard but more interesting than this
kind of rather standard sort of
Stalinist style rhetoric it's very
reminiscent of the days of the genius
Stalin and so on for those of you who
remember that kind of stuff but that's
kind of standard but more interesting
than that is the fact that similar
perceptions though without the Stalin
oeid rhetoric are pretty widespread in
substantial parts of Europe and that's
that's more interesting and even in fact
Europe has to a large extent come to
accept the extension of the Monroe
Doctrine to the Middle East which is new
and has also come to accept to a certain
extent the framework of US propaganda
that's also a interesting and a
noticeable shift I think it's one worth
study in itself I think it has to do
with the end of the Cold War maybe a
comment on that later but even more
interesting than that is that the forea
is reaching much further even to towns
and villages in the West Bank and Gaza
where expectations are apparently
running quite high the lead journal of
the current issue of the journal of
Palestine studies the lead article in it
is by an advisor to the Palestinian
Jordanian Palestinian delegation at
Madrid well it's holiday who lords the
personal commitment of the President of
the United States I'm quoting in front
of Congress in the whole world to adjust
and comprehensive settlement and he's
also much impressed by the invigoration
of in
national institutions and the new
recognition that we can't go too far
with double standards in my view so
that's a pretty broad spectrum in my
view this is all total illusion like to
give some indication of why let's just
start with a brief comment on the matter
of error abandonment of double standards
by chance that issue of the Journal of
Palestine studies happen to arrive in my
home in the same day that the lead
front-page story and the newspapers read
us accuses Libya in Pan Am bombing
that's 270 people killed and the
subheading read retaliation Wade's as
White House and the editorials issued
stern calls for just punishment
overflowing with self-righteousness the
news reports told us that this fiendish
act of wickedness had become the
horrific symbol of terrorism quoting the
New York Times
again it was not entirely uniform so the
New York Times ran an op-ed pointing out
that the evidence about Libya was pretty
thin and suggesting some government
duplicity in identifying Libya the
authors accused the government of
letting letting the Palestinians off the
hook at a sensitive moment in the peace
conference and also they charged that
Syria and Iran had been led off the hook
for similar reasons that the authors of
this article representing the dissidents
are Robert and Tamara Kupperman Robert
Kupperman is a leading proponent of
what's called low intensity conflict
author of manuals on how to implement it
efficiently manuals in which he defines
low intensity conflict here's the
definition it's the threat or use of
force to achieve political objectives
without the full-scale commitment of
resources that's to be distinguished
from international terrorism which is
defined in US Army manuals as the use
use of force to attain goals that are
political religious or ideological in
nature in short low intensity conflict
is international terrorism as the
advocates and practitioners of it are
kind enough to inform us and they're not
only in their definitions but also in
the practice so we have a spectrum then
ranging from those who assume that the
government case against Libya was proven
on the obvious grounds that had been
proclaimed and then on the other extreme
we had skeptics who are leading
proponents of international terrorism
and think that the case hasn't quite yet
been proven and we should go after other
favourite enemies like Palestinians so
the issue is should we meet out Stern
justice to Libya alone or also to other
official enemies and should we use
bombing or maybe some other technique
well that's what's known as an
independent press in a free society now
there were some things that were not
discussed at least I don't see him
discussed for example one thing not
discussed was the worst air tragedy of
the decade that was an air bombing of an
Air India plane in 1985 which killed 329
people as a book by Lesley and Andrew
Coburn called out of control which
discusses some of the background for
this apparently the two people who
bombed that were trained in a
paramilitary training camp in Alabama
this was a sting operation that went out
of control the fact that the US had been
involved in training the people who
bombed it was acknowledged a couple of
months later by the Attorney General
Edwin Meese in India who sort of
promised the Indians we'd be careful to
see that that doesn't happen again
but that was not a horrific symbol of
international terrorism and you don't
have huge squads of thousands of people
you know scouring the region to see what
sensors you can discover and so on and
so forth now that one agency mentioned
though it's the
their tragedy of the decade there was
some mention of another air tragedy the
downing of an Iranian commercial jet
with 290 people killed that's also more
than the most horrific symbol of
terrorism of the decade that was
described for example by the the Middle
East correspondent of The Boston Globe
Mary courteous as she put it the
accidental bounding of the Iranian
passenger plane by the USS Vincennes
which is which was part of the naval
Armada that had been sent by George Bush
to help out his pal Saddam Hussein in
the iran-iraq war and in fact the
shooting down of this plane was a rather
decisive event and ending the war on us
turn on the Iraqi meaning US terms
question one might ask is how the news
columns those news columns remember how
can they be so so sure that it was an
accidental bounty
well of course there's an easy answer to
that the US did it and therefore it
follows that it was an accidental
downing just as US international
terrorism is laudable it's low intensity
conflict good thing not terrorism
however not everyone agrees again
there's a spectrum of opinion in this
case for example one of the people who
does not agree is US Navy commander
David Carlson who was the commander of
the vessel right near by the Vincennes
who wrote an article in the US Naval
Institute proceedings in which he
describes some quoting it now how he
wondered aloud in disbelief as they
watched the Vincennes shoot down what
was perfectly obviously a commercial
airliner passenger jet taking off in a
commercial corridor and he his
assumption is this this was out of a
need to prove the viability of its
high-tech missile system
well the commander of the Vincennes
didn't go completely unpunished
the president reacted he gave him
granted him the Legion of Merit Award
along with the officer in charge of
shooting down the commercial airliner
for exceptional in quoting from the
citation exceptionally meritorious
conduct and outstanding service and for
the calm and professional atmosphere
under his command than the Gulf the
shooting down of the airliner was not
mentioned in the citation although
that's the only known action of the
vents in the media kept a dutiful
silence about this at least at home in
more civilized parts of the world like
for example Malaysia third world
journals were quite open about reporting
the facts including the Legion of Merit
Award in reviews of US international
terrorism which they don't understand
this only low intensity conflict an
accidental Libya's response to these
charges was a call for world adhering by
the world court or some other
international inquiry call that was
regarded as reasonable by the Arab
League but of course dismissed here
without any discussion as utter nonsense
that's what's known as invigoration of
international institutions just as what
I just described is what's known as the
abandonment of the double standard well
for those who are willing to consider
fact what I've just mentioned is like a
crumb from a mountain of evidence that
illustrates what a Salvadoran Jesuit
Journal recently described as the
ominous halo of hypocrisy covering us
statements and actions an ominous hail
of hip hello of hypocrisy that sickens
and disgusts any honest person who
suffers through the daily output of the
commissar culture that's a major element
of the new world order just as it was a
major element of the old world order
well let's put that aside and turn to
the third feature that the lead article
in the journal Palestine studies fine so
encouraging along with most other
opinion the personal commitment of the
president to adjust and comprehend
settlement and let me know review at
least what I think is happening seems me
three major questions arise about what's
going on right now one is why is it
happening now why this big diplomatic
flurry right now - is there a break with
traditional American policy and three
what about the apparent conflict between
the United States and Israel well let me
let's start with first why right now and
in fact we might turn back to page one
of the Boston Globe that which has that
lead story about the u.s. charges
against Libya that's the lead story and
by accident or you know because they got
a subversive in the editorial board or
something there's an adjacent story
right next to it which discusses White
House concerns over polls that show that
George Bush is falling rapidly because
of the problems with the domestic
economy well could there be a
correlation between those facts actually
there could be the story of the past ten
years the major story of the past ten
years it is a huge assault against the
general public which familiar with huge
transfer of resources from large part of
the public large majority the public in
fact to wealthy privileged sectors
investors and so on now when a state is
involved in policies of that kind it's
necessary to divert the public the
ignorant and meddling Outsiders somehow
so they don't pay attention to what's
going on around them and that's true
whether it's at the talat Aryan State or
a democratic state and there aren't a
lot of ways to do this two of the ways
are to inspire fear of terrible enemies
who are about to destroy us and that's
got to be accompanied with awe for our
amazing leaders who rise just in time
and save us from destruction so that we
can once again be standing tall as
Ronald Reagan put it when he succeeded
in overcoming the threat to our
existence from Grenada if you can
for our back in fact this is pretty much
the story of the last ten years every
year or two there's some fantastic
threat to our existence but then with
incredible heroism our leader somehow
beats it down and that's a natural
concomitant of the social policies that
are be carrying being carried out
domestically you'd find that in any
state just as another natural
concomitant there's various devices to
set sectors of the targeted populations
the most of the population set them
against each other so they hate each
other and so on instead of paying
attention to what's going on this is all
pretty standard well it's all
particularly important right now
for several reasons for one thing the
the social and economic catastrophe that
resulted from reagan-bush programs is
getting harder and harder to you know
kind of put to the side and where and
where people see it and that means that
efforts that diversion are needed and
rapid and increasing ones secondly there
it's also necessary to divert attention
away from these foreign policy triumphs
that have supposedly you know shown what
great people we are and led to the bush
rhetoric in fact every one of them has
been a complete catastrophe from the
point of view of any human value at
least that's true of Grenada and Panama
and most strikingly recently the Gulf
it's not too pretty to look at the Gulf
after our great triumph there and notice
a couple hundred thousand Corpses
illogical disaster Saddam Hussein firmly
in power thanks to the support given to
him by George Bush and Norman
Schwarzkopf who backed his crushing of
the popular rebellions the shirt Kurdish
and Shiite rebellions the impact for
once I should say gotta give that press
credit the the diplomatic chief
diplomatic correspondent of the New York
Times it's a technical term which means
State Department spokesman in The New
York Times
Thomas Friedman had an accurate
description of what happened he said
that right after the you know George
Bush was out fishing and Norman
Schwarzkopf was you know patting himself
on the back or something at the time
when the when Saddam Hussein was sort of
authorized to take care of the rascal
multitude the explanation that was given
by Friedman expressing the State
Department position is that the United
States was seeking to restore what he
called the best of all worlds that it
the best of all worlds would be a
takeover by some Iraqi generals who
would wield the iron fist much as Saddam
Hussein did in the period up until his
one mistake in life namely when he
stepped on us toes in August 2nd 1990 as
iron as wield the iron fist I said I'm
Hussein had done much to the
satisfaction of the US ally Saudi Arabia
and Turkey and of course the boss in
Washington well that's essentially
correct it'd be a little embarrassing to
just restore Saddam Hussein after the US
but we need a clone we've got to find
somebody exactly like him and surely we
don't want to allow anything as
dangerous as a democracy opening in the
Middle East any more than we want a
democracy opening in Latin America or
for that matter in the United States and
if the way to block it is by supporting
Saddam Hussein's iron fist well you know
in the interests of what's called
pragmatism that's what we have to do
pragmatism is a nice technical term that
meanings doing anything you feel like
for your own interests and therefore we
pursue pragmatism and that overcomes
even our high moral commitments to human
rights and so on and so forth well so
there is a need to divert attention but
still it leaves a kind of a bad taste I
mean maybe the smart guys understand
that this is the right thing to do but
the population having been aroused the
considerable hysteria over the need to
destroy the beast of Baghdad has a kind
of a tough
I'm figuring out these subtle points
about why we're supporting him while
he's massacring everybody in sight the
so you got to overcome that somehow
there are also our regional problems the
Arab tyrannies that lined up in the Gulf
Crusade these are what the British
imperialists in their they called the
Arab facade that manages the local oil
system and the interests of the imperial
powers the British view was that we
should veil absorption of the colonies
behind constitutional fictions such as
buffer state or sphere of influence and
so on but of course as Lord Lloyd George
put it when complimenting the British on
blocking a disarmament international
disarmament agreement he said we have to
reserve the right to bomb the niggers
that's the sort of bottom line so we
reserve the right to bomb niggers but
you got to have this Arab facade out
there that you know you sort of pretend
they're country's but they're actually
managing the local wealth for you and
those guys have a problem too they those
tyrannies or any tyranny to has to
preserve a certain degree of credibility
with population and if they are exposed
as just agents of the United States and
restoring the traditional Anglo American
condominium over the wealth of the
underground in the Arab world
good for them so they need something and
thirdly continuing with the urgency of
the peace process so-called there is in
fact the window of opportunity that's
not a joke it is in fact correct which
is largely correct and saying that what
we say goes and in fact that means that
what you see in the Gulf is what we say
because that's what we want we have held
all the cards and now that what we say
goes we can ram through traditional US
policies which takes us to the second
point what our traditional US policies
and is there a break with them well the
simple answer to the question what are
us
the way in which we're going to you know
get credit for this and the Arab facade
is going to get some credibility is by
dealing with the festering Palestinian
problem the main the simple answer to
what u.s. traditional policy is is very
simple word it has been adamant and
inflexible opposition to the peace
process now before I continue I have to
make a side comment on political
discourse every term of political
discourse has two meanings it has a
dictionary meaning and it has what we
might call the PC meaning the
politically correct meaning that is the
meaning that's used to event advance
power and and they're always different
so for example terrorism in the
dictionary meaning is what the army
manual says the threat the use of use or
threat of force to advance political
ends but in the PC meaning of the word
international terrorism is the threat or
use of force to implement political ends
when it's carried out by others not when
its carried out by the United States or
client States then it has another name
it's called retaliation or defense of
freedom or something like that
the same is true of the term democracy
there's a dictionary meaning in which
the state is democratic societies
democratic to the extent that the
population has some meaningful way of
participating and managing their own
affairs but then there's the PC meaning
in which democracy means the rule by
elements that appreciate the
transcendent needs of those who own
American society and therefore must
govern it I borrow one of the favorite
Maxim's of the founding fathers that's
the principle on which the country was
founded and the only those who
understand that are capable of
participating in democracy and the PC
sense well the same is true with the
term peace process there's a dictionary
meaning in which the peace process means
something like efforts to advance peace
and
there's the PC meaning in which the
peace process refers to whatever the US
happens to be doing at the moment if
what the US happens to be doing at the
moment is undermining the peace process
and borrowing the peace process at every
turn that's the peace process actually
it's all quite simple once you
understand the rules the reason for
institutions like universities is to
teach you the rules so don't forget to
do your homework but once you figure all
this stuff out you can play the game
rather we'll well breaking the rules and
keeping to English instead of PC
language the traditional US policy has
been - has been as I said rigid
opposition to the peace process rigid
inflexible in variant opposition to the
peace process which is why it never gets
anywhere you can see this very clearly
if you look at the more or less
irrelevant factual record the record is
irrelevant because it's not politically
correct it teaches the wrong lessons but
let's look at it anyway if you look at
the for example you could start with the
UN General Assembly the UN General
Assembly has a vote every they meet
every winter and they have a vote every
year on advancing the peace process I
won't run through the whole record but
the last one was December 1990 when the
vote was 144 to 2 United States and
Israel and that's the way it is all the
way back
it's always something like that you know
into - we're in is everybody who wasn't
asleep that day or something like that
and - is the United States and Israel
sometimes with varies a little in 1989 I
was 150 one two three four completely
unexplained reasons Dominica joined with
some insight into that but in effect
it's the US and Israel blocking the
peace process at the General Assembly
well what about the Security Council
notice incidentally the United States a
very powerful country that means when
the US vote if there's a vote at the
General Assembly which is let's say
you're in sixty to one and so on and
things like that happen pretty commonly
if the one is the United States its veto
that's what it means to be in a position
to be able to assert what we say goes
the
what about the Security Council well of
course that's out because they're the
United States can just flat veto
everything as in fact it's been doing
since 1976 in 1976 first major u.s. veto
the the there was a resolution which
called for quoted a settlement a peace
settlement on the pre-1967 borders
arab-israeli settlement that means the
internationally recognized borders with
guarantees for the sovereignty
territorial integrity and political
dependence of all states in the area and
their right to live in peace within
secure and recognized boundaries
including Israel and a new Palestinian
state in the West Bank and Gaza that was
introduced to the Security Council by
Jordan Syria and Egypt it was openly but
it was backed by virtually the whole
world it was publicly backed by the PLO
according to Israel the current
President of Israel time Hertzog who was
then UN ambassador it was not only
backed by the PLO but actually prepared
by the PLO another example of their
terrorist past it was vetoed by the
United States it is therefore out of
history try to find it in records of the
peace process or documentary collections
and so on in short it's just not
politically correct there have been the
same thing happened in 1980 but in
effect the Security Council was ruled
out as an agency for advancing the peace
process the United State there have been
a series of other proposals rejected by
the United States and as opposed to the
many others I won't run through the
record now the u.s. a very powerful
country so we can block a proposal by
just saying no period Israel is less
powerful and therefore they have to be a
little more vigorous in their opposition
so in the case of the 1976 Security
Council resolution while the u.s. just
vetoed it Israel reacted differently
they reacted by bombing Lebanon killing
about 50 people in a raid that was
described
in fact even reported as having no not a
reaction to anything which was not
exactly correct it was actually
retaliation against the United Nations
for considering this resolution and in
1980 when Saudi Arabia announced the
so-called THAAD plan which again sort of
along the same lines most of those plans
are along the same lines Israel reacted
according to the Israeli press by
sending phantoms which probably means
nuclear-armed phantoms over the oil
field and the Hebrew press pointed out
that foreign intelligence agencies are
digging into their files to look up
their records on the capacity of Israel
to destroy the oil fields meaning which
too far we things we can do well that's
the way a smaller and weaker country has
to respond the u.s. it's just simpler we
just say no and that means it's off the
agenda and it's out of history if you
have a well-disciplined commissar class
at least well this problem continued
through the 1980s Yasser Arafat for
example kept annoying everybody by
calling for negotiations with Israel
leading to mutual recognition this
required considerable acrobatics in the
doctrinal institutions so for example
we'll take a typical case the chief
current chief diplomatic correspondent
in new york times again Thomas Friedman
who was Jerusalem correspondent then he
had to do things like say when if
headlines when the Israeli press said
our I thought offers negotiations Paris
supposed to be the dove says no there
had to be an article by Thomas Friedman
a couple of days later saying the
Israeli peace movement has never been
more distraught there are no
Palestinians to talk to interview with
Shimon Peres saying if only there were
some Palestinians as beautiful as we are
we could settle all of this but
unfortunately they're all terrorists who
won't talk to us and that routine went
on year after year the New York Times
even refused to publish in honor if you
suppose the facts but even refused to
publish letters referring to the fact
and occasionally even went as far as
writing to correspondence explaining
that they were not going to allow
letters on it
thank you some of those are around it
was all done quite brilliantly the
result was to craft a version of history
which has no relation whatsoever to the
fact actually it has a relation to the
facts for the logicians in the audience
the relation of contradiction but apart
from that has no relation to the facts
but does have striking utility for a
power and that was achieved in a manner
which would have been be much admired by
any totalitarian state now there are
reasons for this there are reasons why
the United States has been constantly
opposed to the peace process it has two
features that the United States will not
accept one is it calls for an
international conference and remember
the Monroe Doctrine has been extended to
the Middle East long ago it's too
important to allow anybody to interfere
that's us
turf nobody's allowed in so no
international conference to every call
for all international efforts to advance
the peace process have at least a
rhetorical commitment whether anybody
believes it or not but they have some
rhetoric about self-determination for
the Palestinians and that's unacceptable
to the United States not cross the US
has anything particular against the
Palestinians they basically don't exist
but because that would entail Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied territories
and it's been US policy that they should
essentially maintain continued control
over those territories so therefore for
those two reasons the US has always
blocked the peace process
now turning to Madrid you'll notice that
it overcomes these two defects it's
completely unilateral nobody else was
allowed in actually to be more precise
Gorbachev was invited in but that's
because he is the completely powerless
leader of a non-existent state and
therefore he could provide a certain
kind of propaganda cover and people
could talk about international
conference but anyone who had even you
know
met the minimal condition of existence
would not be allowed in secondly you'll
notice again that there were nothing for
the Palestinians in fact that's built
into the very structure of the
conference they are part of a joint
palestinian jordanian delegation which
is the traditional US policy that there
is no independent Palestinian
nationalism and snow no issue for them
to talk about and the outcome of both
that meeting and any aftermath will be
determined by US policy so going back to
that what is US policy well here you can
find out actually there's the US
government has been kind enough to
inform us there's the public record
can't find it in the media as far as I'm
aware but it's there you can pull out
the documents some of it is even in the
media occasionally the US position was
made very clear in fall of 1989 by James
Baker with what was then called the
Baker plan the Baker plan then had to do
with negotiations between Jordan Israel
and Egypt with some Palestinians who we
like allowed in but the and Baker
presented five points and the five
points were that you read him in the
State Department bulletins that one
point was directed to the Palestinians
it said that any Palestinians who are
permitted in by their overseers the
United States and Israel will be
permitted to discuss one topic namely
implementation of the so-called Shamir
plan and in cart in public statements at
the same time Baker made it clear and
explicit that as he put it the only plan
under consideration is the Shamir plan
there is no other initiative on the
table so we want to find out what US
policy is we turn to the Shamir plan
which is in fact the Shamir paris plan
the coalition plan of the labor Likud
government two major parties in Israel
which had been put forth in May and was
now endorsed and the Shamir Paris plan
has actually Amir Peretz Baker plan has
three basic principles principle one
says
there can be I'm putting it there can be
no additional Palestinian state meaning
there already is a Palestinian state
named Jordan and if Palestinians and
Jordanians and the rest of the world
don't agree that just shows they're kind
of you know anti-semites or ignorant
Arabs or something like that so there's
no issue of Palestinian
self-determination there already is a
Palestinian state that's Jordan and
there can't be an additional one point
number two says there can be no change
in the status of the occupied territory
unoccupied of the territories meaning
Gaza Strip and West Bank except in
accordance with the basic guidelines of
the government government of Israel
which bar any form of Palestinian
self-determination the point number
three says no PLO meaning Palestinians
can't pick their own negotiation
representatives even to sign a
capitulation at point four there's a
fourth point that says there will be
what are called free elections run under
Israeli military control and a
television set you know what that means
with most of the Palestinian national
leadership rotting away in prison camps
without charges those are free elections
so that's it that's the Shamir Paris
Baker plan nothing much has changed
there since sometimes it's called
autonomy that's the current term for it
in the Israeli press more honest than
here one of the leading and most
respected Israeli journalists Annie
Rubenstein right in the mainstream and
no particular Dov recently just a couple
of weeks ago described autonomy as the
kind of autonomy that exists in a
prisoner of war camp where the prisoners
are autonomous I'm quoting it where the
prisoners are autonomous to cook their
own meals and run cultural events
furthermore he went on to say the
autonomy is exactly what the
Palestinians have now namely the right
to run their own services and there's a
reason for that he explained he's
pointed out that even the most extreme
expansionists greater israel enthusiasts
don't call for literal annexation of the
territories because that would have a
problem associated with it it would mean
you would have to extend to the
Dory's Israeli law including the minimal
services that are provided for the
second-class citizens of Israel itself
the Arab citizens he said that probably
bankrupt the Treasury and he estimates a
probably double li income in the
territories so it's much more efficient
just to have heavy taxation but to
provide nothing in return
under autonomy namely the autonomy of a
prison camp well that's what is being
offered now exactly as it was offered
Camp David that's why it's so praised in
the United States well looking back
there's a history to this somebody
stopped me if a a little bit of history
it's worth looking at US policy has
undergone some changes from 1967 to 1971
u.s. policy called for it was right in
the mainstream it called for
implementation of what was then the
international consensus which meant a
political settlement on the internet pre
June 67 borders with the wording that I
just read that was actually drawn from
the resolutions of the time reiterated
in nineteen seventy six territorial
guarantees and security and right to
live in peace and so on and so forth at
that time there was nothing for the
Palestinians okay they weren't part of
it it was just a settlement on those
borders official US policy said that
there might be minor territorial
adjustments which would furthermore be
mutual minor and mutual territorial
adjustments just to fix things up but
that was the position in February 1971 a
problem arose president Sadat of Egypt
offered a peace treaty in those terms
virtually identical with the terms of
official US policy Israel rejected it
calling for looking for bigger that was
under the dugs incidentally the Labour
Party looking for broader territorial
gains and the United States had to
decide whether to pursue its own policy
or to change that policy oh it was a
kind of an internal you're a kradic
conflict Henry Kissinger won out he was
the National Security Advisor and
pursued his policy which was what he
called stalemate keep things the way
they are no peace treaty Israel
responded to Sadat's offer by
recognizing it
peace treaty the us-backed the rejection
that's a big split in change in US
policy actually coincidentally that
happens to be the month in which George
Bush appeared on the national scene as
UN Ambassador although he has nothing to
do with the policy any probably any more
she does know but the ever since then
the US policy has been flatly
rejectionist and separated from the rest
of the world in the manner that I
described now from 71 the 73 was that
was a period of for those of you know
this history of great triumphalism both
in the US and Israel the assumption was
that Israel had overwhelming military
power you could disregard the Arabs
altogether as the former chief of
military intelligence in Israel yo chef
at har cubby no ad of incidentally as he
put it at the time war is not the Arabs
game they don't know which end of the
gun the whole so we can just keep the
stalemate Kissinger accepted that so
there was no need to respond to Sadat
offers or anything now in October 1973
those illusions were shattered turns out
they did know which end of the guns
behold there was a kind of a newer thing
policy had to shift Kissinger who was no
great genius does understand things like
violence pretty good understanding of
that and he could see that the Arab had
it you know so therefore you had to pay
attention to them and therefore at US
policy shifted and it shifted in the
perfectly natural way since Egypt could
not simply be dismissed as a basket case
the thing to do was to incorporate it
into the US system that is to accept so
that's actually long-standing offers to
turn Egypt into a US client state and to
remove it from the conflict there that's
the major Arab military force and if you
remove it from the conflict you've
essentially eliminated the only Arab
deterrent which means that Israel is
then free to continue to pursue the
major policies which u.s. supports and
pays for namely integrating the occupied
territories and attacking
northern neighbor Lebanon well that is
the Camp David agreement the Kissinger
shuttle diplomacy was culminated in the
Camp David agreement which had exactly
these properties and I was quite obvious
at the time to anyone who was willing to
look at the facts without ideological
blinkers and it's incidentally conceded
in retrospect it's called ironic ironic
is another one of those technical terms
which refers to the predictable
consequences of intended us actions
which happen to conflict erratically
with the professed values so that's
what's called ironic and the political
science literature and so on but and
that's a term that applies very broadly
to almost everything but that was Raonic
but as I say it was obvious to any
ten-year-old at the time it's now
conceded well that's exactly what Israel
did of course with huge USA the Carter
Administration raised aid to the
stratosphere so that Israel could in
fact continue to do this with the Arab
deterrent removed
well then comes the invasion of Lebanon
actually it was 1 in 78 another in 1982
its purpose was to destroy the moderates
in the PLO that was again conceded
that's widely conceded and pointed out
at the time I'm conceded proclaimed in
the Israeli literature general Harkavy
he pointed out that this was a war for
the West Bank
the problem was PLO moderation they kept
making these annoying demands for
negotiations leading the mutual
recognition and so on and that's no good
we wanted to go back to terrorism like
shooting down planes and that kind of
stuff then they're easy to deal with the
point was actually put rather well by
the editor of the New Republic martin
peretz
in a speech in in an interview in israel
right on the eve of the night right
before the 1982 invasion he advised
Israel on quoting to administer to the
PLO in Lebanon a lasting military defeat
that will clarify to the Palestinians in
the West Bank that their struggle for an
independent state has suffered a setback
of many years
then the Palestinians will return be
turned into just another crushed nation
like the Kurds and the Afghans and their
problems which are beginning to be
boring will be forgotten well you know
it's possible that with regard to the
Afghans that if you go to some of the
more extreme Stalinist elements and the
Communist Party bureaucracy
you could hear similar comments on the
Afghans back in those days and I should
say that Paris's comments his attitude
toward the Kurds do rather accurately
capture US policy toward them as we've
just seen again well that's us Paula it
stays like that until today now there's
a spectrum as always there the Hawks and
the doves so let's look according to
Hawks the Palestinians deserve nothing
like other crushed nations and then
there's the doves and here a good
example is Thomas Friedman again on the
occasion of his receipt of the Pulitzer
Prize for his reporting in Israel he had
several interviews an Israeli press
where he advised Israel to run the
occupied territories in the manner in
which they run south Lebanon now that
means under the control of a terrorist
mercenary army which with big prison
camps where you hold hundreds of torture
chambers actually we hold hundreds of
hostages to ensure that the villages
submit to the rule of the terrorist
mercenary force and you know you bomb
beyond the borders when you feel like it
and so on so that's a proper way to run
the occupied territories however
remember that this is a dove speaking so
his position is you should give the
Palestinians something right and what he
actually said is if he said if you if
you give quoting if you give off net a
seat in the bus he may limit his demands
so you ought to give off that a seat in
the bus well you know again you could
imagine some but maybe there's something
you know Nazi somewhere who's advising
the Syrians that they should run what is
now Israel the way they run the Bekaa
Valley in Lebanon but they should give
Jaime a seat in the bus because then
maybe a limit is the
there would be the doves or maybe
somebody's advising South Africa that
you should give Sambo a seat at the bus
and maybe I'll shut up or something well
that's the does so again there is a
spectrum and we learn a little more
about ourselves by looking at it well
the the doves view view is that the
Palestinians should be given a seat in
the bus namely autonomy the autonomy of
a prison camp basically what they have
now but nothing more no citizenship no
independence the great achievement of
the Madrid conference and the one that's
called forth such raptures in the
American press is that the Palestinian
representatives permitted in by the
United States have partially agreed to
this so the news cut actually the
Israeli Lobby is naturally quite
enthusiastic the New York Times the
other day has an op-ed by the Deputy
Director of something called The
Washington Institute for Near East
policy which is an organization that
journalists go to when they don't want
to express their own opinions but they
want their support for Israeli policies
expressed for them by an objective
outsider that's a standard journalistic
trick the Washington Institute for Near
East policy has no other function as far
as I'm aware than to provide such
statements and it it's deputy director
notes on quoting and that gains were
made in Madrid the Palestinians reversed
the 13 their 13-year rejection of
autonomy which was called for in the
Camp David Accords the Accords welcomed
by Menachem Bagan because they removed
the Arab deterrent from the conflict and
offered Palestinians the autonomy of a
prisoner of war camp as the mainstream
Israeli press points out well the news
columns in the US are much impressed by
what they call putting the New York
Times the Palestinians self-adjustment
to the real world that is the acceptance
of a period of autonomy under Israeli
domination during which Israel can
establish the facts of permanent
domination with enormous subsidies from
US taxpayers the idea is that
that aphid has limited his demands he's
praised for what is called the new
pragmatism this willingness to accept
half a loaf under Israeli domination
instead of the all-or-nothing demands
that's referring to the demands for
self-determination in a Palestinian
state alongside Israel a totally absurd
idea supported only by the entire world
outside the United States and it's
Israeli client and therefore by
definition extremists rejectionist and
not pragmatic pragmatic means
self-adjustment to the real world which
is what we say goes if you do that then
the news columns are willing to welcome
you as pragmatic that's Clyde Haberman
and the same is true of a host of others
I won't bother referring to it the in
fact so much of it that I won't know too
late to talk about but its standard open
the press at random and you'll find
similar praise for the new pragmatism in
until 1988 continuing the history a
little bit the US was quite satisfied
with the status quo as was Israel in
1988 the Intifada was beginning to raise
some costs costs for Israel to control
it costs for the US which in fact was
becoming something of a laughingstock
internationally because of the
increasingly desperate insistence that
the Palestinians were not repeating
magic words produced by George Shultz
for them to say it became a joke in fact
so the u.s. made the obvious decision to
pretend that the Palestinians had
capitulated and impose upon them the
u.s. position say okay they accepted our
position there's actually a name for
that and the diplomatic literature it's
called the trollop ploy referring to
trollop now this was done by the Kennedy
administration who you remember we're
big intellectuals so they heard things
like novels and the references to a
trollop novel where the heroine
interprets a meaningless gesture by the
hero or whatever an offer of marriage so
the trick is if you're really stuck in a
diplomatic corner what you should do if
you have enormous power and control
over the world information system is
pretend that the other guys accepted
your demands and then stick them with it
and count on the media and the academic
scholarship and so on to say yeah they
capitulated your demands and in
mid-december 1988 George Bush George
Shultz that was at the time went through
this comic act claimed that Yasser
Arafat had said the magic words in fact
he'd been zenny literate person could
see he was saying exactly what he'd been
saying for years it was just as far from
the US demands as ever and though
Palestinians motion could ever accept
the actual u.s. demands but now they
were stuck with it because George Shultz
had said so and everybody repeated it so
that end of that story
the US then moved to what we're caught
what was called a dialogue with the
Palestinians they were offered a chance
to opportunity to have tea and the
Masters at a chamber where they were
told in the first meeting transcripts
were leaked and published in Israel and
they night and and Egypt not here though
they were in English in the Jerusalem
posts or if I could read them the
transcripts of the first meeting the
u.s. told Palestinian representatives
that they should understand two things
one there would be no international
conference so forget about that and two
they should call off the Intifada or
what the US described as the riots which
we regard as terrorism against the State
of Israel so in other words go back to
the previous status quo and forget about
any political settlement and then we'll
agree to talk to you well this was
understood very well within Israel I
should say the Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin of the dovish Labor Party had a
meeting with peace now leaders shortly
after the opening of the dialogue and he
told them don't worry about it it's
quite okay we're in favor of it
he said the dialogue is a low-level
dialogue which is completely meaningless
and which will provide us he said with a
year or more to crush the Intifada by
force and he assured them they will be
crushed well that's what happened they
were crushed there
a limit to what flesh and blood can
endure violence works the dialogue
divert that intent attention as needed
as intended then came along the
diplomatic initiative to divert the
daned the bush Baker Paris Shamir plan
purpose of which was to divert any
attempt to implement the real peace
process that brings us right up till
today that's as far as I can see that's
what's happening at Madrid well just
last comment there is a you know there's
some thinking behind this there is a
strategic conception behind it it's one
which is more or less permanent no it's
part of the old world order the new
world order you know the next 10 years
in the world order and so on the
strategic conception about the Middle
East is pretty simple the major issue
there is the energy reserves the US has
to control them nobody else is allowed
to interfere u.s. turf too important
there's a method for controlling them
the method is first of all to construct
an Arab facade family dictatorships
which sort of manage it for us very weak
so we have to worry about them they the
Arab facade has to be protected from the
population of the region that requires
regional enforcers that's the second
part preferably non Arab they have an
easier time killing Arabs
so that's Turkey Iran Israel Pakistan
provides kind of praetorian guard for
the Saudi elite and so on it's what Ben
Gurion used to call a periphery pact so
there's this regional enforcer system
and then in the background that the guys
with the real muscle US and Britain in
case things get out of control that's
the system and that doesn't change very
much now anyone who contributes to this
system has some rights the Arab facade
obviously contributes they manage the
oil wealth for us the regional enforcers
contribute they have rights we obviously
had rights in fact ultimately the only
ones who do and so to where British
lieutenant as sort as long as they
remain a lieutenant the what about the
Palestinians well they don't contribute
to this
they don't have wealth they're not power
in fact there are damn nuisance they
stir up Arab nationalism you know that
is these pressures for these Democratic
openings that are always a problem so
they have a negative value in fact and
since they have no that contribute
nothing to our domination of the region
it follows by quite simple logic know
that they have no human rights
whatsoever
that's elementary principles of
statecraft human rights depend on your
contribution to the needs of power and
profit other other than that you know
irrelevant well they don't have any
rights in fact they probably have
negative rights as I mentioned they're
even a nuisance and from that you can
pretty well predict US policy and in
fact it works pretty well remember this
stuff is not quantum physics you don't
have to have be a big thinker to
understand that big efforts are made in
the academic disciplines and elsewhere
to make it look difficult but in fact
it's all pretty straightforward and I
think least to my knowledge there's
almost nothing in International Affairs
or any of this stuff that again a
literate teenager couldn't figure out in
a few minutes and that's pretty much the
way it works and if you understand it
you can see what's going on and you can
usually predict pretty well what's going
to happen I have to remember to
translate politically correct discourse
back into English so you can get out of
those problems but that's not too hard
either well that the the thinking with
regard to the Palestinians the position
really has not changed as far as I'm
aware since about 1948 at that time back
in 1948 the Joint Chiefs of Staff
already recognized Israel they were
impressed by Israel's military victories
and they recognized it as a as the
second most powerful regional military
force and a possible potential base for
u.s. power that relationship then got
established in later years that there's
no time to discuss there was also a
discussion of the Palestinians the
Israeli Foreign records show it the u.s.
didn't talk about it much and didn't
care about them but the foreign ministry
in Israel Moshe show rates foreign
ministry this isn't sound like that it
does
that in their internal records that the
Palestinians they said will be they will
be crushed they will be dispersed like
human waste and joined the most
impoverished masses in the Arab world so
there's nothing no worry about them as
martin peretz put it they're just
another crush nation like the kurds and
therefore there's nothing much to we
have to pay much attention to them
that's been the policy ever since and as
I just mentioned that was a beens
statement to the peace now leaders in
February 1989 he assured them that they
will be broken well will they be broken
actually the answer doesn't lie in the
Middle East it lies in the hands of
those who are funding the operation
there is certainly no hope in the
president any faith and the president's
noble intentions or other illusions
rather it's necessary to do some other
things first one is to clear away the
mountains of rubble that conceal the
events of history not only in this case
but in almost every other one to view
what's happening without any illusions
and to create public pressures that can
put an end to the extreme rejectionist
policies that the United States has been
pursuing virtually alone in the world if
we're honest we will also be able to see
that this is true in Central America and
indeed throughout the subject domains
generally what is euphemistically called
the South the president is right to a
degree when he says what that what we
say goes what remains to be determined
is what we choose to be
[Applause]
[Music]
allegations and about the articles that
came out in Newsweek and the New
Republic yeah describe the October
Surprise allegations not particularly
tell the honest truth haven't really
followed it much and the reason I
haven't followed as much as I just don't
think it's all that important tell you
the truth I mean I wouldn't regard it as
particularly surprising if the Reagan
Bush administration had tried to figure
out a way to make a deal with the
ayatollah khomeini to hold off on the
hostages until they until after the
election however i think that how many
would have done it whether they made any
effort or not I think that Reagan and
Khomeini you know the Reagan I Reagan
didn't exist but the people around
Reagan and how meny probably recognized
each other as the kind of folk who can
do business with each other you know you
know they're that kind of guys we like
they didn't particularly like Carter who
wasn't all that different but had these
annoying characteristics of coming out
with sermons about human rights and so
on which didn't have a lot of effect in
policy but kind of we're irritating the
Reagan Bush people were just straight
you know - straight thugs they get along
with each other just fine
and it would have made a lot of sense
for the Irate for Iran to deal with them
rather than Carter so whether the
allegations are true or not I don't
think they would have had a lot of
effect on anything that happened as to
their possible connection to the north
nor do I find it in the least surprising
that people should try to steal
elections I mean that's just standard
everybody tries to do that the so I
don't understand what maybe I'm missing
something but I don't understand what
the importance of the issue is if it's
supposed to have something to do with
the Iran with the sale of u.s. arms to
Iran via Israel that's almost certainly
false because there's a real logical
problem there that you have to deal with
quite apart from what the facts may be
so suppose we grant the whole story
suppose we gray
that you know William Casey or somebody
made a deal with the ayatollah to hold
back on the hostages and in return the
US was going to send arms to iran so
let's say we believe that for the sake
of argument okay
ayatollah khomeini holds up his end of
the bargain the hostages are held reagan
comes in now then we ask the following
question why does the u.s. send arms to
iran i mean that was the what it was
supposed to explain but it doesn't
explain it we still have to ask why did
the u.s. send arms to iran was it
because they made a promise you know
they're so honorable that if they made a
promise to the ayatollah khomeini they
got to live up to it well we can put
that one aside is it they're afraid that
the ayatollah khomeini is going to go to
the new york times and say hey these
guys made a promise and they didn't live
up to it well you know forget about that
one in fact there's no reason why they
should have lived up to it but it's true
that they did send arms to iran via
israel and this can't be the reason and
just to close the story off we know the
reason the reason was explained very
clearly 10 years ago
by in the public record in fact i
actually a book about it it came out of
it ten years ago that quote you know a
lot of stuff about it from the public
record there were no hostages around
that had nothing to do with hostages and
the story was explained by the top
israeli officials who were involved
LeBron II who was the essential amount
of the Ambassador do we ran David Kim
fee who was the deputy director of
Mossad in fact all the guys who later
surfaced in the Iran in the in the
iran-contra story it was mostly a
cover-up and they explained the reasons
straight out and they were perfectly
coherent and standard and in fact normal
they said that where they're sending
armed us is sending arms to Iran via
Israel in order to try to overthrow the
regime the u.s. didn't particularly like
the regime it wanted to restore nor did
Israel they wanted to restore something
like the Shah
we need an iron fist in the kind of
hands we can trust like generals and
there's a standard way to overthrow a
civilian regime that you don't like and
that is to send arms to the military I
mean after all who's going to overthrow
the regime you know I mean
civil rights workers you know the people
who will overthrow the regime of the
military so you establish contacts with
them and one way to establish contacts
is sending arms and another way is
military training and so on that's in
fact the purpose of a lot of the
military missions throughout the world
to keep a grip on civilian regime so if
they get at it in trouble you know they
don't like to think that democracy
openings or that sort of thing we can
control them and it's done standardly
almost reflexively and it often works so
for example when the u.s. overthrew the
democratic government in chile
throughout that whole period where they
trying to overthrow the government they
were arming the military when the US was
trying to overthrow the Indonesian
government back in the early 60s it was
sending arms to the military and as
McNamara later testified that to
Congress he said that paid dividends the
army actually overthrew the regime and
incidentally he slaughtered about half a
million people so I was happy about it
but that standard and it's appears that
that's exactly what was going on in the
early 80s it certainly didn't have
anything do with hostages because there
weren't any so it doesn't seem to me
that the October Surprise would tell you
anything even if it were true this is
one of the reasons honestly pay the
honest truth hadn't really pursued it
and have no opinion about whether the
facts are right or wrong there's a
two-part question really one part is
that ever since the Second World War
we've basically been told that the
reason for our large defense
expenditures were to counteract the
Soviet threat now that the Soviet Union
was completely situated has gone
bankrupt our defense spending has gone
down by insensible amounts and that
seems to me to lead to the question what
was the real purpose
to build up since it doesn't seem to
diminish when the threat goes away and
they're there by what what are the
current reasons for our largest managers
and what can we expect in the future
tied to that is that now there's a
growing awareness on a lot of people's
part about the environment
and the fact that we're going off the
into the scale in terms of putting foods
into the atmosphere and your tune of air
and water and there's a lot of concern
on many people's part because of that
and yet the government resources they're
our focus in terms of taking care of
problems order to tackle that requires a
radical response because when a
radically new situation turns over we go
into the environment in the last 10
years for instance we bankrupted our own
government by adding our large defense
expenditures to during the Reagan years
which is doubled and tripled the
national debt and ends up costing us an
interest payments 200 billion dollars a
year at this point what happens with our
military spending is we're spending half
our over-budget part of it for the
interest payments for the past military
buildup my report and so the focus in
the rule piece that was afterwards
two questions what about the Pentagon
budget it's perfectly true that people
were told for years that it was defend
ourselves against the Russians but that
was about as plausible as the fact that
you know we have to defend ourselves
from you know Hispanic narco terrorists
or something else of course that was
never the reason then it was always
perfectly obvious that that was never
the reason and the internal record makes
it entirely clear that it would be never
the reason and that's exactly why it
continues now exactly pretty much the
way it did before the reasons for the
military budget were real and they were
significant we might as well understand
them that's why they're going to go on
one reason for the military budget is
its domestic every there isn't any such
thing as a capitalist society and in
fact it couldn't survive for a week
every society has a powerful state which
carries out programs typically for the
benefits of those who own the society
and we do too and our state has to
funnel resources to the advanced sectors
of Industry public resources so the
public people like you have to pay the
costs of research and development for
high-tech industry and you have to
provide a state guaranteed market for
excess production so that advanced
sectors of industry can remain
competitive this means like computers
and lasers and everything else and for
all kinds of reasons which we could go
into the make the main mechanism for
that in the United States has been the
Pentagon system so that you know you
look at the history of the development
of computers well its way it works and
so that and that remains constant you
know it doesn't change by now there's
sort of institutionally embedded
secondly the Pentagon system does have a
role its role is to do what it's always
done namely intervention in the third
world some somebody has to make sure
that those people don't raise their
heads you know that they fulfill their
service function the function of
providing resources and raw materials
and cheap labor and opportunities for
investment and export of pollution and
so on and so forth and if they have
funny ideas about democracy openings and
that kind of thing somebody has to make
sure that you knock those ideas out of
their head and that requires
intervention forces and
international terrorism called
low-intensity conflict there's some
other thing and economic warfare and
various other things well why do we need
things like nuclear weapons well the
fact is that you know it takes over the
u.s. is a global power that means we're
often carrying out intervention in areas
where we don't have a conventional force
advantage and you have to make sure you
intimidate everybody properly so nobody
gets in our way you know so you have to
a very intimidating military posture as
long as the Russians were there was the
Russians played a role in this the
Russians were a deterrent that's what is
a technical term for that too it's
called fighting with one hand behind
their backs like the Vietnam War was
supposed to be you know we made this
mistake of fighting out with one hand
behind our backs meaning there was
always a fear that if you went too far
you might run into the Russians and they
got missiles and nuclear weapons and all
that kind of stuff
a mother principle of statecraft if any
of you are going into government is that
you never attack anybody who might be
able to shoot back
you only attack completely defenseless
people and you want to make sure that
you don't run into trouble so if there
is some powerful military force around
you have to fight with one hand behind
your back that's kind of bad and we
needed this and it is completely
explicit incidentally even in the open
public record say go back to the 19
around 1980 and you look at Carter's
Secretary of Defense Harold Brown or
Eugene Rostow of the Reagan
administration the same time they both
pointed out that our strategic nuclear
forces provide an umbrella within which
under which our conventional forces can
be used as meaningful instruments of
political control
you know I've translated the simple
English if we can intimidate people with
a big threatening military posture we
can use our conventional forces to do
the usual thing intervention and
subversion and so on and that still
remains in fact the problem that you
mentioned though that the problem of the
disappearance of the Russians leads to
rhetorical changes in this and even some
technical changes like weapons systems
change it but but the problem was in
fact dealt with in the public record
again every year in a spring the White
House delivers to Congress something
called I think it's called the National
all stretch TJ survey or some such thing
in which the white house presents to
Congress in a glossy booklet in simple
language they understand that the
reasons why we need a much military
force because we're threatened by
enemies even greater than before so
therefore we need x y&z the bottom line
is always the same and for a long time
the argument was more or less the same
you know the Russians etc after the fall
of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 when
you couldn't even pretend anymore that
the Russians are around the first of
these was produced in March 1990 and
it's public record you can get it and
you read it you notice that the bottom
line is the same you know we need a huge
military force and we need to make sure
that the industrial base is for military
expenditures is still there so don't
forget plenty of money for the
electronics industry and so on and why
do we need it well it's not the Russians
anymore you know you can't conjure them
up the reason was the growing
technological sophistication of third
world countries and in fact if you'll
notice we now need Star Wars for that
reason in fact we need Star Wars because
somebody's got to fund the computer
industry and produce lasers and so on
but since the Russians aren't around
we now need Star Wars because of the
growing technological sophistication of
third world nations and since the
Russians aren't around other rhetoric
had the change and was interesting to
watch it the they said they pointed out
this is March 1990
you know while George Bush and Saddam
Hussein are still great buddies they
pointed out that the main problem is
going to be the Middle East where we
have to have extensive intervention
forces that will be able to move in
there in case you know anybody does
funny things or a doctor and remember
and they pointed out that main target of
intervention forces will be the Middle
East and then comes the following phrase
where the threats to US interest could
not be laid at the Kremlin's door okay
so now that the Russians are gone you
can concede what was always obvious the
Russians had nothing to do with it it
was always indigenous threats just as it
is everywhere in the world people have
these nationalist
tendencies or they try for democratic
openings or you know priests organized
Bible study groups that begin to lead
the peasant associations all kind of
rotten stuff goes on and you need
intervention forces to stop that and now
that we can we have to you know the
Russians aren't around we can concede
that the threats to our interests were
not at the Kremlin's door but we still
need exactly what we needed before and
in fact if you take a look it's take a
look at what's happening I mean again
like I said it's not very deep it's
pretty trivial the Berlin Wall fell in
1918 the set in November 1989 a month
later the United States invaded Panama
okay
restored the 10% white minority you know
the money launderers the bankers and
those guys eliminated whatever populist
elements remained from the three hos
years took over control of the military
forces which were out of control
eliminated any possible threat the US
the nomination of the canal that killed
a couple hundred maybe a couple thousand
people you know nobody cares the it was
like a footnote to history you know it's
so incident and 'red that it doesn't
even barely deserves to be mentioned in
the historical record but there wasn't
one innovation it was the first time in
70 years that you couldn't say you were
defending yourself against the Russians
because the Berlin Wall had just fallen
so if you remember we were defending
ourselves against the arch maniac
Noriega who was going to lead words of
Hispanic drug peddlers to destroy our
society and that game was played for a
couple of weeks until it was over and
then everybody forgot about it in short
as interesting Bush is constantly
criticized by the media for being kind
of inarticulate you know he can't
formulate the reasons why we're doing
things as coherently as it was done
before and that's extremely unfair way I
could be fair to our leaders I mean for
70 years there was a reflex anytime you
want to smash up somebody in the third
world he screamed Russians okay so it
was easy now you can't do that anymore
so we're back to the days when Woodrow
Wilson was sending the Marines
it's to Hispaniola into Mexico in 1916
and there weren't any Russians around so
we were defending ourselves against the
Huns or the British you know all the way
back to the merciless Indian savages of
the Declaration of Independence
we're always defending ourselves from
somebody you know but the fact of the
matter is we're always just securing our
own interest extending and that's what
you need a Pentagon system for as well
as the domestic reasons try to figure
out some other way to keep my
institution functioning MIT or more
significantly IBM questions one is you
spoke of the fact that this recent peace
conference or whatever foreign policy
exploits that the u.s. gets involved in
is a divergent or a smokescreen for the
let's say economic woes that are facing
this country in part but there also are
real reasons like ramming through the
traditional rejectionist program so
insignificant in light of that how will
the u.s. be able to justify the
continued aid to Israel and the fact
that the issue of ten billion dollar
loan guarantees are coming up for
discussion come January 1992 and second
of all irrespective of who is
responsible for the tragic downing of
the Pan Am 103 flight Libya was the
scapegoat for that or is deemed as the
perpetrator of that act who is the
scapegoat for the fact that Israel most
recently reaffirmed economic social and
scientific ties with South Africa and
was not reprimanded for that you know it
was glossed over by the media and never
to be heard again because in favor of it
and the meteor in favor of it so you
don't need a scapegoat as to the ten
billion dollar loan guarantee all right
I never really did get to the third of
the three points I was going to talk
about that reminds me the third was the
conflict between the US and Israel which
is mostly about the modalities of
rejection ISM it's a trivial one on the
loan guarantee the the way in which it
obd I mean you don't have to ask me we
read the newspapers they're telling you
how it's going to be done the government
and the press are telling you the
justification for the ten
for the 10 million dollar loan guarantee
what you the justification is
humanitarian it's a great humanitarian
Enterprise and obviously we're big
humanitarians so will therefore give
Israel the loan guarantees of course
will condition it on the that will
require that they not use it for
settling Russian immigrants in the West
Bank which means we're telling them use
another dollar not the one we're giving
you for settling Russian immigrants in
the West Bank and everybody will be
happy with that
there's no debate in the United States
as to whether it is a humanitarian
effort again if you go to the Israeli
press they point out openly you know
there's nothing humanitarian about this
there what's what's in fact happening if
it is true that Soviet Jews face a
legitimate fear of persecution let's say
that's true then they qualify for entry
into the United States under US
immigration laws of course the US won't
let them in because Israel doesn't want
us to and we don't want to either we
want them to be forced to go to Israel
this is quite open inside Israel so for
example the Minister of Immigration
Michael kleiner has an article in the
just couple weeks ago in these Hebrew
press in Israel in which he when he says
he's going to Germany because they got a
big problem in Germany now the Germans
are letting Russian Jews in and he's got
to go there and stop them from this you
know anti-semitic action and he
describes how he's going to do it he's
going to tell them here's roughly almost
literal translation he's going to tell
the Germans that they've already
fulfilled their quota with regard to
discrimination concerning Jews in this
century and they should start treating
Jews just like other people at last no
they don't let anybody else in so
therefore they shouldn't allow the
Russian Jews in so in short because of
the Holocaust you know the Germans
should stop discriminating with regard
to Jews and not let Soviet Jews in so
they'll be forced to go to Israel well
there's nothing humanitarian about that
I mean maybe you decide to do it or you
decide not to do it but it
humanitarian issue is zero there's no
humanitarian reason for forcing Russian
Jews to go to Israel and if you're
thinking about problems of refugees
there plenty of them so for example
right across the river there's hundreds
of thousands of Palestinian refugees who
are being driven out of quate with the
authorization of President Bush who
makes you know various apologetics for
it which are featured in the Kuwaiti
press therapy they're not leaving
because they're under fear of
persecution they're being tortured and
driven out and so on they're going into
a very impoverished country no not
getting any aid so you know right next
door there's a much bigger humanitarian
problem and one can think of a number of
others without too much imagination so
the the pretense the pretext that will
be used is humanitarian and there won't
be any debate about that because it
serves us interest it serves you as
interests of trying to extend Israeli
control over the territories that's the
standard interest served by this so
therefore we force Russian Jews to
Israel and the American taxpayer pays
for that's the way will be presented I'm
sorry he presented that way but that's
what it amounts to
I'd like to come back to Latin America
and the US support of democracy down
there in December of last year than much
touted democratic elections were held in
Haiti and the u.s. got a kick in the
teeth a few weeks before with our steeds
appearance on the scene and also since
December 19 when he was elected there's
been a big change in the tone of the
reporting in the US press about Aris
teeth between then and the coup on 30th
of September what I'd like to ask is do
you have any comments on the events up
till now in Haiti and what do you see in
US policy in the future there in the
immediate future
and how important do you consider the US
public stance on democracy that has been
such a big deal generally and
specifically in Haiti recently versus US
interests down there well it's
no there's no question that the u.s. was
not happy with aresty and would have
much rather seen a standard
representative of business interests
however the u.s. accepted the rst
government in fact was even you know I'm
more or less favorable to it now I think
the reasons are basically - first of all
Haiti is considered so hopeless you know
that it's assumed that you know we can
get some guy in there who has supports
poorer and there's no interested in
liberation he's not gonna be able to do
anything anyway
the constraints are so narrow you know
the economic situation is so horrifying
that the limits on any choices he can
make probably won't make any difference
so therefore we can tolerate him
furthermore the US has just made a big
rhetorical story about supporting
democracy in the New World Order and all
that kind of stuff and it's a little you
know it's a propaganda is it possible
you know there's a lot you can do but
some things are tough it would be tough
to you know to oppose what's obviously a
popularly elected government to
blatantly now after the coup the u.s.
kind of was standoffish about
you remember right after the military
coup that throughout our estate there
came a lot of reporting and talk about
his terrible human rights record and
he's not a real Democrat and all that
kind of stuff actually it's human rights
record is stellar as compared with
anything before after anything the US
support but and the u.s. kind of
reluctantly went along with the OAS
boycott and I suppose the reasons are
pretty much the same there's no real
gain I mean I'm sure that the US would
much prefer to have a standard
representative of the you know the
industrialists and the guys who are
getting the good press in the press you
know yeah the ones who are called the
Democrats meaning the industrialists and
so on but it's not so simple to see how
to do that
and since Haiti is not really considered
very important because the options there
are so restricted I suspect the US will
continue to sort of stand back try to
manipulate things so that the business
classes and maybe the military restore
control maybe with iris-t to some kind
of figurehead and then we have to will
law ourselves again on their great
contributions to democracy that's what I
suspect would probably come out frankly
I think for the u.s. it's kind of a
minor issue there's big humanitarian
issues for example these thousands of
people fleeing the both people a couple
hundred of them died the other day who
knows how many hundreds or thousands are
dying but remember there's been going on
for twenty years I'm sure you know the
there have been people fleeing from
Haiti and the Dominican Republic for
decades and they drown at sea or you
know if the Coast Guard picks them up
they send them back and that's a really
human rights horror which has been going
on for a long time it's hitting the
newspapers now but it's not really new
it's increased because of the coup but
sure but it's been going on for a long
time so late 1970s it was already quite
substantial thousands and thousands of
people both from Haiti and the Dominican
Republic so you think from the point of
view to the u.s. rhetoric and
see that it will just eventually sort of
fade into the background they'll try to
make everybody forget about it I mean I
realize Haiti isn't that important but
yeah I mean you've got to maintain the
rhetorical stance you know we've got to
maintain the rhetorical stance of being
in favor of democracy we got a problem
remember there's a problem with the
rascal multitude in the United States -
they have to be subjected to illusions
about the US commitment to freedom and
human rights and democracy and so on the
commissar culture has its own tasks and
you don't want to make those tasks too
hard you know like blatant support for a
brutal military dictatorship that's why
for example when the u.s. supported
Saddam Hussein and putting down the
Kurds and the Shiites there was a little
bit of a propaganda problem as you
remember we had to bring in all this
business about stability and so on and
then quickly turn to another diplomatic
triumph I mean these are constant
problems and controlling populations and
since Haiti's kind of marginal you know
they probably figure they can tolerate
the appearance of democracy there
I was wondering since you're talking
you're talking about the New World Order
if you can make some comments and about
the United States attempts to isolate
and demonize North Korea considering
what's going on now in the papers
because aside from the Middle East peace
talks what has been in the papers
recently is the whole new Korean nuclear
campaign as well as officials coming out
with statements saying that you know
aggressive force must be used to contain
North Korea also that if Desert Storm
was an indication there been greater
force using in Korea and so if you can
make some comment about that situation
taking into consideration of us yeah you
recall when after the Gulf War Colin
Powell made some statement about saying
there's still a couple of things that
haven't been resolved like Cuba North
Korea Libya and a few others which have
to be integrated into the I mean the
u.s. system is supposed to be a world
system that's always been the position
certain pieces of it are still not
integrated into it North Korea is one of
them kind of interesting column the
other day in The Wall Street Journal
which maybe noticed from South Korea
reporting that the South Koreans want US
forces to remain even after possible
unification with North Korea because
they're afraid of Japan no interesting
sidelight on this they have some history
on that issue you know but I don't
really expect the United States to do
anything serious to go after North Korea
it's too it's too dangerous too far away
you know it's not the kind of thing you
can do a more likely target of us attack
in fact the most likely one is Cuba
Libya you can always just bomb at will
you know that's not a big problem you
bomb and whenever you want a punching
bag around Cuba will take a little more
work and it's the next most likely
target and you know that you can see the
mechanisms Cuba was has been under us
terrorist attack for 30 years the
Kennedy administration launched the
world's by far the world's largest
terrorist operation international
terrorist operation against Cuba right
after the Bay
pigs that went on for a long time may
still be going on we usually learn about
these things couple years later they're
under illegal embargo and economic
strangulation the United States has
intimidated Latin America and officer
there I'm going to break the embargo and
the European countries in Japan don't
care that much and I can get in the way
of the United States
so these they were able to survive for a
while by assistance from the East Bloc
but now that we have Gorbachev's new
thinking as it's called meaning
subordination to u.s. power that
wonderful thing
they've stopped giving them substance
sustenance so now you can continue the
economic strangulation assumption being
that that'll worsen the internal
situation enough so that there will be
you know protests and dissidents and
that will intensify the repression which
is our a severe enough and that will
cause an internal breakdown and sooner
or later it'll get to the point where
things have gotten so bad that you can
send the Marines in with being pretty
secure that nobody's going to shoot back
and you can call them liberation that's
probably the scenario and if you know
the economy really is in trouble that
might be accelerated so as to happen
before the next election that's not
inconceivable but that's what I'd guess
the next likely one is North Korea I
think it's gonna be just something to
talk about for a while so you think it's
just a media campaign they want to
integrate North Korea into the US
dominated system but I don't think it's
a big policy initiative for the US for
one thing if North Korea did get
absorbed into the Western dominated
economic system Japan would be the main
beneficiary not the United States okay
because that's in the Japan sphere of
influence and the US has no particular
interest in strengthening Japan actually
you can see this going on in Eastern
Europe right now throughout the decade
the United States has been kind of
trying to retard the opening up of the
Soviet Union in fact right now that's
continuing the u.s. is still to this day
you know it's trying to strengthen the
central forces in the Soviet Union
against the separatist tendencies of the
Republic
I mean just last August Bush called for
cold father Ukrainians not to move
towards independence you know and in
fact throughout the decade the US has
been opposed to trade with the Soviet
Union which would have led to more rapid
liberalisation and opening up and so on
the US would prefer to see some kind of
Iron Fist over there rather than opening
the region up and turning it back into
conventional third world and I think
that's not hard to understand simply ask
yourself who's going to be the
beneficiary of returning Eastern Europe
to its traditional quasi colonial status
which is what's happening
well the many beneficiaries will be
mostly Germany and its surroundings and
Japan if they decide to get in on the
act those are the cap first of all
they're nearby that's where the
traditional trade patterns are they have
excess capital to invest which the US
doesn't have so the u.s. is kind of
likely to be left out in the cold and
that one as a result there's no special
interest in it and I think probably the
same is true with regard to North Korea
it's my guess anyway and please limit it
to one question each my question is
about the relationship between the
government and the US government my
first question is there are a lot of
talks after the Gulf War about there are
a lot of talks in the Middle East
especially after the Gulf War especially
in Israel that Israel is no longer an
asset for us in and that's why they
believe that
and other interest in Washington DC are
no longer powerful
