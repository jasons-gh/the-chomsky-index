Socialist Interviews April, 2020 
The world after the Coronavirus 
Well .. it really depends on us 
Noam Chomsky is a philosopher, historian, and philologist 
The masters of the universe as they call themselves are hardworking now, as always, 
To try to ensure that the outcome of the crisis is in their favor 
Even, more harshly 
The question is: Can other powers mobilize themselves to face this? 
And triumph over him. 
For example: If you look at the massive monetary easing package that 
The Trump administration brought it out, and it is the largest in human history. 
In the history of the United States and perhaps in the history of mankind. 
It has some good aspects but for the most part 
It is geared towards meeting the needs of companies, financiers, and so on, 
They eat from that manger like pigs eat, 
If it continues on that state 
There will be nothing in it to benefit 
People who are the worst victims. 
Without going into details, 
But this is what is going on, 
At a time when the oil tycoons are extracting the largest possible profit 
Before they destroy the world. And that is not in the distant future. 
They are calling for more funding and legislative facilities, 
And of course it is given to them 
By the Trump Criminal Administration. 
So, this is what is happening before our very eyes, 
And we can either confront it or allow it to happen. 
It could be a much better world. 
This is a good opportunity for people to think of whatever world we want. 
Do we want to return to recent history and its tragedies, 
Or do we want to overcome it. 
There are many ways to do this, different ways in different countries. 
The problems in the United States are different from the problems in Egypt, 
But everywhere there are ways 
Let's try to move beyond the tragedies of the past and its crimes. 
It is not enough to know that it is possible. it is necessary 
Roll up our sleeves and work towards it. 
The Arab Spring and American Intervention 
United State 
She naturally followed her usual policy 
Whenever 
Favorite dictators got into trouble 
In case after case. 
Like Somoza, Marcus, and Duvalier 
And many others 
The usual pattern is to support the dictator as long as possible 
And when it becomes impossible 
Perhaps the army will turn against him 
The business class turns against him 
And then what they usually do is claim that they were always against him 
And banished him somewhere 
An island in the Red Sea in this case 
Then they try to re-establish the same system as possible 
So here's what they tried to do 
There were many serious problems inside Egypt 
Which you cannot attribute to the United States 
And it ended up in a fierce dictatorship 
Perhaps the worst in the history of Egypt 
It is strongly backed by the United States 
It is strongly backed by the business world 
They were flocking to Egypt 
For economic conferences to find out 
What they can pounds 
From robbing the Egyptian people during a desperate moment 
But that is to be expected 
The question is whether there will be ways to counter it 
It is possible 
In the United States and Egypt 
American Imperialism Today: Allies and Foes 
It's hard to find 
Coherent strategy 
Amid the chaos in the Trump White House 
But there is what we can notice 
The most obvious thing to us is the effort 
To create an international 
Includes the most reactionary states 
And use it as a basis 
The next stage of US imperial interests 
For example, in the Middle East 
We find them 
Egypt Sisi 
And family dictatorships in the Gulf 
And Israel is at the center of the matter 
They are all cooperating now, almost openly 
We come next 
Moody in India 
Fierce Hindu Dictatorship 
Racial dictatorship 
Which are trying to 
You destroy the huge Muslim minority 
And the disintegration of Indian secular democracy 
We come to Europe 
Countries like Hungary led by Urban 
Destined for fascism 
And Salvini in Italy 
Builds something similar to ancient Italian fascism 
And in Latin America 
The most important example 
Brazilian President Bolsonaro 
Which, in fact, is competing with Trump 
To see who will be the most evil character in the modern world 
And when you mix them all together 
We have a reactionary international 
They can be the bedrock 
To expand and maintain the strength of the United States 
There are certain enemies (for the United States) 
The main enemy is Iran 
The reason is that Iran is an enemy 
CIA explained it well enough 
In its reports to Congress 
The problem is that they point out that 
Iran's military expenditures are extremely low 
Even by the standards of the Middle East region only 
Its strategic policy towards the United States is 
Deterrence 
It is trying to deter 
The invasion happened long enough for diplomacy to intervene 
If Iran is considering developing nuclear weapons 
Which may be true or not 
This is part of Iran's deterrent policy 
Now, who would stand against the existence of a deterrent policy? 
Rogue states 
Countries that desire the ability to use force freely and without any hindrance 
There are two of these countries 
Israel and the United States 
Hence, of course, they cannot tolerate a deterrent 
By the way, it is worth remembering that 
In the United States you cannot talk about this 
Maybe you can in Egypt 
There is a very simple solution 
For any potential danger 
Someone might think that Iran is representing him because of its weapons program 
Too simple 
In fact, Egypt has proposed this solution aggressively 
30 years ago 
It is declared a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East 
Strictly applied 
We know that can be done 
It has already been implemented 
As in the case of joint agreement 
The recent agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons 
Torn by Trump 
He was well run and tightly watched 
And American intelligence 
And the International Atomic Energy Agency attest to Iran's commitment to it 
So that is not a problem 
A zone free of nuclear weapons could be established in the Middle East 
Egypt has been at the forefront of lobbying for this since the 1990s 
The idea is launched every five years 
At the Nuclear Review Meetings 
And every time the United States vetoed it 
No one else would oppose the idea 
Iran strongly supports the idea 
The Arab countries led by Egypt strongly support it 
Non-Aligned Countries 
130 countries strongly support the idea 
The United States uses its veto. Why? 
And Obama was the last to do that, by the way, in 2015 
The answer is known to all: 
The United States does not want the Israeli nuclear weapons system 
To undergo an examination 
In fact, the United States is totally in denial 
It exists 
The United States claims it does not know if it exists 
Obviously, it is nonsense of course 
There is a reason for this denial 
If the United States admits that Israel has nuclear weapons 
US laws will have to apply 
American aid to Israel will have to be cut short 
The United States cannot provide aid to countries 
That develops nuclear weapons outside of a framework 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
Thus, in order to be able to protect Israel from the examination 
The United States is ready 
Because you face the real danger 
To start a large war 
Maybe just by chance 
During its conflict with Iran 
That shows us something important 
It also explains why these matters cannot be discussed in the United States 
Look at Google's search engine 
And try 
New York Times Archive 
They cannot mention it 
Although it is very clear in front of everyone's eyes 
As I said, Egypt 
It was at the forefront of lobbying for the exclusion zone 
For thirty years 
You can't talk about it 
Consequently, the reactionary internationalism must turn against Iran 
In fact, there are a lot of problems in Iran 
We can spend the entire section talking about the ugliness of the Iranian government 
But this is not our point 
At the moment 
Iran is suffering badly 
Because of the Corona virus 
And the United States, consciously and openly, is trying 
To increase rapidly and broadly 
And to kill the largest possible number of Iranians 
By tightening economic sanctions 
Economic sanctions are basically illegal 
And the United States is the only country in the world 
That can impose sanctions 
It imposes penalties on about 30 percent of the world's population 
The US sanctions are third-party sanctions 
Other countries should stick to it even if they don't like it 
Hence, Europe 
Strongly rejects sanctions against Iran 
Which are currently being used 
And it is really expanding 
To increase the torment of the Iranians in their time of need 
The Europeans oppose it, but nothing can be done 
Because if you oppose the US sanctions 
American power will throw you out of the global economic system 
Then you must follow the master 
None of this is acceptable 
Cuba continues to face fatal economic sanctions 
Since I achieved independence 
And it is not because of anything you do 
But just because 
According to the admission of the US internal files 
Because of what they called 
Its successful challenge to the United States 
This cannot be accepted 
The world is run by a mafia 
And if you challenge the Godfather 
Will be punished 
OK? This is how most things in the world go 
Democracy in the Middle East: An Ongoing Conflict 
Israel is said to be the only democracy in the Middle East 
But it is a deeply flawed thinking 
I don't need to point out details 
For half of the population governed by Israel 
The problem is not just the absence of democracy 
But in practice living in a prison 
Even within Israel itself 
There is extreme persecution 
But if we go to the Arab world 
There were democratic elections in the Arab world 
In January 2006 
In Palestine 
The first democratic elections in the Arab world 
Watched carefully 
They are recognized as fair and free elections 
What was the result? 
The result was that the United States 
I immediately began organizing a military coup against the elected government 
Israel 
It increased its terrorist activity 
Against Gaza 
And harsh economic sanctions were imposed on it 
The alignment of the European Union, to its disgrace, is behind it 
The problem was that the wrong people won the election 
And the elections are fair and acceptable 
Only if your candidate wins 
This is from the standpoint of the powerful 
If the wrong candidate wins, destroy the election 
This was the only free election there 
Lebanon has almost free elections 
The sectarian quota system that 
Left by French colonialism 
It severely impedes the growth of a true democracy 
In other countries you find some features 
Limited forms in Kuwait 
Not much, often dictatorships 
The Arab Spring would have changed the situation 
I don't think the Arab Spring is dead 
I think it has been pushed into retreat 
But the forces are still there 
And I think it will rise again 
It is a long process 
The person who might 
Give the best description of this situation to the best of my knowledge 
He (Gilbert) is blond 
Of Lebanese origin 
He teaches in 
School of Oriental and African Studies, London 
Which was said early during the Arab Spring 
That is an important step 
But it is only the first step in a long process 
To smash authoritarian institutions 
A culture of slavery 
Many steps have to be taken, but they can be taken 
You won't win in a minute 
But over time it can 
The recent demonstrations in Egypt are evidence of that 
Labor activity is another evidence 
Tunisia has avoided repression to some extent 
But there are enough examples, you can even see that 
In family dictatorships like Saudi Arabia 
Young 
They are pushing towards the end of the worst 
The teachings imposed by the Wahhabi religious leaders 
And they are making some progress 
It is a process that can continue 
Unfortunately 
There is not much time left 
Mankind in the Era of Coronavirus and Climate Change 
Unless you take serious steps 
To reflect the growing environmental disaster 
Most of the area will become uninhabitable 
Literally 
Survival will not be possible 
Likewise in South Asia 
These are critical problems that must be addressed 
There was not much time left 
Aramco cannot continue to poison the environment 
If it persists 
Aramco will not be there 
Nobody can live there 
These threats outweigh the threat of the Corona virus 
And it's bad enough 
And I must say that I think we are the ones even close 
From seeing its true extent 
The virus has not yet hit poor countries 
Where it will be a disaster 
For example, in the poorest slums in Egypt 
You will not be able to wash your hands every 15 minutes 
Or to keep himself isolated from others 
This is repeated all over the world 
That would be a great disaster 
And what happens 
And what happens 
It shows us the degree of sadism 
That is difficult to describe 
For example, there is a shortage of artificial respirators everywhere 
All states are trying to get 
What percentage 
And they cannot 
Poorest countries 
And even relatively rich countries, such as Brazil 
They can't get it 
Because the richer countries overtake them in spending 
Which wants to take all the devices for itself 
If hundreds of millions of people die elsewhere, it is not their problem 
This sadistic and anti-human behavior 
And in a competitive environment 
Just 
It shows us that we live in a sick world 
And it became more narrow 
Take the example of the European Union 
In the name of the union 
But they now show us the extent of the union in the matter 
Rich countries like Germany 
She was able to control the spread of the virus 
Next to her a few miles away 
The epidemic is raging 
Are you helping Germany? 
No, it's not our problem 
Germany is not content with not helping 
But it also hinders attempts to issue a common European bond (Eurobond). 
That might be a major component 
In helping the poorest countries 
No, they just pursue their own interests 
Miles beyond the border 
People die, it's not our problem 
Fortunately, those of you can suffer 
In northern Italy 
To ask for help from behind the Atlantic Ocean 
From Cuba 
Cuba offers the only true example of international solidarity 
Send doctors 
And using medical supplies from China 
To the most affected areas of the disease 
Cuba has been doing this for many years 
Cuba was largely responsible for the liberation of Africa 
Africans know that 
When Mandela got out of prison it was the first thing he did 
He praised Castro for his contribution 
In the liberation of Africa 
Defeated the South African forces in Angola 
Opening the door to the liberation of Namibia 
And weaker apartheid South Africa 
It is dedicated international solidarity and international solidarity 
It cost Cuba a lot and gained nothing from it 
When there were major earthquakes in Pakistan 
Villages were being destroyed and people dying 
Cuban doctors have come 
While the Corona virus ravages Italy 
Cuban doctors have come 
So true international solidarity is not impossible 
But it will be necessary to scale up 
To the level of civilization and culture of the countries that practice it 
At the same time, next to Cuba 
Trump 
Completely canceled aid to the Palestinians 
In full 
Which is sent to UNRWA hospitals in Palestine 
And explain its reasons 
"They don't respect me enough." 
Clear my shoes and maybe I'll give you some coins 
But if you don't respect me enough, I will suffocate you 
This is Cuba's neighbor 
Of course, there is a difference in power between Cuba and the United States 
I don't think we want to have this debate 
As I mentioned earlier, Cuba is subject to harsh US sanctions 
Since its independence. 
Deal of the century 
Interesting thing 
Regarding the deal of Kushner and Netanyahu century 
And it was Netanyahu who had the real idea 
And he gave it to this little boy 
Trump's servant 
The plan would look like it if it came from the United States 
The big question regarding this deal is 
Why do people give her any attention? 
Suppose that this proposition comes from China 
Or Germany or any country in the world 
We wouldn't even have the time to laugh at him 
It's a silly proposition 
Why do you even look at him? 
This is a sign of the strength of the United States 
When the minus comes from American power 
Whatever the degree of absurdity and ugliness 
It becomes the central issue 
You read the serious discussions in the newspapers 
Will the offering succeed? 
Is it fair? Will it have this defect or that? 
But the appropriate response is laughter 
Laughing and dumping away 
It's not even worth laughing 
If you want to know what kind of deals these are 
Just look at the right wing of the Israeli Foreign Ministry 
And what they usually bring up 
This is the deal of the century 
You don't need to look at the details 
What counts for her 
It is that it gives an official status to the reality of US policy in all cases 
If you look at American politics 
In the last 50 or so years 
It's simple 
For example, Israel has a specific and clear policy 
It is the creation of a great Israel 
Which will annex every part of the occupied territories of value to Israel 
And connect it to Israel using the best infrastructure projects 
And leave all areas with the largest Palestinian population concentrations 
Israel does not want Nablus 
They want to preserve what they call a "Jewish democratic state." 
This means not to increase the number of Arabs 
And thus excludes the Palestinian people 
But Israel takes the rest 
It divides what is left of the Palestinian people 
To live in hundreds of small areas 
Practically unfit for life 
And the peasants are dispossessed from their lands and ambushes everywhere 
Impossible life 
In the hope that one day the Palestinians will leave 
This was and remains the policy of all Israeli governments 
Even so-called pacifists like Shimon Peres 
Which was responsible for expanding settlement 
To delve into the West Bank 
Which Israel calls Judea and Samaria 
The United States accepted and funded it 
Every now and then she says, "We don't like it, please don't do it." 
But they finance it anyway 
Well, now things are in the open 
This is their official policy 
So, it counts to Trump 
He revealed to us their policy 
Its ugliness and extreme sadism 
Which befits his personality and his worldview 
And now it is exposed to all 
But besides that, the deal of the century 
It does not deserve the attention of the commentators even for a moment 
Capitalism, China, and America 
China is a growing society 
But it remains a poor country 
Not like the United States 
If we look at the United Nations Human Development Index 
It is our best measure of community health 
The center of China is around 90 
And the center of India is around 130 
All this talk is about the domination of China and India over the world 
It is pure paranoia 
Which country can impose sanctions? 
one only 
United State 
Which country has more than 1000 military bases around the world? 
United State 
which country 
It can surpass practically all countries in spending with its military spending only? 
United State 
Which country has exceptional advantages that no other country shares? 
Vast space and huge resources 
A homogeneous population 
Once wiped out the natives 
The arena became open to European control 
Was the economy 
It has been based on slavery for a century 
Creating the worst slavery system in history 
And create the foundation of the current economy 
Remember, cotton was the world's oil 
Until the late nineteenth century 
Britain got rich because of cotton, and so did the United States and others 
Finally, now there is no other country 
Get close to having the advantages that the United States has 
And it happens to be a largely business-run community 
To an exceptional degree 
This has an impact on the nature of society 
If you look at the OECD 
To rich country measures of social justice 
You will find the United States at the bottom of the assessment 
Next to Mexico and Greece 
If you look at the health system 
One of the current kaleidoscopes 
The American health system is catastrophic 
It costs twice as much as comparable countries 
It brings out the worst results 
And now this system is suffering badly 
Because in a neoliberal system it follows a business model 
A commercial model means that the system does not have redundant capacity 
You don't want to waste money buying an extra bed 
For emergencies 
So the business model follows what they call efficiency 
No redundant potential capacity 
Just enough to cover normal conditions 
It doesn't go as well as many people, myself included 
From my personal experience 
But it works at least somehow 
But if anything happens outside of the normal framework 
Your luck is bad 
In fact if you look closely, what happens 
It's almost bewildering 
Let's look at artificial respirators 
Which now represents the bottleneck of the system 
Doctors and nurses are forced to make painful decisions 
About who will be killed today 
Because there aren't enough devices for everyone 
Why? 
It's a long history, but let's look at Trump 
In January he was known to the whole world 
That there is an epidemic or pandemic and comprehensive to come 
So what did the Trump administration do? 
She was sending respirators, masks, and other equipment 
Outside the United States 
To China and other countries 
And it lasted until March 
When Trump finally realized 
That is not a joke 
They started importing the same respirators and masks from China 
For manufacturers 
Brokers and shipping companies 
It's cool 
They make money sending it and they make money back 
And this is how it works 
In all aspects 
If you really want to see 
clear picture 
Of the mindset in Washington 
Look at the budget for the next year 
Budget project 
In mid-February 
While the epidemic was raging 
Clearly in mid-February 
Trump goes out to us with his budget 
It provided for continuous spending cuts 
On the CDC 
And all parts of government related to health 
Continue to cut spending 
This is what Trump has been doing throughout his presidency 
Even in the middle of a pandemic 
But there are other things to spend on 
Like huge subsidies to the fossil fuel industry 
This is the budget 
And the army of course 
That tells you what the mentality of this criminal gang is 
In the most powerful stage in world history 
Of course, people are afraid of it 
In fact, the United States is surprisingly feared and hated around the world 
You can see this by reading the Arab press 
You do that more than me 
But from my few translations, it's amazing 
I will tell a personal story that clarifies the matter 
There is an online scam rampant 
Crazy article 
It claims that the United States started the Coronavirus 
So you kill people around the world and take control of it 
The article is attributed to me 
Not real, of course 
But I receive messages from all over the world 
And even from friends and colleagues 
Serious people 
They say "Thanks for finally telling the truth." 
Hatred of the United States is extremely high 
So much so that people believe anything 
But you must lie down before the force 
You can't do a strong thing 
So can the people of the United States themselves 
From dismantling it and turning it into a more free society. 
The Rise and Fall of Sanders and the Future of American Politics 
Young people who worked hard for Sanders 
Feel depressed 
And they see that they have failed 
But they are wrong 
This is part of another strange fact about the United States 
There is no date 
There is no historical continuity 
There are no political movements going on 
And it has a long history 
Every political movement started from scratch 
They are often young 
So they do not know anything about what happened before them 
Take any serious social movement 
Anti-slavery 
Women's rights and the Arab Spring 
anybody 
They move forward and experience setbacks 
But they don't give up 
They do not give up on the first setback 
They continue 
In fact, Sanders' campaign was a smashing success 
Success will make a mark 
It completely changed the arena of debate 
And even shaping politics in the United States 
Very important things that were considered nonsense a few years ago 
Now you are in the spotlight 
Like comprehensive health insurance 
Free higher education 
And workers' rights 
And appropriate wages 
It all became the focus of attention 
Mainly because of him 
This is a massive success 
He did something else, too 
Show that you can successfully run a political campaign 
Without relying on private wealth 
And corporate power 
This is a break with a century of American political history 
These are huge successes 
You can build on it 
You don't have to go home and cry 
I think most of this talk applies to the Arab Spring 
He achieved a lot 
Make people realize there is something that can be done 
So let's do it despite the cruelty of the dictatorship 
And it's much worse than anyone in the United States would ever face 
Sanders made it clear 
In his withdrawal letter 
It is not the end of the political movement 
The election campaign will end 
Because of many circumstances 
But the movement will continue 
It is the responsibility of the youth 
To give a tangible dimension to these words 
To make it true, that is possible 
And if they did it would be a much better world. 
But I'm afraid I have to go now because I have another interview.
