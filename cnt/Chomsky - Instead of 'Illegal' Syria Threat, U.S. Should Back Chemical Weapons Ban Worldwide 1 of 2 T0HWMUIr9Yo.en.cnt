I'm Amy Goodman and I'm gonna mean che
welcome to our listeners and viewers
around the country and around the world
in a nationally televised address
President Obama announced he was putting
off a plan to strike Syria while
pursuing a diplomatic effort from Russia
for international monitors to take over
and destroy Syria's arsenal of chemical
weapons the speech came just 10 days
after he told the nation he would ask
Congress to authorize using military
force on Tuesday night Obama asked
congressional leaders to put off a vote
on his request to authorize the use of
military strikes but he said the
military would remain ready if diplomacy
fails America is not the world's
policeman terrible things happen across
the globe and it is beyond our means to
right every wrong but when with modest
effort and risk we can stop children
from being gassed to death and thereby
make our own children safer over the
long run I believe we should act that's
what makes America different that's what
makes us exceptional with humility but
with resolve let us never lose sight of
that essential truth President Obama
offered a qualified endorsement of the
Russian proposal to secure Syria's
chemical weapons arsenal
today's we've seen some encouraging
signs in part because of the credible
threat of US military action as well as
constructive talks that I had with
President Putin the Russian government
has indicated a willingness to join with
the international community in pushing
Assad to give up his chemical weapons
the Assad regime has now admitted that
it has these weapons and even said they
joined the Chemical Weapons Convention
which prohibits their use it's too early
to tell whether this offer will succeed
in any agreement must have verify that
the Assad regime keeps its commitments
but this initiative has the potential to
remove the threat of chemical weapons
without the use of force particularly
because Russia is one of Assad's
strongest allies
I have therefore asked the leaders of
Congress to postpone a vote to authorize
the use of force while we pursue this
diplomatic path I'm sending Secretary of
State John Kerry to meet his Russian
counterpart on Thursday and I will
continue my own discussions with
President Putin I've spoken to the
leaders of two of our closest allies
France and the United Kingdom and we
will work together in consultation with
Russia and China to put forward a
resolution at the UN Security Council
requiring Assad to give up his chemical
weapons and to ultimately destroy them
under international control we'll also
give you an inspectors the opportunity
to report their findings about what
happened on August 21st and we will
continue to rally support from allies
from Europe to the Americas from Asia to
the Middle East who agree on the need
for action meanwhile I've ordered our
military to maintain their current
posture to keep the pressure on us up
and to be in a position to respond if
diplomacy fails to talk more about
President Obama's speech and the crisis
in Syria were joined by the world
renowned political dissident linguist
author MIT professor Noam Chomsky he's
authored numerous books his latest is on
Western terrorism from Hiroshima to
drone warfare that's out next week he
joins us via Democracy Now video stream
from his home in Massachusetts Noam
welcome to Democracy Now first let's get
your response to President Obama's
announcing last night and a nationwide
address which I'm sure was watched
worldwide that for the moment there
would be no strike on Syria as the u.s.
supports a Russian plan to deal with the
chemical weapons stockpile of Syria well
the Russian plan is a godsend for Obama
that saves him from what would look like
a very serious political defeat he has
not been able to obtain virtually any
international support for this the
action he's contemplating that even
Britain wouldn't support it
and it looked as though Congress wasn't
going to support it either which would
leave him completely out on a limb well
this leaves him a way out he can
maintain the threat of force at which
incidentally is a crime under
international law that we should bear in
mind that the core principle of the
United Nations Charter bars the threat
or use of force threat or use of force
so all of this is criminal to begin with
but it will continue with that the
United States is a rogue state it
doesn't pay any attention to
international law he was kind of
interesting what he didn't say this
would be a perfect opportunity to ban
chemical weapons either to impose the
Chemical Weapons Convention on the
Middle East the convention contrary to
what Obama said does not specifically
refer just to use of chemical weapons it
refers to production storage or use of
chemical weapons
that's banned by the international norm
that Obama likes to preach about well
there is a country which happens to be
happens to have illegally annexed part
of Syrian territory which has chemical
weapons and is in violation of the
Chemical Weapons Convention and has
refused even to ratify it namely Israel
so here's an opportunity to eliminate
chemical weapons from the region to
impose the Chemical Weapons Convention
as it's actually formulated but Obama
was very careful not to say that he for
reasons which are too obvious to go into
he and that gap is highly significant of
course chemical weapons should be
eliminated everywhere but certainly in
that region the other things
said were not unusual but nevertheless
kind of shocking to anyone not familiar
with us political discourse at least so
he described the United he said that for
seven decades the United States has been
the anchor of global security really
seven decades that includes for example
just 40 years ago today when the United
States played a major role in
overthrowing the parliamentary democracy
of Chile and imposing a brutal
dictatorship called the first 9/11 and
Latin America go back to earlier years
overthrowing the parliamentary system
and Iran imposing a dictatorship that
same in Guatemala a year later attacking
in the Indochina worst crime in the
books war period and killing millions of
people attacking Central America killing
involved in killing in imposing a
dictatorship in the Congo and invading
Iraq on and on that stability I mean
that a Harvard Law School graduate can
pronounce those words that is pretty
amazing as is the fact that they're
accepted without comment so what he said
is I'm gonna lie like a trooper about
history I'm gonna suppress the u.s. role
the actual u.s. role for the last seven
decades I'm going to maintain the threat
of force which is of course illegal and
I'm going to ensure that the Chemical
Weapons Convention is not imposed on the
region because our ally Israel would be
subjected to it I think those are some
of the main points of his address Noam
Chomsky Noam Chomsky the world renowned
linguist political dissident we're going
to go to break and then spend the hour
with him on President Obama's policy and
what's happening in
Middle East this is democracy now
