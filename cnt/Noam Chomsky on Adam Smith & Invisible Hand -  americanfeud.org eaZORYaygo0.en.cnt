absence is very rarely read he's
worshipped but not read so for example
everyone's heard of the phrase invisible
hand but almost no one knows how he used
it in the term invisible hand actually
does appear in his classic Wealth of
Nations once it appears in an argument
against what's now called neoliberalism
classical at what's now called
neoclassical economics that were
supposed to worship so we're supposed to
worship Adam Smith and neoclassical
economics and they radically differ on
the notion invisible hand Adam Smith was
concerned as David Ricardo later was
that if there was free movement of
capital and free import of goods he was
concerned about England he said England
will suffer because British capitalists
will invest abroad and they'll import
from abroad and that will harm the
English economy required have had
similar concerns and Adam Smith then
gave an argument was not a very good
argument but his argument was that
English
investors will prefer to invest in
England because of what something called
a home bias they'll have a preference
for investing close by and therefore as
if by an invisible hand England will be
saved from the Menace of free capital
movement and a free import that's
invisible hand what's that going to do
with the Cato Institute earth or the
modern enthusiasm about the free capital
flow and you know having US corporations
invest in China so they can send stuff
back here to sell cheap exploiting
Chinese workers
that's not Adam Smith and it goes right
across the board I mean everyone who
went to college learned the first
paragraph of Wealth of Nations in which
he talks about a wonderful division of
labor is you know lost for all kind of
efficiency and productivity and so on
and not very many people got to page
you know whatever it is page 400 in
which he points out that division of
labor is monstrous
because it turns people into creatures
as stupid than ignorant as a person can
possibly be person who just becomes a
machine and that's a terrible attack on
fundamental human right and therefore he
says in any civilized society
the government is going to have to
intervene to prevent division of labor
how many people get that far you know in
fact the Smith does give arguments for
markets rather nuanced arguments I'm
ready to take what they call trade now
that so-called conservatives are very
excited that trade is increasing so for
example NAFTA is supposed to be a great
triumph of conservatism it increased
trade between Mexico and the United
States well it's true that cross-border
interactions between Mexico and the
United States increased but would Adam
Smith or any classical liberal or
traditional conservative of called that
trade I mean suppose General Motors
assembles parts in Indiana and sends
them to Illinois for assembly and then
to New York to sell is that trade well
suppose it happens across the Mexican
border but it's still internal to a huge
command economy is that trade well it
turns out that if you look at the rough
figures which are all that we have
before and after the part of cross
border interactions between you know
vertex go in the u.s. that was internal
to a corporation was about 50% and now
it's about two-thirds that's no more
trade than if the Kremlin produced
things in Leningrad and sent them to
ukraine for assembly and the poland to
sell the operations internal to command
economies we have to simply look you
know they just tend to talk about trade
or free trade or
tripping Oriole that user consumer
choice or democratic functioning and so
on is putting us in a world of illusion
and fantasy that's why these terms are
all demeaned not just conservative
