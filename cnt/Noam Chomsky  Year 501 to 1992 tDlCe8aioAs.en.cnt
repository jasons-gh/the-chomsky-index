this evening will be the fourth Raymond
Williams memorial lecture the trust
which is organized four of these
memorial lectures invites someone who
they feel is working in the spirit of
Raymond Williams or whose work he would
have wished to see encouraged and
honored and so far we've had four of the
annual lectures and also in the spirit
of Raymond Williams we've organized some
outside London the in fact they've been
three outside London and four of the
annual lectures here in London itself
previous give us of the memorial lecture
have been Edward side Gwyn Alf Williams
marina Warner and outside London Umberto
Eco Terry Eagleton and Stuart Hall who
given lectures in Glasgow kila and
Cardiff well this evening it's our very
great pleasure and honor to introduce
Noam Chomsky to give this fourth
memorial lecture and I would just like
to say a little bit not because now
Chomsky needs any introduction but
because we do feel that he is
extraordinarily well placed to give this
memorial lecture and we do feel that in
inviting him to do so we are encouraging
precisely the type of her ages public
intervention of which Raymond Williams
so warmly approved and which he himself
also undertook I I think i should say to
begin with that we also
felt that there was even some affinity
in the work of Raymond Williams and Noam
Chomsky even though it it is in
different fields and I suppose it would
be this that in the work of both of
these great scholars one does see a
commitment to the extraordinary
potential that lies in ordinary people
and one can see that this can give rise
I though to great work of culture
criticism or in the case of professor
Chomsky to his innovative and
revolutionary work in the field of
linguistics but this commitment to the
potential of ordinary people is
something that also naturally grows over
into a critical vigilant stance against
the arrogance of power and against the
corruption of all the channels of
communication discussion and public
debate which is such a ominous feature
of public life not only in Britain but
also in the United States Raymond
Williams of course himself pull forward
bold proposals for democratizing the
media not by enlarging a power of the
state but by empowering people from
below and by empowering communicators
and releasing them from the tutelage of
commercial interests under of the
interests of power holders I think
Raymond Williams saw this as a
particularly key area because he felt
that democracy itself democratic life
was in danger of atrophy in its formal
bodies in parliament in Congress and
other such institutions and that's why
he put such great emphasis on the need
for a democratic revitalization of the
means of communication and that's why he
himself also
participated as a public intellectual a
responsible intellectual speaking out on
the great issues of the day well it need
hardly be said but Noam Chomsky has been
doing that and doing that for more than
three decades many of us remember his
tremendous essays at the time of the
Vietnam War and the huge role he played
in gradually awakening a critical spirit
even in the most unlikely places in the
United States in the late 60s the middle
in late 60s in subsequent decades and
including on occasions when the going
was even more difficult Noam has been a
vigilant eye and a strong voice against
oppression injustice above all the
oppression and injustice supported by
his own government or the government
that is to save the United States and by
the West more generally in Nicaragua and
perhaps one should mention most recently
and memorably for all of us the occasion
two years ago when the governments of
the United States and Britain unleashed
the gulf war now in Britain as in the
United States we're just passing through
a period where through a chapter of
accidents through events entirely
outside the control of the government a
court case has gone wrong and apparently
it's discovered two great amazement that
the British government was covertly
breaking its own supposed in bargain on
the dictator Saddam Hussein against whom
it launched that ferocious attack and of
course at the time it was arming Saddam
Hussein it was
perfectly well known that he'd been
gassing Kurds oppressing oppositionists
inside his own country I think many of
you may remember noam chomsky's splendid
essay that was printed in our in The
Guardian in the run-up to the Gulf War
which exposed this and many other
hypocrisy long before we've had the
confirmation which is so lately arrived
well uh I don't wish to say anymore by
way of introduction I know that Noam
Chomsky is speaking tonight on the year
501 I think this is a reference to the
first year after the 500th centenary of
Christopher Columbus which has been
marked by many of us as an event which
shows the dark side of the spread of the
Western its global power and influence
and which also requires of us a critical
spirit well i'm also pleased to say that
Noam Chomsky's book deterring democracy
is now available in paperback and I
think even some copies can be purchased
at the door I think that the title of
the lecture he has chosen this evening
is linked to the theme of his next book
so without further ado I would like to
introduce professor Noam Chomsky
actually I was going to talk about the
500 first year of modern philosophy but
I guess a bit of shit given what
the the year nineteen ninety-two poses a
critical moral and cultural challenge
for the more privileged sectors of the
world dominant societies as of course as
Robin mentioned we enter year 50 one of
the European conquest of the world and
how that challenge is addressed i think
is likely to have quite a faithful
consequences in recent years the
subjugation of the south as it's now
euphemistically called the subjugation
of the south has intensified the gap
between the rich and the poor has
doubled since nineteen sixty this is
largely a consequence of the neoliberal
policies that are imposed have been
imposed on the traditional colonies
while 20 out of 20 for industrial
countries are more protectionist today
than they were a decade ago the World
Bank has recently estimated that the
protectionist measures of the industrial
countries which are keeping pace with
their free market bombass reduced the
national the national income of the
South by twice the amount of official
so-called development assistance which
is itself a form of export promotion the
South Commission may call for a new
world order as they called it that will
respond quoting to the South's plea for
justice equity and democracy in the
global society but that plea is sure to
remain unanswered short of major changes
where powers where power lies what will
be heard and has been heard is the
vision of the new world order of George
Bush who borrowed the same phrase a few
months later as part of the rhetorical
cover for the u.s. British war
go this is the new imperial age as the
Financial Times recently called it with
a global system paraphrasing the
Financial Times a global system
orchestrated by the group of seven the
IMF the World Bank the GATT and their
corporate financial constituencies a
major feature of the era that we are now
entering by the term Europe when I speak
of Europe's conquest of the world of
course mean to include the English
settle colonies one of which now leads
the crusade and also the Japanese I
borrow here South African usage and
described the Japanese is honorary
whites rich enough to almost qualify at
least Japan was one of the few parts of
the South that joined the Corps with
core industrial societies with some of
its former colonies in its weight having
been able to avoid the doctrines that
are applied to ensure the subordination
of the traditional colonies which are
sometimes called free trade or
structural adjustment or our noble
ideals from which we of course are
exempt and always have been Adam Smith
took the discovery of America and that
of a passage to the East Indies
according to be the two greatest and
most important events recorded in the
history of mankind which certainly made
a most essential contribution to the
state of Europe opening up a new and
inexhaustible market that led to vast
expansion of productive powers and real
revenue and wealth so quoting in theory
he said the new set of exchanges should
naturally have proved as advantageous to
the new as it certainly did to the old
continent but that was not to be the
savage injustice of the Europeans
rendered an event which ought to have
been beneficial to all ruinous and
destructive to the conquered people who
suffered dreadful misfortunes
smith roti revealing himself to be an
early practitioner of the crime of
political correctness to borrow some of
the terminology of contemporary cultural
management he went on to point out that
their superiority of force enabled the
Europeans to commit with impunity every
sort of injustice one case that he found
particularly appalling was bingo a rich
and fertile country with advanced
manufacturing when the British arrived
already devastated by Smith stay in 1776
hundreds of thousands die of famine in a
single year he wrote because of the
conditions imposed by the conquerors
which turned earth into a famine while
officials of the Honourable company plow
up a rich field of rye sir of the grain
in order to make room for a plantation
of poppies for the opium trade which was
one prime source of the huge profits
that stimulated the first Industrial
Revolution along with the lucrative
slave trade and robbery of the colonies
generally these Smith's conclusions the
100 years ago are quite well supported
by contemporary scholarship Europeans
fought the kill and they had they had
the means to satisfy their bloodlust in
the American colonies the natives were
astonished by the savagery of the
Spanish and particularly the British
meanwhile on the other side of the world
the peoples of Indonesia were equally
appalled by the all destructive fury of
European warfare quoting all this from a
contemporary military store in Geoffrey
Parker Europeans regarded all the
conquests as small wars he comments it's
nomination of the world relied
critically upon the constant use of
force it was thanks to their military
superiority rather than to any social
moral or natural advantage that the
white peoples of the world managed to
create and control however briefly the
first global hegemony in history those
temporal qualification
in my opinion are open the question well
the consequences of what Adam Smith
called the savage and justice of the
Europeans are not in doubt including the
two worst demographic catastrophes in
history and the record of devastation
and oppression that continues until the
present day the grim truth has been kept
quite remote from consciousness and with
remarkable efficiency to this day among
educated sectors one example that's been
quite well studied is their reaction to
the pot style atrocities that were
directed by the United States in its own
backyard in recent years as it conducted
a violent war against the church and
other miscreants who sought to bring a
measure of freedom and justice to one of
the most brutalized corners of the world
outside of more disciplined circles
however the cultural awakening of the
1960's opened many eyes a fact which has
aroused much fury among the connoisseurs
it's worth taking a moment to inspect
the wonders of the commissar culture
highlighted in fact by this current
example there's now a solemn debate in
progress about the u.s. dedication to as
it's called exporting democracy it was
supposed to have been the guiding
doctrine of the Reagan administration
sober thinkers warned that voting by
granting idealism and near exclusive
hold on our foreign policy we go too far
harming our own interests it's New York
Times Chiefs diplomatic correspondent
Thomas Friedman quoting high officials
there's no confusion about the operative
meaning of democracy or how the grand
victory was won all of this was revealed
with great clarity after the end of the
Cold War removed any residual appeal to
this
interference with the awesome mobility
of our other purpose keeping just to
Central America as descent as the Berlin
Wall fell elections were held in
Honduras in what George Bush called an
inspiring example of the Democratic
promise that is today spreading
throughout the Americas there were two
candidates they both represented large
landowners and wealthy industrialists
with close ties to the military were the
effective rulers under us control they
had no political programs so the
campaign was largely restricted to
insults and entertainment rather like
another campaign that had taken place
somewhere it's not long before human
rights abuses by the security forces
escalated before the election starvation
and misery are rampant having increased
considerably during the decade of
democracy as it's called along with
capital flight and the debt burden but
there was no major threat to order or to
investors at the same time same month
the electoral campaign opened the
Nicaragua it's 1984 elections do not
exist in u.s. commentary they could not
be controlled and therefore they are not
an inspiring example of democracy taking
no chances with the long scheduled 1990
elections Bush announced that once in
November 1989 that only a victory for
his candidate would end the embargo that
was strangling the country the White
House and Congress then proceeded to
renew their support for the Contra
terrorists in defiance of the Central
American president the World Court and
the United Nations which had been
rendered irrelevant by the US security
council veto Nicaraguans were thus
informed very explicitly that only a
vote for the US candidate
in the terror and the illegal economic
warfare the intellectual class in the
United States and Britain and other
places went along continuing to suppress
the u.s. subversion of the peace process
with the diligence that's required on
important affairs of state I did a
review of the press in latin america in
the united states and was kind of
interesting in latin america the
electoral outcome was generally
described as a victory for george bush
even by those who celebrated it in the
united states and contrast the outcome
was held as quotes the victory for us
fair play with Americans United enjoy
kind of Albanian style that's New York
Times headlines now it's not that I was
typical all over the press no exceptions
it's not that the celebrants were
unaware of how the u.s. victory was
achieved rather there was just
unconstrained joy at the grand success
in subverting democracy here's Time
magazine for example it was quite frank
about the means that were employed to
bring about what they called the the
happy the latest of the happy series of
democratic surprises as democracy burst
forth and Nicaragua the method they said
was I'm quoting to wreck the economy and
prosecute a long and deadly proxy war
until the exhausted natives overthrow
the unwanted government themselves with
a cost to us that is minimal leaving the
victim with wrecked bridges sabotage
power stations and ruined farms and thus
providing the u.s. candidate with a
winning issue ending the impoverishment
of the people of Nicaragua well to
appreciate the character of the
political culture it's only necessary to
take the same phrase imagine it
appearing in Stalinist Russia with a few
names change an intellectual exercise
which is far beyond the capacity of
Western commissars needless to say but
let's leave that morass and turn to some
other ones as the Quinn centenary
the traditional apologetics were sounded
once again and they're not entirely
without merit so it takes a the
Economist in London it had a point when
it lauded what it called the passion for
justice of the Spanish murderers and
torturers it is in fact true that they
wanted to keep some of their victims
alive to slave in the mines where their
life expectancy was about the same as
that of forced laborers at Auschwitz as
historian David stannard observes and he
compares this more humane attitude with
that of the English settlers seeking
Layden's around their goal was simply to
rid themselves of the natives entirely
as they carried out what the leading
newspaper in the United States in the
mid 19th century called the glorious
work of subjugation and conquest one of
the leading heroes whose name now
embraces the capital city of Texas
explained that the American colonists
would be satisfied with nothing short of
extermination or expulsion the US would
soon sweep the country of the Indians
and drive them as they always have
driven them to ruin an extermination
Stephen Austin explained he was speaking
to what he called the mad men who
thought to establish a free red white
society in Texas where he had already
successfully cleared those he called the
natives of the forest there were people
more humane Stephen Austin like George
Washington who felt that in his words
the gradual extension of our settlements
will as certainly cause the savage as
the wolf to retire both being beasts of
prey though they differ in shape Thomas
Jefferson advised the the backward
tribes that the borders will relapse
into barbarism and misery blues numbers
by war and want and we shall be obliged
to drive them with the beasts of the
forests into the stony mountains
meanwhile all blacks would be removed
africa jefferson said leaving the
country without blot or mixture or to
Haiti which Abraham Lincoln recognized
in 1862 in part for the same reason a
modern rendition of all of this is given
by a contemporary standard history of
American diplomacy published in nineteen
sixty-nine Thomas Bailey where we read
that after winning their independence
Americans concentrated on the task of
felling trees and Indians and of
rounding out their natural of their
natural boundaries well like Adam Smith
Thomas Jefferson was a man of
enlightenment than humanity representing
the heights of European civilization
exploring further we reach the great
thinker who discoursed authoritative
Leon same topics in his lectures on
philosophy of history a half-century
later in 1830 as we approach what he
called the final phase of world history
when spirit reaches its full maturity
and strength in the German world German
includes England speaking from these
lofty heights Hagel explains that Native
America was physically and psychically
powerless so that it must expire as soon
as spirit approached it hence the
Aborigines gradually vanished at the
breadth of European activity according
to him they were inferior even to the
Negroes whose character has nothing
harmonious with humanity entirely
lacking in moral sentiments they
practice polygamy so as to have many
children to sell into slavery which is a
benevolent institution enabling them to
become participant than a higher
morality and the culture connected with
it they have such contempt of humanity
he said that they allow themselves to be
shot down by thousands and war with
Europeans life has a value only when it
has something valuable as its object
which is a thought beyond the grasp of
creatures who are at the level of a mere
thing an object of no value such
thoughts persist right to the present
day liberal critics of the Vietnam War
explained that the Asian poor used the
strategy of the week inviting us to
carry our strategic logic to its
conclusion which is genocide but we are
unwilling to destroy ourselves by
contradicting our own value system soft
humanitarians we feel that genocide is a
terrible burden to bear William pfaff
and Townsend hoops explain a couple of
weeks ago strategic analyst Albert
Volstead er added that the Vietnamese
were able to bear the costs imposed on
their subjects more easily than we could
impose them ideas that were just too
noble for this cruel world while Hagel
lectured on the psychic disorders that
caused the natives to expire a spirit
approached President Andrew Jackson
announced his Indian Removal Act and
explained that he was deeply moved by
his generosity in having done my duty to
my red children mainly by expelling them
expelling the civilized tribes who had
in fact created a remarkably successful
and productive self-governing society
after having been brutally expelled in
violation of other equally solemn
treaties if any in any failure of my
good intention arises Jackson said it
will be attributable to their lack to
their want of duty to themselves not to
me his lucky children were then driven
at Bayonet Point on what
called the Trail of Tears perhaps half
survived the generous and enlightened
policy of the US government as the
operation was described by the secretary
of war with the routine self-acclaimed
for unspeakable atrocities there was an
eyewitness observer who described how
the Pioneers deprived the Indians of
their rights and exterminated them with
singular felicity tranquil II legally
philanthropic ly without shedding blood
and without violating a single great
principle of morality in the eyes of the
world it was impossible to destroy
people with more respect for the laws of
humanity de Tocqueville wrote on the
scene nothing reveals this remarkable
capacity more dramatically than the
Western reaction to the Indochina wars
which are in fact one of the most savage
episodes of the 500-year conquest they
left millions of corpses three countries
utterly devastated children being killed
to this day by unexploded bombs deformed
fetuses in hospitals in the south notice
not the north which was spared the
particular atrocity of chemical warfare
from this record one issue remains the
savage treatment of the United States at
the hands of the Vietnamese barbarians
they get it day after day in the press
today for example in the New York Times
we read stories with headlines like
Vietnam trying to be nicer still has a
long way to go with Asia correspondent
Barbara corset reporting that although
the Vietnamese are making some progress
on the missing Americans they're still
far from approaching our moral standards
and there's a hundred others with the
same tone and content presume Clinton
will be in the act properly statesman
like President Bush a few days ago
announced that it was a bitter conflict
but Hanoi knows today that we seek only
answers without the threat of
retribution for the past in other words
their crimes against us can never be
forgotten but we can begin he said
writing the last chapter of the
war if they dedicate themselves with
sufficient zeal to locating the remains
of Americans who they viciously blasted
from the skies we might even begin
helping the Vietnamese find and identify
their own competence missing in action
Chrisette ads and we perhaps might even
lift the embargo that strangling Vietnam
that is if American businessmen feel
that they're being cut out of potential
profits which is the only serious issue
the adjacent that was a story on the
front page of the New York Times right
next to it there's another one which
reported a visit of the Japanese Emperor
China where he failed to unambiguously
accept the blame for Japan's wartime
aggression that revealed again a deep
flaw in the Japanese character that has
very sorely puzzled American
commentators in the past year as they
commemorated the date which will live in
infamy namely a day when Japan attacked
the naval base in a u.s. colony that had
been stolen from its inhabitants by
force and guile loyalists elsewhere
insist on greater vulgarity for example
in England where you can find people
like Robert conquest who mocks reports
of us directed atrocities as the
sheerest absurdity perhaps the silliest
he wrote what in 1986 was a solemn
declaration but I'm quoting him by a
leading figure in Oxfam that he had
evidence showing that the Contras in
Nicaragua had committed various
atrocities especially against medical
and educational staff something that
would obviously have no possible motive
he explained that is therefore
transparently vulgar propaganda five
months before he wrote and on the scene
inquiry of 120 health professionals of
the American Public Health Association
and the World Health Organization had
reported that the Contras were quoting
systematically destroying hospitals and
clinics and killing and terrorizing
health care workers
many details Human Rights investigators
have provided a horrendous and detailed
record as for the reasons those who are
too stupid to be able to figure them out
for themselves could turn for assistance
to the CIA State Department and the u.s.
Southern Command who explained quite
clearly why the Contras were directed to
attack what were called soft targets
mean meaning undefended civilian targets
the former head of intelligence of the
main contra force who defected described
his training illegally in a US Air Force
Base and he explained how the Contras
there were trained in his words to
attack a lot of schools health centers
and those sorts of things we have tried
to make it so that the Nicaraguan
government cannot provide social
services for the peasants cannot develop
its projects in other words to ensure
that scarce resources I are diverted to
military expenditures as the CIA put it
in an internal July 1983 assessment
three years before a conquest explained
his perspective some of the commentary
to British press on the latest nobel
prize given to rigoberta and true really
sir passives belief sometimes when i
read the British press I must say I
think there's something subtle going on
that I don't understand you know too
subtle thrusts Colonials to catch or
something anyhow I'll quote if I'm
misunderstanding explain it to me the
others from the Telegraph they concede
that the Guatemalan army did Massacre
Indian populations and drive them out of
their country but I'm quoting it is the
left-wing terror tactics that have
plagued the Americas for more than a
hundred years not the genocidal
operations of the slaughterers and
tortured or of course their paymasters
and directors who remain unmentioned in
polite society the ideological movement
of the guerrillas posed a much greater
danger to the way of life of the
Highland Indians in Guatemala then the
brute
but fitful intrusions of the military
regime that's from the journals Central
American specialist you can find such
things elsewhere if you go down to the
depths of the Stalinist archives you can
find things similar to these
performances which are quite regularly
in the press in fact traditionally the
British have been able to compete with
the best in this game Lord Cromer
explained that the British possess in a
very high degree the power of acquiring
the sympathy and confidence of the
primitive races with it with which they
are brought into contact his colleague
Lord Curzon who is a Viceroy of India
proclaimed that in the Empire we have
found not merely the key to glory and
wealth but the call to duty and the
means of service to mankind in fact
heaven must be full to overflowing the
Masters of self adulation hard to be
taken at their word thod reason the
subject peoples find strange ways to
express their gratitude so narrow for
example who is incidentally quite an
Anglophile wrote that the only possible
parallel to the Viceroy of India would
be that of Hitler the ideology of
British rule he wrote was that of the
Herrenvolk and the master race an idea
inherent in imperialism that was
proclaimed an unambiguous language by
those in authority and manifested in
practice as Indians were subjected to
insult humiliation and contemptuous
treatment writing from a British prison
in 1944 Nehru was not unmindful of the
benevolent intent of the rulers the
solicitude with which British
industrialists and economists have shown
for the Indian peasant he wrote has been
truly gratifying in view of this as well
as of the tender care lavished upon him
by the British government in India one
can only conclude that some all-powerful
and malign fate some supernatural agency
has countered their intentions and
measures and made that peasant one of
the poorest and most miserable beings on
earth he also points out that you can
draw quite a good correlation between
the length of British rule in various
areas and the impoverishment of the
population other others have been less
genteel in their commentary although
Western culture which has the guns and
the wealth remains largely immune the
shameful record if considered it all is
regarded as insignificant or even a
proof of our nobility and it's here that
the moral and cultural challenge arises
at the end of the first 500 years of
this story which is sure to continue one
striking feature of the European
conquest has been the leading role of
state power and violence was a lot of
very good contemporary scholarship on
this summarizing a lot of it gains tray
starring James Tracy writes that
Europeans broke violently and to
relatively open asian trading systems
organizing their major commercial
ventures either as an extension of the
state or as autonomous trading companies
which were endowed with many of the
characteristics of the state and in fact
were backed by the centralized power of
the home country the English were
particularly efficient which is why
Britain won the game the booty that was
brought home by Sir Francis Drake and
other pirates may fairly be considered
the fountain an origin of british
foreign investments john maynard keynes
wrote laying the basis he pointed out of
the for the investments that were the
main foundations of england's foreign
connections by the mid 17th century
england was powerful enough to impose an
effective trading monopoly in the North
Atlantic while driving its rivals from
India where state power was used to
quite good effect at 20th century
british royal industrial commission
recalled that indian industrial
development was quoting not inferior to
that of
more advanced European nations when
merchant adventures from the West
arrived it may even be that the
industries of India were far more
advanced than those in the West up to
the advent of the Industrial Revolution
economic historian Frederick Claremont
points out citing British Studies on
that matter from 1700 written bard
Indian textiles later forcing India to
take inferior British products other
advanced Indian industries were also
undermined including shipbuilding glass
paper and others india became rural
rural eyes and impoverished an
agricultural colony of industrial
england such measures were unavoidable
Horace Wilson a friend of James Mills
wrote in his history of British India
1826 had this not been the case the
mills of Paisley and Manchester would
have been stopped in their outset and
could scarcely have been again set in
motion even by the power of steam they
were created by the sacrifice of Indian
manufacturers in 1757 as he conquered
bango Clive described the textile center
of Dhaka as extensive populous and rich
as the city of london by 1840 its
population had fallen from 150,000 to
30,000 Sir Charles Trevelyan testified
before a committee of the House of Lords
quoting him and the jungle and malaria
are fast encroaching Dhaka the
Manchester of India has fallen from a
very flourishing town to a very poor and
small town it's now of course the
capital of bangladesh the very symbol of
hopelessness and despair much like Haiti
which was the wealthiest colonial
possession in the Americas producing
three-quarters of the world's sugar by
1789 also leading the world in
production of coffee cotton and other
resources providing France with enormous
wealth from the labor of its roughly
half million slaves and later completely
devastated and large measure as
retribution for its successful slave
revolt as the savage injustice of the
Europeans took its course continuing
until the present day is going on right
now under Britain's permanent settlement
of not 1793 the lands of India were
privatized touched to that that yielded
wealth to local clients and taxes for
the British rulers while quoting the
settlement fashioned with great care and
deliberation as to our painful knowledge
subjected almost the whole of the lower
classes the most grievous oppression to
British Inquiry Commission in 1832 the
director of the east india company
reported that the misery hardly finds a
parallel in history of commerce the
bones of cotton Weaver's are bleaching
the plains of Indian note that the
experiment was a failure only for the
experimental subjects who far as I
recall were not asked to sign consent
forms but those who design the
experiment for them at work very well in
fact typically the experiments that are
carried out that the experimental
seventies don't even have the rights of
laboratory animals who at least are
considered subject certain ethical
requirements by the 19th century India
was financing more than two-fifths of
Britain's trade deficit providing a
market for British manufacturers after
the destruction of its own industry as
well as the troops for its colonial
conquests and of course the opium that
was the staple of British trade within
with China the experiment as it was
called in Bengal has been followed by
many others quite typically with similar
results although nobody grows any
conclusions from then I'll give looking
to just turn to a contemporary example
and quite an illuminating one namely
Brazil by the 1920s the colossus of the
South as it was called was hailed by the
US press as a mighty realm of limit
potentialities no territory in the world
is better worth exploitation than
Brazil's The Wall Street Journal pointed
out perceptively in 1924 after World War
two the United States was able to take
complete control kicking out the British
the the United States at that time was
very much in favor of and what they
called an open world but with a closed
hemisphere inside of it the closed
hemisphere the u.s. already controls it
was no need for that to be open and the
open door was not to be applied in Latin
America in the Middle East that's us
turf the rest of the world not yet under
us control was to be open and the
results are reviewed in a highly
regarded scholarly work by Gerald Haines
as the senior historian of the CIA I
didn't actually know there was such a
position until I read the book the US
goal he says was to eliminate all
foreign competition from Latin America
to maintain the area as an important
market for u.s. surplus industrial
production and private investments to
exploit its vast reserves of raw
materials and to keep international
communism out although US intelligence
he notes could find no indication that
it was trying to get in international
communism just a code word for people
with the wrong ideas the u.s. sought to
prevent what Washington called excessive
industrial development which he explains
means competing with us industry
industrial development from quoting must
be complementary to US industry while
guaranteeing American profits and
dominance and of course ample profit
remittance competition with foreign
capital say British or Canadian capital
was not considered excessive and
therefore allowed agricultural
development was promoted as long as it
avoided what he calls destabilizing
programs like land reform relied on us
farm equipment
and fostered commodities that
complimented us production and created
new markets for us agricultural
commodities Brazilian desires were
secondary he concedes although it's
useful to pack them a little bit and
make them think you're fond of them as
John Foster Dulles put it what u.s.
planners envisioned he says but seldom
stated was a neo-colonial relationship
with Brazil furnishing the raw materials
for American industry and the United
States supplying Brazil with
manufactured goods they the Americans
pursued a neo-colonial neomercazole asst
policy which he explains is a classic
liberal approach to development that
just shows you how supple an instrument
economic theory can be in the right
hands us leaders who says used Brazil as
a testing area for modern scientific
methods of industrial development
another angle and short for example us x
us experts encouraged Brazilians to open
up the Amazon to development and to
follow the US model of railroad
operation the latter perhaps a touch of
black humor but crucially they provided
Brazil with very sincere and advice on
how to benefit us corporations in fact
the account if you read through it is
inter larded with such phrases as the
best of intentions sincerely believed
and so on by lucky accident what was
sincerely believed conformed quite
nicely to the interests of us investors
however ruinous it might be to our
little brown brothers hands again
strikes traditional cords including the
endless faith in the benign intent that
so miraculously served self-interest
another goal he points out was
cultivating the Brazilian military which
US officials promoted as the protector
of democracy this farsighted program to
achieve our democratic vision came to
fruition in 1964 as the generals took
terminating Brazil's post-war
parliamentary interlude and instituting
a neo-nazi national security state with
ample torture and repression inspiring
their counterparts throughout the
hemisphere to do the same kind of
notable illustration of the domino
theory one which for some reason has
never mentioned when one brings that up
they followed approved neoliberal
doctrine again under can continue us
tutelage and created what was called an
economic miracle that was greatly
admired though there were some
reservations about the statistic
sadistic violence by which it was
instituted the brilliant achievements of
the generals and the right thinking
technocrats made Brazil the Latin
American darling of the international
business community business Latin
America reported in 1972 Arthur burns it
was chairman of the Federal Reserve was
also full of praise for their miraculous
work as the Chicago boys were invited in
by another collection of fascist killers
a year later after the overthrow of Ind
and Chile Chicago School economist
arnold harberger held up brazil as the
exemplar of a glowing future under
economic liberalism Latin American
economist David Felix report reports it
was true and people recognize that the
miracle had a few flaws over ninety
percent of the population lived under
conditions of increasing misery for many
of them comparable to Central Africa
omit examples which I presume you know
but profits flowed and the tiny elite
was doing fine and macroeconomic
statistics were quite okay so it was an
economic miracle in the technical sense
Haynes is writing in 1989 he describes
the results of more than four decades of
us tutelage and dominance
a real American success story America's
Brazilian policies were enormously
successful he writes bringing about
impressive economic growth based solidly
on capitalism this triumph of capitalist
democracy stands in dramatic contrast to
the failures of communism although
admittedly the comparison is unfair to
the Communists who had nothing remotely
like the favorable conditions of this
testing area for capitalism with its
huge resources no foreign enemies free
access to international capital and aid
and benevolent us guidance for half a
century and the success is indeed real
from the early years haynes writes us
investments in profits boomed as
washington intensified brazil's
financial dependence on the united
states influenced its government's
decisions affecting the allocation of
resources and nudged Brazil into the
u.s. dominated trading system if the
conditions of Eastern Europe are beyond
the wildest dreams of much of the
population that's the way the cookie
crumbles we should not underestimate the
scale of the achievement it took real
talent to create a nightmare in a
country as favored and richly endowed as
Brazil and in the light of such triumphs
which can be duplicated over much of the
world it's entirely understandable that
the rulers of the new imperial age
should be dedicated with such passion to
helping others share the wonders and
that the ideological managers should
celebrate the accomplishment with such
enthusiasm and self praise well such as
the way with experiments they don't
always succeed except for the designers
it's another one of those puzzling
irony's of history that being used the
well-behaved intellectual the essential
point about all this was actually
perceived by Adam Smith in one of the
many parts of his classic work that
nobody bothers to read he argued that
monopolistic companies and colonies had
a grievous impact
others and were harmful for the home
country as well that part you read what
he went on to say that our merchants and
manufacturers have been by far the
principal architects of policy and their
interests have been most peculiarly
attended to by the system though not the
interests of consumers and working
people in short the costs were
socialized and the prophets poured into
the coffers of the principal architects
well that too is a lesson that carries
over in the year 501 Adam Smith's
emphasis on the crucial element of class
conflict is only one of the many
interesting features of his thinking
that have been filtered out as it's been
converted into an instrument of
domination and depression state power
also played a major role in development
at home especially in England from the
days of the massive expropriation of the
peasantry and on there's a recent quite
an interesting recent study on this by
John brewer historian of England who
points out that Britain's emergence as
what he calls the military wunderkind of
the age in the late seventeenth and
early 18th century coincided with them
all these are quotes with an astonishing
transformation and British government
one which put muscle on the bones of the
British body politic contrary to the
liberal tradition written in this period
became a strong state what he calls a
fiscal military state thanks to a
radical increase in taxation and a
sizable public administration devoted to
organizing the fiscal and military
activities of the state the state he
points out became the largest single
actor in the economy one of Europe's
most powerful States judged by the
criteria of the ability to take pounds
out of people's pockets and to put
soldiers in the field and sailors on the
high seas lobbies trade organizations
groups of merchants and financiers
fought or combined with one another to
take advantage of
protection afforded by the greatest of
economic creatures the state its Brewer
the role of the state was not merely to
conquer and to conduct experiments it
also acted to promote exports to limit
imports and in general to pursue the
protectionist import substitution
policies that have opened the way to
industrial take off from England to
South Korea without any exception that
I've ever heard of the same is true of
the United States from textiles through
steel to modern electronics and
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology the
state has been called upon to protect
private capital from the destructive
impact of free markets to organize a
huge public subsidy and to provide a
state guaranteed market to cushion
management decisions the role has been
played primarily by the Pentagon based
system in past years there's now much
concern in the United States read about
it all the time over the need to find
other measures to guarantee the system
of public public subsidy private profit
that's proudly called free enterprise
now that the possibility of appealing to
the Great Satan the justify the
traditional Methodist has been lost the
crucial role of state of the state in
what's late development has been widely
recognized by economic historian since
the work of Alexander gershon Crone
about 40 years ago the east asian model
is one familiar case is a major study
and a very interesting one x 24 leading
japanese economists who review the
decision by the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry meet
the right after World War 2 they decided
to disregard prevailing economic theory
and the advice of their economic
advisors and instead to assign a
predominant role in the formulation of
industrial policy to the state
bureaucracy in a system that they say is
rather similar to the organization of
the
steel bureaucracy in the so-called
socialist countries the this radical
defiance of economic preset they point
out set the stage for the Japanese
miracle and Western specialists do not
disagree one of the leading conservative
Japan experts chalmers johnson describes
japan as the only communist nation that
works because they were efficient their
corrupt the pattern in fact is
exceptional asst as far as i know
economic success has invariably relied
on activist policies that deliberately
alter market incentives there's a very
extensive recent scholarly study by
hollis Chenery and others on which
reviews the point comparative study and
it points out that periods of
significant export expansion are almost
always preceded by periods of strong
import substitution look at the
exceptions you see they really prove the
same point that is state intervention
and violation of the market these
conclusions are important to bear in
mind as you observe the measures that
are now being employed to keep the third
world in its place now including Eastern
Europe which is being restored to its
traditional role true those who expect
to win the competition are going to law
the wonders of free trade so everybody
knows that Britain was a great advocate
of free trade from about 1846 up until
the late 1920s I became an advocate of
free trade after it had smashed up the
competitors and created its industrial
revolution and that put it in modern
terms the playing field was leveled
namely vertically which is the way it's
supposed to be leveled in the 1920s
however Japan unfairly began to produce
more cheaply and efficiently at which
point Britain effectively closed off the
Empire Empire followed by the Dutch the
Americans and the French an important
part of the background for the pacific
war the u.s. preached the principles of
free trade selectively as they've just
in the
after World War two for much the same
reasons until us hegemony declined and
what is these days called a tripolar
world economy Reaganite conservatism as
it's called doubled the percentage of
import subject the protectionist
measures among other devices of state
intervention which were in fact among
the most protectionists in the world in
the 1980s aid to dependent mothers
succumb to so-called conservatism but
aid to dependent bankers and steel
executives and electronics firms
flourished in fact throughout the
corporate sector has insisted on massive
state subsidies to maintain private
power and privilege that was a lesson
that was learned by the corporate
managers who flocked to Washington to
run the essentially totalitarian wartime
economy that in fact finally pulled the
u.s. out of the great depression belief
that capitalism might be a viable system
has long disappeared apart from the
remote margins and of course the
mainstream doctrinal system which
naturally seeks to subject intended
victims to its destructive impact but
the successful economies will not hear
of it and never have which is why
they're successful by World War two US
planners were well aware of their
unprecedented economic and military
power and they intended to use it to
organize the world in the interests of
the social sectors that they represent
at home the population are considered
ignorant and meddlesome outsiders who
must remain spectators not participants
in the political system putting walter
Lippmann and other progressive thinkers
as they develop the suitable democratic
theory for the modern age the economic
system must observe sure to appellate
Arian principles with the ravel
restricted to the role of rented tools
and passive consumers it was also
necessary at that point to reverse the
first and the last legislative victories
of Labor in the mid 1930s and to
dismantle the organizations and the
threat of democracy that they posed
that's at home abroad the industrial
societies were to be reconstructed along
similar lines that was a major task of
the early post-war period as the
traditional conservative order was
largely restored including fascist
collaborators while labour and the
anti-fascist resistance were weakened
and marginalized as much as possible
with great violence when that was
necessary the great workshops as they
were called were to be Germany in Japan
restored the conservative business rule
and under us control now that plan
required that Japan be provided with its
empire toward the south as George Kennan
put it he was the chief of the State
Department policy planning staff and one
of the leading architects of the
post-war world and Germany had to be
partitioned with the rich industrial
areas kept under unilateral Western
control and protected from what the
british foreign office called economic
and ideological infiltration from the
east which is something very like
aggression political successes by the
wrong people are commonly described as
aggression in the poor well ian language
of the internal documentary record so in
japan potential victory of labour which
everyone's afraid of would have been as
they put it concealed aggression by the
russians in vietnam the united states
was fighting what the kennedy
administration described as internal
aggression that is aggression by south
vietnamese peasants against the US
troops who were trying to defend their
country from them and so on throughout
the south throughout was to be restored
to its service role and in fact it was
sophisticated planning each area was
given its particular role africa was to
be exploited quoting kenan again
exploited for the reconstruction of
europe southeast asia was to fulfill its
main function of providing raw materials
and markets along with Latin America
Middle East resources were to be managed
by what British imperialists had called
the
Arab facade that could be trusted to
serve the interests of the Masters for
the third world generally a 1948 CIA
memorandum observed it would be
necessary to strike a balance between
supporting local nationalist aspirations
and maintaining the colonial economic
interests of Western Europe and there
could be little doubt as to the relative
weights when serious interests were at
stake well as global manager and global
enforcer the United States perceived the
main threat to all of this as what we're
called we're commonly called radical and
nationalistic regimes that are
responsive to popular pressures for
immediate improvement in the low living
standards of the masses and development
for domestic needs these are quotes
tendencies that conflict with the demand
for a political and economic climate
conducive to private investment with
adequate repatriation of profits and
protection of our raw materials and so
if this sounds like some tenth-rate
Maoist tract that's because the most
vulgar Marxism is absolutely standard in
the internal planning record and the
business press with of course the value
is reversed now I'll spare you similar
things radical and nationalistic regimes
are intolerable in themselves even more
so if they appear to be succeeding in
terms that might be meaningful to
oppressed and suffering people in that
case there's another couple other
technical terms that come along in that
case they're called a virus that might
infect others or a rotten apple that
might spoil the barrel of course not by
conquest but by the demonstration effect
of successful development so when Henry
Kissinger warned that the contagious
example of a nd's chili would infect not
only Latin America but also southern
Europe he did not I think anticipate
that I end his hordes would descend upon
Rome I say I think because the extent of
his ignorance and stupidity is hard to
it's a jury but I don't think he had
that in mind rather I assume that what
he meant was that Italian voters would
get a message that Democratic social
reform was a possible option the
sandanista revolution without borders
was a spectacularly successful
government media fraud but the
propaganda images did reflect an
authentic concern from the perspective
of a hegemonic power and its
intellectual servants declaration of an
intent to provide a model that will
inspire others which in fact is the
actual source of the imagery those
amount to aggression much as the British
Foreign Office understood in the late
1940s when a virus is detected it has to
be destroyed naturally and potential
victims have to be immunized the Cuban
virus called forth invasion
unprecedented international terrorism
and economic warfare all of which of
course continues and a rash of national
security states as in Brazil to prevent
the rot from spreading and much the same
was true in Southeast Asia in the same
years a notable example which gives
great insight into Western civilization
was the euphoric welcome that was
afforded to the huge slaughter in
Indonesia in 1965 which really have to
read to be believed the standard
approach to the virus itself is a
two-track policy as in the case of alien
days Chile the hardline called for a
military coup which was finally achieved
the soft line was outlined by ambassador
Edward chorea Kennedy liberal he's
explained we must do all within our
power to condemn chili and the chili ins
to utmost deprivation and poverty a
policy designed for a long time to come
to accelerate the hard features of a
communist Society in Chile so even if
the hardline did not succeed in
exterminating the virus the vision of
utmost deprivation should keep the rot
from spreading and ultimately
demoralized a patient itself and
crucially it provides ample
for the mills of the commissars who can
produce cries of anguish at the hard
features of a communist society pouring
scorn on those apologists to describe
what is in fact happening very same
model was applied to Cuba and Nicaragua
it was extended after Cold War pretexts
had to be abandoned simply showing their
utter irrelevance in the Cuban case in
fact the policies go back 170 years
another fact that has to be obscured by
the cultural managers well to introduce
some further technical terminology this
is mostly advice for those of you who
are looking for professional careers and
so you catch on rotten apples constitute
a threat to what's called stability so
as Washington prepared to overthrow the
first democratic government in Guatemala
in 1954 a State Department official
warned internally that Guatemala has
become a coating what Guatemala has
become an increasing threat to the
stability of Honduras and El Salvador
its agrarian reform as a powerful
propaganda weapon its broad social
program of aiding the workers and
peasants in a victorious struggle
against the upper classes and large
foreign enterprises has a strong appeal
to the populations of Central American
neighbors where similar conditions
prevail so stability ensured means
security for the upper classes and large
foreign enterprises and naturally it
must be preserved again such thinking as
pervasive and understandable and
entirely independent of the cold war
after the Gulf War when the cold war was
lost as a pretext beyond hope of
redemption George Bush returned to
support for his old friend and allies
that I'm the same as he crushed the
Shiites in the south and then the Kurds
in the north western ideologues
explained that although these atrocities
offend their delicate sensibilities we
must nevertheless accept them in the
name of stability the chief diplomatic
correspondent of the New York Times
again Thomas Friedman outlined Bush
administration reasoning
Washington II wrote seeks the best of
all world an iron-fisted II rocky hunta
without Saddam Hussein a return to the
days when Saddam's iron fist held Iraq
together much to the satisfaction of the
American allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia
not to speak of the boss in Washington
Saddam Hussein committed his first
serious crime on August second 1990 when
he disobeyed orders therefore he must be
destroyed you're not allowed to disobey
orders but some clone has to be found to
ensure stability incidentally while
Britain is agonizing over the curious
sudden discovery of what was always
known mainly the Britain in the United
States were arming their good friends
that I'm saying the compartmentalised
British mind is able to overlook the
fact that written is right now the major
military supplier to an absolute clone
of Saddam Hussein namely general suharto
who is using British aid to crush to
consummate the genocide and team or
among other pleasant actions but you
can't expect the commissar class to get
that into their heads the Communist
danger to stability is further enhanced
by their unfair advantages the
Communists are able to appeal directly
to the masses President Eisenhower
complained again using the standard
vulgar Marxist rhetoric internal
discourse our plan our plans for the
masses preclude any such appeal
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
add he added to this he deplored what he
called the Communists ability to get
control of mass movements something we
have no capacity to duplicate the poor
people are the ones they appeal to and
they have always wanted to plunder the
rich that's the greatest problem of the
modern Europe the same concerns extend
to the preferential option for the poor
of the Latin American church and
commitments to independent development
or democracy and they also extend to air
old friends like Mussolini and Hitler
Trujillo Noriega Saddam Hussein when
they forget their assigned roles
although major themes are persistent and
will continue into year 501 and Beyond
policies do have to be adapted to
changing contingencies there was a
change in World Order of lasting
importance that was recognized
officially in August 1971 when richard
nixon dismantled the international
economic order that had been established
after World War two in which the u.s.
served in effect this international
banker German led Europe and Japan had
recovered from wartime destruction and
the US was facing the unanticipated
costs of the Vietnam War world economy
was entering into a period of tribe
polarity and also of stagnation and
declining profitability of capital one
perfectly predictable reaction from the
early 1970s was a rapid intensification
of the class war that is waged by the
corporate sector its political agents
and its ideological servants of the year
since the last 20 years have seen an
attack on real wages Social Services
unions and need any functioning
democratic structure so as to overcome
the Troublesome crisis of democracy as
it was called that was brought about by
the illegitimate efforts of the public
to bring their interests into the
political arena in Central America one
can send out the death squads at home or
subtle means are required another
objective is to establish a de facto
world government which is devoted to the
task of ensuring that the world's human
and material resources are freely
available to the supranational
corporations and banks that are
denominated new imperial age its
operations have to be insulated from
popular awareness or interference it's
taken for granted that not very many
people are going to follow the internal
deliberations of the gap
negotiators or the IMF with their
enormous impact on global society and of
course not the transnational
corporations and international banks and
investment firms which are immune to
inspection and which dominate production
and commerce and conditions of life
worldwide in a system of internally
managed trade classical economic theory
a firm is considered an island of
central management in a sea and a
free-market sea by now the islands are
approximately the size of the sea and
the sea itself has little resemblance to
free market ideology an interesting
example of this is the north american
free trade agreement nafta that's now
being consummated in north america it's
going to have very large scale
consequences it's quite intriguing to
see how it's being handled it's you
can't be quite certain about what its
consequences are because it's secret
nobody knows what's in it it but it's
pretty clear that it's going to be a
bonanza for investors and probably a
disaster for workers in the environment
it's an executive agreement the text was
even withheld from a a union based Labor
Advisory Committee which is required by
law to review such measures it was
withheld until one day before the report
was due and then still largely kept
secret that's a striking example of the
utter contempt for democracy on the part
of the so-called conservatives which is
believe it or not even greater than that
on the part of the so-called liberals
Congress abdicated responsibility
citizens know nothing in such ways we
can approach the long-sought ideal
formal democratic procedures that are
utterly devoid of meaning as citizens
not only do not intrude into the public
arena but scarcely have an idea of the
policies that will shape their lives the
point in fact it's far more general by
now people have scarcely any idea what's
happening around them there's an
interesting academic study that just
appeared about the
presidential election in the US it
reports them less that less than thirty
percent of the population was aware of
the positions of the candidates on major
issues although eighty-six percent knew
the name of George Bush's dog actually
to my amazement I mentioned this on
Swedish radio in an interview right
after the election and before I got to
the last part the Swedish announcer
interview no you said oh you mean Milly
but the general propaganda does get
through when people are asked to
identify the largest element of the
federal budget less than a quarter gave
the correct answer which is military
spending almost half select foreign aid
which you can barely find I'm in dinneen
exists the second choice was welfare
which was chosen by a third of the
population who also far overestimate the
proportion that goes to blacks and the
child support and although the question
wasn't asked you can be sure that
virtually no one is aware that so-called
defense spending is in fact in large
measure welfare for the rich another
result of the study is that the more
educated sectors were the more ignorant
which is not surprising since they are
the main targets of the indoctrination
system and they are also the ideological
managers so they have to be instilled in
them the right ideas namely the proper
falsehoods Bush supporters who are the
best educated scored lowest overall on
factual judgment now the public is not
unaware of what's happening although
with the success of the policies of
isolation and breakdown of
organizational structure the responses
erratic and self-destructive faith in
billionaire saviors myths of past
innocence and all sorts of fanaticism
mixtures that have not had happy
consequences in the past in this general
framework the Cold War can be understood
in large measure as an interlude
the north-south conflict of the
Colombian era unique in scale but quite
similar to other episodes in its basic
logic even before Columbus Eastern and
Western Europe were diverging in fact
along a fault line that goes right down
Germany the Bolshevik take over quickly
eliminated any socialist elements but it
was radical nationalist it was a threat
to stability in the technical sense and
had no little appeal elsewhere in short
the soviet union from 1917 was a
gigantic rotten apple now and naturally
it called forth the the usual reaction
including immediate North Area
intervention now of course there are
other pre tastes so if you take a look
at say the George Kennan scholarly
history of soviet-american relations he
writes that it was the dissolution of
the Constituent Assembly in january
nineteen eighteen that created the
breach with the Western world with an
element of finality the British
ambassador was deeply shocked he said
and promoted armed intervention from
that point on Woodrow Wilson was
particularly offended a few months later
Wilson's invading army dissolved the
National Assembly and occupied Haiti by
genuine marine corps air methods and the
words of the marine commander Smedley
Butler major Smedley Butler the reason
was that Haitian legislators had refused
to ratify a constitution imposed by the
invaders that gave them the right to buy
up Hades lands there was then a marine
run club a site that remedied the
problem arranging for the Constitution
to be ratified with ninety-nine point
nine percent approval with five percent
of the
relation participating accordingly
Wilson is revered as a great moral
teacher and the apostle of
self-determination and freedom the
Bolsheviks in contrast had violated our
high principles and had to be overthrown
by force following the same high
principles the u.s. enthusiastically
welcomed the Fine Young revolution
carried out in Italy in 1922 as the
American ambassador described it well
into the 1930s Mussolini was that
admirable Italian gentleman in the words
of the man who took credit for the
Constitution forced on Haiti President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt fascist
atrocities were acceptable because they
blocked the threat of a second Russia
the State Department explained Hitler
was described as a moderate for the same
reason in 1937 the State Department saw
fascism as the natural reaction of the
rich and middle classes in self-defense
when the dissatisfied masses with the
example of the Russian Revolution before
them swing to the left fascism it said
must therefore succeed or the masses
this time reinforced by the
disillusioned middle class will again
turn to the left as you doubtless know
that conception is now being revived by
ultra-right and neo nazi german
historians and will doubtless be the
accepted doctrine of the future given
its utility for power interest a host of
other murderers and torturers were
placed in power and supported for on
exactly the same grounds the actual
logic of the Cold War from 1917 was much
the same as in the case of Grenada or
Guatemala although the scale of the
problem was vastly different situation
became more dire after 1945 when
traditional Eastern European service
areas were removed and the virus reached
such a level of military power that
actually had a deterrent effect lending
park assistance to targets of us attack
it's kind of interesting to see how the
problem of this oversized rotten apple
was dealt with in policymaking led to
some curious contortions there's a major
secret study of July 1945 recently
declassified in which planners tried to
put a satisfactory gloss on the u.s.
intention to take control of the world
and surround Russia with military force
while denying the adversary any rights
at all beyond the quarters that may seem
to be open to the criticism of being
illogical they worried but the criticism
they explained is only superficially
plausible the reason it's the u.s. plan
that is a logical illogicality one of my
favorite phrases the reason is that by
no stretch of the imagination could the
US and Britain be thought to have
expansion expansionist or aggressive
ambition but Russia is different for the
following reason they're voting there's
a rising tide all over the world we're
in the common man aspires to higher and
wider horizons and we cannot be certain
that the Russians have not flirted with
the thought of associating themselves
with this criminal conspiracy pursuing
the economy tactic of appealing to the
poor who have always wanted the fund of
the richest tell us later put it in
other words only when it has clearly
adopted the principle that the rich men
must have their way everywhere may the
Russians be allowed to enter the
servants quarters it's worth bearing in
mind that there was no concern over no
high-level concern over Russian
aggression and furthermore crucially
that Western leaders were completely
untroubled by Stalin's awesome crimes
Truman for example wrote that he liked
and admired Stalin thought he was honest
and clever and thought that he could
deal with him an Eisenhower and others
agree with what went on in Russia was
not his concern Truman declared Stalin's
death he wrote in his diary would be a
real catastrophe but he added a spin
crucial footnoted Stalin cooperation was
contingent on the u.s. getting its way
eighty-five percent of the time in short
as usual the problem is not crimes which
can be as awesome as you like but
insubordination that's a fact that has
been made clear by a host of gangsters
from Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin up
to Saddam Hussein for such reasons the
US had little interest in resolving the
cold war conflict that's getting late
i'll skip the history but in fact it's
true right up to the present this unless
you can return them to the service role
short of that no kind of settlement is
even worth thinking about in there were
many opportunities it's not endowed any
longer the soviet union reached the peak
of its power by the late 1950s always
far beyond the west by the mid-1960s the
Soviet economy was stagnating and
standard social indicators were
beginning to decline by the late 1970s
military spending was flattening and the
autocracy was unable to control rising
dissidents the command economy had in
fact carried out basic industrial
development but it was unable to proceed
to more advanced stages and it also
suffered from the global recession that
devastated much of the south by the
1980s the system collapsed and the core
industrial countries which are always
always far richer and more powerful won
the Cold War much of the Soviet empire
will probably return to its traditional
third world status with the old
communist party privileged class the
Menk Latura taking on the role of third
world elites linked to the international
business and financial interests which
is in fact exactly what's going on right
now throughout that period great efforts
were undertaken to present the Soviet
Union as larger-than-life about the
overwhelm us by the late 1970s Soviet
decline was absolutely unmistakable
there was rising hysteria about the
gargantuan Soviet system leaping from
strength to strength straddling the
globe challenging the u.s. even
threatening its survival establishing
positions of strength and Laos and
Grenada and Mozambique and other such
crucial centers of world strategic power
these delusionary efforts were
accompanied by much fantasy about Soviet
military spending which have since been
exposed as utter utterly false and quite
likely outright fraud too long soul save
you some other things the collapse of
the Soviet empire offers an um quite a
number of opportunities to Western power
along with the restoration of East
Europe the traditional service role for
one thing it offers crucial
opportunities to establish the
north-south divide more firmly within
the rich societies one aspect of
globalization of the economy is
globalization of the third world
two-tiered model they go together its
corollary well months ago the chairman
of daimler-benz warned the huge Chairman
conglomerate warned that if there were
further strikes the corporation would
transfer manufacturing facilities
elsewhere in particular to Russia with
its ample supply of trained and healthy
and it is hoped docile workers chairman
of General Motors uses similar threats
with regard to Mexico and other sectors
of the third world and incidentally
Eastern Europe it was a nice article
about this in the Financial Times the
other day which pointed out that while
GM plans to close 21 plants and the US
and Canada it has opened the huge 700
million dollar assembly plant in East
Germany with great expectations
heightened by the fact that thanks to
over forty percent unemployment workers
are willing I'm
from the Financial Times now workers are
willing to work longer hours than their
pampered colleagues in western Germany
at forty percent of the wage and with
few benefits the point is that capital
can freely move people can't or in fact
are not permitted to buy those who
applaud Adam Smith's doctrines which
required free movement of labour of
course apply them when it suits their
fancy the US press also bitterly
assailed the striking German workers
last spring for what it called their
soft life long vacations and general
lack of understanding of their place as
instruments for the rich and the
powerful the idea is that they should
learn the lessons that were taught at
the same time to American workers by the
caterpillar corporation profits and
productivity were up wages were down the
right to strike was eliminated by the
resort to scabs permanent replacement
workers returning the u.s. to the
situation of a century ago when the
admired philanthropist Andrew Carnegie
destroyed the world's these country's
largest union at Homestead by bringing
in scabs protected by the Pennsylvania
National Guard that victory enabled him
to slash wages imposed 12 hour workdays
eliminate jobs gained monumental profits
a magnificent record it was called that
was to a great extent made possible by
the company's victory at homesteads a
historian of the world's first
billion-dollar corporation the same
victory cured the region of the dread
threat of democracy as working people
were afraid to speak well on organized
for fear of being blacklisted and
starvation if not directed state
violence of which there was plenty these
conditions in fact were not overcome
until the Great Depression and they're
now being restored and so the world
should run and accord with what Adam
Smith called the vile Maxim of the
Masters and one of his many did
see Asians of capitalism all for
ourselves and nothing for other people
this caterpillar strike in 1992 is a
historic event as was the homestead
lockout century earlier its first time
in 60 years that a major corporation has
felt powerful enough to use the ultimate
weapon against a very substantial Union
the United Auto Workers in this case
these are the results of a fierce
corporate campaign that was undertaken
as soon as American workers finally won
the right to organize in the mid-1930s
after long years of bitter struggle and
violent repression which are completely
unmatched in the industrial world in
fact the violence was so extreme that it
even scandalized journals like the
London Times you can draw your own
conclusions from that that victory for
working people and for democracy sent a
chill through the business community the
National Association of Manufacturers
warned in 1938 of what it called the
hazard facing industrialists and the
newly realized political power of the
masses unless they're thinking is
directed we are definitely headed for
adverse adversity and a major
counter-offensive was very quickly
launched accelerated after the elite
concerns that were aroused by the crisis
of democracy of the 1960's and it has
had quite significant success the
results of it are neatly captured in a
New York Times headline a couple of
weeks ago in business section which
reads paradox of 92 weak economy strong
profits America is not doing very well
the article opens but it's corporations
are doing just fine with corporate
profits hitting new highs as profit
markets margins expand just paradox
inexplicable insoluble and it's one that
will only deepen as the architects of
policy proceed without interference from
middle some outsiders what the paradox
entails for the general population is
demonstrated
numerous studies of income distribution
real wages increasing poverty including
starvation infant mortality and so on in
cities and in rural areas that are
coming to compare in these respects to
the third world and of course the rich
is the world's richest country with
extraordinary advantages over all the
1980s have accelerated a global rift
between a small sector enjoying great
privilege and a growing mass of people
who are suffering deprivation and misery
the internationalization of capital that
accelerated since 1971 breakdown in
Britain would system also gives a rather
new character to competition among
natural national States just to sight in
one indication the u.s. share in world
exports of manufacturers declined about
three and a half percent from nineteen
sixty six to nineteen eighty four but
the youth but the share of us-based
transnational corporations increase
during this period and international
trade patterns reveal quite a different
picture if imports from overseas
subsidiaries are counted as domestic
production in fact foreign affiliates
increased their share of total exports
of manufacturers by us-based firms from
under eighteen percent in 1957 to
forty-one percent in 1984 there's a 1992
world bank study that reports that intra
intra firm trade meaning centrally
managed trade inside a particular firm
within the largest 350 transnational
corporations contributed about forty
percent of total trade those are the
islands and the alleged free trade see
more than a third of us trade is
currently between foreign affiliates and
their us-based parents that is
internally managed trade and current
figures are surely higher from these
which in fact are from a decade ago as a
social entity the country and most of
the population may decline but the
corporate empires are playing quite a
different game based on the theological
doctrine that the Masters have the right
to make in
vestment decisions unencumbered by the
concerns of their servants and the
workplace in the community and with some
somewhere around maybe a third of world
trade already conducted within North
based transnational corporations these
are factors of growing importance as we
look forward toward year 501 the
tendencies toward the new imperial age
that are heralded by the international
financial press are obvious and
understandable along with the corollary
the extension of the north-south divide
to the inhabitants of the rich but there
are counter tendencies throughout the
north notably in the United States a
great deal has changed in the last 30
years at least in the cultural and moral
spheres if not at the institutional
level if the quinn centennial of the Old
World Order had fallen in 1962 it would
have been celebrated once again as the
liberation of the hemisphere in 1992
that was impossible just as no
diplomatic historian today could write
about our task of felling trees and
Indians and get away with it there's
ample evidence also that Washington is
well aware of the domestic constraints
that virtually rule out state violence
traditional intervention the firm end of
the 1960's reached much wider circles in
the years that followed it elicited new
sensitivity through racist and sexist
depression to concern for the
environment respect for other cultures
and human rights one of the most
striking examples is the third world
solidarity movements of the 1980s with
their very broad social base in fact
right through middle America in this
case and their unprecedented engagement
in the lives and fate of the victims
that process of democratization and
concern for social justice could have
large significance well these
developments are perceived to be
dangerous and subversive by the powerful
and they're bitterly denounced as we
read
day in the press and journal and that
too is understandable these developments
do threaten the vile Maxim of the
masters and they also offer the only
real hope for the great mass of the
people in the world even for the
survival of the human species in an era
of environmental and other global
problems that cannot be faced by
primitive social and cultural structures
that are driven by short-term material
gain and that regard human beings as
mere instruments not ends thank
I think we may not have a great deal
more time in the world but it's just
time to take one or two questions and
name is very kindly agreed to answer
these before and just while you're
thinking of what those might be I have
had to further announcements one is that
the Raymond Williams trust will be
organizing next spring around Easter
time a seminar on his work shooting a
seminar where themes connected with the
nature of imperialism in the current
world and the cultural distortions that
that is produced were in the theme of
him books of his like the country in the
city will be taken up and developed if
you're interested in this could you
please write to Graham Martin professor
Graham Martin at the arts faculty at the
Open University and you'll be sent
further details also if you're able to
make any contribution to the trust that
would be gratefully received and you
should send it to professor Graham
Martin arts faculty the Open University
and just another thing that I might
observe is that I understand that noam
chomsky will be interviewed by John
Pilger on The Late Show the theme that's
right so I'm sure your advertisers been
wetted by this tremendous discourse so
pointed so precise such an indictment
could I now ask four questions
that's the lectures on philosophy of
history his final work you know the
summation of this thought 1830 1831 what
would you say about the post-industrial
society to being healthy industrial to
start it being another myth it's been
created in the here is part where you
can actually produce very little
productive well the majority of the
population somehow know what is is there
a myth of the post-industrial society
where you can produce very little you
can produce great wealth but with little
of the population productively employed
a great part of the population is
productively employed it's just employed
in Papua New Guinea and the high
repression areas the idea is to the
effect of the there has been I mean
there's always been multinational
corporations you know of course but
there's been a very rapid acceleration
since the breakdown of the international
economic system in the early seventies
very rapid acceleration there are other
factors that contributed to it too so
and that's what's indicated some of the
statistics that I mentioned so you now
have internally managed trade in a kind
of corporate mercantilism as it's
sometimes called where the labor is
moved to high repression areas so that
you don't have to worry about those
pampered workers at home as the
Financial Times puts it and in fact this
is a shit is a kind of if I don't have
post-industrial is the right term but
there is a shift of models there was a
kind of a Ford Henry Ford style model
where the idea was you've got it
production was basically net the economy
was more or less national not totally of
course but more or less national and
that meant you had to have consumers to
keep profits up so Ford innovated the
idea of paying workers enough so that
they could buy something and that would
enable
manufacturers to make profits I think
there's a shift away from them towards
production by workers who don't have to
buy anything because they're mostly
either in the third world or in the
third world that's coming back at home
in the United States and to a certain
extent in Britain where he can have high
repression unorganized workers who
really are not and then having organized
because you kill the organizers or
something like that and if they try you
just bring in others will replace them
because it a huge overflow as you drive
people off the land and so on now
they're never going to be consumers so
who are going to be the consumers well
in the internationalized economy there
are rich sectors everywhere fairly
substantial rich sectors in the
industrial societies and smaller but not
insubstantial rich sectors in the third
world so you know go to a typical third
world country say Brazil after this
great you know success story for
capitalism and say five percent of the
population or what something like that
live at approximately the level of you
know Western European elites may be
richer sometimes and you know eighty
percent live like you know central
Africa now in a rich society like say
the United States the proportions will
be different of course but the structure
is becoming more or less the same and
the idea is that the poor people
everywhere will be the wealth producers
and the rich people everywhere will be
the consumers and the domestic societies
the domestic the countries will be
essentially police forces controlling
their own populations while the major
decisions about a world economy and
world society are made by the
international corporations and financial
institutions and the de facto world
government which is growing in a quite
natural way to reflect their interests
that's the new imperial age of the
Financial Times the the decisions are
raised to the level of supranational
institutions where Parliament's can't
influence them and citizens don't know
about them the problem with Parliament's
is that all
they're more or less controlled by the
same interests they are to a limited
extent subject to the influence of the
rabble and you want to eliminate that as
you destroy democracy totally which in
fact has always been the aim of a lead
so I mean there are kind of dreamy
fantasies going around about history
with a capital H converging to a liberal
democratic order I mean this isn't even
fantasy continuing Chinese occupation of
the bet that's an atrocity but we ought
to look at its history in fact why does
China occupied to bed well one reason is
because in the 1920s in the 1930s the
western imperial powers insisted the
China occupied to bed they wanted China
to dominate the surrounding areas Tibet
Manchuria and Mongolia because it was
assumed that China's in our pocket it's
one of the China has been opened to
Western exploitation ever since the
British opened it up in the Opium War
forcing them to take British lethal
narcotics because there was nothing else
they wanted and ever since then China
has been a plaything for the West and it
was assumed in the 1930s that that was
going to continue so therefore China
ought to be as large as possible to be a
proper market and therefore the West
insisted on something which was by no
means natural name with in Manchuria
Mongolia and Tibet be incorporated
within China well later something
happened in China that the West didn't
like that much but they were stuck with
what they had achieved but I yes it's an
atrocity like most occupations
yea i meant to yeah well at the end very
rapidly so much so that she almost
missed it she thought she caught a note
of something positive and actually I
that's extremely important I mean it the
United States and in fact much of a
world is completely different culturally
and Marley than it was 30 years ago the
effects of the sixties riverbed
revolutions were enormous I'm you see
them in every imaginable respect and the
rulers are terrified of it I mean that's
why you have these tantrums now in the
press about what they call political
correctness they're sort of right you
know there are a lot of people around
who don't believe in racist depression
and in sexist depression and who have
respect for other cultures and think
you're to care about other people and
who are opposed to violent aggression
and who don't like sadism and terror I
mean all of these monsters are in fact
running around that wasn't a problem 30
years ago they weren't running around
but now they're there so naturally the
commissar class is becoming totally
hysterical that's they tried very hard
to get rid of them and they can't I mean
pick say the Vietnam War for the last 30
years there's been unremitting
propaganda in the United States to
portray the Vietnam were in fact the
whole history as an atrocity by the
Vietnamese and suffering Americans I
gave a couple of samples but it's
uniform and if you sample the educated
classes everybody sees it like that you
go to the general population and they
are totally out of control there's
regular polls because business wants to
keep its finger on the public pulse so
you know how to propaganda and stuff the
latest on this issue nineteen ninety
seventy percent of the population T 1
percent of the population regards the
war given a set of choices as not a
mistake but fundamentally wrong and
immoral among educated sectors is
statistically undetectable such a
position and that seventy percent of the
population is people who have never
heard it expressed everybody who answers
that question must think I'm the only
person in the world who thinks this
because they certainly never read it
anywhere all they read is it was a noble
cause that went awry and maybe Kim a
mistake and so on but nobody believes it
the population is just out of control
and it's the same on every issue I mean
when Anita Hill maid brought her charges
the whole thing turned into a
catastrophe but just imagine what would
have happened if Anita Hill had brought
those charges forward 30 years ago I
mean nobody even bothered to laugh you
know I mean yeah sure that's what things
they're supposed to be like well now
they could the Senate tried to suppress
it but they couldn't you know leaked out
and they had to pretend to face it of
course they didn't but they had to
pretend because the population is like
that and it's like that on every issue
in fact less just the day of the opening
of the ground campaign in Iraq there was
a leak of a very interesting document it
was hidden but it was there and was
interesting a bush administration
planning document from the early days of
the Bush administration and here's what
it said it said in the case of
confrontation with much weaker enemies
meaning anybody that we're willing to
fight you obviously don't fight anybody
is going to shoot back if you want
what's called a military hero is
somebody who sits in an air conditioned
to office somewhere shuffling around
papers while his troops murder people
who can't shoot back that's the
definition of a hero like Norman
Schwarzkopf from the British equivalent
his name I've forgotten the so in the
case of much weaker enemies it says we
must not only defeat them but defeat
them rapidly and decisively because
anything else will undercut political
support recognized to be completely thin
now you know there is a traditional
pattern of intervention goes way back
traditional intervention means you send
the Marines to occupy haiti for 20 years
or to chase son deno around in the hills
forever you know or you send like you do
like John F Kennedy
you send the US Air Force the stud to
start bombing South Vietnam the
smithereens that's traditional
intervention it's not even an option
anymore I mean the only options today
our clandestine warfare which is
clandestine means secret from the
population at home clandestine warfare
is just a sign of fear of the population
it's not secret from anybody else you
know think about what clandestine
operations are the not secret to the
victims you know the not secret to the
big network of states around the world
who are participating in them fact the
item secret from the press accept their
low enough levels they can pretend not
to know it their secret from the
domestic population and you only resort
the inefficient clandestine terror if
more efficient direct error is not
available that's why there was such a
sharp increase in London and complexity
of clandestine terror during the Reagan
years they know the population won't
accept it so that's one option and the
other is rapid decisive victories over
much weaker enemies when you're
guaranteed that they're not going to
shoot back and those are the only
options the so-called war in and the
Gulf which was not a war of course a war
means you got two sides shooting each
other the Gulf slaughterers we ought to
call it met those conditions first you
demonize the enemy and I terrorized the
American population then you go in very
fast destroy everybody before I run with
a guarantee that no one will shoot back
and that he get away with but that's you
know not nice for the victims but it's a
very sharp narrowing of the options and
this is true of everything but Quinn
Centennial is a very dramatic example
when they were planning the Quinn
centennial they were planning a
celebration of liberation it there was
so much popular protest they had to back
off it then became an encounter it was
about as much of an encounter as the
encounter between the Germans and the
Jews and Europe and the 1940s and plenty
of the population understands that too
so the whole thing just turned just
collapsed come to anything you know well
that's a sign of cultural improvement
it's even reached the educated sectors
went to a limited extent so for example
up until the 1960s it's remarkable but
up until the 1960s even scholarship you
know anthropologists and people like
that were completely suppressing the
history of what happened in the United
States I mean it was possible for a
leading diplomatic historian to talk
about felling trees and Indians and
nobody batted knowledge ok felling trees
an Indian you that now it's impossible
they had to start telling the truth
about what happened which is of course
mass genocide and it's not that they
found new evidence you know the evidence
was always around it was just suppressed
and it's coming out and there's fair
amount of understanding and that's true
of lots of other areas you know that's
really important those are tremendous
changes now they have no institutional
reflection you know yeah the great
genius of American and British society
has been to isolate individuals enough
to make people so isolated you know but
they can't do anything okay they're all
sitting there somewhere you may have
seen this the other day there was a
study of the European Community you know
life patterns how long do people sleep
and all that kind of thing and one of
the one of the questions they asked is
how long people watch TV Britain broke
the record you know ninety percent of
the population I think it was four and a
half hours a day of TV watching well
that's the perfect way to isolate people
you can have complete freedom you know
everything all democratic rights
absolutely perfect long as every person
is glued to the tube you know so you
can't talk to anybody and you can't get
together and you can't pull your
resources and you may have your own
crazy ideas in your head you know like
in your own head
yeah yeah the Vietnam War was an
atrocity but as long as that is happens
you can have democratic forms and that's
what's being achieved in the advanced
industrial societies that's what's being
called the triumph of liberal democracy
but you know it doesn't have to be like
that I mean unions and other popular
organizations were created in the past
under much more violent or impressive
conditions than exists today with a lot
of struggle and it can be done again and
you don't have to have the vile Maxim of
the Masters that Adam Smith deplored not
necessary you can go after the core
issue which classical liberalism also
deplore namely wage labor which was
regarded as atrocity by classical
liberals in the 18th century if you look
back yeah you go after that to this is
another form of oppression and autocracy
there are lots of possibilities if this
if these broadly based popular movements
can manage to overcome the fact that
they don't have resources and that they
are scattered and that they're isolated
and they're very little ways of
communicating with one another and so on
sure it can happen yeah
Oh
so so another's without the prop of
vandy communism which has been the basis
for the propaganda system for actually
70 years how can paper I think you
mentioned the independent but in fact
any paper continued to localize the
atrocities on some particular enemy okay
well you know the same way they did
before 1917 there actually was a history
before in 1917 now if you look back it
was the same you know I mean nothing
happened during cold war acceptable
pre-pasted I mean new methods of
mobilizing people say take the United
States which I know better than England
so i'll take the United States when
Woodrow Wilson sent the Marines to
occupy haiti and the dominican republic
which was no joke incidentally you know
they massacred people they reinstated
slavery as i mentioned they threw out
the constitutional system and place then
sold the country off to american
plantations it is yet to escape that's
the reason why haiti and the dominican
republic is still horror chambers the
pretty rich country when he did that
there were no no Bolsheviks around it
was 1915 1916 so he was defending the
u.s. from the Huns before that the US
Navy was defending the United States
from Chile believe it or not in the
1990s 1890s before before that it was
mainly defending him from England and
the way if you want to understand how
these things work you ought to look at
the u.s. record on English English was
despised you know it was regarded as
much worse than the treatment of Russia
this goes way back to the late 18th
century the idea expressed by the
founding fathers John Adams and others
was that England will always be our
enemy until we are her master the
takeover of Texas when the US took Texas
and the under the Jacksonian Democrats
the major motive was to try to
monopolize cotton cotton was then in
those days like oil is today
you know is the main commodity in World
Trade and it's what got the industrial
it was the main factor in the industrial
revolution so the idea was that if the
United States could control Britain was
very strong men you know like the
British fleet was a deterrent us
couldn't conquer qubit you know couldn't
invade Canada all these things i wanted
to do because the British power was too
great the idea was that if the US could
monopolize the production of cotton
which they figured they could do if they
took Texas we can not only bring England
to our feet but we can bring the entire
world to our feet you know i mean the
the worst charges against saddam hussein
were in fact real about the Jacksonian
democrats in the 1840s if you look back
and it was mainly England that was the
enemy that we had to defend ourselves
again I just led to some more comical
examples too if you like Thomas
Jefferson back around 1785 was trying to
figure out in the state 1790 and so on
was trying to figure out what it was
that made the English character so in
susceptible to civilization as he put
and he decided the problem he was
scientist you know so he decided that
the problem was probably that the
English ate too much animal food and he
therefore concluded that may be the
solution would be in their kitchens not
in their churches as he put it and in
fact couple years later he strongly
supported the French he was hoping
French would conquer England presumably
assuming that would improve the cuisine
as well as with characters and and it
just goes on from there you know so
Britain was true was the enemy which
inspired even more hatred probably than
than Russia and today is only this was
reciprocated except in the case of
British attitude toward the United
States it was contempt rather than you
know fear so for exempt you one example
and it's around eighteen seventy or so
some benefactress been
factor offered Cambridge University a
bequest for a lectureship in American
Studies which is kind of like as if
somebody offered them a bequest and you
know I don't know I can't even think of
an example to observe nobody could
imagine why you should study this but he
offered them a bequest in American
Studies and the idea was that every
other year they should get a Harvard
professor over to talk about you know
this colonial culture over there and
there's big debate about it in Cambridge
they finally voted it down and the fear
was that if they brought a professor
from Harvard you gotta read this to
believe it he would stir up subversion
among the the undergraduates and in fact
one of the Dons one of my favorite lines
how did he put it he said if we do this
there's going to be a biennial flash of
transatlantic darkness and they weren't
going to take any chances with this so
they turned it down so they you know the
problem with both ways but it's never
hard to conjure up enemies you know I
mean you go back to the Declaration of
Independence which is one of the most
disgraceful documents on record the US
the founding fathers were describing how
they were defending themselves against
the merciless Indian savages whose known
way of warfare is the massacre women and
children okay maybe by the 1950s people
had forgotten that but they knew the
truth they knew that it was the
merciless European savages who had to
teach the native people the the European
Way of warfare namely wait till men
leave the village and then you go in and
he slaughtered women and the children
they knew it because they were doing it
but they could say it anyway and in fact
we've been able to read it for 200 years
without batting an eyelash over so you
know conjuring up enemies is a job that
the commissars are very good at
