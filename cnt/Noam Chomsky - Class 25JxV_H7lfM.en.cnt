what's the word class means you not a
concept what do you think it refers to
what's class you know it has a history
but what I'm pretty simple minded
frankly if I can't see something in
simple terms I don't understand it that
in these areas it's not like science if
you take a look at society there are
just different roles that people play
there people who give orders and their
people would take orders actually and in
fact it gets institutionalized so for
example you know it takes a corporate
system again it's very strikingly
institutionalized there are the
directors and the banks who own them and
so on and so forth they basically set
the framework there are the managers who
sort of worked out how to apply things
that you have their own initiative and
they give orders they get down the line
and then their people just take orders I
mean they're not totally passive like
workers and strike and all sorts of
other things but the array of
decision-making in control is fairly
sharp okay those are classes by virtue
of the position in the economy and then
the roles that people play they have
different interests opposing Krishna so
to use different terms for other kinds
of hierarchy and domination so let's
take a patriarchal family so maybe the
father gives the orders and my mother
follows the orders and the kids do what
they're told
okay we don't call that class but it's
but that's just a terminological point
and it's another illustration of the
same kind of structural relations
economic classes and then this is okay
is classless nests
an economy it's kind of like asking
whether slavery is necessary you go back
to the 80s well you know 18th century if
you ask me it was so happy I was society
without slave can we eliminate class in
other respects I'm sure why not why
can't workers run factories in fact a
very live issue right now these issues
are just below the surface right now so
let's be concrete there's a economic
crisis and there's an environmental
crisis
and it's agreed across the board but one
way the United States has to try to deal
with this is to overcome our hopelessly
backward infrastructure backward is
compared with Europe and Japan so we
have terrible transit transportation
system was designed that way it was
designed and you know like massive
social engineering projects after the
war to be highly inefficient in
efficient front of money of money making
but based basically on wasteful use of
fossil fuels that's why I have
suburbanization you know destroy the
railroads and so on and so forth major
state corporate projects
all right that's now kind of like can't
go on you know we got a sort of at least
catch up to the rest of the industrial
world so you need high-speed rail
okay how do you get high-speed rail well
Obama sends his Transportation Secretary
to Spain so that he can use federal
stimulus money meaning taxpayer money to
buy that doesn't make contracts in Spain
for Spain you know it's like not some
superpower to provide us with high-speed
rail at the very same time Obama's
continuing to follow the
deindustrialization policies from the
1970s you know close down GM plants and
so on and so forth it's kind of like
couldn't couldn't imagine a more massive
criticism of those socio economic system
destroying a factory doesn't just mean
destroying the factory
I mean it's destroying the workforce you
know the community the communities
usually built up around the factories
and so on what is an answer the people
in those factories could take over the
plants running themselves convert them
to high-speed rail production it's a
task but not an insoluble one like
conversion of American industry to
wartime production in the 1940s was a
far bigger task it was done very
successfully it might need some
community federal support okay fraction
of what's paid to the banks so it's
perfectly feasible
