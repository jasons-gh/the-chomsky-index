the concept itself is that the phrase is
has become fashionable quite recently
but the concept is very old in fact just
about every act of violence and
aggression in history that falls under
the category of humanitarian adventure
intervention at least if we believe the
voices of the perpetrators so and that
that shows up there is scholarship
academic scholarship on the topic and it
shows up very clearly there so for
example one of the main scholarly books
dealing with the humanitarian
intervention and modern period by Shawn
Murphy finds three examples of
humanitarian intervention probably the
period before the Second World War the
first was Mussolini's invasion of
Ethiopia the second was Hitler's
takeover of the Sudetenland and the
third was Japan's conquest of Manchuria
and North China now of course he didn't
mean that these were real humanitarian
interventions but he meant that they
were the the standard kind they were
claimed to be humanitarian interventions
so Mussolini invaded Ethiopia to uplift
and Christianize and civilize the
backward people of the country actually
the same phrases that President McKinley
used when he invaded the Philippines
earlier in the century uplift and
Christianized them lifted a couple of
hundred thousand of them all the way to
heaven and the Philippines have yet to
recover from the humanitarian gesture
Mussolini's invasion was horrendous and
atrocious Hitler invaded took over the
Sudetenland
in order to for the noblest of purposes
to end ethnic cleansing to allow the
conglomerate of people there to live in
peace under the framework of the
superior technology and culture of
German civilization when the Japanese
invaded Manchuria and North China their
goal was to create an earthly paradise
and to protect the poor people of the
region from the Chinese bandits who were
trying to undermine this noble project
at least those of them who survived the
slaughter a huge monstrous slaughter and
that's pretty typical the early history
of humanitarian intervention is quite
similar actually one of the earliest
modern cases and one of particular
interest to us should be is happens to
be right here in 1629 the King of
England gave a charter for the bait the
Bay Area colony colony the Bay Area and
the goal of the the goal of the
settlement was to save the natives here
from their fate bitter pagan fate the
goal was the principle end of this
plantation king said was to civilize and
Christianize them and if you look up on
the internet you can find the Great Seal
of the bay colony of Massachusetts
that's us it depicts an Indian with
holding two Spears that pointed down in
a sign of peace and there's a scroll
coming out of his mouth which says come
over and help us so the colonists who
came were just responding to this plea
from the benighted natives to please
come over and help them
well a strange thing happened the it was
actually discussed later years Supreme
Court justice Joseph story in the two
centuries later in the 1820s expressed
as a surprise of what happened he said
that the wisdom of Providence which is
inscrutable to mere mortals caused the
natives to disappear like the withered
leaves of autumn even though the
colonists had constantly respected them
it's just one of those mysteries we
can't understand the Lord's wisdom and
depth actually the perpetrators knew
much better so revolutionary war hero at
General Henry Knox he was the first
Secretary of War in the newly liberated
colonies he described what they were
doing what they're doing he said is the
utter extrication
of all the Indians in the most populous
parts of the Union by means more
destructive to the Indian natives than
the conduct of the conquerors of Mexico
and Peru and he warned that a future
historian may mark the causes of this
destruction of the human race in sable
colors shortly hasn't happened shortly
after Joseph's stories musings on
Providence another one of the
perpetrators the architects of the extra
patient John Quincy Adams lamented the
fate of what he called that hapless race
of Native Americans which we are
exterminating with such merciless and
perfidious cruelty among the heinous
sins of this nation for which I believe
God will one day bring it to judgment
earthly judgment awaits and these are
not the staples of taught history
they're only the staples of actually
on the contrary what we constantly hear
is ODEs to our unique magnificence
called American exceptionalism also not
unique to the United States but very
striking right now the later history of
humanitarian intervention is not very
different after World War two there are
actually a few a few cases of military
intervention that had a very benign
outcomes actually there too in the
post-world War two period both in the
1970s in 1971 in the india invaded east
pakistan now bangladesh and terminated a
monstrous slaughter of millions of
people by the pakistani army at the end
of the decade 1979 of Vietnam invaded
Cambodia and put it in through Pol Pot's
atrocities drove out the Khmer Rouge
just at the moment when they were
peaking but these two examples don't
enter the Canon of humanitarian
intervention because they had a problem
the problem is wrong agency it's only
humanitarian intervention when we do it
we are our clients and there was another
problem with these two cases the u.s.
bitterly opposed them and moved very
quickly to punish those who had carried
out the crime of ending these slaughters
and atrocities in the case of India that
was Kissinger Nixon at the time the
Kissinger particularly was outraged by
this it was threatening to undermine a
secret trip he was planning to Pakistan
he'd already set up all the photo ops
and so on it looked like this might
undermine it we know from recent White
House tapes that were released that the
Kissinger was so furious he was calling
he was proposing the Nixon that they
used nuclear weapons
but what he said is that if we don't use
nuclear weapons the Russians will attack
China and we'll be finished that's the
great diplomat Henry Kissinger Nixon was
a little more restrained he thought that
mass famine in India would be enough of
a punishment for this crime and
Kissinger went on to mock those who as
he put it who bleed for the slaughtered
Bengalis the millions of them who cares
about them well fortunately Nixon
prevailed there was no Armageddon
although the United States did send an
aircraft carrier into the sea of Bengal
to warn the Indians of the punishment
that they deserve for the crime of one
of the two crimes of intervention that
actually had the major denying
consequences the other was 1979 Vietnam
was bitterly condemned for the crime of
ending Pol Pot's atrocities a New York
Times denounced them as the prussians of
Asia the United States imposed harsh
sanctions sorry the United States
imposed harsh sanctions and in fact
supported a an immediate Chinese
invasion to punish the criminals who
ended the Pol Pot crimes and the United
States immediately turned to supporting
the Khmer Rouge on the borders and their
attacks against Cambodia the diplomatic
and military support so those two cases
can't qualify as humanitarian
intervention if you look on there after
the collapse of the Soviet Union the
concept of humanitarian intervention
that became very popular now there was a
good reason for it
prior to the collapse of the Soviet
Union every US intervention that could
be justified as defense against the
Russians didn't matter how ludicrous the
pretense was
you could always claim defense against
the Russians so you didn't need any of
the pretext but with the Russians gone
some new pretext was gone was needed to
carry out the same policies which of
course was done so humanitarian
intervention was called upon the 1990s
were a very interesting period of
American history and in fact general
intellectual history there has never
been a period in mind not to my
knowledge
of such a few Civ praise for the
magnificence of any state on the part of
the most respected intellectuals of
respected figures give you a couple of
examples from the highest most respected
people the United States was an
idealistic new world bent on ending
inhumanity everywhere its foreign policy
entered a noble phase with a saintly
globe that's Clinton for the first time
in history a state has arisen that is
dedicated to principles and values
that's the Slav Havel acting from
altruism alone and moral fervor
hence free to use force where its
leaders believe it to be just supported
by the enlightened states who are its
respectful allies
that's a small sample of a deluge again
from the most respected and honored
liberal voices while all through the
years the crimes and atrocities mounted
I lost time to run through them well
there was a jewel in the crown which the
final triumph of this noble phase and
saintly glow that was the bombing of
Serbia in 1999 the Kosovo intervention
there was an enormous chorus of
self-congratulation
there was even there was an
international commission led by Judge
Goldstone Goldstone Commission of South
Africa which did can have distinguished
lawyers concluded that the bombing was
illegal but it was legitimate
and that phrase illegal but legitimate
has haunted us since why was it
legitimate because it was undertaken to
stop an ongoing ongoing atrocities there
are a couple of problems with that story
which is uniform it's repeated today
constantly but one problem is the
chronology it happens to be the other
way around
the bombing was the cause of the
atrocities it didn't it was not a
consequence of them the we have
extensive documentation of this one of
those richly documented cases in history
two huge State Department publications
the United Nations reports monitors on
the ground British parliamentary inquiry
and they all say the same thing it was a
 it was an unpleasant place until
the bombing but the bombing set off the
atrocities and in fact if you look at
the indictment of Milosevic for the
crimes in Kosovo you look closely you'll
notice that with a single exception they
all follow the bombing because that's
when the atrocities took place
furthermore it was anticipated the
general General Wesley Clark informed
Washington a couple of weeks earlier in
a discussion about what would happen
that if the United States NATO meaning
the United States did bomb of course the
Serbs would react with atrocities on the
ground he also informed the press as the
bombing began that it was predictable
that there would be a sharp increase in
atrocities so these horror stories
you've seen are real but they're the
consequence of the intervention so
that's one problem that one is easily
handled just by suppressing the
historical record almost totally
suppressed richly documented almost
nothing about it there was another
problem that the the traditional victims
of intervention vigorously objected
there was a major meeting shortly after
of the South Summit that's basically the
non-aligned countries about 80% of the
world
population and they bitterly condemned
what they called the so-called right of
humanitarian intervention referring to
Kosovo which they described this simply
old-fashioned imperialism and a new guys
well that one could also be handled he
wasn't reported a few mentions of it
were derided but it did cause a slight
problem the one problem was that the
notion humanitarian intervention was
somewhat tainted in in significant parts
of the world namely 80% of the world but
it was a little hard to maintain so the
intellectual classes had the ride to the
rescue with some new notion and the new
notion is what's called responsibility
to protect r2p
that was concocted right after Serbia to
try to deal with this problem well
that's I should say that that Kosovo is
also regarded as a precedent the recent
debate over bombing not much of a debate
over bombing Syria did point out that it
would be illegal but legitimate because
the international law has changed and of
many commentators even the president of
France pointed out that international
law is a flexible notion it changes as a
result of actions that are taken actions
of state that set precedents and the
United States set a precedent by bombing
Kosovo actually this is not quite
accurate so for example when Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait that didn't set a
precedent when the Russians invaded
Afghanistan of course not a precedent
and what is really meant in this
discussion is when the most powerful and
violent states carry out an action those
who are in a position to control and
shape the way histories presented that's
that's a president that's the reality of
it nevertheless there was a problem you
needed something new
r2p responsibility to protect came along
constantly invoked it's claimed to be
legitimate because it was supported by
the United Nations which is about half
true but there was a recent article you
may have seen in the New York Times by
Michael Ignatieff lauding humanitarian
r2p and saying we have to invoke it it's
a book about him by Derek which you
should look at recent book on this great
humanitarian
Ignatieff like others had to ignore a
slight problem here too there are two
versions of r2p one of them in fact is
was adopted by the United Nations 2005
UN General Assembly adopted a
responsibility to protect doctrine but
that one has a condition it says it has
to be within the framework of the United
Nations Charter so you can have
intervention to protect people but only
on the condition that it is either
authorized by the Security Council or
that's it's an immediate response to an
ongoing armed attack otherwise as
illegitimate before fortunately there's
another version of r2p that's the one
that the West appeals to while appealing
to the UN for legitimacy the second one
is the concept developed by a commission
led by Gareth Evans Prime Minister of
Australia who's a noted violent
interventionist himself but this one is
the operative version of r2p it's the
same as the UN version with one
exception it has a paragraph stating
that in the event that the Security
Council does not agree on the use of
force regional organizations can carry
out military intervention within the
area of their jurisdiction
subject to subsequent authorization by
the general assent by the United Nations
well there's only one reasonable
organization that can do this namely
NATO and its area of jurisdiction is the
world so what the second what the US the
western version of the operative version
these Nadiya version and others what
that says is that NATO can do whatever
it likes independent of international
law if they say Libya that Libya is an
African state that's within the African
Union that's the regional organization
they were not silent about the bombing
of Libya they were strongly opposed to
it you didn't read it here but they were
strongly opposed the African Union gave
a series of proposals for sensible
proposals for diplomacy and negotiations
to try to achieve the end of the civil
strife without leading to a humanitarian
crisis as the bombing in fact did they
were disregarded they are not the kind
of regional organization that is
authorized to take a position in the
case under the responsibility to protect
doctrine Libya's you know is now a total
ruin didn't read about it in the paper
this morning it's such a disaster that
they've even had to stop exporting oil
almost entirely well the fact is that
whatever term is used the accepted Canon
of humanitarian intervention the one
accepted here at Harvard by
distinguished intellectuals by Western
powers that's the one that authorizes
aggression and violence by the powerful
and whatever name is given to it
the real hit that's official history the
real history is an annoyance which is
easily ignored if we of course allow it
to be ignored
