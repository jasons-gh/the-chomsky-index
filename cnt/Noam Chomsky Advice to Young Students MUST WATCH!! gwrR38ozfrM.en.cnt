and I spent many hours and night
answering letters and a fair number of
them are from very sincere very
concerned mostly young people who are
asking that question can you give me
advice about what I should do I can't
stand what's going on I'd like to do
something about it what should I do and
it's a very frustrating it's a funny
it's a question which reveals a
pathology and the society the idea that
you have you should ask somebody who is
up on high so for some reason to tell
you what to do it's nothing that works
you've got to find out for yourself what
to do and nobody can give you advice not
me not Bertrand Russel lives up there
not anybody it's it's a it's a highly
personal matter you know as much as
anyone else does maybe not on the
details about how the economic system
works but you know what matters you have
choices we have people like us have my
comparative and historical standards
have an unbelievable amount of freedom
and privilege means plenty of
opportunities which makes it harder I
see a lot of narrow choices and you just
have to find your own way I mean I never
gave advice to my own children and if I
had they wouldn't if they did any
attention to it
rightly they just found their own ways
for interesting ways there'll be a lot
of false starts inevitably you can learn
from the failures and you try other
things and that's sooner or later you
find something that works for you it's
not the right there's no right answer
for everyone it's very different right
answers lots of things that can be done
so you have to find it for yourself
