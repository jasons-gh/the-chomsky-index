Sung- Wake uo...not time for sleeping...

Abel: Do you think the reawakening social justice concerns
in the Catholic Church  speaks to a paradigm shift
something like we saw- particularly in Latin America with the Catholic Church
there,
a focus on liberation? Noam: There's a good test of this.
In 1962 with
Vatican II- Pope John the 23rd
introduced a very substantial paradigm shift.
He tried to restore the Gospels to the church.
They'd been essentially eliminated, except in form.
since the 4th century, when the Roman Empire
took over Christianity, as soon official religion,
This is a major change and it was picked up in Latin America, as you say,
became most (often) called liberation theology. Priests and nuns
lay people went out talk to peasants
set up groups in with a group of peasants would read the Gospels, think about their
radical pacifist message. There is a reason we're Christians were persecuted
for three centuries- gospels is a radical...
It is basically radical pacifism
with its preferential option for the poor. They tried to restore and
what happened? Well, the US went to war
fought a bitter, brutal violent war against the Church.
If we had Free Press.  that's the way they present it.
It started out with hope, you know,
a long listed religious martyrs.
There's another photograph,a painting over there which depicts them.
The overthrew governments,  the institutional of
Neo- Nazi style dictatorships; a  major war against the church
which ended, sort of, in 1989
with the assassination of six leading
Jesuit intellectuals by a- what we should call them a terrorist group.
A US-backed, US trained,  US Armed battalion
in El Salvador which it is come from
renewed training at the Kennedy School counterinsurgency warfare
acting on official orders of the  Salvadorian command,
very close to the US Embassy.  I don't have to attribute this to the US government,
it accepts this.  The School of the Americas which
trains latin-american officers, killers basically,
one of it's talking points is that the US Army helped defeat Liberation Theology.
Okay that's what happened when the church
tried to return to the gospels. It's not happening now
and the reason is that so far nothing much is happening.
What's happening is...you know, I like the fact that the tone has shifted.
there's more... better words about social justice but
we have to see if it crosses the point
where it leads to, say organizing people to
insist on their rights and to
pursue the path love preferential option for the poor,
take a gospel seriously, if it gets to that point,
then I think we'd see the same reaction.
