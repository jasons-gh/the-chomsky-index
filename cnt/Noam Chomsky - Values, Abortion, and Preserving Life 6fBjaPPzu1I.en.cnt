there are conflicting values and taken
in isolation each of the values is quite
legitimate so the value of preserving
human life or for that matter the life
of any organism that that is a value
that we should accept you shouldn't just
go arbitrarily kill some animal because
it's fun to kill it
I that's a reasonable value on the other
hand most people will agree to swat a
mosquito ok well that the idea that life
is should be valued has come into
conflict with another value and we know
what that one is
and that's commonly the case the values
that we hold are not absolute
they are always contingent they conflict
and life is made up of decisions in
complicated situations in cases of
conflicting values if you listen to just
one in isolation yeah it may sound
legitimate and maybe is but you have to
ask what it means under particular
conditions so choice is legitimate
preserving life is legitimate and
sometimes they run into conflict is
reasonably well in fact very well
established that as women have more
opportunities more education as better
medical care is available as more family
planning is available fertility rates go
down
abortion goes down the children are
better cared for and women are healthier
those things are known and those are all
things that that are easily under social
control and that are not should not be
controversial I don't think there should
be anything controversial about making
sure that women can have access to
decent to say obstetric care now that
alone would save hundreds of thousands
of lives every year if you want to do
things that will help people there are
very easy ways to do it
and that's not just true of women it's
also true of children that's UNICEF also
reports that
my memory is correct at about 15 million
children die every year from mostly from
easily treatable diseases
I mean sometimes things like you know
lack of drinkable water and our
dehydration you know diarrhea things
that can very easily be treated and
could be treated for literally pennies a
day from the rich countries well okay
we're serious about saving lives saving
children's lives they're easy ways to do
it on the other hand if you look at the
same people who are most militant about
saving the fetus are they calling for
increasing foreign aid are they are they
concerned with the fact that the United
States has the most miserable miserly
foreign aid program of any developed
country by quite a large margin other
countries got plenty of wealth you know
the means are easily they out there
they're just being used the social
policy is being designed to enrich the
wealthy even further and let the poor
suffer let the children die let them
starve let the mothers die and so on
that's an overwhelming problem once
people address among people who are
willing to address those problems people
are willing to address those problems we
at least take seriously when they talk
about values when you can take people
seriously when they talk about values
you can listen to what they say about
other things like abortion which is a
hard question but I'm not I don't think
we should be interested in discussing it
with people whose values are such that
they don't care about the massive
problem of killing and harming women and
children that they could easily deal
with and are doing nothing about by the
like any complex historical text
presents a God who can be called upon to
justify mass genocide and who can be
called upon to justify mercy to widows
and orphans same God depends what you
want to what parts of the texts you want
to interpret everyone in the debate is
opposed to outright infanticide
that is taking a live child and deciding
to kill them because too much trouble
take care of everyone agrees on that
everyone agrees I suppose that women are
allowed to wash their hands although I
suppose I guess you could make a case if
you went over to the biology department
that when a woman washes her hands lots
of cells flake off and some future
technology might be able to use the
information in those cells to construct
the potential child so somewhere between
say washing your hands and killing your
three-year-old somewhere between that
there are decision that there are
decisions to be made about how we're
going to balance what we call life which
in fact is there in the cells in your
hand how we're going to balance what we
call life against lots of other problems
and those decisions are not simple
people who say well I know it's it that
this number of days there can't be taken
seriously what we're talking about
ambiguous issues of a complicated kind
where you have to balance conflicting
interests and concerns as is generally
the case in human life you're not going
to get the answers from holy texts
you're not going to get the answers from
biologists these are matters of a human
concern that have to be discussed
seriously reasonably with attention to
the array of value differing values
often that people have and different
decisions they may come to under similar
circumstances
