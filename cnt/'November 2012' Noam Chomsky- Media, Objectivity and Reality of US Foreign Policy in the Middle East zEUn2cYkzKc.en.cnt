actually spoke here at and one of the
earlier sessions of this series a couple
of years ago following Amy and I've had
that experience a number of times it's a
it's a very humbling experience when I'm
really unfair because the instinct they
have is just to say you know I endorsed
everything she said in this inspiring
way which I can't duplicate but this is
much worse this is really unfair I've
never had the experience of speaking
after one and Amy that's hopeless so I
probably ought to just shut up but I'll
say a few words anyway both of them
brought up issues of media I'll start by
saying something about that there is a
very high ideal that's celebrated by the
especially the elite media and that's to
maintain objectivity objectivity has
very definite meaning in media culture
it means repeating accurately anything
that said within the Beltway if you do
that it's objective if you go beyond
that it's biased subjective you know
emotional and so on and so forth now
there's another concept reality and
objectivity and reality often don't
quite match in fact it quite often
there's a huge gap between them sort of
obedient by nature I'll start by talking
about objectivity and move very quickly
to reality and I'll keep two
oh sorry I'm sorry yeah any better yeah
okay that's right oh yeah sorry my voice
isn't very good
the I'll keep the foreign policy given
the you know the topic of the general
event is plenty to say beyond and you've
heard a lot on foreign policy there are
some issues where where conformity is so
overwhelming there's basically nothing
to say
there's only objectivity mainly
repeating what everybody says
the sofa is one example which in fact
was brought up was the President Obama's
global assassination campaign now the
drone campaign that's pretty remarkable
I mean there are countries that have had
assassination campaigns the Pinochet
Chile South Africa had had one Khomeini
is Iran had one Israel's had one for
years but there's nothing remotely like
the sophistication and scale of Obama's
campaign we've read a lot about it and
what's written about it is pretty
interesting that's you know I'm sure the
decisions are made in the White House by
the president after having read passages
from st. Augustine and discussed them
with his priestly adviser and I won't
tell you what the rules are you know
about them and then they murder anybody
they like this is there's a little
discussion of this in an interesting way
there's a little bit of a flicker of
interest over the fact that they
sometimes kill American citizens so when
they killed an American cleric and
Yemen oh lucky there was kind of a
little talk maybe it's nice nice to kill
Americans they also haven't the killer's
companion in the car was also an
American a couple of weeks later killed
his son 16 year old son also an American
so a little Rumble about that but
killing anybody else is just fine but we
don't the only question is how much you
should do it
no there was there was an interesting
article and at times you may have read
if I got chained one of the reporters
who exposed it actually presented the
White House version of how all this is
done with great pride and he said yeah
there's some moral questions but the
last line of his article was look it's
better than Dresden which is true you
know we could do worse
and that's that's roughly the the range
of objectivity should we do Dresden or
should we do global assassination
actually the same this disparity shows
up in the NDAA case which I wasn't you
know about I was a plaintiff in it but I
felt kind of uneasy about it the NDAA
case was about it it's focused on the
fact that the legislation that was
passed Obama signed and he's now taking
to higher court to try to get enacted
that legislation allows the government
in principle to carry out preventive
detention without trial indefinitely of
American citizens and we're not supposed
to like that but what about anybody else
I mean this violates principles going
back to the Magna Carta in 1215 which
says that no no one shall be deprived of
Rights without a due process of law and
a speedy trial by peers since you've
written into the American Constitution
fifth and sixth amendments so that's all
being scrapped
and it's okay but there's a little
question about Americans why should we
accept that why should we even pursue it
well this is all beyond discussion so
here we're just talking about
objectivity now the same is true of
something else which I don't know if you
follow but it's worth getting your eye
on one of the new expansions of the
remarkable state that's being
constructed by the president is the
disposition matrix it's a very
interesting idea there's a huge
surveillance system all over the world
collecting huge amounts of information
about anyone the government thinks might
someday you know want to do something we
don't like and you feed all of it most
of the information you know that kind of
informations I mean I am worth laughing
whatever it is it goes into a major a
computer system which is collecting
enormous amounts of data and it somehow
links up in ways that haven't been
explained yet to another computer system
which is collecting huge amounts of data
about Americans and from this data the
government is supposed to call
information about who it wants to
dispose of that's the disposition matrix
but that's gonna be nobody really knows
there's no precedent for this there's a
little talk about it but only objective
talk just repeating the few words that
are said inside the beltway
well since I'm talking about foreign
policy here we can there's a very easy
way in this case to give an objective
account of the issues in international
affairs for example you can look at the
last presidential debate if you can bear
it
yeah Ami's forced to do it for
professional reasons but the rest of us
can skip it but as I'm sure you know
there were two words in the presidential
debate that actually dwarfed anything
else overwhelmed everything else the one
word was Israel the other word was Iran
Israel because each candidate had to
express their overflowing adoration for
Israel and everything it does and
incidentally for Obama this is nothing
new I wrote about him just using his
disgraceful web page before the
primaries in 2008 it was shocking but
this time he had you know exceeded his
opponent it was also overflowing with an
adoration so that's Israel why Iran well
two reasons one Iran is a threat a
threat to Israel maybe even an
existential threat and two it's the
greatest threat to peace in the world
that's hammered in over and over if you
look at the media the next day they were
quite objective they reported calmly
that Iran is the greatest threat to
peace in the world you know after all
that's objective reporting and this
continues in in the more indirect ways
so a couple days later in fact the day
before the election I take a look at the
New York Times it was full page with two
topics in it
the top story top half of the page was
about a discussion a debate that took
place in the Israeli cabinet a couple
years ago 2010 about whether just go
ahead and bomb Iran or whether it'll
wait and there's a discussion of the
debate and it goes into the pragmatic
issues can you manage it and you get a
that I will it be hard to refuel the
plane I think one was talking about and
they finally decided well this isn't the
time for the tone of the discussion is
interesting it has been a series of
discussions like it
not long before the Secretary of Defense
Leon Panetta was asked about Israel
bombing Iran he said well we we don't
really think it's a good idea but
they're a sovereign country so if they
feel like doing it it's their business
we have nothing to say about it what
everyone should do when you read that is
a reversal do a thought experiment
suppose there was a report about an
Iranian meeting planning to bomb Israel
and deciding whether they could get away
with it or whether it wouldn't work
quite right and so on would we have this
reaction actually you know what reaction
you'd have take the alleged comment by
nodding a job that one exposed as a
fraud years ago but it keeps resounding
over and over came back today it's too
good to lose that they have to wipe
Israel off the map doesn't matter
whether that's true or false or
anything's good to use so we use it I
mean that's been a major that
non-charged by a non-person has been a
major part of the propaganda campaign
against Iran suppose something happened
like what happened in the Israeli
cabinet well leave it to your
imagination the bottom half of the page
is about Israel there was a comment by
Abbas the you know she's technically
what he's called the president of the
palace of the Palestinian Authority
actually isn't but the in which he made
a comment in which he said that he'd
like to visit the town where he was born
soffit but
he wouldn't want to live he wouldn't
want to go back and live there and that
caused a huge furor different kind of
furor and the Mideast and here the furor
here was well maybe this means that
finally Israel and the United States
have a partner for peace lesson which
they've been yearning for and striving
for for years but the Palestinians are
Arabs generally are so outrageous and
impossible that they've never been able
to have a partner for peace so maybe
there's a chance now well let me say a
couple of words about each of these
cases of objectivity so let's start with
Iran three questions should immediately
come to mind when you read that Iran is
the greatest threat to peace in the
world
the first question is who think so the
second question is what's the threat and
the third question is if there is a
threat what you would be doing about it
okay so let's look at those well who
thinks so pretty simple answer it's a
Western obsession that most of the world
doesn't think so the non-aligned
movement which is most of the countries
in the world most of the people in the
world by far just had a one of their
regular meetings this one was in Tehran
and once again they strongly endorsed
Iran's right to enrich uranium they
harshly condemned the sanctions and they
called for a nuclear weapons free zone
in the region I'll come back to that I
don't think there was a word about that
because the report it wouldn't be
objective nobody in the Beltway said
anything about it so it's not them well
what about the Arab world you know
they're right there that's an
interesting case the public opinion in
the Arab world has repeatedly been
polled by the leading US polling
agencies and the results are interesting
they do see threat the two major threats
that they see
or Israel in the United States they
don't like Iran that's hostilities that
go back forever but they don't regard
Iran as a threat very small numbers
regard I ran as a threat
in fact opposition to US policy is so
strong that in most of these polls
pretty high numbers think that the
region would be more secure if Iran had
nuclear weapons they don't want Iran to
have nuclear weapons of course but at
the balance US and Israeli power and
maybe that would be better that to
report that again would not be objective
nobody says that in the Beltway and you
have to look really hard to find mention
of it I've found a couple of words in
the mainstream press what you do see is
something different that the Arab
support us on Iran that's Harold and all
over the place in fact WikiLeaks was
interpreted as saying that with big
headlines about how maybe WikiLeaks is
being run by the CIA because they're
giving such great information and it's
not totally false but you have to ask
who they're referring to which Arabs
well it turns out the Arab dictators
some of the Arab dictators support US
policy and if the dictator supporters
and the population overwhelmingly
opposes us that means the Arab support
us that teaches us something about the
how deep-seated the contempt for
democracy is and the fear and hatred of
democracy and that shows up right away
in the Arab Spring everything you read
you know Thomas Friedman this morning or
anything else that talks about how much
the United States loves the the pressure
for democracy in the Arab world it's
exactly the opposite pressure for
democracy in the Arab world is
terrifying to us leaders as a very
elementary reason just take a look at
the public painful
ended them up to the extent that a
democracy's functioning public opinion
as an influence on policy so does the
United States one say a Jew that
havethey to follow up policies based on
the idea that the major threats they
face are Israel in the United States
Iran isn't a threat and they ran should
develop nuclear weapons to balance the
u.s. no they don't want that so they
have to be against democracy and feel
look at the actual record you can see
that that's exactly the way it works I
won't run through it because there's no
time but straight forward however this
is going outside the realm of
objectivity into reality that's a
dangerous step that's the who question
what about the what question what's the
threat one what one said is accurate I
think and it's also it comes from the
most authoritative sources absolutely
most authoritative sources the Pentagon
and US intelligence they provide every
year they provide an analysis to
Congress of the global security
situation of course a big section on
Iran and they talk about the Iranian
threat what they conclude is that Iran
has very limited capacity to deploy
force it has very low military
expenditures even by the standards of
the region I mean in comparably less
than us or our allies it has a strategic
doctrine the doctrine is defensive to
try to deter direct invasion long enough
for diplomacy to set in and they say if
and they don't know because nobody knows
they say if they're trying to develop a
nuclear capability and what one was
talking about that would be part of the
deterrence strategy and if you just
think about the geostrategic situation
which is
obvi enough so obvious enough I don't
talk about it it is hard to imagine a
country that has a greater need for a
deterrent it's almost obvious so maybe
they're doing it as part of their
deterrent strategy that's the main
threat there's a secondary threat
they're destabilizing the region how are
they destabilizing the region they're
trying to extend their influence in
neighboring countries in Iraq and
Afghanistan so when we invade and
destroy the countries that's stabilizing
when they try to expand their commercial
political cultural influence that's
destabilizing well all this fits
together that makes perfect sense on the
principle that we own the world so we
have to have a right to do anything we
want anywhere and that's a dominant
principle of policy you know not just
the u.s. it's the kind of policy that
flows from overwhelming power there's
nobody's ever been anywhere near as
powerful as the US is but you get
similar theses measured by the level of
power that a state has we are kind of
out of sight so it's enormous and in
fact one of the most significant
developments in the world today is that
while the u.s. still formally maintains
the principle that we own the world that
and that policies that flow from it the
capacity to implement those policies is
declining and that's causing tremendous
fear in the establishment as much fear
as you find in the weight community here
when they see that they're going to be a
minority pretty soon you can read
Foreign Affairs you know main
establishment journal a couple of months
ago front cover announcing the topic of
the issue big black letters is is
America over question mark
because we can't anymore fully implement
the policies of the last 70 years based
on the principle we own the world and
this is a common theme right through
establishment discourse well that's
that's worth thinking about too I simply
endorsed one said about it well that's
the what question so that's who thinks
is the threat and what the threat is
how about doing something about it okay
so let's assume for the sake of
discussion that Iran does pose a threat
okay what can you do about it the threat
is that there allegedly trying to
develop nuclear weapons can you do
anything about that
well it's something very simple you can
do that one thing you could do is follow
the advice of the non-aligned movement
move to establish a nuclear weapons free
zone in the region now that's not new
that goes back a long time for the last
roughly 20 years Egypt in particular has
been pressing hard for a nuclear weapons
free zone in the in the region it was
back before that the pressure is so
strong that on the regular
non-proliferation treaty meetings the US
has been compelled to endorse it clinton
endorsed it that bush twice the concept
five years Bush refused to endorse it
Obama endorsed it but added a
qualification it's a nice idea but not
now and furthermore it has to exclude
Israel in fact it has to exclude even
any commitment to any country to provide
information about Israel's nuclear
weapons program meaning us so a great
idea but this condition has been unit
first by accident that happens to be
Israel's policy their policy is that
wonderful idea but first we have to have
complete regional peace
everyone has to accept Israel's right to
exist and other things that can be put
off indefinitely well okay that kills
the possibility of solving whatever the
problem is in a simple way now how could
that be changed it could be changed if
there was a mass popular movement in the
United States calling for implementing
this proposal but there can't be a mass
popular movement until somebody knows
about it at this point you look at the
objective behavior of the media and here
I think it's a hundred percent I have
not seen one word in maybe you can find
one in the mainstream media even
referring to this now that's pretty
striking because it's imminent there's a
conference coming up in a couple of
months getting Helsinki to try to move
forward on establishing a nuclear-free
weapon zone Israel's already made it
pretty clear they're not going to attend
the u.s. won't do anything unless
pressed the media with perhaps a hundred
percent uniformity should be pretty
impressive even a totalitarian state
have refused even to mention try to find
an exception well that's how you could
deal with it incidentally this is not
the only nuclear weapons-free zone in
the world there are others that
countries have been trying to implement
one is in Africa the African countries
did agree to establish a nuclear free
weapon zone but they can't the reason
they can't is because there's an island
in the Indian Ocean
Diego Garcia which was a British
dependency actually belongs to African
country but the United States
asked or ordered you pick it England to
kick out the inhabitants so the US could
establish a major military base it's one
of the major military bases that
Washington uses for bombing the Middle
East and Central Asia and Obama built a
database up much faster he expanded it
in fact to accommodate nuclear
submarines submarines with
nuclear-tipped missiles and other ways
expanded enormously now as long as that
base has nuclear weapons Africa can't
implement its nuclear free weapon zone
there's another Zone in the Pacific the
Pacific countries have tried to
implement a nuclear weapon zone
at first it was blocked by France 15 20
years ago because France wanted to carry
out nuclear tests and it's specific
dependencies okay that's long over now
it's bad it's a block by the United
States because the United States insists
that its Pacific dependencies
accommodate nuclear weapons
installations so that's another
possibility of extent of moving towards
the nuclear-free world that Obama is
very you know just wonderful soaring
rhetoric because it's called about but
the crucial one is the Middle East one
and it's also worth adding something
else that doesn't get recorded but it's
quite important of all the countries in
the world the United States and Britain
I have a unique obligation to move in
this direction for very simple reason
you recall that when the US and Britain
invaded Iraq they tried to provide a
kind of a thin legal cover Iraq was
developing weapons of mass destruction
well we don't have to talk about the
outcome of that but that was the cover
and that went back to it and they
invoked a Security Council resolution
from 1991 687 which called on Iraq to
abandon its nuclear weapons policies
weapons of mass destruction policies you
read that resolution and it also adds a
commitment by the signers to move to a
nuclear-free weapon zone in the region
okay now that imposes a very powerful
obligation on the two countries that
carried out some of the worst aggression
in recent years on the basis of that
resolution try to find a word about that
No
okay that's how you can deal with it in
fact whatever the threat is is a very
simple way of dealing and mitigating it
or ending it but can't happen unless
people know they can't know unless the
media move beyond objectivity to reality
and incidentally it's not just the media
it's the media in the whole intellectual
community it's not just the United
States it's the whole West a lot of work
to do on the major threat to peace in
the world allegedly well let's turn to
Israel in the United States yearning for
negotiating negotiating partner in
Israel Palestine it's a very interesting
history I wish I had time to go through
it but I'll just pick a few of the
points the issue of Israel Palestine
have reached the international agenda
after Israel's conquest of the occupied
territories 1967 and the u.s. did have a
policy at that time official policy the
policy was in accord with UN resolution
242 which everyone formally accepts at
least US policy was that Israel should
withdraw from the occupied territories
back to the international border with
perhaps minor and mutual modification
so the international border was in fact
a ceasefire line so okay straighten out
the line here and there that was US
policy until 1971 at that point
something quite significant happened the
president of Egypt Sadat accepted a
proposal from the international
negotiator to have a full peace treaty
from it with Israel total peace treaty
everything the normalization and so on
if Israel would withdraw from the
occupied territories and in fact the
only part he really cared about was
Egyptian territory the Sinai
90 Jordan made a similar offer right
after so here was a possibility to have
total security but without expansion
there was a choice are we gonna have
security or expansion that's the most
fateful choice in Israel's history if
Egypt was out of the conflict it's the
only serious Arab army so okay you've
got security the Israeli cabinet decided
against it they were putting in motion
plans to develop the Sinai a big Jewish
city on the Mediterranean a lot of
colonies and so on
the question is always as what's the
u.s. going to do about it that's what
determines well there was an internal
debate in the United States the State
Department was in favor of it it was
pretty much their program in fact but
there was somebody else involved
character named Henry Kissinger he was
against it probably because he wanted to
take over the State Department it's
probably internal bickering but his
policy as he said was what he called
stalemate
no negotiations just forced and it was
he assumed that others assumed at the
time that Israel was overwhelmingly
powerful that they could disregard the
Arabs long story and Kissinger prevailed
and since that time
Israel backed by the United States has
devoted its efforts international
efforts to expansion at the expense of
security now this changed a little in
nineteen in the mid-70s the official US
policy and UN 242 didn't say anything
about Palestinian rights and nor did
Sadat's offer they were just treated as
refugees but by about 1975 that changed
the issue of Palestinian national rights
reached the international agenda and
that caused problems for the u.s. in
January 1976 a Security Council
resolution was brought by Egypt Syria
and Jordan the main Arab states calling
for a two-state settlement on the
international border with a Jewish state
in a Palestinian state Israel and
Palestinian state and then it included
all the wording of UN 242 so with
guarantees for the right of every state
in the region to exist in peace and
security within secure and recognized
borders us vetoed it when the u.s. veto
is a resolution it's a double rope veto
it doesn't happen and it's vetoed from
history and objective commentators don't
refer to it so try to find some you can
find it's documented there's no debate
about the facts but try to find some
mention same thing happened in 1980 same
resolution this time Carter vetoed it
and long story since I won't run through
it the most recent US veto in the
Security Council was actually did get a
little commentary because of so
outlandish
that's Obama in February 2011 a
resolution came to the Security Council
coin on Israel to live up to official US
policy official US policy the verbiage
you hear is don't expand settlements
there's a very minor issue incidentally
the issues the settlements which are
totally illegal there's no question
about that
not the expansion but the Security
Council resolution was weak it
reiterated US policy and Obama vetoed
that's February of 2011 that pretty much
ended any talk of settlement expansion
well quickly since there's only another
minute are there what are the options
there how do you deal with the problem I
mean if all the problems in the world
this may be one of the easiest to deal
with
I'm it's always called intractable
impossible no negotiating partner and so
on it's all perfect nonsense there's an
overwhelming international consensus
includes essentially every one of the
Arab states Organization of Islamic
states which includes Iran the
non-aligned movement everyone calling
for essentially the 1976 resolution one
thing stands in the way the United
States of course Israel doesn't like it
but they can't do anything like unless
the u.s. backs them small country so
it's in our hand u.s. continues to block
it the u.s. does call for negotiations
but take a look at the kind of
negotiations it's calling for they have
two crucial preconditions one
precondition is they'll run beaten run
by the United States the United States
is not a neutral party it's a
participant along with Israel and
blocking it this makes about as much
sense as proposing that Shiite Sunni
conflict and Iraq should be mediated by
a
anybody said that you burst out laughing
but this is the same it's saying that
the major party that has blocked
negotiations for 35 years should run the
negotiations the second condition is
that settlement expansion must continue
furthermore must continue even when it's
formally stopped you see references to a
10-month stop and expansion but that's a
joke take a look at what happened all
sorts of devices were allowed to keep
them from expanding so this is two
preconditions yeah let's have
negotiations that are run by the country
that's been blocking settlement for 35
years and let's ensure that the major
issue expansion of the settlement that
continues I should say there's a lot to
say about Gaza a lifetime but one thing
is crucial if you go back to the Oslo
agreements 1993 you know celebrated with
great of all I won't go into what was
wrong with them but one crucial element
in them was that Gaza and the West Bank
are a single territorial entity its
integrity cannot be broken right away as
the United States and Israel initiated
programs to separate them there by now
totally separated if you're a the Gaza
is a kind of a cage you can't get out of
it but if somebody in Gaza wants to go
to a college in the West Bank visit
their cousin go to a hospital and the
West Bank Hospital Alma virtually
impossible I mean you may be fine
half a dozen cases were to happen but
essentially impossible people die in
Gaza because they can't get medical
treatment does it mean that going to the
part of their territory which is one
unit well again objectivity doesn't
allow reference and discussion of this
just to summarize very quickly the
major issues that the presidential
candidates debated the greatest threat
to peace in the world Iran and Israel's
needs yearning for peace and our efforts
to try to bring it about there's a
response to those a simple one the
United States
in the case of Iran is a straightforward
solution nuclear weapons free zone
it's not gonna solve everything it's an
important step forward would reduce
tensions that would essentially
eliminate the problem but that can't be
implemented or even initiated unless a
large-scale popular movement in the
United States acts to compel the
government to do something about it and
that cannot happen if nobody even heard
about it if nobody even heard about say
the Helsinki conference coming up so the
media are doing their job on that one
and the same is true of the second there
is a settle of at least a temporary
short-term settlement of the
israel-palestine conflict which again
could reduce conflict set in motion
other things the whole world is in favor
of it except for the United States and
Israel so we know exactly where the
problem is and that's a very optimistic
conclusion I think in both cases because
the one thing we can influence in the
world is the policies of this country to
the extent that it becomes a Democratic
Society and to the extent that we can
overcome what the founder one of the
founders of modern political science
Hans Morgenthau called our conformist
subservience to those in power the
pathology of the educated population
