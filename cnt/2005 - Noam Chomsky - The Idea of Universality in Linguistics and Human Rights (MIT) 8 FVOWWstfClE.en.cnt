directors to make this sort of anti
behavioral move in linguistics and I
think you sort of hint at how we might
do so in the political realm important
two examples and the sort of influence
that lead to different judgments and we
also point to sort of the similarities
we have you know genetically you know
with the studies looking at little
babies and stuff and perhaps what you
would call the combinatorial capacity
philosophy might we philosophy we might
call practical reason or something that
as sort of the basis of our difference
and potentially our ability to overcome
those differences but here's a here's
another question and a group of adults
all raised in the same country mostly
exposed to the same influences growing
up in terms of cultural influences why
is such a divergent set of moral
appraisals between government elites and
people not in government what's the
contribution of that particular
institution to this sort of these that
sort of is able to overcome what would
normally you would think would be very
deep-seated moral intuitions well first
of all I don't think they're to look
very far it's true of all of us I mean
when I'm in the examples I was giving I
purposely gave to because they
illustrate the educated culture in which
we are all heart which is not very far
from government elites or affect their
right from here you know and many of
them people we know and or or the media
so it's very it's it's an intellectual
moral culture that we're all part of
like Harvard squares led the coro so if
we think about it we can answer the
question by looking in the mirror and I
think the answer we find is that when
you begin to play an institutional role
of some kind you
just you can only do it there's only one
two approaches you can take one is to
just recognize that the institution is
inherently immoral and has to be
significantly changed in which case
you're out or else you somehow stay
within it to accommodate to begin to
internalize its values no matter how
they conflict with your own and you live
these joint lives it's true and just
about I mean I it's hard to find a
counterexample we can find it in our own
lives we find that governments we've had
it in corporations anywhere we look you
have these this is your choice will I
resist and try to change the structure
of the institution if I recognize in one
part of my moral capacities that it's a
wrong repressive murderous and so on or
will I simply accommodate to it in one
fashion or another and there are a lot
of ways to do that one of them is to
convince yourself almost always falsely
that actually you're doing good by doing
wrong that's why when you look at the
history of leadership articulate
leadership you find that everything they
do is Noble it's hard to find an
exception try to find a historical
exception even among the worst monsters
you know Hitler Stalin pick your choice
everything they did was noble and
there's very good reason to think that
they believed because we see when you
look at documentary records that they
talk to each other the same way they
talk in public so you kind of
internalize them yeah it tomorrow so
when Japanese fascists let's say we're
and there we haven't have extensive
records because defeated country so
therefore you get their archives
the written article about it for years
ago if you're interested in the records
came out but the Japanese fascists who
were carrying out the most horrendous
atrocities in Manchuria in north China
were convinced and talk to each other
privately about how they were carrying
on a noble endeavor trying to create an
earthly paradise for the people of the
region led by Japan's generous and
humane concern and they had to protect
them from the Chinese bandits who were
trying to destroy the legitimate
governments and it was so hard and they
were suffering so much and trying to do
all these wonderful things and so on you
just compare that with the actions and
so and you which find is that they're
very much like us because we do exactly
the same thing for example in the cases
that I mentioned and I think the
mechanisms are probably about the same
and I think if we think about it we see
them in our own lives
I've ever fingered the US military in
the US media and one woman who is my
agent lived through the war just looked
at me and she's like you could have
taught us whatever you wanted to teach
us but we pointed at each other and
killed each other and so what challenged
me was what is it that shits perception
of humanity to people when their
neighbors and how how do we separate
this pointing fingers from what is human
nature and whether it is human nature
and then how to move forward within that
paradox I would only say one word no no
just do you talk about it and that is
that i don't think it makes a lot of
sense to point fingers unless we're
pointing them to ourselves that's where
we should start at least very easy to
criticize other people for all the
terrible things they do but anyone who's
honest will begin by saying well what am
i doing and if we look turns out it's
not so pretty so just to take one
totally different example everyone is
very much exercised about the horrendous
atrocities in Rwanda right 400 days they
were killing about eight thousand people
a day roughly you know maybe 800,000
people and we didn't do anything about
it and isn't that awful well in fact
there's a lot more to the story I mean I
myself was writing about those
atrocities in the 1970s because they
were going on you know not at the scale
of 1994 of it very serious something
could have been done about and something
was done about it one of the things that
was done was that the international
institutions World Bank IMF
there's imposed structural adjustment
programs which in fact exacerbated the
conflicts just as they had originally
been almost created by built-in and
German imperialism and then they were
exacerbated by the social and economic
policies that were imposed and they
finally blew up to something horrendous
scale well you know the problem of using
military force in Rwanda or anywhere in
fact is very tricky military force has
unpredictable consequences and you
really have that strong reason to do it
big heavy burden of proof to bear but
there are many things very much like it
that it easy to do and that we don't do
although we know about like for example
right now there is Rwanda level killing
going on among just children in southern
Africa every day about 8,000 are dying
from easily treatable diseases with
something which we could deal with not
by military intervention but just by a
few cents you know in rich countries
that wouldn't even notice it but we
prefer not to look at that because there
would be a marginal inconvenience so we
therefore go see Hotel Rwanda and talk
about how awful a are well yeah they
were pretty awful but we have to look
very far to find similar things you talk
about human nature I mean I think
actually there there are two sides to
human nature that are relevant here one
which you your remarks point to is we
are frightening ly flexible in our
abilities to draw lines around people
and consider some people as truly
deserving within some circle and other
people as totally outside and in case
after case governments can play on our
tendency our ability to do that and
manipulate it okay but another aspect of
human nature is that we can study
ourselves and we can criticize our own
notions and we can rise above that
and I mean I think we see this this this
has happened in the history of science
and that we can be optimistic that it
can happen here particularly given that
the evidence shows that that the insofar
as this tendency to draw lines and
segregate out people from each other is
thought to have some rational or factual
basis the science says that that's not
true that there is no important
distinction between any person on this
planet in any other that merits the
kinds of distinctions that have been
drawn and the conflicts that they've led
to so it's the other side of human
nature that can examine these questions
and critically that I hope we can rely
on to address this problem take one more
one last question I own professor
Chomsky my question to you it's not a
it's a question I find myself faced with
people who particularly have a military
background or very patriotic
