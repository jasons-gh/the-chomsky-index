I wrote a book called fateful triangle
us-israel the Palestinians focused on
the war discussed background and
prospects the triangle remains a
reasonable image I suppose it reappears
in the title for these remarks but it's
kind of misleading it's not an
equilateral triangle it's more like an
isosceles triangle with a very narrow
base so that the other two sides are
virtually parallel a lots changed since
but that remains true the basic issues
remain there are very broad issues of
right and justice with deep historical
roots there are narrow but crucial ones
about policy choices for the short-term
oh they will lay the basis for what
comes i'll keep this latter topic in
these brief comments that means keeping
to the post 67 period though obviously
that's only part of the story
immediately after the 67 war israel
initiated the settlement policies that
continued to the present and some of the
leading figures made the purpose quite
explicit of the most important was Moshe
Dayan Minister defense in charge of the
occupied territories he said we must
consolidate our hold so that over time
we will succeed in digesting Judea and
Samaria in the West Bank and merging
them with our little Israel meanwhile
dismembering the territorial integrity
of contiguous the West Bank no we should
establish what he called permanent rule
mem shallot Keva and he would that would
have to be done by expropriating land
from
owners under the pretense on quoting him
the pretense that the step is necessary
for military purposes these are
procedures that Israel had conducted
repeatedly with inside what he called
little Israel famous cases karmiel he
informed his colleagues that we should
tell the Palestinians that we have
nothing for them they will live like
dogs and whoever will leave will leave
and we'll see where that leads to hear
eckin I that this is in violation of
international law but he said states
violate international law so we will too
and they can when the superpower
mastered the world approves by now the
illegality is beyond serious discussion
that includes the Security Council so
for example in 1979 not UN Security
Council passed resolution for 46 which
stated that the policy and practices of
Israel in establishing settlements in
the Palestinian and other Arab
territories occupied since nineteen
sixty seven have no legal validity and
constitute a serious obstruction to
achieving the comprehensive just and
lasting peace in the Middle East where
them terminated that was passed 12-0
with the US and Britain abstaining it
now includes the International Court of
Justice that includes the US Justice on
the crucial issue it also includes
Israel itself right after 1967 Israel
was leading the legal authority to adorn
mehran's now a distinguished
international legal figure he informed
the government that any settlement at
all in the occupied territories would be
in violation of the Geneva Conventions
basic international humanitarian law he
was packed in that by
the Attorney General yaakov ship Jean
Shapiro and as I mentioned diana's well
in illegally annexed East Jerusalem and
the go on Syrian Golan Heights there are
specific Security Council condemnations
right away in fact in 1968 Israeli
unification of Jerusalem establishing
the capital was declared illegal by
Security Council 13 20 two abstentions
United States and Canada was reiterated
in 1980 with the US alone abstaining it
with regard to the Golan Heights even
the United States agreed and joined in
1981 and declaring the annexation and
settlement illegal interestingly a few
days ago the New York Times referred to
the Golan Heights as disputed territory
they're keeping obediently to us
practice which is in violation of
official policy than the Security
Council vote well in the next major step
was in 1971 when President Sadat of
Egypt offered Israeli full peace treaty
this is through glory re the
International mediator full peace treaty
no mention of the Palestinians except as
refugees in return for Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied territories
he cared only about the Suez Canal
Israel then had as was every Egyptian
Sinai the is the Israeli cabinet
considered the offers rejected it making
a very fateful decision they were
preferring expansion to security peace
treaty would have it with Egypt would
have meant total security but they were
then expanding into the Egyptian Sinai
and preferred that well the important
question as always is
what the US will do there was an
internal debate in the United States a
Henry Kissinger won the debate and
imposed the policy that he called
stalemate eight years later in his
memoirs he explained this he said until
some Arab state showed a willingness to
separate from the Soviets or the Soviets
were prepared to dissociate from the
maximum Arab program we had no reason to
modify our policy of stalemate no
negotiations just force that's pretty
astonishing it's unbelievable that he
didn't know that Saudi Arabia didn't
couldn't separate from the Soviets
didn't even have relation diplomatic
relations with them and Egypt was
eagerly trying to separate from the
Soviets and as far as the Russians were
concerned their position was extremely
moderate it was right in the mainstream
of international opinion in fact even
official but not actual us opinions it's
kind of interesting that scholarship
permits Kissinger to get away with these
ludicrous remarks as it does well after
the u.s. rejection Sadat removed the
Russian advisers tried in every possible
way to get the United States to join him
in calling for peace there was no
reaction that led to the October 73 war
which is a very close thing for Israel
and indeed for the world there was a
threat of nuclear war there are some
recently declassified documents from the
Israeli in US archives that shed a good
deal of light on what happened and these
is a very crucial moment the Kissinger
later recognized that as he puts it
during 1973 it was possible to prevent
war and the archives report his meetings
with Sadat's adviser hafezi smile before
the war and Kissinger says frankly what
what what I did in these meetings was to
speak with
him about the weather at every other
topic in the world just so that we
didn't touch on the subject of an
agreement I attempted to gain time
postponed at month after month we didn't
desire talks so stalemate force no
negotiations then came the war a
Kissinger wet as far as calling a
nuclear alert to warn the Russians to
keep out while he was secretly advising
Israel that they could violate the
ceasefire that had been imposed by the
US and Russia his goal explicitly was to
keep control after the wreckage for
which he was largely responsible that
led the ship shuttle diplomacy finally
the Camp David agreements of 78 79
that's held in the united states as a
diplomatic triumph it's actually a
diplomatic tas dirty it led to the what
happened the the rejection of Sadat's
offer and 71 led to terrible suffering
very serious threats the United States
and 78 79 essentially accepted Sadat's
1971 proposal but in a form that was
harsher from the us-israeli standpoint
that involved now formal recognition of
Palestinian rights of course this was
immediately ignored by Israel and the
u.s. remained silent meanwhile
palestinian national rights had reached
the international agenda in january 1976
a Security Council resolution yeah
Security Council resolution the call was
proposed by Syria Egypt Jordan so-called
confrontation states calling for
establishment of a two-state a
settlement on the internationally
recognized border with and then came the
wording of UN 242 recognition of the
rights of every state in the region to
peace and security within
secured recognized borders that was
vetoed by the United States I won't run
through the rest of the record it
continues until today the most recent
security council resolution which was
somewhat note worthy enough to be
reported it called for a endorsed
official US policy namely ending
settlement expansion that was vetoed by
Obama that vogue in didn't veto and in
any discussion of settlement expansion
well meanwhile other events were
occurring the first intifada took place
something had to be done the u.s.
initiated the Madrid negotiations they
got nowhere the palace to the head of
the Palestinian delegation hydro shafi
abdul raffi insisted that any agreement
must end growth of settlements so it
broke down meanwhile the tunas Arabs
Yasser Arafat made an end run around the
local Palestinians that's the Oslo
agreements they reach an agreement with
Israel which said nothing about
settlement expansion of the shafi in
fact refused to even attend the
celebratory meeting settlements
continued without a break the intentions
became increasingly obvious by now
they're not in doubt the they do go back
to the 60s but now it's very explicit
Israel will take everything within the
separation wall basically an annexation
wall it will take the Jordan Valley
Palestinians are being expelled military
zones are being established to prevent
Palestinian settlement meanwhile Israeli
settlements continue wells are being dug
all over and so on there are corridors
cutting through what remains leaving
unviable Canton's or the goal is to take
probably close to a half of the West
Bank area what's called area see where
the Palestinian Authority has no
independent
ours is sixty percent of the West Bank
about a third of it is closed military
zones forty percent of settlements are
on private land it's essentially being
taken over Oslo will be the Gaza will be
kept as a prison separated from the West
Bank that's actually been us Israeli
policy since the Oslo agreements which
declared the two to be an inseparable
territorial unity and Israel will keep
the Syrian Golan Heights those are the
policies now being implemented a couple
of days ago the United States warned the
European Union not to support the
Palestinians at the UN urging again that
the only passes passes negotiations now
the kind of official line and the West
is that the Palestinians are insisting
on preconditions the opposite is true
the United States and Israel are
insisting on crucial preconditions one
is that the negotiations be under US
auspices which means that the two legs
of the triangle will be in parallel and
also that settlements will continue to
it to expand either openly or by
deception as during the 10-month
settlement freeze well that's roughly
where we are now they just say a couple
of words about the prospects and the
options one option is well known
international consensus roughly along
the lines of the 1976 vetoed Security
Council resolution that's supported by
essentially everybody apart from the two
rejectionist states the US and Israel
that could lay the basis for moving on
to closer integration Federation
bi-national state eroding the imperial
borders which there's no reason to
worship for what it's worth these
longer-term goals are pretty much what
i've personally advocated for 70 years
often writing about it an alternative is
commonly suggested now namely give the
keys to israel
one state civil rights struggle
anti-apartheid struggle that second
alternative overlooks a crucial fact
there's the slightest reason to expect
Israel to accept the keys the reason is
that there's a third option namely the
one that the US and Israel are now
pursuing as already described in that
case there is no so-called demographic
problem the very few Palestinians in the
areas that Israel take over no civil
rights struggle there are many analogies
to South Africa mostly irrelevant in my
opinion it's true that the sometimes the
scattered Canton's are called band of
stands actually a real Sauron even used
that but that's misleading to the South
Africa had reason to sustain the band
who stands that was their labor supply
tried to develop them try to gain
international recognition didn't gain
any apart from Israel but Israel has
absolutely no interest in the Canton's
it just it's pretty much like what they
unsaid let them leave number so far
booty a couple days ago pointed out
accurately that it's far worse than
South African apartheid essentially for
these reasons there is actually one
analogy with South Africa that's highly
relevant in 1958 the we know from
internal documents that yes we know from
internal documents that in 1958 the
nationalist regime in South Africa
recognized that they're becoming
international pariahs the foreign
minister called in the American
ambassador and spoke to him he said we
know that everyone's voting against us
in the United Nations were becoming
pariahs but it really doesn't matter
there's only you and I both know that
there's only one vote in the United
Nations that's yours as long as you
support us doesn't matter what else
happened and that's pretty much the way
it worked out under Reagan in the ninth
ATS in the framework of his war on
terror the African National Congress was
declared to be one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world Mandela
was on the terrorist list that was 1988
in fact Mandela was removed from the
terrorist list just about two years ago
by 1990 however US policy had shifted
also Cuba had driven the South Africans
out of illegally occupied Namibia and
when these events happened including the
shift in US policy apartheid shortly
ended that's a major victory for justice
even though only partial as the recent
minor strike in the brutal state
reaction vividly illustrates that's not
the only such case there are others it's
conceivable that US policy might shift
for example the United States might
accept the proposals of the major human
rights group groups like Amnesty
International which called for an arms
embargo and Israel or Human Rights Watch
which called for an end to any US aid to
Israel that either is involved in any
way with these settlements and the
occupied territories or with
discrimination within Israel Systrom
demand coming from a central
organization there's plenty of popular
support for that even in the United
States and it could expand it could lead
to a change of policy and if that
doesn't happen I think the prospects
look pretty grim I
I have a piece to tell you that Cindy
and gray Corey just arrived during the
interview of Nam Chomsky and maybe we
can welcome to you such a respected and
beloved person in the world community
was able to come to us via Skype Noam
Chomsky who is not feeling particularly
well but who made this effort because
all of his life actually he's made the
effort to understand what has been
really going on in the world instead of
leaving it to the media and other places
so we thank him deeply and we wish him
the best of help Roger do you have
something to say i would say here here
and i was happy to hear his voice coming
out of the darkness and acknowledging
acknowledging amnesty and Human Rights
Watch as there's a possible elements in
a way out of this unholy mess that we
all find ourselves in I thought it was
extremely dramatic the way he stopped
after having said that's one week and we
can go and if we don't go that way
so so I so I to thank him from her from
afar from being part of this this
afternoon it's very moving but also very
chilling
