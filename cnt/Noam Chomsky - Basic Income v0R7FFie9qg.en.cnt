Germany there's a lot of grassroots
organizations taking place around the
concept of a basic income guarantee
whereby citizens receive an
unconditional sum of money to cover the
basic cost such as rent food and
electricity etc could you provide your
assessment on this concept of basic
income guarantee actually that's an
interesting concept it comes from the
right-wing originally built in freedom
proposed it for example in his point of
view it was part of an effort to
undermine welfare state measures but it
doesn't have to have a reactionary
component it can be interpreted as
something aggressive the people their
people have rights in fact if you read
the Universal Declaration of the Human
Rights 1948 take a look at article 25 it
says people have rights to adequate food
nutrition health employment security and
so on those are the minimal rights any
society ought to guarantee that well one
way to guarantee it would be through a
socially acceptable form of basic income
in fact to an extent that's what welfare
so-called welfare states try to provide
in a certain way so sure that's
something that could be proposed I mean
I don't think it goes far enough but
that's a short-term way of alleviating
major problems that's fine and there are
elements in various societies that do
provide things like that
