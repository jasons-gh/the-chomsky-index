hi
secrets of the state here on democracy
now democracynow.org the war and peace
report I'm Amy Goodman our guest is noam
chomsky world-renowned dissident author
of more than 100 books speaking to us
from Boston known you wrote a piece
after the midterm elections called
outrage misguided I want to read for you
now what Sarah Palin tweeted the former
Alaska governor of course Republican
vice presidential nominee this is what
she tweeted about WikiLeaks she rather
she put it on Facebook she said first
and foremost what steps were taken to
stop WikiLeaks director Julian Assange
from distributing this highly sensitive
classified material especially after
he'd already published material not once
but twice in the previous months Assange
is not a journalist any more than the
editor of al-qaeda's new english
language magazine inspire as a
journalist he's an anti-american
operative with blood on his hands his
past posting of classified documents
revealed the identity of more than a
hundred afghan sources to the taliban
why was he not pursued with the same
urgency we pursue al-qaeda and taliban
leaders Noam Chomsky your response
that's pretty much what i would expect
sarah palin to say i don't know how much
he understands but i think we should pay
attention to what we learn from the from
the leaks what we learn for example is
kinds of things I've said the most
perhaps the most dramatic revelation is
the every mentioned the bitter hatred of
democracy that is revealed both by the
US government Hillary Clinton others and
also by the Diplomatic Service to tell
the world to tell them to talk to each
other to pretend to each other that the
Arab world is regards Iran as the major
threat and once the u.s. to bomb Iran is
extremely revealing when they know that
approximately eighty percent of our of
opinion regards the US and Israel is the
major threat ten percent regard to brown
is the major threat and a majority 57% I
think the region will be better off with
Iranian nuclear weapons as a kind of
deterrent that doesn't even enter all
that enters is what they claim has been
said by our dictators brutal Arab
dictators that's what counts with a how
representative this is of what they say
we don't know because we don't know what
the filtering is but that's a minor
point the major point is that the
population is irrelevant all that
matters is the opinions of the dictators
that we support and if they were to back
us that's the Arab world that's a very
revealing picture of the mentality of us
political leadership and presumably
elite opinion judging by the commentary
that's appeared here that's the way it's
been presented in the press as well and
your piece matter what the Arabs believe
your piece outrage misguided back to the
midterm elections and what we're going
to see now can you talk about the Tea
Party movement well the Tea Party
movement itself is maybe fifteen twenty
percent of the electorate it's
relatively affluent white nativist you
know it does trigger the traditional
nativists tricks to it but what is much
more important I think is the is its
outreach I mean over half the population
says they more or less supported or
support its message and what people are
thinking is extremely interesting I mean
the overwhelmingly polls revealed that
people are extremely bitter angry
hostile opposed to everything the
primary cause undoubtedly is the
economic disaster that's so it's not
just the financial catastrophe it's an
economic disaster I mean manufacturing
industry for example
unemployment levels are at the level of
the Great Depression and unlike the
Great Depression those jobs are not
coming back us owners and managers have
long ago made the decision that they can
make more profit with complicated
financial deals than by production so
finance this goes back to the 70s mainly
Reagan escalated in onward Clinton to
the economy has been financialized
financial institutions have grown
enormously in their share of corporate
profits it may be something like a third
or something like that today at the same
time correspondingly production has been
exported so you buy a some electronic
device from China China is an assembly
plant for a Northeast Asian a production
center the parts and components come
from the more advanced countries and
from the United States and the
technology so yes that's a cheap place
to assemble things sell them back here
and m's rather similar in Mexico Vietnam
Vietnam and so on that's the way to make
profits it destroys the society here but
that's not the concern of the the
ownership class and the managerial class
their concern is profit that's what
drives the economy and the rest of it is
a fallout people are extremely bitter
about it but don't seem to understand it
so the same people who are majority who
say that the wall street is to blame for
the current crisis our voting Republican
the both parties are deep in the pockets
of Wall Street but the Republicans are
much more so than the Democrats and the
same is through an issue after issue so
people that the antagonism to everyone
is extremely high actually antagonism
they don't like popular
doesn't like Democrats but they hate
republicans even more they're against
big business they're against government
we only have 30 seconds science no we
only have 30 seconds I wanted to ask if
you were President Obama's top advisor
what would you tell him to do right now
I would tell him to do what FDR did when
big business was opposed to him or
helped organize stimulate public
opposition and put through a serious
populist program which can be done
stimulate the economy don't give away
everything to fin its ears push through
a real health reform the health reform
of those push through maybe a slight
improvement but it leaves the major
problem untouched if you're worried
about the deficit pay attention to the
fact that it's almost all attributable
to the military spending and we're going
to leave it there but we'll continue the
conversation after I'm posted online at
democracynow.org I'm Amy Goodman thanks
so much for joining us
