the war and peace report
I'm Amy Goodman as we continue our
conversation with the world-renowned
professor linguist and dissident Noam
Chomsky Democracy Now is nermeen Shaikh
and I recently spoke to him and asked
him to talk about the twin threats of
climate change in nuclear war we spoke
in the wake of a new report by nature
magazine that the world has massively
underestimated the amount of heat
absorbed by our oceans and president
Trump's decision to pull the United
States out of the intermediate-range
nuclear forces treaty known as the INF
professor Chomsky began by talking about
the significance of this landmark
nuclear arms pact with Russia
well the INF treaty was a very important
development you may recall that in that
period in the early and mid eighties the
short this has to do with short-range
nuclear missiles they were being
installed in Western Europe pursing two
missiles in Western Europe which had a
few minutes flight time to Moscow if you
think what that means the Russian
detection systems are first of all far
more primitive than ours but even
sophisticated if they had had
sophisticated detection systems it would
have given them barely a few minutes
warning before a possible heavy nuclear
strike even a decapitation strike
against against Moscow and the Russians
were doing the same they were building
short-term missiles aimed at your
Western Europe notice the knot at the
United States this was internal to
Europe short term for short-range
missiles well the 1987 INF treaty and
and that extreme peril sharply reduced
that the missiles were reduced and so an
important step forward
breaking the treaty reinstates that
system now there's an obvious way to
deal with the problem namely it's called
it's kind of a bad word maybe able to
spell it
it's called diplomacy there have been
the way to deal with the problem is
quite straightforward do what has not
been done as yet have technical experts
from both sides and neutral ones
investigate the claims that are being
made by both sides and determine if
they're valid and to the extent that
there are negotiate a way to overcome
these violations of the treaty and then
enforce the treaty even further carry it
further we should be a limb moving
towards eliminating nuclear weapons
remember that the New START treaty is
coming up for renewal that's a very
important one start has led to the sharp
reduction of nuclear weapons
[Music]
by no means anywhere near far enough but
nevertheless quite significant the we
should also recall that Trump's pulling
out of the INF treaty has a precursor
namely the Nuclear Posture review of the
Trump administration which already
called for developing new weapons
[Music]
tactical tactical nuclear weapons which
themselves greatly increased the threat
of possible war a target of these
missiles can't know whether they're
conventional or nuclear or whether
they're short-range or or much more
powerful missiles you have a few minutes
swarming time to make these decisions
you look over the history of the nuclear
age and it is practically miraculous
that we've survived this
for there's been case after case where
we came the very both side
came very close to making a decision
to launch nuclear weapons which means
basically a terminating human
civilization and miracles like that can
go on forever and enhancing the threat
is just beyond insanity ending the INF
treaty not only opens the door for the
United States and Russia to develop more
dangerous lethal weapons but of course
for others to join it as well
greatly increasing the hazard to all of
us and there are diplomatic options that
have not been pursued and they are the
ones that they are the ones that should
be uppermost not vastly endangering
ourselves and everyone else Trump also
brought up the fact that China's not a
partner to the INF yeah they're not well
the waited it's because of their
particular geostrategic position and
their defensive posture and in the
Western Eurasia Eastern Eurasia Eastern
Eurasia the so the way to deal with that
problem is to bring them into the treaty
not to break the treaty and greatly
increase the danger to the world we
should bear in mind that the Bulletin of
Atomic Scientists which has established
since 1947 beginning of the nuclear age
it's established a Doomsday Clock where
the minute hand is a certain distance
from midnight midnight means goodbye
termination of all of us at the
beginning 1947 it was 7 minutes to
midnight
it's oscillated up and back since in
last January after a year of the Trump
administration it moved to two minutes
to midnight that's the closest it's been
two terminal disaster ever with one
exception 1953 the United States then
the Soviet Union exploded thermonuclear
weapons demonstrating that in our
ingenuity we had devised the means to
destroy everything at that point the
clock did move to two minutes to
midnight hasn't gone that close to
disaster since but it did last January
and now it's worse the Nuclear Posture
review the revelation since that time
that the u.s. actually has developed the
first strike potential which could
prevent could eliminate any deterrent
through a first strike then Trump's
Nuclear Posture review which calls for
extending the nuclear threat and now
this latest step this is a march to
disaster which is only paralleled by the
moves of the administration to race
towards the cliff of environmental
destruction with eyes open they know
exactly what they're doing
Trump himself is a firm believer in
global warming the others as well but
just in order to fill a couple of pocket
overstuffed pockets with more dollars
they're willing to to threaten of the
existence of ordinary of organized human
life
