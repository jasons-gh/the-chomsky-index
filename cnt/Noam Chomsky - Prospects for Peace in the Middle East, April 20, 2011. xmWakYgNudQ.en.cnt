you
thanks David the most dramatic events in
the region in fact in the world and this
year have been what's been called the
Arab Spring the uprising democracy
uprisings all over the Arab world in
North Africa now they didn't come from
nowhere the tech Egypt the most
important country in the region the
movement as you probably know was led by
a initiated by a group of kind of
tech-savvy fairly young people who call
themselves the April sixth movement why
April sixth the reason is because on
april six two thousand eight the
egyptian labor movement which has been
very active in militant for many years
had organized we're planning major
strike actions at the the most important
industrial installation in egypt along
with solidarity actions elsewhere it was
crushed by the dictatorship the
us-backed dictatorship so it's not known
here but they didn't forget it in Egypt
that's normal so that's the April sixth
movement the young people named
themselves after that the movement
really the current uprising gained
significant force when the Egyptian
labor movement joined into it and that
continues just a couple of weeks ago
there was a major strike at a instantly
an industrial insulation in the Delta
north of Cairo she been no comb which
had a repetition of earlier actions
before the earlier ones had been crushed
this one was successful in raising very
low wages and slightly improving
working conditions of the kind that
prevail under the us-backed dictatorship
of course not only in Egypt all over the
world and the same is true elsewhere
take a look at each of these uprisings
you find the have plenty of they have
deep roots there are two countries in
the region in the general region a two
countries that are under long and harsh
military occupation including transfer
of populations from the invading country
in violation of international law and
violation of security council orders and
other crimes actually this wave of
uprisings began in one of them in
November in western sahara the Western
Sahara was invaded by it's the last
African colony it's under the
jurisdiction of the United Nations
supposed to undergo decolonization but
in 1975 it was invaded by Morocco
Morocco has instituted a military rule
that's sent in large numbers of
Moroccans to try to flood the area so
they can claim to take it over there was
a there have been many protests by the
sorrow is the native population and last
November they did set up a tent city in
the capital de nonviolent protest which
was crushed by Moroccan troops this was
brought to the Security Council that's
under their jurisdiction they want to
call an inquiry but France which is the
protector of Western African dictators
including Tunisian France intervened and
blocked the inquiry well that's one of
the two countries the other one is
Palestine remains under firm grip return
to that at the end the
for the west the democracy uprisings are
fraught with danger for for good reasons
and they're good reasons why the Western
powers the US and its allies will do
whatever they can to try to constrain
and reverse them to find out the reasons
it's efficient to take a look at the
poles of of the region there are good
careful polls taken by the leading
Western polling agencies released by
prestigious institutions Brookings and
others they're not reported they're much
too important to be reported but
planners certainly know them and if you
take a look at the polls you find out
what democracy is intolerable to the
west and this goes way back and so for
example in Egypt the most important
country ninety percent of the population
regard the major threat to them as the
United States a tiny percentage regard
Iran as a threat about ten percent
throughout the region opposition to
Western policies US policies is so
strong that in Egypt eighty percent of
the population think the region would be
better off if Iran had nuclear weapons
figures are very throughout the region
but it's roughly on that order so it's
obvious that the democracy authentic
democracy can't be tolerated democracy
in which popular opinion influences
policy and that goes way back so take
one crucial moment in 1958 President
Eisenhower discussed with his staff
secretly know Declassified he was
concerned with what he called the
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and not from the government's
there okay but from the population and
the National Security Council the major
planning agency had just released it I
memorandum about it and which they said
that explained it they say
there's a perception in the Arab world
that the United States supports harsh
brutal dictatorships and blocks
democracy and development and that we do
so because we want to maintain control
over their energy supplies and they went
on to say that the perception is more or
less accurate and furthermore that's
pretty much what we should be doing as
long as the population can be kept under
control and who cares about the what
what they think and that runs right to
the present one of the most striking
revelations from WikiLeaks was not so
much about the report but about the way
the reaction to it in the wind here you
probably remember that the leak that got
the most publicity you know made the
headlines and so on was that the Arab
states support the United States on Iran
and it quoted the Arab dictators the
Arab dictator said young like what
you're doing on Iran what about the Arab
population and their euphoric reactions
no we're in good shape all over the
press and commentary what about the Arab
population well you know they're quiet
so they're kept under control so who
cares ninety percent think we're the
worst enemy and Iran should have nuclear
weapons well Arella that's basically our
conception of democracy it's not the
only case and it it continues as long as
the population can be maintained under
control kept under control as long as
the dictators we impose are obedient
that was then it's fine the background
for all of this is also not particularly
obscure it's pretty much with the
National Security Council mentioned in
the 1950s control over the energy
resources control notice we didn't use
them in that time but it was important
to control
the world's major energy resources and
that's made clear constantly in fact it
was made very clear just a couple of
weeks ago and another interesting event
which wasn't reported there's a an
International Tribunal at The Hague in
the Netherlands this was the tribunal on
those atrocities in Sierra Leone on the
prosecution rested its case a couple of
weeks ago the prosecution was not
satisfied with the case the chief
prosecutor a US law professor informed
the London Times that they wanted to try
Colonel Qaddafi they claimed that
prosecution had evidence that he was the
primary funder and of responsible for
the training and their words he and his
colleague British colleague and they're
worth he was responsible for the death
of over million people but Britain in
the United States intervened to prevent
their friends Gaddafi from being tried
at the tribunal this is not ancient
history I'm talking about a few weeks
ago the which is highly relevant today
the prosecutor was asked why did they
intervene and his answer was quite
simple welcome to the world of oil
that's correct that's the phrase that
you should keep in mind when you want to
think about this region and from these
simple considerations you can pretty
well anticipate what the reaction of the
US and its allies is going to be where
there's a oil-rich country and the
dictator is reliable and obedient he's
given free rein the most important of
course is Saudi Arabia most repressive
regime in the region
main ally as most of the oil there they
there was as in other countries of the
region there was a effort to have a
friday protest the security forces were
so intimidating that people were refused
to even were unwilling even to appear on
the streets so that wasn't even crushed
couldn't even start same is true in
quite other major oil producer
interesting important cases behind there
the again the there were nonviolent
protests brutally crushed a saudi-led
military force invaded too and provide
the muscle so that the domestic security
forces could crush the protests they
invaded the major medical complex the
soma Nia medical complex patients thrown
out to disappear somewhere doctors to
all of this is fine little tap on the
wrist no and then a human rights
activists are being arrested and
tortured the most serious protest and
Bahrain is important not for oil but
because for one thing it hosts the u.s.
Fifth Fleet major military force and
whole area but more important than that
Bahrain is the dictatorship is Sunni and
the population majority to populations
Shiite and it's right across the
causeway from Saudi Arabia eastern Saudi
Arabia which is largely Shiite
dictatorship is Sunni and that happens
to be where most of Saudi oil is by some
accident of history and geography the
concentration of the world's energy is
in the northern Gulf region which
happens to be largely Shiite
eastern Saudi Arabia southern Iraq and
those sectors of Iran nearby and there
has been considerable concern in the
West for a long time that some kind of
tacit alliance might form in the Shiite
areas which would move towards a degree
of Independence and would control the
bulk of the world's oil that would be a
very serious development the so crushing
the rebet the uprising democracy
uprising Bahrain is of significance far
beyond the significance of Bahrain
itself this concern about huge Shiite
Sunni confrontation is largely the
result of the american invasion of iraq
i'm there there had been down tensions
going way back but they were never very
serious there was a lot of intermarriage
communities were intermingled in all
sorts of ways but one consequence of the
invasion of iraq was to set off a very
harsh and bitter sunni-shiite conflict
which spread to the whole region Lebanon
beyond so now it's a major confrontation
that's why Bahrain is treated in the
Sunni Arab world as a confrontation
between Saudi Arabia and Iran you know
the sort of leading figures of these two
sides that's one of the coffee like
collateral damage the side effects of
the invasion of Iraq which is poisoning
the region and can have is already
having major consequences and could be
much worse there had been and remains
another severe confrontation in the
region this is not sunni-shiite but
rather Sunni dictatorships which is the
majority of the region versus secular
nationalism that's been a serious issue
for a long time the United States and
Britain the
main imperial powers have consistently
supported radical Islamic fundamentalism
including the crucially Saudi Arabia
which is the both the ideological center
of radical Islam it's the place where
the funding is for the spread of
madrasas that teach the Quran and jihad
and so on and Saudi Arabia is also the
major funder of jihadism but it's also
the main US ally and it's been the main
British ally for a long time and the
reason is it's regarded as a barrier
against secular nationalism which could
become independent and that's the real
problem not just in that region but
anywhere independence is what can't be
tolerated and independence has been
associated with secular nationalism in
the region actually the tight relation
between Israel and the United States was
really established in 1967 when Israel
performed the major service to the
United States there had been at the time
there was at the time a war going on
between Saudi Arabia and Egypt Nasser's
Egypt that was the center of secular
nationalism in the region Saudi Arabia
is the leading center of radical Islamic
fundamentalism and Israel did destroy
pretty much destroyed secular Arab
nationalism which was considered a great
gift to the United States defending the
radical Islamic fundamentalist aunty
nationalist centers and that established
the strategic relationship which in fact
still exists in the case of Yemen it's
business which is very brutal also
hundreds of people killed and so on
there the issues not oil but the Yemen
is a US ally us is carrying out military
operations there and so on and also a
suti ally so therefore there
to kill as many people as they liked in
the case of Egypt where there's no major
oil issue though it's the major country
in the region in the case of Egypt and
also Tunisia of the United States
followed a very traditional game plan
over and over again it's happened many
times there comes a point when it
becomes difficult to sustain your
favored dictator so there's a procedure
the procedure is support the dictator as
long as possible if he can't be
sustained any longer maybe the army
turns against him or business classes or
whatever then send them off to pasture
somewhere issue ringing declarations
about your love of democracy and
commitment to freedom and so on and then
try to restore the old regime that may
be under different names happens over
and over you have to really be blind not
to see it Marcos and the Philippines
Duvalier in Haiti somoza and Nicaragua
that China and South Korea Suharto and
Indonesia over to in the Congo you just
list them all Ceausescu and Romania
favorite dictator in the Eastern zone so
it happens over and over and that's
essentially what the United States is
doing right now in Egypt and also
Tunisia France primarily in Tunisia
there's a lot that's been achieved but
the regimes are still in place in Egypt
the country still run by the military as
it has been for 50 years the high
military command is very deeply embedded
in the economy and the dominant they'll
eat repressive system they're not going
to give it up easily and they are
heavily harmed by the United States
trained by the US close connections to
US military and so on we'll be back what
the outcome will be is uncertain
protests are continuing their have been
substantial gains presses free for the
first time the labor movement as I
mentioned is now able to organize much
more freely
there will be some sort of elections but
the conflict is still continuing like in
other situations where a dictator had to
be sort of shelved and you have to
reconstruct the regime well there is
another category that's the one in the
headlines what happens when you have an
oil-rich country with a dictator who's
not reliable Libya in other words there
have been plenty of support plenty of
Western support for Libya I mentioned
one example right up to the present
Britain and the u.s. preventing Qaddafi
from prosecution for crimes in Sierra
Leone that's not the only case in
Cambridge Massachusetts my hometown they
the Harvard Business School has a as an
offshoot of the business school which
has projects called the monitor project
a business project which has been
providing public relations and others
other assistance to Qaddafi one of the
things they did was help his sons a fake
PhD dissertation at the London School of
Economics was the kind of a scandal
there when the West turned against
Gaddafi the director Harold Evans had
resigned other scandals they were also
producing they were also bringing a
Western academics leading Western
academics to Harvard professors and
others to Libya to sit with Qaddafi in
his tent and listen to his death you
know disquisitions on democracy in the
human rights and so on and to help him
improve his rhetoric they luckily for
them it didn't happen then the tide turn
before they could do it they were
planning they had presented in fact a
monograph for him strolling his wisdom
and brilliance which he was to release
well that's the kind of this plenty more
like it this is both in the United
States and in didn't Britain but he's
not reliable these are kind of a loose
cannon so would be better to have him
replaced if possible this issue came to
a head when Qadhafi's forces were
reaching Benghazi and Obama's main
Middle East advisor Dennis Ross warned
that if Qadhafi's forces entered
Benghazi and carried out a massacre
which was not unlikely it would be
blamed on us on the United States and it
wouldn't look good so we better do
something about it so therefore the at
that point the US did join with Britain
and France in backing a UN Security
Council resolution 1763 which is called
a no-fly supposed to employ impose a
no-fly zone well the triumvirate the US
Britain and France notice the three
Imperial traditional imperial powers the
Imperial triumvirate immediately were
they really the only ones involved
except marginally others they
immediately went beyond 1763 if you've
been reading the press you've been
seeing it so a ceasefire was imposed on
Qadhafi's forces but not on the rebel
forces so when rebel forces advanced to
the west towards the major cities in
central Central Libya they were supposed
there was no ceasefire imposed in fact
they were supported the bombing was
supporting them so in other words was in
fact happening is that the Western
powers are participating in a limited
way in the rebellion maybe they should
be maybe they shouldn't be that's a
separate question but that's their
interpretation of 1763 and it's worth
noting that the triumvirate is quite
isolated on this
it's an African country the African
Union is opposed they want to cease fire
in negotiations the Arab states have
given very tepid support they're all
very heavily armed but they're not
participating Qatar sent a couple of
reconnaissance planes but that's
symbolic and they've also objected to
the interpretation of 1763 the major
regional power Turkey has just been
standing back I'm they alone there again
NATO power huge military they could have
imposed and who flies on themselves if
they wanted but they've refused to
participate at all the that was just a
conference in China of what are called
the BRICS Brazil Russia India China and
South Africa the emerging economies it's
a couple of days ago they issued a joint
Dec final declaration meeting in China
Sonia declaration opposing Western air
strikes in Libya and calling for a
peaceful solution they said we share the
principle that the use of force should
be avoided well again you can agree or
disagree but that's a huge segment of
world opinion fact the large majority of
the population so in fact if you look
across the world the triumvirate
whatever you think of their actions is
isolated almost nobody's supporting the
imperial crown for the US has been kind
of reluctant about the whole thing it's
now backed off the most influential
cabinet member Secretary of Defense
gates has been opposed from the
beginning he pointed out that no-fly
zone can't do anything you're going to
have to send arms to the rebels they're
an untrained force I mean like if
somebody gave me a Kalashnikov we know
what to do with it
Robin rocket-propelled launcher or
whatever they're cool so they're going
to have to be trained and if you send in
trainers that their military forces or
contractors mercenaries you have to send
in combat troops to protect them and
pretty soon it's often running so we for
that reason he was opposed Obama's
backed off the Britton in the united
states are unenthusiastic they've been
on proposed sending arms then backed off
presumably for similar reasons the
preponderance of power in the world was
made very clear in this operation it was
led by france and britain but they
couldn't carry it off when they needed
muscle they had to turn to the united
states so in the early part and they're
heavily armed you know military powers
with of course a huge imperial history
but they had to call on the united
states to do the heavy lifting so in the
early days of the intervention was
almost all US Tomahawk missiles you know
attack fighters and so on when the u.s.
backs off the mission declines the arab
press from the beginning has been the
london-based arab let press not in the
region has been predicting that it's
going to end up in a stalemate with a
partition an east-west partition and the
crucial question will be what happens to
the oil fields if you take a look at the
map you'll see that the area of the
fighting the area where the stalemate is
I to be briga on those places that's
right about in the fault line that's
right pretty much where the oil known
oil fields are located and whoever gets
control of those in
an eventual partition will essentially
be the rich part of the country also
it's worth bearing in mind that most of
libya vast territories unexplored and
oil experts suspect that there must be
plenty of oil there also Libyan oil have
a very valuable it's very easily refined
and so on well anyway that's where the
situation stands in Libya now there is a
size I mentioned a second country that's
under military occupation long military
occupation that's Palestine the Arab
League a called for a no-fly zone over
over Gaza I don't even know if that get
reported here but certainly no talk of
implementing it because it doesn't serve
us purposes so therefore it's irrelevant
what popular opinion for Israel like
other western states Arab democracy
could would be quite a dangerous
development partly for the reasons I
mentioned and partly beyond so a
democratic government in Egypt is not
too likely to maintain the position of
the support for Israeli actions that the
dictatorship has supported that means
first of all the occupation and the
expanding occupation and the pretty
horrifying siege of Gaza but also other
actions like since the Israel Egypt a
peace treaty was signed in 1979 Israel's
invaded its northern neighbor 11 and 4
times again brutal attacks all supported
by the US in fact us participates
otherwise they couldn't carry him out
and that's expedited by the fact that
the major Arab deterrent Egypt has
pulled out of the region pulled out of
the conflict and Israel of course
understood that right away in 1979 read
Israeli strategic analysts that
they said with Egypt removed we can
concentrate on actions elsewhere taking
over the occupied territories attacking
northern neighbor and so on a democratic
government might not go along with that
Israel also is facing several crises a
two in particular to read the Israeli
press you know that they're deeply
concerned about what they call d
legitimation and they have a right to be
concerned they're becoming an
international pariah state the Human
Rights Watch which is pretty
conservative organization that came out
with an appeal recently to the United
States quoted to suspend financing to
Israel in an amount equivalent to the
costs of Israel spending in support of
settlements and also to monitor
contributions to Israel from tax-exempt
US corporations organizations that
violate international law including
prohibitions against discrimination that
cuts a pretty broad wast casts a pretty
wide net would eliminate most of the
private funding organizations Amnesty
International had earlier that called
for an arms embargo in the middle of the
Gaza war arguing that the arms were
being used in violation of international
law and they could have added but didn't
that the arms almost all from the US are
a violation of US law which specifically
requires that arms any arms transferred
to a country be used solely for
self-defense or for maintaining internal
order which certainly was not the case
here well those are significant dangers
they're also large the Human Rights
Watch also called on Europe main trading
partner to boycott goods from the
settlements or permits stop any activity
that any contact with
organisations and businesses whatever an
Israel that are involved in any way in
the occupation that the occupation is
illegal has never been in question not
the occupation but activities undertaken
to in to maintain the occupation in
particular any transfer of populations
any settlements are in violation of the
most basic principles of international
humanitarian law that was recognized
right away in 1967 in fact Israel itself
recognized it and it's been reiterated
by the Security Council by the
international by the International Court
of Justice it's not arguable so yes
there were everything is illegal and any
participation in any of those activities
is illegal and Israel's concerned about
it because there is a popular movement
growing which supports this point of
view and is even reaching organizations
like Human Rights Watch so that's the
deal ajuta mation getting worse in a
moment but i'll just mention that
there's also a problem of legitimation
there that concerns them namely
legitimation of the Palestinian
Authority and their rights and that's a
problem too it's going to come up very
sharply in a couple of months at the
coming un session in September when
looks as though the Palestinians will
put forward press forward a an effort at
the General Assembly and the Security
Council to be admitted into the United
Nations as a state they're already
supported by probably eighty or ninety
percent of the the government's that
represent about eighty ninety percent of
the world's population including
important ones like Brazil
there's and the only thing blocking it
really is the United States possible the
United States will be driven to another
of its long series of vetoes to protect
Israeli crimes the most recent was
februari when Security Council
resolution was vetoed by the United
States called for implementing official
US policy that's why it was a little
unusual official US policy is that the
settlements shouldn't be expanded that
was the content basic content of the
resolution which the Obama
administration vetoed it also declared
the settlements to be illegal but that
as I said hasn't been in question for 45
years the and there may be another one
coming up this this September and this
is another case where the u.s. happens
to be extremely isolated and it's not
the only one finish with one of the most
important ones I mentioned before that
the Arab world overwhelmingly supports
even not only supports Iran's nuclear
programs but even thinks they ought to
develop nuclear weapons which goes way
beyond on Egypt 80% the core US policy
program at the moment what's regarded as
the leading foreign policy issue is the
Iranian threat this is called the yearly
ran and foreign policy journals and so
on are full of commentary on the
terrible Iranian threat well on this
issue to the US happens to be very
isolated in the region certainly the
again the large majority of the
population thinks sports Iran on this
issue doesn't regard Iran as a threat
and even thinks it should go beyond and
develop
their weapons turkey major power in the
region and the most respected is
improving relations with Iran us is
complaining that they're violating US
sanctions but of course US sanctions
have no authority you know no reason for
anyone to accept them except fear of
power and they are they're increasing
trade with Iran the very natural trading
partners in fact they just announced
they're going to triple trade with Iran
and they established a pipeline same is
true of Brazil which is the most
respected country in the South the third
world has been combining infected to
join turkey in an effort to settle the
enrichment issue outside the framework
of us power which led to a lot of
controverted denunciations here of the
non-aligned countries which are most of
the world for all along they've been
vigorously supporting your ends right to
develop nuclear energy as a signer of
the non-proliferation treaty but the
world is disregarded if you read
commentary here Iran is defying the
international community that which is
technically correct the phrase
international community has a technical
meaning it means Washington and whoever
happens to agree with it at the moment
that's the international community so if
like the whole world disagrees they're
not part of the international community
it's very much like the hour of public
if you know there's a campaign of hatred
against us and they think your ranch
should have nuclear weapons and it's not
it's not real because the dictator
support us and incidentally there's an
analog to that at home but that's a
different topic the in general the world
is kind of drifting out of control if
you go back to say
the early 70s when the Nixon
administration was planning to overthrow
the parliamentary government of chile
instituted dictatorship the National
Security Council warned that if the
United States can't control Latin
America it's going to have a hard time
controlling the rest of the world well
us can no longer control Latin America
in the last decade or so south america
for the first time in 500 years has
become start to become integrated move
towards independence they're out of
control you could see that again on
Obama's lost last trip to the South
America a couple of weeks ago Asia has
drifted out of control the Middle East
is now moving in that direction the
Middle East is a critically important
area that's the center of the world's
energy supplies all of this leads to
broader issues of World Order topics
actually I'll shall talk about in a
couple of hours somewhere else but no
time to go in
Thank You Mitch okay we'll have a
question and answer and so folks who
want to ask a question please line up
and again please remember keep them a
short question even if you disagree with
what he said ask a question respectfully
for him to reply to that so I guess
we'll start over here and then professor
Chomsky will go back and forth picking
folks professor Chomsky in a few weeks
there'll be another Freedom Flotilla
challenging Israeli siege of the Gaza
Strip can you comment on how you think
that might progress or what the
implications might be well like
everything else in the region it it
depends on what how the US reacts the
last you were on one of the ones that
went but managed to get through most of
them haven't gotten through they've been
stopped by the Israeli Navy actually one
was blown up in Cyprus Harbor a long
time ago but the most recent one was
last May that's the mavi marmara a
Turkish based ship was part of the
flotilla and Israeli commandos landed on
it in international waters that's piracy
hijacking the killed nine crew members
including an American citizen was a huge
protest over the world but support in
the United States so Congress passed
resolution saying was fine and you know
if the boss agrees nothing much is going
to happen doesn't matter what the world
thinks in Israel itself Israel has moved
very far to the right the jingoist right
probably ninety five percent of the
population in Israel regards the attack
on the ship the mavi marmara as
a defensive you know that the commandos
were attacked by the passengers and so
on and if that position is also taken in
the United States Israel will be
emboldened to do the same thing this
time or something similar but notice
that there would be no problem if they
wanted to stop the ships non-violently I
mean you know a big expert to realize
that you know the Navy could disable the
rudder and tow the ship to port they
have no right to do that you don't have
a right to carry out piracy
international borders unless you're
supported by the master of the world if
the u.s. authorized that you have a
right to do anything you like but just
as the u.s. itself does but otherwise
not like Somali Somali pirates aren't
allowed to do it but they may given the
mood in the country and the estimate of
the u.s. reaction they might again stop
it in a violent fashion as they have in
the past that depends pretty much on us
these are matters that we can control
those aren't these are not things
happening on Mars it depends very much
on what the US population is willing to
tolerate and support
hi first I want to say thank you and my
question may be sort of goes along with
that regarding what's happening on in
Egypt as well as the murders of settlers
activists giuliano and Vittorio
Oregonian as during a time that Hamas
and Fatah are trying to hold unity talks
what do you think the next move moves
are for Israel and where do you think
they're going what should they do or
what will they do what will they do I
mean there is sort of a ramping up in
Gaza with the operation scorching summer
well what they will do is exactly what
they are doing and will continue to do
as long as the u.s. supports it we
should bear in mind that the framework
of discussion of this topic in the
United States is completely skewed so
like you read the newspapers they tell
you there there's a peace process in
which the u.s. is an honest broker
trying to bring together two
recalcitrant opponents the truth of the
matter is totally different if there
were serious negotiations going on
they'd be run by some neutral party and
on one side would be the US and Israel
and on the other side would be the
entire world because on this issue the
u.s. is totally isolated literally so as
long as the US continues to support
Israeli policies they all continue to
carry them out they'll go as far as the
US will accept and as far as the UN it's
not just acceptance its participation
every Israeli crime is an American crime
they can only go so far as us
participation permits that includes
military support diplomatic support
economic support and in fact ideological
support like framing the issues so yeah
if we if we can't if US government
continues to support them meaning the US
population allows that then Israel will
continue it's a siege of Gaza which is
an act of war Israel first no question
about that and it's a continued
expansion into the West Bank which is
essentially taking over roughly fifty
percent of it and leaving the rest and
isolated Canton so that's what they will
do what should they do well that
assuming that the suppose the u.s.
changes its policy and the u.s. joins
the world okay you know not not totally
utopian notion but maybe far out but not
inconceivable if the US were to join the
world Israel would have to do what the
master says and it would accept a
two-state settlement of the basics terms
of a settlement of this has been known
for 35 years I mean you can argue about
details but they were stated in a
Security Council resolution in January
1976 have brought by the Arab states
major Arab states which called for to
state settlement on the internationally
recognized borders and then they brought
in the wording of you n 2 42 which
everyone accepts as the major diplomatic
document that called for recognition of
the right of every state in the region
to exist in peace of security with
insecurity recognized boundaries on the
international border that's supported by
essentially the entire world Arab League
Iran
everyone supports it but except the US
the u.s. vetoed it in 1976 and I won't
go through the rest of the record but it
stays about the same but if the US were
to join the world Israel could move to
join the world as well except through
state settlement that would improve its
security security has never been the
issue they would Israel has been for us
when I say Israel I mean the US and
Israel because they work in tandem have
been since the early 90s following a
very definite policy of trying to
separate Gaza from the West Bank that's
inviolate explicit violation of the oslo
accords which they had just signed which
call them a territorial unity so they
would then reverse that and allow the
two parts of palestine to reunite and be
connected somehow not hard to figure out
how they would end the siege of gaza and
accept the truth which would very likely
end all conflict there was a truce for a
couple of months back in two thousand
eight and israel concedes that hamas
didn't fire single rocket during the
truth even though Israel didn't live up
to it it maintained the siege and then
finally broke the truth but they could
reinstate that and you know open up Gaza
to international commerce and trade and
development them you know stop crushing
it whether these are all perfectly
feasible policies but it depends on what
the US will do and I should say that
there is there's some has let me go off
and a little bit of a tangent there are
historical analogies which are worth
thinking about like it's very common to
stress you talk about the relationship
comparisons between Israel and South
Africa most of them are pretty dubious
for lots of reasons but there's one
that's accurate and very important for
Americans to understand which as I
suppose the reason why it's never
discussed but there's one that's
accurate back around nineteen sixty the
white nationalist regime in South Africa
recognized that it was becoming
international pariah and the foreign
minister called in the American
ambassador all of this is long
declassified called in the American
ambassador and told him look we're
becoming an international pariah there
we're getting voted down in the United
Nations everyone's denouncing us he said
that none of this matters because you
and I both understand that there's only
one vote at the United Nations namely
yours as long as you back us doesn't
matter what the world thinks and that
turned out to be accurate by the 1970s
the UN passed an arms embargo in 1980s
corporations were pulling out even
Congress was passing sanctions the
Reagan administration which was very
strongly pro apartheid continued to
support South Africa even violating
congressional sanctions and they had a
reason the reason was the war on terror
the African National Congress Mandela's
and see was in 1988 that late was
condemned the fish'll II as one of the
more notorious terrorist groups in the
world in fact Mandela himself was just
taken off the terrorist list two years
ago and allowed to come to the United
States you know without special
dispensation well in the context the war
on terror the u.s. continued to support
the South African regime they look
completely triumphant they could do
anything they wanted around nineteen
ninety US policy shifted and within a
couple of years apartheid collapsed
that's not the only case the world is
not ruled by law it's ruled by force we
may not like it but it's
the world is ruled by force the forces
mostly in Washington not entirely but
mostly and if the u.s. changed its
policy things can change and it depends
a lot on what happens among the
population now it's not a dictatorship
they can do what the population permits
and tolerates so it's possible that the
US would shift its policy as it did in
South Africa and there are other cases
in which case I think you can see a
steps towards a peaceful settlement
thank you very much for coming Oregon
professor Chomsky welcome a brief
follow-up on the flotilla question let
us not forget the early 60s intentional
proven intentional Israeli attack on the
USS liberty killed scores of sailors and
nothing has ever done about that either
my question now is about labor unions I
mean you've cited labor unions evidence
by inspiring the April sixth movement
and the following Arab Spring and labor
unions Annie you have generally helped
to win cradle grave health care and
mostly free education of PhDs six weeks
paid vacations generous paid maternity
leave for both parents most boards of
directors of half labor union and worker
council members on them in the EU and
here labor unions are decimated
demonized and can you ever see the day
when unions are strong enough to help
create a form of democratic socialism
here and are the pro-union uprising in
Wisconsin and elsewhere giving you hope
yeah well again I think so useful have a
I on history with regard to both the
cases you mentioned case of the u.s.
liberty is for those of you don't know
was a u.s. ship which was attacked by
Israeli forces in 1967 right the end of
the 1967 war a couple of dozens crewmen
were killed Israel essentially got
complete impunity it's not the only case
there's one other case of a country
which was so such a close and valued
Ally that they were authorized to attack
a u.s. ship and killed 35 or 36 crewmen
that Saddam Hussein Qaddafi is not the
only dictator that the US strongly
support of the US reagan administration
was supporting Saddam's so
enthusiastically that in 1987 when
saddam saddam's forces attacked a u.s.
naval vessel with Exocet missiles and
disabled it and killed i think three
doesn't crewmen they got off with just a
tap on the wrist those are things that
are worth remembering to those the
owning two cases with regard to the
labor unions again this is not the first
it's your what you said is exactly right
there's been a huge attack against the
union movement ever since the early 50s
it picked up sharply in more recent
years and the reason is very
straightforward organized labor is the
only organized force that stands in the
way of something like complete corporate
tyranny literally it's not an
exaggeration so of course there's
this is a major effort that decimated
it's not the first time in American
history it's happened repeatedly so
there was a very powerful labor movement
in the late 19th century developed
through the early 20th century it was
largely crushed by woodrow wilson these
things tend to be bought bipartisan a
Wilson's Red Scare after the second of
her First World War a crushed labor
independent thought worse purity
repression in American history the labor
movement was practically gone in fact in
one of the leading US labor historian
David Montgomery has a classic book
called the the rise and fall of American
labor something like that and the fall
that he's talking about is 1920s when it
looked as it was all done you know end
of history you know utopia the Masters
and so on period rather like this well
1930s came along labor revived became a
very significant force it drove the New
Deal measures which were social
democratic and since the 1950s there's
been a concerted effort to beat them
back in fact you can see how far it's
gone by just taking a look at Eisenhower
Eisenhower gave speeches in which is it
we are we all everyone in the countries
that of course accepts all the New Deal
measures maybe a couple of crazed oil
executives don't but anybody who tried
the question any of them would be
considered too ridiculous to discuss all
right that's the dominant thrust at the
moment and it's not the first time and
it can be beaten back again but that's
why what happened in Wisconsin was
pretty important and there is no
teachers labour union here I've heard
there's no teachers a union here is it
teachers union yeah here at specific
University of that
should be I don't know you have to ask
people here yeah I professor John scam
will seaman with KBOO community news on
the issue of why the United States
continues to support Israel to the
degree it does in recent years one
explanation that's gained some currency
is a so called Israel lobby however you
have also spoken in the past about the
strategic asset theory and I wonder if
you talk even if briefly about those two
explanations for US policy and how you
weigh the likelihood of one or another
or the influence of one or another well
under the Israel lobby is a powerful
lobby but you know no ethnic-based lobby
is strong enough to overcome the major
concentrations of us power they can as
long as the AIPAC the Israel lobby in
more or less acts within the framework
of us power they can get what they want
if they try to step beyond at their
stopped instantly and there's case after
case I mean I could run through them but
in general take a look at America the
way American politics works ethnic
lobbyist lobbies can have influenced
like the gun lobby the gun lobby is very
militant they're a minority the
population but you know there's no real
organized opposition to them so they get
what they want okay but on the other
hand there were organized opposition say
if the Chamber of Commerce came out
against them they disappear okay but and
it's pretty much the same here you take
a look at the support for Israel what's
called support for Israel that in the in
the press the most extreme support is
the Wall Street Journal The Wall Street
Journal is not part of a pack the wall
street journal is the journal of the
business community in the political
system the two parties are not very
different but somewhat different the
Republicans are you know that don't even
pretend to be anything but the business
party they're deep in the pockets of
corporate America they're the most
extreme pro-israel group
the Democrats too they're a little more
diverse but they follow along you take a
look at American there's a major lobby
which strongly supports Israel the
military lobby I'm that Dwarfs a pack
and they think Israel's great like
Lockheed Martin for instance are bowing
or any of them when the US provides arms
to Israel the money goes into their
pockets furthermore it's a double effect
because Saudi Arabia comes along and
says you know we want some of that stuff
too so you sell them 2nd grade arms
which they don't use don't how to use
and like Obama just signed a 60 billion
dollar the deal with Saudi Arabia to
pour arms into Saudi Arabia more money
into the pockets of Lockheed Martin so
they think it's great you want to run
the f-35 line that's the way you do it
if it goes beyond that take high-tech
industry so it takes a intel not far
from here there they are establishing a
new generation of chips which they think
will sweep the global market their main
facility they're building in Israel okay
it's a good place for it you know what
of high tech support the government
support trained personnel so fine
they'll support it in fact high-tech
industry in general invests pretty
heavily in Israel the strategic
relationship remains Israel remains a
very close military and intelligence
ally and has a lot of effects so
integrated into the u.s. system you
really can't distinguish them there's a
lot more there are cultural factors
which is kind of hard to measure but
they surely exist so it takes a
Christian Zionism I'm not talking about
evangelicals here I mean just mainstream
Christian Zionism people at Woodrow
Wilson that goes back way before Jewish
Zionism and it's much more
experience it's much bits wept the
population much more than Zionism did
the Jewish population so for example in
the First World War when the British
general Allenby conquered Jerusalem you
take a look at the headlines in the main
us press richard the lionheart it has
defeated the pagans and restored the
Holy Land to us that's the way it's
presented in the main us press in the
Roosevelt administration which was
secular you know Harold Ickes one of
Roosevelt's main advisors kind of a
Social Democrat he described the return
of Jews to Palestine as the Greater
Israel as the Land of Israel as the
greatest achievement in human history
because was fulfilling the words of the
holy book you know and this this is a
strain that goes way right through
that's apart from evangelical
Christianity considerable part of the
population which is much more extreme
and that includes people pretty high up
like george w bush for example literally
and can talk about if you like but
that's significant and there's something
else that's significant political
science literature has a concept that
they call the anglosphere meaning
britain and it's offshoots the
Anglosphere is a little unusual in the
history of imperialism not unique but
unusual in that the Anglosphere
countries like this or Canada or
Australia these are settler colonial
societies they don't just rule the
countries they conquer they exterminate
the population and take them over that's
a very special form of imperialism and
that's deeply rooted in the hole you
know American picture of the world and
it's justified if we did it it must be
justified so by definition so there's a
hole in of the large part of the culture
is based on the idea that it's right for
superior races to come and get rid of
the backward population and take it over
and so on well that's what Israel is
it's the last settler colonial society
and that strikes a chord I don't know
how to measure the effect of that but
it's something there's in other words
there's plenty of factors that support
the strategic relationship which it's
sustained and on on the other hand you
know there's almost nothing going for
the Palestinians they don't offer
anything they aren't wealth they're off
power then of military force you know
they have the kind of Rights that other
indigenous populations had but who cares
about them and of course by now it's all
mingled with this extreme Islamophobia
but which is taking which is really
reaching almost hysterical proportions
in the country I mean just recently for
example a number of state legislators
Oklahoma a couple of others have passed
legislation insisting that the state
constitutions be changed to block
Islamic law I mean the chances of
Islamic law affecting a court or a kind
of you know minus zero or something but
we have to put it in a constitution
there's a substantial part of the
population who think that Obama is
trying to institute and Sharia you know
take over the country it's a pretty wild
country in many respect and these I
don't have to know how much these but
whatever it is the Palestinians are
caught up in this anti-arab hysteria and
he Muslims during so it's also long haul
yeah thanks for coming I reluctantly
support my government by paying taxes
and my government then goes and does
does these things I'm wondering what
your thoughts are on paying federal
taxes and if you pay federal taxes and
and if that's really something that we
each could do and
slow the the machine down well in I've
thought about a lot and in fact acted on
it in 1965 along with another friend I
tried to organize national tax
resistance we weren't terribly
successful not the greatest organizers
in the world but wasn't that much
support for it but I didn't pay taxes
for about ten years it's somewhat risky
they can come down on you but but it's
like other kinds of civil disobedience
including much more serious kinds which
I was also involved in you know that
people have different reasons but in my
view of civil disobedience is really a
pragmatic issue you'd do it if you think
its consequences will be favorable like
will civil disobedience kind of
stimulate other people to say okay I'll
go a little farther than I did if it can
have that effect it's okay if it doesn't
have that effect it seems to me it's
useless so in fact I stopped in 1975
because it seemed to me useless and
certainly I'm not opposed to taxes i
think we're under text and particularly
the wealthy earth ridiculously under tax
but so taxes are okay but and yes
they're do terrible things but they also
do important things so just not paying
taxes and itself doesn't seem to me a
sensible tactic unless it's focused and
can in a way which can reach other
people who can make them think that they
ought to take some other stand some
years ago and I'd have to go back a long
time Noam Chomsky supported a one-state
solution in Israel and then like a lot
of us recognize that a two-state
solution was a good good idea given the
last let's say well 60 but at least the
last 20 years of the nation-building
project of Israel is noam chomsky back
to a one-state solution like a lot of
other people I can't go back to it
because I
never gave it up except that I never
called it a one-state solution I called
it a one-state settlement which is
different from a solution I have never
seen any reason to worship the Imperial
boundaries the boundaries there were
established by Imperial force by the
British and French there's no
justification that I can see for a
boundary cutting the Galilee in half
between what's called Israel and Lebanon
so I think there are better settlements
often the distance but a one-state
settlement which back in more rational
times was called a bi-national state
that makes good sense and I know of only
one way to approach it I mean we can you
know there's a pie-in-the-sky approach
which says okay let's all live in peace
you can say okay let's all have one
state fine that's meaningless it's
meaningless until you sketch a path from
here to there and the only path I know
of maybe some kind of can suggest
another one is through it through state
settlement not settlement but not
solution but settlement a two-state
settlement which is supported by
essentially the whole world would have
the effect of reducing the cycle of
violence it would open the possibilities
for eroding the boundaries in a way a
sense in the way it's happening in
Europe just increasing the commercial
cultural personal other exchanges and I
think a boundary through that part of
the world makes absolutely no sense for
anyone and I think they probably would
erode and you could move towards maybe
some kind of federalism than maybe a
bi-national structure of some sort and
then on to erode the Imperial boundaries
so yeah I'd still believe what i did
when i was at what was called a Zionist
youth activist in the 1940s opposed to a
Jewish state and I think that's right
but the
tix you choose depend on circumstances
you can't pretend that the world doesn't
exist so you have to calibrate tactics
to options and these seem to you know
maybe somebody has another idea but
these are the only options that I can
see hello I'm this may not be especially
topical but I'm curious to know if you
have any comments about the life and
legacy of about the life and legacy of
the late anarchist Alexander Berkman
I've always been curious to know if you
had any comments on that yeah well ABCs
of communist anarchism is still worth
reading shooting Frick was not a good
idea but yeah you pick and choose
mr. Chomsky thank you for coming today I
we live where we can make a difference
every single one of us some people do
i'm on the front page of the newspaper
my name is ryan wildly had protested the
war recently and what can individuals in
this room due to shift that policy of
what's going on can we actually make a
difference okay we can make a huge
individuals in this room I mean look
take Egypt say I mean the people in
Tahrir Square or facing difficulties and
repression vastly beyond anything that
we can think of but they did it and the
back in say 1960 when a couple of young
black students had in a lunch counter
they were again facing the kind of
violence and repression that none of us
face but they did it they faced the
repression finally got somewhere that's
the way things change that we we have a
huge range of options virtually anything
it's a pretty free society I mean you
can complain about this and that but by
historical or comparative standards it's
a pretty free society which means there
are any number of options from civil
disobedience to legislative to protests
to organization to educational
activities they all matter in the long
run they add up so just to clarify every
single person in this room can make a
difference absolutely take a look at our
own history or what's happening right
now
thank you I would look up in anybody my
age it's yeah it's a much more civilized
country than it was maybe 50 years ago
and the reason is because people did
things most a lot of young people did
things I don't know what happened here
but let's say take my own University MIT
have been there since nineteen
fifty-five in 1955 he walked down the
halls in MIT it was a well-dressed
obedient deferential white males period
doing their work you know you walk down
the halls of MIT today it kind of looks
like this you know half women third
minority is a you know informal dress
which means informal relationships a lot
of political activism unheard of then
well that's this happened all over the
country in fact to an extent all over
the world a lot of it was initiated by
young people and it did civilize the
country in fact it set off a wave of
repression which tends to follow
civilizing the country sorry plenty you
can do I thank you for coming you're a
hero from way back linguistics as well
as politics in history and you've taught
me to do this I look at who followed the
mummy and the big money seems to go to
international finance so oil prices go
up and the major beneficiary is
international finance weapons systems
are paid to Lockheed but we borrow the
money and ten years later the biggest
beneficiary is international finance can
you comment on the role of that elephant
in the room well that's a very
significant change that took place in
the 1970s I think the major post-war
change post-world war two change I've
always thought was in the early 70s when
the United States abandoned the post-war
economic system Bretton Woods system and
freed up a basic point was to free up
flows of financial capital deregulate
capital up until that point currencies
were regulated capital flows were
limited and so on that just changed the
it was connected with something else it
was connected with the fact that the
rate of profit and manufacturing was
declining and you could make more money
by financial manipulations than by
producing things connected with that
with the increasing ease of offshoring
production so you could trade agreements
were established which are called free
trade they have nothing to with free
trade they're basically agreements which
are designed to provide rights for
investors and to set working people
around the world and competition to one
with one another and not privileged
professionals and others they're
protected but of course investors are
privileged but working people are set in
competition with one another has an
obvious effect as part of the attack on
unions in fact when somebody mentioned
and it also has shifted the economy
enormously that you go back to say the
early seventies financial institutions
were part of the economy but they were
doing the job that they're supposed to
do in a state capitalist economy they
were taking unused funds like say your
bank account and directing them to
something productive use that's changed
enormously by be right before the
current crash they've been repeated
crashes since that time none before
right before the last crash the
financial institutions made about forty
percent of corporate profit which is
phenomenal it's not that they're doing
anything useful if I could doing nothing
useful for the economy in fact they're
harming the
right now if we had a capitalist system
this wouldn't happen because every time
there'd be a crash they go out of
business but we don't have a luckily we
have a very powerful state which
intervenes and if Goldman Sachs is going
to tank they go to you the taxpayer and
say you bail me out you know and that's
what happens so they're not subject to
market discipline and that's continuing
right at this moment like well you know
twenty percent of the population is
qualifying for food stamps and Congress
is telling us we got to reduce that
freeloaders Goldman Sachs just announced
seventeen and a half billion dollars of
compensation for executives and tripled
the base salary or their CEO and their
Richard they're bigger than ever were
before after having been instrumental in
creating less prices and being bailed
out by the taxpayer well that's our kind
of capitalism it's run by financial
institutions and yes so they're
extremely powerful they're quite harmful
to the economy they survived thanks to
the fact that the so-called libertarians
actually support a very powerful state
which intervenes on the for the benefit
of the Richard powerful and it's happens
repeatedly I mean like I said there were
no financial crises in the 50s and 60s
they started under Reagan they've been
increasing ever since and as long as we
have this system of government insured
finance called too big to fail yeah
we'll continue the gentleman just before
me ask about what we can do and that
question stimulated one were yet I think
of two things one is the bill for a
state bank that's right in front of the
our legislature right now one like North
Dakota head for 50 s for 50 years made
of a deficit so that's that's one that's
right now and there's the other one is
the I understand the person who produced
producer of The King's Speech that one
the people took of the Oscar is also has
come out with a movie called mural mir
al because he said there'll be no
solution to the israeli-palestinian
conflict until we understand the
Palestinian side and of course that's
being attacked as we one-sided but I
understand it's being suppressed I found
it was on shortly for a while in
Portland but when I called around here
they said oh well it's just being shown
it at art theaters how is that kind of
suppression accomplished here is this
the a bag or where is it coming from and
what can we do I'm sorry
so there's a pro-palestinian movie that
is being repressed yes put out by the
person who just won the big Oscar of the
King's Speech protest outside the movie
theaters or go to the studios or whoever
runs this stuff and make it clear that
you don't want to accept that kind of
censorship how else let's run them
somewhere else how's it published in
this country huh how do they accomplish
it how do they accomplish me don't know
what happened in this particular case
but it's a centralized control of
distribution of movies and so wherever
that center is they say what's going to
be shown but that means it's not graven
in stone first we can get around it by
doing it yourself like movies could be
shown here I presume and that I think
the centres of censorship whatever they
are can be directly protested thank you
this will be short thank you Egypt the
spring there the recent referendum the
yes vote that the stoning of a borrowed
I how optimistic are you that we have
something good happening there
how optimistic about agent stays well
you know again it's it's not something
happening on Mars we can affect it what
the US government is doing is
influencing it and the US government has
a policy a very clear policy it's a
familiar one that had like I said it
happens over and over dictatorship after
dictatorship try to restore the old
regime now we don't have to support that
in fact we don't have to tolerate it we
could support democracy in Egypt means
protesting our own government which
doesn't want it for the reasons I
mentioned but so it's not something like
I said it's like more it's not on Mars
you know it's happening here we can
affect what's likely to happen it's hard
to say I mean the the old regime is of
course digging in its heels they want to
maintain themselves they have some the
names they maintain control of the elite
in the military are still in power
they'll try to hang on and get what if
they can you know this torture going on
the security forces are back under a
different name on the other hand the
protesters are still at it they're
showing up constantly regularly
demanding more they're protesting the
military now could lead to a direct
confrontation with the military which
could be pretty ugly that's again
crucial where the u.s. stands will it
permit massacre in Tahrir Square the way
it did in Pearl square in Bahrain say
well I I don't think you could I can't
predict nobody could predict it was
going to start and nobody can predict
where it goes it will depend on the
fortitude and commitment of the
participants and the way in which
external power is mainly the US will
react
