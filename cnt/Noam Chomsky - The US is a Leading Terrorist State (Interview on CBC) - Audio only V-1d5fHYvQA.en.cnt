is the United States of America a
leading terrorist state even war in
Afghanistan an American support of
Israel proved that George Bush qualifies
as a war criminal well according to Noam
Chomsky America's most famous dissonant
the answer is yes we need him in
Cambridge to talk about many things
including his new book 911 in the
hysterical days following the September
11th attacks when George Bush reduced
the world to two camps you're either
with us or you're against us two voices
of dissent distinguished themselves
first Susan Sontag and then Noam Chomsky
both refused to buy into George Bush's
reductive worldview and they reminded
Americans of their own government's
criminal actions around the world now
Noam Chomsky is of course the MIT
linguistics professor who famously
popularized the concept of manufacturing
consent for years he's written about how
the West uses a propagandistic press to
coerce its own citizens and how it uses
covert forms of violence to maintain
power around the world Chomsky was
overwhelmed with media requests about
September 11 so his new book 911 is a
collection of interviews that he gave in
the following months now interestingly
911 has been a best-seller despite the
fact that it's had a total lack of
publicity I met Noam Chomsky in
Cambridge to talk about the post-911
world and how things have changed since
then but I began by asking him to
explain how the war in Afghanistan is an
example of how the u.s. is in his mind a
leading terrorist state October twelfth
I guess a couple of days after the
bombing started Bush publicly announced
to the Afghan people that we will
continue dammam you unless your
leadership turns over to us people who
we suspect of carrying out crimes
although we refuse to give you any
evidence probably because they don't
have any and we dismiss without comment
the unique offers of your leadership for
negotiations about extradition and
notice that that's a text book
illustration of international terrorism
that is the you by the US official
definition that is the use of the
threats of force or violence in this
case extreme violence to attain
political ends through intimidation and
fear and so on that's the official
definition this is a text book
illustration of three weeks later by the
end of October the war aims had changed
they were first announced as far as I
can find out by the british defence
minister sir Admiral boys Admiral boys
british defence minister he informed the
afghan population that we will continue
to mom you until you change your
leadership well that's an even more
dramatic illustration of international
terrorism if not an aggression and that
was the and that was the goal that was
followed this had nothing to do with
finding the criminals and bringing them
to justice it's totally different issue
if the United States is a leading
terrorist state if as you say Britain is
another example of a terrorist state how
do you distinguish between that kind of
what you described as terrorism and what
they are saying Osama bin Laden who's a
terrorist make the distinction that's
very simple if they do it it's terrorism
if we do it its counterterrorism that's
a historical Universal get back to Nazi
propaganda say most extreme mass
murderers ever if you look at Nazi
propaganda it's exactly what they said
they said they are defending the
populations and the legitimate
governments of Europe like VG from the
terrorists terrorists partisans who are
directed from London that's the basic
propaganda line and like all propaganda
how vulgar it has an element of truth
the partisans did carry out terror they
were directed from London the Vichy
government is about as legitimate as
half the government's the u.s. is
installed around the world and supports
so yes there was a minor element of
truth to it and that's the way it works
if somebody else carries it out it's
terror if we carry it out it's counter
terror I think perhaps one of the most
dramatic examples right at this moment
as a place where where he just was a
couple of weeks ago southeastern Turkey
southeastern Turkey is the site of one
of the some of the worst terrorist
atrocities of the 1990s this is the
Curtis tax records tax on the Kurds left
a couple of million refugees much of the
countryside devastated and tens of
thousands of people killed every
imaginable barbaric form of torture you
can dream I was all well documented and
Human Rights Watch reports and so on how
did they do it well they did it with a
huge flow of us arms which ended up its
peaked in 1997 in the single year 1997
and that one year the arms transfers to
turkey from the United States were
higher than the entire Cold War period
you know up until the insurgency store
the counterinsurgency started but look
at the way it's treated look at the way
it's treated this massive international
terrorism run supported by the United
States is considered a great triumph of
counterterrorism so if you read the
State Department reports on terror they
praised turkey for its success in
showing how to counter terror you read a
front-page article in The New York Times
praised as Turkey for showing how to
deal with terror turkey was selected as
the country to provide the International
of the forces for what they call the
international force for Afghanistan
actually it's for kabel alone it's
turkey that's being offered is being
paid by the United States extensively to
carry out the repression of terror
thanks to their achievements
encountering terror namely by carrying
out some of the worst terror the 1990s
massive of ethnic cleansing and
atrocities with us support now you know
this takes it this is a real achievement
of the intellectual culture to be able
to do this but it illustrates very well
the answer your question terror and
counter terror if some enemy state did
this and I would be not just outraged
we'd be bombing all right when we come
back Noam Chomsky says that nations such
as the United States and Israel should
acknowledge their own crimes before
talking about right and wrong and he
says a lot more than that so stick
around for more Noam Chomsky let's talk
about in the Middle East for example
where Sharon says we are experiencing
terrorist bombings and therefore we have
to have a big operation in the in the
West Bank and and root out terrorism and
people say hey you're violating human
rights and the Israelis say there's no
equivalency between suicide bombings and
protecting our security in the
Palestinians say there's no equivalence
between suicide bombings and the
occupation this is the 35th year of a
harsh brutal and vicious occupation
supported unilaterally by the United
States constant terror and atrocities
the supposed Palestinians say well we're
under terrorist attack for 35 years
therefore we have a right to carry out
suicide but they say do you accept this
does anybody except that nobody accepts
right then how come everyone accepts the
Israeli claim to be doing it which is
much weaker claim because after all
there's no symmetry in the situation
they are the military occupiers
Palestine isn't occupying Israel and
this isn't just started now it's going
on years ago I mean what is that in your
mind just a fan of course not that
doesn't in anybody so it validates both
sides those who defend suicide bombing
and they're very few have not don't have
a leg to stand on
those who defend the Israeli atrocities
including the US government most
intellectual opinion good bit of the
West generally they don't have a leg to
stand on either and have a much weaker
position they were back to Turkey again
I such take the Powell mission Powell is
praised because he's such a wonderful
diplomat he succeeded in he went to
Yasser Arafat who's imprisoned in a
dungeon where again him flush the toilet
and he extracted from him a statement
condemning terror did anybody request
suggest that Powell should have asked a
Sharon to condemn the Israeli atrocities
did anyone suggest that Powell asked
George Bush to condemn the fact that
he's been sending Israel of the Apache
attack helicopters which have been
devastating Judy who has been kickin
sorry oh no no did anybody noticed and
my point did anybody suggest can you
find a word in the press anywhere or
anywhere that's just at powell should
have requested a condemnation of israeli
terror from sharon and of us backing of
that terror from bush I mean that's a
thought that couldn't enter anyone's
mind and the reason is because our
profound commitment to terror and
violence when it's committed by our
clients and by ourselves that is so deep
that we can't even think of the question
you asked us after September 11 one of
your points we ought to look in the
mirror we being America or the West that
a look in the mirror at our own was that
a way of saying look people like bin
Laden are angry at us for good reason in
other words is there a way to justify
what I was saying the statement of mine
that you just quoted is a very
conservative statement in fact it was
articulated by George Bush's favorite
philosopher Jesus Christ who pointed out
famously defined the notion hypocrite a
hypocrite is a person who focuses on the
other fellows crime
and refuses to look at his own that's
the definition of hypocrite by George
Bush's favorite philosopher when I
repeat that I'm not taking a radical
position I'm taking position which is
just elementary morality but even if he
is a hypocrite and they had all not he
ever even you let me ask another
question see if just here's an
experiment try to find a phrase in the
massive commentary on September 11th
which is not hypocritical in the sense
of George Bush's favorite philosopher
find one phrase all right but I don't
think you can do it okay but before I
don't want to get Gnostic here and
religious on it but I do want it this is
not religion this is elementary morality
if people cannot rise to the level of
applying to ourselves the same standards
we apply to others they have no right to
talk about right and wrong or Gooden but
let's talk about even in right look
there's nobody pure but an argument
estimate I know that the US has
committed atrocities however they did
out a more brutal regime the Taliban
there wasn't even wearing there wasn't
even a warrant wasn't even wore him but
is that a moral thing to do they did get
rid of a brutal regime there was
celebration k good final atom bomb is
real and get rid of the brutal regime
there let the bomb was becca ston and
get rid of the brutal regime they say
the Taliban but he has really got rid of
the same no they're not the same their
brutal regimes but let's go back a stage
the goal was not to oust the Taliban
that was not a warring that was a war
aim that was picked up several weeks
after the bombing started okay all right
let's go back suppose the weed and their
dozen is a like list long list of brutal
regimes around the world which ought to
be overthrown but not by somebody
bombing however let's go back to the
late late October when the after three
weeks of bombing when the US and it's
British client decided to shift the war
aims to overthrowing the Taliban regime
there was a meeting sponsored by the
United States in Peshawar Pakistan of a
thousand
Afghan leaders they unanimously
condemned the bombing and said it was
undermining their efforts which they
thought could succeed to overthrow the
Taliban regime from within the US is
doing it just to show off their muscle
all right now you want to so the
question of whether the overthrow regime
iya that arises and I think the Afghans
are right regimes should be overthrown
from within and in this case it was
probably very likely that that would
succeed it was a small brutal group
highly unpopular plenty of opposition to
it which could have been organised from
within and that's the way to overthrow
regime if we want to overthrow the
regime of Uzbekistan now a great
favorite but it happens to be not very
different from the Taliban the way to do
it would not be the bomb was Becca stone
but to support internal democratic
forces and let them do it and that that
generalizes around the world now Robert
Kaplan who writes about foreign policy I
spoke to him recently about his book or
your politics and I put some of your
points to him he said about the
distinction between the terrorists
states you call Israel America and the
terrorist states that America calls the
Taliban he said I wish Noam Chomsky had
been with me in Romania in the 70s or
the 80s just one of the seven or eight
Warsaw states with just one of the seven
or eight prison systems with 700,000
political prisoners adult choice of
foreign policy is made on distinctions
the argument that Chomsky makes has no
distinctions because there's a
difference between the quantity and the
kind of dictators at America supported
and the quantity and the kind of things
we went in in communist world for 44
years so let's take his example I am
Ceausescu hideous regime which he forgot
to tell you the United States supported
I supported right till the end as did
britain so the example that he gave is a
perfect example and it's a small example
because we support much more brutal
regimes I gave an example in
southeastern Turkey several million
refugees tens of thousands of people
killed a country devastated that's
rather serious it's a nobody accused the
militia which of that in Kosovo
east timor we supported affricate he's
indonesian he was one of the Sioux heart
though was one of the worst killers and
tortures of the late 20th century the
United States and Britain supported him
throughout he's our kind of guy as the
Clinton administration said in 1995 I
horrible atrocities in fact you know
when he came into office in 1965 with a
coup the CIA compared it to Hitler
Stalin and now it led to total euphoria
in the United States and Britain massive
support when he carried out even worse
atrocity comparable atrocities elsewhere
the couple of you know 100,000 people
killed then hundreds of thousands later
full support continued right through the
end of his rule in fact continued past
his rule in late nineteen ninety nine
when they were rampaging and destroy
what was left of East Timor the US and
Britain continued to support him and I
can continue through the world like this
what Catalans Kaplan says that that
there is a distinction everyone's got
some blood other hands but he says I we
have significantly less blood because
what we are is a soft imperialist really
not state terrorist so like when we
supported his example Ceausescu and
Romania right to the end that's good how
about killing several million people in
Vietnam how about killing hundreds of
thousands of people in Central America
in the 80s leaving for countries
devastated beyond you know beyond that
may be beyond recovery the qualify the
US know it does your Vita the other way
ob's look nor does it disqualify been
that the fact that this quality that bin
Laden is a terrorist or that say the
Taliban or terrorist state that fact
doesn't disqualify them from bombing
Washington what disqualifies from doing
that is even as even they were maganda
they shouldn't do it Kaplan's can't
understand trivialities the triviality
here is that nobody's compania kept the
ultra right-wing jingoists like kaplan
is comparing atrocities by various
what honest people are saying this seems
to be incomprehensible is that we should
keep to the elementary moral level of
the Gospels we should pay attention to
our own crimes and stop committing them
this would be true even if we were
killing one person ok and it's even more
true when we're killing millions of
people let's bring it to the bigger
picture than just because it the
question he says we all agree with the
Gospels this is and then he does he
doesn't he said lucky does the odds ian
world this is what was he said wishes
are ours or theirs nasty if you leave
people alone they'll kill each other
yeah and that's why what you need was he
calls is an organizing hegemon an
overwhelming power which is always tons
yeah which is always asking price
because we and why is it us because we
have the power and we have a massively
subservient intellectual class of which
is an illustration which will support us
atrocities no matter how awful they are
but is realpolitik that sure he's off in
another land with his gospel that he
says we look nuts we forget gospel I'm
talking about the most elementary
morality if a person doesn't understand
that they have no right to talk ok if
you don't understand that you pay
attention to your own crimes you have no
right to talk he talks about
Machiavellian virtud sometimes we do a
bad thing to protect our democratic and
our good institutions and the justices
how are we protecting our democratic
institutions by supporting mass
slaughter and southeastern Turkey in the
last few years without supporting our
democratic institutions was it
supporting our democratic institutions
on ours but anybody would Kaplan argue
that the nation state has a right to use
any means necessary to protect its
sovereignty no then then he's justifying
the lesser of it she's saying militia
which had any head of the right do
anything he wanted to repress the
Kosovars and Albanians that reasoning do
we needs a Constabulary a force a
central force in this case it's American
America because it's a superpower to
sometimes use unjust beings in the
service of Just Cause what are the just
causes what was the just cause
in for example slaughtering Kurds in
southeastern Turkey what was it just
cause I can what was the Just Cause in
supporting su carto when he wiped when
he killed a couple hundred thousand
landless peasants in Indonesia went on
to become one of the biggest torturers
in the world and then destroyed a
slaughter the third of the population of
East Timor what was it just cause what
was it just cause when we invaded South
Vietnam 40 years ago this is the 40th
anniversary of the public announcement
of the US attack on South Vietnam ending
up killing millions of people leaving
the country devastated is still dying
from chemical warfare what was it just
cause what was it just cause when we
fought a war to a large extent against
the Catholic Church in Central America
in the 1980s killing hundreds of
thousands of people every imaginable
kind of torture and devastation what was
the Just Cause can I continue yeah we
woulda just cause for people like Kaplan
is we did it therefore it's a just cause
you can read that in the Nazi archives
to all right when we come back Noam
Chomsky's always controversial views on
Israel and his idea for solving problems
using international law so stick around
once again for more Noam Chomsky
hitchin says we've seen the enemy and
the enemy isn't us it's the Islamic
fascists there's into fascist there and
I don't want to live with them we don't
want to negotiate then we must destroy
them ergo the war against the Taliban
justified the war against the al-aksa
brigades justified I mean he has a
different distinction but we see the
face of the enemy and we should do
anything to root them out how do you
respond to that argument on to that by
saying that there are many evil forces
in the world if we want to stop
atrocities I think it's a great idea to
reduce the level of atrocities and
violence around the world the easiest
way to do it simplest is to stop
participating in it if we stop
participating in it we will already
reduce the level of atrocities and
violence enormously and if we can ever
reach the moral level minimal moral
level of terminating our own massive
participation and atrocities then we can
move to another question of what we do
about the atrocities of others and I
think there I think it's right to deal
with them yes there is an enemy there
are people who carried out crimes
against humanity and there are ways to
deal with crimes and not by a bombing
another country and putting millions of
people at the risk of starvation that's
not a way to deal with crimes when the
US was condemned for international
terrorism and Nicaragua and then veto to
security hadn't dismissed the
condemnation by the World Court of
course and escalated the crimes and
vetoed a Security Council resolution
calling up on it to observe
international law the right reaction for
Nicaragua was not to say we have seen
the enemy and we must destroy them so
therefore let's set off bombs in
Washington but if it's wrong for them
it's wrong for us again by elementary
moral standards so we should ask well
what was right for them and what's right
for which would be right for us and I
think they couldn't do what was right
for them because we blocked it we're too
powerful but we could do what was right
for them and we never even considered it
because we don't rise to that minimal
our level let's take a look at the
Middle East but let's take a look at the
fact the facts are 435 repeat for 35
years there has been a harsh brutal
miserable military occupation there has
not been a political settlement the
reason why there has not been a
political settlement is that the United
States unilaterally has blocked it for
25 years is it supported by the entire
world including the majority of the
American people the answer to that
question is yes there is a political
settlement that has been supported by
virtually the entire world including the
Arab states the PLO Europe Eastern
Europe Canada Barack put that on the t
know he did not he did not what this bed
is also supported by the majority of the
American people it has just been
reiterated by Saudi Arabia the US has
unilaterally blocked it for 25 years
what Barack put on the table the the
population doesn't know this because
people like the Western media the media
in Canada in the United States don't
tell them like you can check and see how
often you you for example or others have
reported what I just said I don't don't
bother checking the answer is 0 the
Barack proposal in a camp david in the
Brock clinton proposal at in the United
stand check the Canadian media in the
United States you cannot find a map
which is the most important thing of
course a check in Canada and see if you
can find a map you go to Israel you can
find a mat you can go to scholarly
sources you can find them out here's
what you find when you look at a map you
find that this generous magnanimous
proposal guaranteed it provided Israel
with a salient east of Jerusalem
including the city of malaya du meme
which was established primarily by the
labour government and Clinton in order
to bisect the west bank that salient
goes almost to Jericho bricks the West
Bank in two to ten tons then there's a
second set into the
North going to the israeli settlement of
arielle which bisects the northern part
in 22 can tons so we've got three
Canton's in the West Bank virtually
separated all three of them are
separated from a small area of east
jerusalem which is the center of
palestinian commercial and cultural life
and of communications they got four
can't tons all separated from the west
from gaza so that's five can't Duns all
surrounded by Israeli settlements
infrastructure development and so on
which also instantly guarantee is real
control over the water resources the
reason last comment this does not rise
to the level of South Africa 40 years
ago when South Africa established the
Bathurst and that's the generous
magnanimous offer okay and there's a
good reason why Maps weren't shown
because as soon as you look at the map
you see it all right however that's the
characterization of it but let me just
say Arafat didn't even bother putting a
counter proposal on the table that's not
true they negotiated that taba
afterwards that's not right well I I
guess my questions that's not they don't
continue to delicious except that's
totally false and no practical not on is
it false but not a single participant in
the meetings says it that's a media
fabrication terrified didn't put
together adiposity they had a proposal
they proposed the international
consensus which has been accepted by the
entire world the Arab states the PLO the
majority's Markham sorry they proposed a
settlement which is an accord with an
overwhelming international and my
question and as watched by the United
States all right when we come back after
this break Noam Chomsky says that the
United States is not only blocking
Middle East peace it's actually
escalating the violence there and who's
guilty of these kinds of crimes George
Bush Bill Clinton JFK Eisenhower All
American presidents and a lot more so
come on back once again for Noam Chomsky
the problem that people look at now the
Middle East as they say it's spun out of
control how do you get back to first way
we get to get back first way we get back
is by trying the experiment of minimal
honesty okay let's try that experiment
if we try the experiment of minimal
honesty we look at our own position and
we discover what I just described that
for 25 years the United States has
blocked the political settlement which
is supported by the majority of the
American population and by the entire
world except for Israel virtually I mean
there's some marginal exceptions so
first thing we do is accept the honesty
to look at that we take a look at Camp
David and we see I was the same the
United States was still propose a
demanding a Bantu stanza style
settlement and rejecting the
overwhelming international consensus and
the position of the American people we
then discover that the United States
immediately moved to enhance terror in
the region so let's continue on
September 29th a hoot Barack put a
massive military presence outside the
Alexa mosque very provocative when
people came out of the mosque young
people started throwing stones these
early army started shooting half a dozen
people were killed and escalator the
next couple of days there was no
Palestinian fire at this time and soul
and occupied territories in the next
couple of days Israel used us
helicopters Israel produces no
helicopters use us helicopters to attack
civilian complexes killing about a dozen
people and wounding several dozen
clinton reacted to that on october third
by making the biggest deal in a decade
to send israel new military helicopters
which had just been used for the purpose
i described and of course we continue to
be the u.s. press cooperated with that
by refusing to publish the story
day they have not published the fact it
continued when Bush came in one of his
first acts was to send Israel a new
shipment of the most advanced military
helicopters in the arsenal that
continues right up to a couple of weeks
ago with new shipments you take a look
at the reports from say Janine by
British correspondents like Peter
Beaumont and the London observer he says
the worst atrocity there was the Apache
helicopters buzzing around destroying
and demolishing everything this is
enhancing terror and we may easily
continue we can take also let me
continue on December 15th 14th the
Security Council tried to pass a
resolution calling for what everyone
recognizes to be the obvious means for
reducing terror namely sending
international monitors that's a way of
reducing terror this happened to be in
the middle of a quiet period which
lasted for about three weeks the u.s.
vetoed it ten days before that there was
a meeting at Geneva of the High
Contracting Parties of the Fourth Geneva
Convention which has unanimously held
for 35 years that it applies to Israel
it the meeting condemned the Israeli
settlements as illegal condemned the
list of atrocities willful destruction
of property murder trials torture and so
on and so forth all right okay what
happened to that meeting okay what
happened to that meeting the u.s.
boycotted it therefore the media refused
to publish it therefore no one here
knows that the United States once again
enhanced terror by refusing to recognize
the applicability of conventions which
make virtually everything the United
States and the Israel are doing there a
grave breach of the geneva conventions
which means a war crime just a minute
these conventions were established in
1949 in order to criminalize the
atrocities of the Nazis in occupied
territory
they are customary international law the
United States is obligated as a high
contracting party to prosecute
violations of those conventions that
means the prosecutors own leadership for
the last 25 years if we had if we were
functioning by the Geneva Convention who
would we then prosecute as a war
criminal with George Bush be a war
criminal course she wanna be a workers
they're all acting which is rarified be
a war criminal he's a criminal but not a
workroom what's the difference the
difference is working on has a technical
definition its crime carried out by
States would he be guilty of crimes
against humanity probably he would minor
crimes is compared with us but Tony
Blair obvious obviously that most
leaders in the Arab states they're
criminals but not were criminals they're
horrible criminals splitting the ones we
support like all the states we every
state we support is a practically as a
brutal terrorist state which carries out
crimes against their own society in
internal of their own society that
technically those are not war crimes
they just crimes very popular phrase now
Samuel Huntington's clash of
civilizations book writers like Bernard
Lewis say what went wrong that in fact
there might be a clash of civilizations
between an Islamic culture and a Western
judeo-christian culture they resent us
there's enormous amounts of hatred that
goes back in history but because of
resentment you want to know the answer
to the question which state Bernhard
Lewis certainly knows it he's not
telling you first was not telling you
what happened in the 19th century he
didn't talk about what Lord Palmerston
and the British did the Egypt for
example but let's be more recent yes
there's hatred against us why is easy to
find out the u.s. is a very free country
we have enormous internal declassified
record so let's look at them in 1958 the
US government faced we know from
internal records three major crises in
the world North Africa Middle East and
Indonesia all with oil producing states
all Islamic states president eisenhower
in internal discussion observed to his
staff that I'm quoting it now there's a
campaign of hatred against us in the
Middle East not by governments but by
the people the National Security Council
discuss that question and said yes and
the reason is there's a perception in
that region that the United States
supports status quo governments which
prevent democracy and development and
that we do it because of our interest in
Near East oil furthermore it's difficult
to counter that perception because it's
correct and furthermore it ought to be
correct we ought to be supporting brutal
and corrupt governments which prevent
democracy and development because we
want to control Middle East oil and it's
true that leads to a campaign of hatred
against us now until Bernard Lewis tells
us that and that's only one piece of a
long story we know that he's just a
vulgar propagandist not a scholar so yes
as long as we are supporting harsh
brutal governments blocking democracy
and development because they are
interest in controlling the oil
resources of the region there will be a
campaign of hatred against us what state
does function according to what you call
the minimal levels of honesty is there a
stand no it's our power centers the only
thing that imposes constraints on them
is either outside force or their own
populations so the United circle
criticism critical dialogue that's
exactly why the intellectuals who were
talking about are so adamant at
preventing people in the United States
and Britain from learning the most
elementary facts about is it even
possible that if you say no state
functions knowledgeably happens the
United States for example is far more
civilized than it was 40 years ago let's
just take that March 9th of this March
happened to be the 40th anniversary of
the public announcement by the Kennedy
administration that the US Air Force is
bombing South Vietnam it also initiated
chemical warfare to destroy crops
initiated napalm started driving
millions of people into concentration
camps to separate them from the
guerrillas they knew what they were
supporting this was all public did we
commemorate the 40th anniversary no why
because 40 years ago nobody cared if the
government announces okay we're gonna
start bombing another country and use
chemical warfare wipe out their crops
and driving the concentration camps
our problem so there was no protest in
the discussion now there's more proper
yes because the country has gotten more
civilized no US president today or for
the last 20 years could conceivably do
what Kennedy could do with total
impunity 40 years ago and the reason is
because there was massive popular
protest opposed by the intellectual
classes of course who hated but it did
it led to all sorts of things including
opposition to aggression and violence it
also spawned the contemporary civil
rights movement the feminist movement
the environmental movement's and all
sorts of other things and it imposed
important constraints on straight files
so that's how we got rid of slavery
that's how we got rid of feudalism
that's how it's also moving towards an
emancipation from these slowly there's
optimus / yes / over time there has been
agonizing Glee slow progress but very
real always opposed by the states by the
intellectuals who support violence and
atrocities and try to justify them and
try to prevent the population from
knowing about them but fortunately their
control is limited and therefore what
will the state look like at the end at
the end yeah end is a long time ok what
is what would we look like at the end I
think states or to dissolve because I
think there are legitimate structures
but that's a long time that's it but but
it is the end of the nation state that
you foresee in the vision I don't
foresee anything what I'm saying is that
as long as people ordinary people are
able to free themselves from the
doctrinal controls imposed on them by
their self appointed betters and mentors
I as long as they're able to do this
they'll continue to be able to struggle
for peace and justice and freedom and
limitations on violence and constraints
on power as they've been doing for
hundreds of years and I don't see any
end to that where it will end up in the
long run I can tell you where I'd like
it to but I wouldn't even dream about
that the immediate problem is to free
ourselves from the shackles
imposed very consciously by the kind of
people you're talking about who don't
want the facts to be known and for very
good reasons because if people know the
facts are not going to tolerate it so
therefore have to prevent them from
knowing you have to indoctrinate them
you have to tell them stories about how
we're really good guys and if we use
violence must be for the general good
because we represent the course of
history yeah that's the job of
propagandists for power and violence and
it's the task of populations to free
themselves from those kinds of controls
and domination pleasure to see you
always in the post-september 11th days
few people were as courageous as Noam
Chomsky and asking the hard questions
about American involvement with
terrorism and then marshalling evidence
to support his views but to say that his
ideas are controversial is obviously an
understatement witness what he said
about the nation-state being an inherent
terrorist state or his views on the
Middle East a lot of its controversial
now his slim book 911 is only a primer
on his views and it doesn't include his
usual array of footnotes which are
always essential reading Noam Chomsky's
911 is published by seven stories press
now for a transcript of the entire
interview and for a list of other
Chomsky spokes or to add your comments
to the discussion board check out our
website that's news world that's cbc.ca
/ hot type now our next hot type our
long summer special will feature two
writers who challenge Chomsky's views on
international politics the US and on the
Middle East first robert kaplan and
we'll talk about his book warrior
politics and then the islamic historian
Bernard Lewis and we'll talk about his
book what went wrong it's a real
academic fight between all those three
you'll want to watch out for that that's
it for this week I'm Evan Soloman I'll
see you next time on
