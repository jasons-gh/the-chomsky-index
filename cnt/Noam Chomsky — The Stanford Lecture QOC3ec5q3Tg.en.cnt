[Applause]
I'm really relieved to hear the reaction
we've been trying to get Michael Moore's
I'm glad you're satisfied with our
speaker group good evening everyone and
welcome my name is Paul George I'm
director of Peninsula peace and justice
center and I welcome you here on this
very special occasion in what is a very
special year for the peace and justice
center this is our 20th anniversary of
being the peninsula's leading grassroots
organization
[Music]
so welcome to the birthday party this
will kick off our celebrations Mark
Twain once wrote truth is our most
precious commodity
let us conserve it the political
leadership in Washington when it comes
to truth that seems to be the only
conservation program they have in mind I
guarantee you we will have no such
conservation this evening in this
so-called war year that George Bush is
declared it is so important that we have
access to the information and those are
so consistently concealed from us
misinformed dis informed that's we're so
glad to have Noam Chomsky here with us
this evening I'm so glad to see so many
people here I know people came from all
over the place it's been wonderful to
see we have a lot of students here
tonight that's been great I've seen the
young people come out for Noam Chomsky I
really don't know what to say to
introduce a man who's already so well
known to you so I'm gonna get out of the
way and please ask you to give a very
warm welcome to what what I think is one
of this country's most important natural
resources Noam Chomsky
[Music]
in let me check first and make sure you
can hear me yes louder yeah how's that
any better okay I'll try to remember to
stay closer to the mic and if I lean
back wave at me
in the last couple of years I've been in
the thousands of talks that give all
over the place
I've found myself kind of reluctantly
giving talks about endangered species
meaning by that things like democracy
human rights socio-economic development
others but the prime one unfortunately
is human beings ourselves I think
there's a very serious threat to
survival it's not a joke it's following
from it's as a consequence of policies
that have a great deal of elite support
a lot of popular opposition overwhelming
popular opposition but more ominously
their rationale policies that is
rational within a framework of
ideological and socio-economic
institutions that exist and are pretty
stable and within that framework policy
is leading almost inexorably to
self-destruction do appear rational and
are being pursued I want to talk about
some of these these are not going to be
things that are actually I've been
giving quite a few talks here in the
last couple of days in this area and
they've mostly been on topical matters
but I want to turn to things that are
maybe in my view more important they do
involve issues of survival but are not
on the front pages they ought to be
however first I will say a couple of
words about things that are on the front
pages these concerns have been
put to the side in the last several
months by Easton public discussion by
the threat of international terrorism
which compels us to peer into the abyss
of the future that's a title it's
supposed to be careful about plagiarism
these days and that's plagiarism I took
it from a full-page headline in the New
York Times about September 11th
well September 11th was undoubtedly a
major atrocity major terrorist atrocity
and it's been it was regarded that way
throughout the world virtually without
exception however sometimes it is useful
to pay a little bit of attention to what
people are saying outside the little
cocoon of rich and privileged and
powerful people within which most of us
spend all our lives that me too and in
fact there were interesting things to
say
outside of that about international
terrorism it was so for example in
Central America and the Middle East
which have had considerable experience
with international terrorism described
as a plague spread by depraved opponents
of civilization itself in a return to
barbarism in the modern age so on I
haven't be quoting Secretary of State
George Shultz he was the moderate of the
Reagan administration so he will
remember they came to office 20 years
ago declaring that the war against
international terrorism was going to be
the focus of u.s. foreign policy and
particularly they would concentrate on
Central America and the Middle East
which they described as the center of
the operations of the depraved opponent
of civilization itself well the
interesting that we haven't heard
anything about this in the last six
months after the war on terrorism was
read eclair Don September 11th wasn't
declared it was the same war with the
same rhetoric act even the same people
if you look probably a little being
carried out about the same way has been
so far but nothing has been said about
this not very ancient history although
in places like the Central Central
America in the Middle East they haven't
forgotten it that quickly the places
where the war against terrorism was
focused in Central America and the
Middle East they have memories like they
have memories of the fact that the
defenders of civilization launched
terrorist campaigns of unprecedented
scale and violence in both areas and
Central America in the Middle East which
has overwhelmed any other terrorism that
might be taking place there by orders of
magnitude the the and and this they do
remember undoubtedly I just happened to
return a couple of weeks ago from the
site of one of the more recent
international terrorist campaigns namely
southeastern Turkey where there was a
savage assault against the population
beginning in the mid 80s peaking in the
1990s during the Clinton years some of
the worst atrocities and ethnic
cleansing of the 1990s far worse than
anything that Malaysia bitch is being
tried for connection with Kosovo and two
or three million people made refugees a
couple of thousand towns and villages
destroyed tens of thousands of people
killed Kurds as Turkish campaign against
the Kurds every imaginable form of
torture and bar
it's all well reported in human rights
reports and scholarly literature and so
on and of course they know all about it
it's international terrorism because we
paid for it it was all done with the
military and economic and doctrinal
support diplomatic support of the United
States first by the Reagan Bush
administration's but then peaking under
Clinton in fact in the year 1997 alone
Turkey that single day year turkey
received more US military aid than in
the entire period from the beginning of
the Cold War up till the onset of the
counterinsurgency campaign in the mid
80s combined I was at Eppley nothing to
do with the Cold War it's just straight
outright international terrorism
organized paid-for
supported encouraged in Washington and
primarily by Clinton they ended up
providing 80% of the arms and and turkey
in fact became the leading recipient of
u.s. arms outside of Israel in Egypt by
the end of the 1990s by 1999 it was
replaced by Columbia as the leader and
that's the focus of the next major war
against terror which will be very much
like the earlier ones you can be sure
that and they don't doubt it
well the repression of the Kurds had
been far worse than anything bad as
Kosovo might have been it was far worse
than anything reported there and
remained so right up until the present
moment that's a kind of dungeon for
millions of people now you may have read
in the papers today or heard on NPR as I
did driving somewhere that for the first
time Afghans were able to celebrate the
Persian New Year great celebration about
that and it's a good thing for the
reasons they talked about it but you
know we can be happy that they did that
in the same celebration takes place in
Kurdish areas in all the sort of Kurdish
Persian areas everywhere except
southeastern Turkey where it was banned
by the Turkish government a couple of
people killed the demonstrations the
United States is now sending Turkey to
fight the war on terror in Afghanistan
in gratitude for their achievements of
the 1990s and conducting some of the
worst terrorist atrocities of those
years and in fact that is regarded as a
model so if you read State Department
reports or the front page of the New
York Times articles by their terrorism
experts they law in Turkey for having
Jonah for having demonstrated how one
should deal with terrorism and serve as
a model for the future and therefore
they're the ones who should take
responsibility for fighting the war on
terror in Afghanistan now this is quite
a tribute to the servility I guess is
the right word of the educated classes
in the West all of this passes without
notice virtually none of it was reported
still isn't reported beyond just
suppressing the fact they are even
lauded for the achievement of conducting
some of the worst international
terrorism of the last few years and
serving now as a model to how to conduct
the war against terror well is nothing
here surprises anyone in Central America
or the Middle East or in fact most of
the world because they're quite familiar
with how wars against terror are carried
out all of this simply illustrates what
ought to be a complete truism terrorism
has a definition it means it refers to
the terrorism that others carry out
against us if we carry out against them
at a thousand times the level that's not
terrorism and furthermore it's not
that's in the United States that's
university try hard to find the next
into it in the scholarly literature
journalism or everything else but it's
not just the United States as far as I
know it's universal
I think it's a historical Universal I
can't find an incident in modern or past
history when that hasn't been true so if
you take the worst you know the worst
mass murderers who existed say the Nazis
in occupied Europe take a look at their
propaganda they were defending the
population against the Terrorism of the
resistance which was directed and
supported from abroad and defending the
legitimate governments like Vichy
against these terrorists and like all
propaganda there's a certain element of
truth to it nobody doubted that the
partisans were being directed and
supported from London and Washington
that's perfectly open and they
undoubtedly carried out terrorist acts
if you can think of a resistance
movement and history that didn't I'd
like to hear about it it's not to say
that it's a good thing but it's just a
fact and so there was some truth to the
Nazi propaganda that they were fighting
a counter to war against terror and we
can take pride in the fact that we're in
good company it's not all that different
and then as I say I don't know of any
exceptions I presume if we had records
from Attila the Hun we'd probably find
the same thing you can anybody can think
of an exception I'd like to hear it I
had it as a footnote somewhere well the
sum of some of these things remain in
memory some don't and they follow the
they follow the principle so for example
on March 11th there were solemn
ceremonies around the country very well
reported commemorating the 6th six
months anniversary of the atrocities of
the World Trade Center that was a
serious terrorist attack undoubtedly
it's the first terrorist attack on in
the National 1st military force the
violent attack
against the national territory of the
United States since 1814 when the
British burned down Washington and every
December seventh and that's justified
you should commemorate that on every
December seventh we commemorate an
attack against military bases into US
colonies on 1941 and yes those are
terrorist atrocities or aggression as
well and that makes sense we should
commemorate those crimes there are
others that pass without mention for
example this month which had in March of
2002 happens to be the 40th anniversary
of March 1962 that was the month in
which the Kennedy administration
publicly announced that it was sending
the US Air Force to bomb South Vietnam
and initiate chemical warfare to destroy
food crops authorized napalm began the
officially began the project of driving
hundreds of thousands of people it ended
up being maybe ten million people into
concentration camps and slums try to
overcome indigenous resistance that's 40
years this month haven't noticed any
commemorations or any reference to it
and the reason is it's kind of like the
atrocities in southeast Turkey didn't
happen and it didn't happen because we
did it and since we did it it's not a
crime in fact it's not even part of
history and as far as I know that in
fact that one is even lauded as a noble
cause and the noble achievement left
millions of them in South Vietnam was
the main target of the u.s. attack all
the way through and that I've
practically destroyed the rest of the
Indochina along with it
millions of corpses nobody knows within
millions literally what the number of
dead was front because of another
principle you don't investigate your own
crimes you investigate other people's
crimes we
you know laser-like intensity about your
own since they don't exist there's no
need to investigate them and we don't
even know in fact among the general
public information is so slight that the
one study I know of that was done to try
to see what people thought you know so
what what's your guess as to how many
Vietnamese victims there were it turns
out the mean guess is a hundred thousand
that's as if in Germany now if you ask
people how many Jews were killed in the
Holocaust and the mean guess was maybe
two hundred thousand if that happened in
Germany we think there's a problem there
you know some if that if you got results
like that
well we don't think there's a problem
here because Germany was defeated and
therefore they have to face the facts of
what they did but the United States has
always been victorious 100% of the time
and when you're always victorious it's
very bad for the character and part of
part of the defect is you just don't pay
attention to what you did to other
people so if err you don't have to worry
about how the first war on terror was
waged or how this one's being waged or
the fact that the one of the major some
of the major terrorist atrocities are
just the last few years are in fact not
only you know not only the atrocities
overlooked they're actually lauded as
successes in counter-terror and the
agent of them is praised sometimes it
takes real effort to ignore these things
so you may have seen a couple of days
ago clip in here
March 11th there was a front-page story
in The New York Times probably the San
Francisco Chronicle about big headlines
as some see panic as main effect of
dirty bombs some scientists and
scientists discovered that radioactive
materials that are in quite wide use in
the United States
cobalt radioactive cobalt rods that are
used to irradiate
food and so on can be turned in
principle at least into what they call
dirty bombs they could be spread over
cities in New York they say that would
these would be weapons of terror that
would probably kill few people but would
spread panicked and produce severe
economic damage with Ray's radiation
levels above what's acceptable by the
EPA environment protection Environmental
Protection Agency it would undoubtedly
cost panic
so that's front-page story and it should
be indicates the kind of abyss that we
should be peering into the couple of
days before that three days before that
the wire services reported it was barely
had a friend to a database Church barely
searched barely noted in the press but
why are served all the wire services
reported a conference going on in
Vietnam which had leading u.s.
specialists on public health mainly
concerned with the effects of chemical
warfare this is not the possibility that
some people a few people might suffer
from a dirty bomb in the future but
rather the chemical warfare of the years
19 of the 1960s beginning in March 1962
the leading u.s. specialist professor at
University of Texas had been doing blood
tests of dioxin levels around South
Vietnam North Vietnam was spared this
particular atrocity it was just the
south that had the chemical warfare
attacks beginning 40 just 40 years ago
and he found dioxin levels up to 200
times above average that's one of the
most severe carcinogens there is some
investigation of this by foreign
journalists one of the leading Israeli
reporters very well known and respected
reporter Amnon Capelli traveled through
the region in 1988 and reported in
Israel that
what he called the hideous deformities
among children just deformed fetuses in
the hospitals you know horrible effects
he estimated at that time 1988 about
quarter of a million victims the the
public health specialist a couple of
days ago pointed out that they're still
new victims
so it's something very lasting but again
that's not a crime it's not like the
possibility that some people might be
affected by dirty bombs by terrorists in
the future this is just who knows how
many maybe a quarter million people
affected by us chemical warfare in South
Vietnam so therefore it isn't worth
mention I actually sometimes it is
mentioned about ten years ago there was
an article in the New York Times in the
science section by their Southeast Asia
correspondent barbara Chrisette who
pointed out that it's kind of a mistake
for us not to investigate this question
because if we because it's a it's a
perfect experimental situation we have
two genetically identical populations
North and South Vietnam so we have a
control group and a test group one of
them was subjected to intensive u.s.
chemical warfare the other was not and
if we investigated it we might learn
something it would be useful for us so
therefore we're kind of overlooking a
real opportunity by not paying any
attention to this problem the conception
that maybe would it do something about
it like pay reparations or try to cure
people or something I mean that is so
remote from it's just son unintelligible
the words don't mean anything you can't
say it in polite company well those two
stories differed in that one was a
front-page story and the other was
unmentioned and that again illustrates
the principles principles are you don't
alright we don't commit any crimes it's
kind of a logical impossibility and
the terrorism is what they do to us not
what we do to them so therefore it was
unnecessary in the past six months to
report anything about the history of
terrorism and if you look carefully
you'll find nothing nothing about the
first war on terrorism nothing about the
fact that the same people that ran that
one are running this one and nothing
about the fact that the US was condemned
for international terrorism in Central
America by the World Court would have
been by the Security Council of it
hadn't vetoed a resolution calling on
all states to observe international law
the current leader of the war on
terrorism the only state in the world
that has the that happens to be both
condemned by the highest international
tribunal for international terrorism but
also happens to be the only state in the
world that has vetoed a Security Council
resolution calling on States to observe
international law its assistance in the
its coalition partners are leading
terrorist States Russia's delighted to
join the war on terrorism to have
authorization for its atrocities and
chechnya saimin china same and israel
turkey stepped up repression that's what
I was there for and is now honored by
taking over the role of leading the war
on terrorism in Afghanistan all of this
passes unnoticed unmentioned if you can
find a word about it and the reams of
paper that have poured out I'd be
surprised I have it well that's inside
the cocoon we happened to be rich
privileged victorious powerful but we
don't have any responsibility to pay any
attention to what's going on in the
world well outside the cocoon you hear
different voices so in the Arabic year
it was a couple of weeks ago in
southeast Turkey where the celebrations
were just banned yesterday with troops
and demonstrations and killings they do
condemn the September 11th atrocities
but they also remember very
well their own suffering our hands which
vastly exceeds anything that took place
in September 11th horrible is that was
and they still live under harsh military
rule that relies crucially on US support
at every possible level that means
military support and also silence which
is major support for atrocities in
Central America and down the region the
again if you read the press the
atrocities of September 11th were
condemned but with with memories so in
Panama for example one of the least
affected countries the press condemned
the September 11th bombings the way
everybody else did tragedies everyone
else did but point it out we're not
unfamiliar with it and they referred to
operation just cause George Bush the
first who invaded Panama and in one
bombing raid attacking a poor body Howe
a slum barrio Judea
according to the Panamanians killed a
couple of thousand people in one raid
well we don't know anything about that
since again it's our crime so don't look
at it
but the Panamanian estimates are
approximately three thousand people
killed in one bombing raid in operation
just cause which was you'll recall an
operation undertaken to kidnap kind of a
minor thug whose crime was disobedience
not criminality carried out plenty of
criminal act he was kidnapped brought to
the United States after the u.s. me two
Security Council resolutions and carried
out a few actions like the one I just
described he was tried sentenced he's
now in jail for crimes that he committed
while he was on the CIA payroll almost
entirely but that's the Panamanians
remember that we don't and
they remember it when they condemned the
crimes of September 11th in Nicaragua
the Journal of the research Journal of
the Jesuit University which is the main
research journal in Central America they
condemned the bombings and the
atrocities of the World Trade Center and
Pentagon in September 11th as Arment
they said to be called Armageddon but we
too have remember our own excruciating
Armageddon which left tens of thousands
of people dead devastated the country
never recover sort of going down far
below ever since the u.s. took it over
again in 1990s now the second poorest
country in the hemisphere after Haiti
which also remembers a number of things
for example they remember that they've
been the target of most US intervention
military intervention in the 20th
century and are now the poorest country
in the hemisphere they also remember
that right in the midst of all the furor
about the unwillingness of the Taliban
to hand over alleged criminals suspected
criminals and meaning that we have a
right to bomb them because they don't
want to hand these people over to us
that we refuse to provide any evidence
and refused to consider their offers of
negotiation right while all this was
going on
Haiti renewed its requests for the
extradition a formal extradition of a
leading war criminal
amano al constant who's happily living
in New York he's he was the head of the
paramilitary forces that were
responsible for killing maybe four or
five thousand people in the 1990s under
a military junta which was in fact
supported by Bush number one and Clinton
and they've sentenced him in absentia
there's no problem in this case about
finding evidence or finding the
perpetrator but the u.s. won't extradite
him nor will the press even report it
because it's so insignificant four or
five thousand black people and the
probably the reason why the u.s. refuses
to extradite him everyone presumes is
that if he is brought to Haiti and tried
in person he'll spill the beans on his
CIA connections during the period of the
in which he was Russian running the
atrocities that's better to keep that
quiet even though it's not really all
that controversial well it's really easy
to continue you know stop but this we
could go on for hours like this these
differences are you know it really takes
discipline not to see them they are so
overwhelmingly transparent and the fact
that they are literally unmentioned is
again a major tribute to our educational
institutions it takes have to give them
credit for being able to create people
like us me too
you know go through these things and
come out well trained so as not to see
things that are so glaringly obvious and
so humanly significant you know it's not
like missing some triviality we're
talking about things of extraordinary
importance
well that's international terrorism if
we want to peer down that abyss and
that's what we'll see if we look there
with our eyes open but let me just
continue a little turn over to the
Middle East again that was Central
America after September 11th some of the
press particularly The Wall Street
Journal did do what they should have
done they began investigating opinion in
the in the region to find out why people
they were trying to find out the answer
to George
bushes plaintiff question why do they
hate us when we're so good you know
alright so within actually before even
before I asked the question the Wall
Street Journal had provided some of the
answers they did do what they should
have done they did a investigation of
opinions in the region now they kept to
the people they care about so they had a
it was what they called money Muslims
meaning bankers lawyers managers of
branches of US Corp transnationals that
kind of people people are right inside
the u.s. system and of course naturally
despise some have been Laden because
there is main targets they're the ones
he's after so they don't like it and in
that group you can't what's their
opinion about the United States well
turns out they're they're very
antagonistic to US policy though they're
in the main policies they're just part
of the international economic policies
but what they what they object to is the
fact that the United States has
consistently opposed a democracy
independent development sporting corrupt
brutal regimes is that they're naturally
strongly opposed to the unilateral US
support for the Israeli military
occupation which is very harsh and
Brittles now in its 35th year strongly
opposed the US sanctions against Iraq
which they understand perfectly well and
you know to so go into it are
devastating the population but
strengthening Saddam Hussein and they
remember another thing that we like to
forget that the United States and
Britain supported him right through his
worst atrocities help them continue to
help them develop weapons of mass
destruction didn't see anything wrong
with gas and Kurds or anything else they
remember that even if we choose to sweep
it under the carpet and for reasons like
that they say they a lot of hatred of US
policies despite the fact that they're
right in the middle of
the entire us system well that's one
answer to George Bush's question it's
not the kind of answer you read and most
of the intellectual journals and the
press and so on there you read
sophisticated answers about how people
of that region have bad cultures or they
left out by globalization or they you
know can't stand their freedoms and
their magnificence and so on so for
anyone who is seriously concerned with
these issues certainly anyone who's a
specialist than International Affairs or
the Middle East knows that there's
nothing new about these answers you can
go way back and find them as far back as
you want to go one of the good places to
look one of the advantages of living
here is that the United States has
become over the years of very free
country not a gift from the gods but as
a result of plenty of popular struggle
it's become unusually free country
uniquely so in some respects we have
more information about us high-level US
policy planning then you can find about
any country in the world that I know
about tons of Declassified material
which old shows how policy is being
conducted and what the thinking is well
obvious place to look if you want to
find out more about this is the records
for 1958 the reason is that 1958 was a
critical year in u.s. international
affairs for a lot of reasons explain it
later if you like
but in particular with regard to the
Middle East is a critical year because
it was the first year in which some
country namely Iraq had been able to
break out of the anglo-american
condominium over the world's energy
resources he ran at tried conservative
nationalist regime but they were there
there was a military coup that of us
British military coup that overthrew it
Iraq actually broke out and that was a
huge issue the flurry of activity
military forces all over the place alma
came to nuclear weapons it was enormous
issue so if you want to understand what
the US was thinking about you look back
to those records well if you do you find
that President Eisenhower into an
internal discussion observed to his
staff his words that there's a campaign
of hatred against us in the Middle East
not by governments but by the people and
there was discussion about this to the
National Security Council the highest
planning body gave their analysis they
said that there is the reason is that
there's a perception in the region that
the United States is supporting harsh
and brutal and corrupt regimes and is
blocking democratization and development
and is doing so because of our interest
in controlling the oil reserves of the
region and they said it's difficult to
counter this perception because it's
accurate and not only is it not only is
it accurate but it should be accurate it
said it is natural for us to support
status quo governments meaning the kind
I just described and to prevent
democracy and development because we
want to maintain control over the energy
resources of the region so there's a
campaign of hatred against us by the
people and that's the reason for it
essentially the same is what the Wall
Street Journal discovered on September
14th and anybody knew in between the
only difference is that of course some
of the specific policies like the
sanctions against Iraq or knew and so on
but the general policies are the same
and they're talking about the people not
just what money
Muslims and among the people there's a
much deeper resentment because they
don't see any particular reason why the
wealth of the region should flow to the
west and to the moneyed Muslims
but who are cooperating with the west
and not to them the kind of backward
cultures as you read and this idea
somehow
penetrated their minds and still hasn't
so there's an even deeper campaign of
hatred among the people who aren't
moneyed Muslims in the middle of the
u.s. system so if you want to listen to
some voices outside the cocoon it's not
hard to hear them and they'll answer the
questions about why there's a campaign
of hatred against us whether it's now or
in 1958 and in a good part of the rest
of the world where people just don't
enjoy being ground to dust under
somebody's boot I don't like it leads to
hatred you can avoid you know you can
indulge and the fantasies if you like
but that's a choice you certainly don't
have to well there's a lot more to say
about this but let me put these top
relatively topical issues aside and look
at some other things a couple of weeks
ago you read certainly the front page
stories on George Bush's current whishes
Nuclear Posture review the and that was
kind of interesting it wasn't
interesting because of the content there
was almost nothing new and the content
what was interesting is that it was
reported now that had been leaked and
reported and since the content is
essentially the same as everything
preceded which was already public or not
reported one wants to know why was it
suddenly leaked and reported and here we
can only speculate but my guess is that
there probably are people inside the
administration who aren't happy about
the fact that certified lunatics have
their hand very close to the button some
of them some of them you may actually
have run into honest answer
[Applause]
there have been a number of leaks
recently which kind of suggests that
there's a concern that you know things
may really get out of hand even from the
point of view of elite interests anyway
that's a guess what is not a guess is
that the content of the Nuclear Posture
review as far as it was revealed is
pretty much the same as the preceding 10
years right after the end of the Cold
War you know when the Berlin Wall fell
and no more Russians there was there
were quickly discussions of tactical
changes to deal with the new situation
some of it was public and what's public
is really sufficient into natural again
but sufficient to gain an understanding
of what's happening and where we're
heading and some other misses into which
we might appear much deeper ones than
international terrorism in this case the
first conclusion which was correct by
the Joint Chiefs was that the u.s. is no
longer facing what is called technically
a a weapons rich environment Russia is a
weapons rich environment you know
particular place ton of weapons we're
not facing that any longer we're now
facing a target-rich environment that is
the rest of the world which is a lot of
targets but not many weapons so we have
to switch planning from a weapons rich
environment to a target-rich environment
in fact the target-rich environment had
always been the focus of military action
but under the pretext that we were
protecting ourselves from the weapons
rich environment now that's gone the
pretext is gone and also the deterrent
is gone that was understood right away
that opens up lots of new opportunities
it does require new pretexts and new
tactics the preet the pretexts now
couldn't be any longer that the
basically the plans remained more or
less the same
except that you can out shift to many
nooks you know little nuclear weapons
that you can use against you know places
that aren't weapons rich what's called
adaptive planning new techniques for
dealing with small countries that you
want to destroy and the and the
description changed the pre takes
changed so by March 19 March 1990 just a
couple of months after the fall of the
Berlin Wall the public documents of the
first Bush administration explained
publicly wasn't reported but it was
public that in their presentations to
Congress about the Pentagon why we have
to have the same old Pentagon system
even though there's no more Russians
they explained that the reason now is
not that the Russians are coming
but it's the technological
sophistication of third world countries
that's the phrase that's why we need all
this stuff and we also have to target
any country that's capable of producing
weapons of mass destruction well if you
over to the chemistry department and
Stanford they'll explain to you that any
country that has a high school with a
chemistry lab is capable of producing
weapons of mass destruction so and those
are the countries we have to go after
and that is target-rich and in fact as
for intervention forces our major
intervention forces had always been
focused at the Middle East huge system
goes from Guam to the Azores all Diego
Garcia and in the ocean all aimed at the
Middle East it's been true for years has
to stay that way the only thing that's
different is the reason as the Bush
presentation said we have they have to
focus those intervention forces at the
Middle East quoting where the threat to
our interests that required military
intervention could not be laid at the
Kremlin's door so sorry we've been lying
to you for 50 years but now we got to
tell you the truth
it couldn't be laid at the Kremlin
door that's not the threat to our
interest the threat was indigenous it's
indigenous nationalism independence with
efforts at independence what's called
radical nationalism and the technical
technical literature that's why we need
the intervention forces notice that the
threat couldn't be laid at Saddam
Hussein's door either because this was
March 1990 and he was still a great
friend and ally of George Bush in fact
just then Bush with Bush number one had
sent a high-level senatorial delegation
headed by Bob Dole to visit Saddam and
bring the president's good wishes and
assure him that if he heard some
negative criticism from US reporters
it's just that some of these guys are
out of line and this Free Press business
makes it hard to shut him up but he
doesn't pay attention to him anyway it
wasn't hearing very much but the lowly
might have heard they can sort of forget
about that's when the threat to our
interests was not laid at the Kremlin's
door obviously Iraq's well then comes
preparation technical preparation for
what they call small-scale conflict a
small-scale small as a relative notion I
mean they may be small for us but
they're not small for the victims like
there's nothing small about the
terrorists war against Nicaragua from
their point of view or El Salvador
Guatemala or hey and on down a long list
small from our point of view well let me
give you some of the flavor of the
Clinton era documents which are worth
listening to and you might compare them
with the current Nuclear Posture review
says the this is Clinton the United
States should have a bit this I'm this
Strategic Command you know the highest
level part of the Pentagon that deals
with strategic weapons Stratcom this is
from a crucial document of theirs which
was gotten on the Freedom of Information
Act a couple years ago called essentials
of post war post Cold War deterrence
so major thinking about how to carry out
what's called deterrence deterrence of
course means a
on the in the post-war period and it
says the US should have available the
full range of responses but nuclear
weapons are the most important of these
because unlike chemical or biological
weapons the extreme destruction from a
nuclear explosion is immediate with few
if any palliatives to reduce its effect
and then it says though we are not
likely goodness for that we're not
likely to use nuclear weapons in less
than matters of the greatest national
importance or in less than extreme
circumstances they have to be available
all the time because they cast their
shadow over any crisis or conflict and
we have to have them then there's a
section called maintaining ambiguity and
it says it's important that planners
should not be too rational about
determining what the opponent value is
the most it all has to be targeted
it hurts to portray ourselves as two
fully rational and cool-headed that the
United States may become irrational and
vindictive if it's vital interests are
attacked should be part of the national
persona we project it's beneficial for
our strategic posture if some elements
may appear to be potentially out of
control and it goes on to say if this
sounds familiar it's not an accident
nuclear weapons seem destined to be the
centerpiece of US strategic deterrence
for this foreseeable future we must
therefore reject any no first use policy
there never has been one but we must not
Institute one we make it clear that our
reaction may either be response or
pre-emptive actually that notion of
pre-emptive reaction is an interesting
one which tells you what deterrence
means so we have to have pre-emptive
reaction we
means undermining the stated goal of the
non-proliferation treaty and we should
not agree to any so-called negative
security assurances that ban the use of
nuclear weapons against non-nuclear
states that are parties to the treaty
all of this apparently been confirmed by
Clinton's internal Nuclear Posture
review parts of which have been
Declassified and subsequent presidential
directives so that's that's the old
Nuclear Posture stand and the new one is
not very different interesting question
is why it was suddenly publicized heard
my guess for the future we also have to
face for ourselves now back to terrorism
the fact that small nukes can be
smuggled into any country including the
United States with no difficulty there's
a recent high-level technical report
quoting it which says well-planned
operations to smuggle weapons of mass
destruction into the United States would
have at least a 90% probability of
success much higher than ICBM delivery
so that raises the question what's
missile defense about if those threats
are so enormous and the answer is the
missile defense program does have an
effect on existing threats namely it
enhances them and furthermore that's
understood it's not a secret so much of
the fuss about ballistic missile defense
these days is criticism about whether
it'll work
so critics say it's not going to work
too easy to fool it but I think they're
missing the point it's much more
dangerous if it looks like it might work
it's enough for it to look as though it
might work because in this kind of
deadly game appearance and reality are
the same thing nobody can take a chance
so it looks like it might work
adversaries potential adversaries are
going to have to interpret the system as
if it would work they have to just as we
would if it was inverted
and US intelligence has been very clear
about the consequences they point out
have four years as Clinton years that if
the u.s. deploys a system that looks
realistic that's going on quoting now
that'll Intel China to develop new
nuclear-armed missiles expanding its
arsenal tenfold probably with Merv's
multiple warheads prompting India and
Pakistan to respond with their own build
ups that then leads to a ripple effect
throughout the Middle East in same
intelligence officials predict that
Russia and China both would increase
proliferation including selling
countermeasures to such nations as North
Korea Iran and Iraq and Syria they also
point out that Russia's only rational
response to the National missile defense
system would be to maintain and
strengthen the existing Russian nuclear
force that's the analysis of US
intelligence about deploying a system
that has even a likelihood of working
the Bush administration agrees they
announced on September 1st that they
have no objection to John Breen quoting
from the press now they have no
objection to China's plans to build up
its small fleet of nuclear missiles
that's shifting policy pretty sharply in
the hope of getting Chinese acquiescence
to the then plan now implemented a
demolition of the ABM Treaty for similar
reasons that Clinton Clinton's
negotiators had already encouraged
Russia to adopt it's called a launch on
warning strategy computerized strategy
that says you know if it's some computer
sense as a danger send off the missiles
they Clinton negotiators had urged
Russia to do that reason the same reason
to try to get them to acquiesce to
programs were carrying out some experts
nuclear experts who were asked about
this regarded it as in their words
pretty bizarre because we know that the
there
computerized systems are deteriorating
there warning systems are deteriorating
and full of holes prone to false alarms
that increases the threat of Russian
unauthorised accidental or erroneous
launches meaning destruction we're
finished and that increases the threat
the administration also announced plans
to number first again to share detailed
information on its missile defense
programs with China that's going to
enhance China's capacity to overcome any
u.s. systems and also to transfer
information to others who have similar
concerns about being targeted strategic
analysts point out that that change of
policy encourages China to aim more
nuclear-armed missile missiles at the
United States and Japan with the
expected effect on Japanese and
Taiwanese programs as well as India and
then onwards same day that all this was
reported the national press also
reported independently that the US would
impose was about to impose sanctions on
China for allowing the transfer to
Pakistan of missile parts and technology
that are essentially for weapons that
can carry nuclear warheads it's all
happening at the same time the clearly
the and it's understood programs like
missile defense increased the danger of
destruction for the United States and
for others but that's just not important
and furthermore it's not new that's the
whole history of that's military history
including the history of the arms race
for the last 50 years so just think
about that 50 years ago around 1950
there was only one of the u.s. had an
overwhelming security but there was a
potential threat on the horizon didn't
exist yet but it might come into
existence that was ICBMs with
thermonuclear or
inter-country they weren't around but
it's an hour later they would come
around
what was the react you know everybody
knew that's the that is a real potential
threat to the United States how is it
dealt with well there's a history of the
standard history the arms race by
McGeorge Bundy he was Kennedy Johnson
national security adviser yet access to
internal records and so on and he writes
in his history that he could find no
record of any interest even any interest
in pursuing the possibility of banning
these things which the Russians probably
would have accepted they were so far
behind and so much more threatened by
them but there's every possibility they
would have agreed to a treaty that
banned them but there was never any
interest in this even though it was the
only potential threat to the United
States and a non-trivial threat
Eisenhower once pointed out that a
nuclear war would destroy the northern
hemisphere
that was a threat but there was no
interest in trying to even move towards
negotiations that might deter it the
fact of the matter is that if you really
look over history including our own the
threats threats to survival are
considered quite marginal ranked rather
low on the value scale as compared with
others like enhancing global dominance
that's a kind of a constant throughout
history the difference today is the
scale of the threat which is significant
well there's a lot of as you know lots
of Russian archives have been coming out
people are poring over them to see if
they can find some justification for us
cold war policies and there's not much
but there is some interesting material
coming out some one of part of what's
coming out of the Russian archives is a
confirmation of what had already been
discussed by US strategic analysts some
of them from inside the intelligence
community and the Pentagon who left and
have described that now it's confirmed
by the Russian arc
the basic story is that confirmed now by
the archival sources on both sides is
that after Stalin's death
well after Khrushchev took over mid 50s
his view was that the United States and
his words was using the arms race to
destroy the far weaker Soviet economy
and by that means to obtain its goals
even without war point is everyone else
knew the US economy is far larger if the
u.s. runs a extensive arms race and the
Russians try to keep up it will destroy
their economy and Khrushchev understood
that that's US policy he therefore over
these strong objections of his own
military command we now know this from
Russian sources he initiated a sharp
reduction in Soviet offensive military
forces and called on the United States
to reciprocate well the Eisenhower
administration considered it then
rejected it but the death blow to this
was given by the Kennedy administration
at that point first chef made really
sharp cuts called for reciprocity it was
discussed internally and rejected I'll
just quote from the leading scholarly
study of the archival records on both
sides by Matthew evangelist he points
out that the Kennedy refusal and their
choice instead of a huge escalation of
offensive armaments he said that drove
the last nail into the coffin of
Khrushchev's agenda of restraining the
Soviet military he was kicked out soon
after that and the arms race picks up
and goes on that's confirmed by internal
u.s. sources now we have it from both
sides the Soviet reaction to the Kennedy
escalation and rejection of these
efforts also terminated Khrushchev's
reformist programs internally they might
have averted in fact it's not impossible
they would have heard as this whole
social and economic catastrophes for the
first of all a stagnation of the so V
from the 1960s which was a result of
this and the immense human catastrophe
of the past decade which is almost
historically without precedent as well
as the destruction of Afghanistan all
kind of other atrocities not to speak of
the very serious danger of nuclear
destruction has come very close in the
past 40 years but all of that was
evidently regarded as a kind of
secondary concern by the Kennedy
planners and their predecessors and
indeed their successors well without
going on with this there isn't any real
novelty in the Clinton and Bush
preferences you look over time the
correlation between security policies
and concern for security is very weak
it's historically the case it's the case
now the so what's the ballistic missile
defense for well the first thing to bear
in mind about it is that everyone takes
it to be an offensive weapon not a
defensive weapon and that's a kind of
doctrinal truism when you hear the word
defense you interpret it as meaning
offense and in this case it's assumed
that that's assumed both by adversaries
and by advocates so for example the
these plans have of course been
escalated all of them not just the
missile defense plans but the much
bigger plans for militarization of space
of which they're a small component they
were escalated very sharply after
September 11th the Bush administration
saw kind of a window of opportunity for
its kind of exploit the fear and the
concerns of the population and the
demands for patriotism meaning you
showed up to sharply escalate its own
agenda on everything including a major
attack against the population destroying
social welfare systems you know about
this I don't have to go into it but also
vastly expanding the militarization
programs including the space
militarization programs which they know
perfectly well pose a very severe danger
far beyond it
national terrorism to the existence of
not only the United States but in this
case the human species the as I said
even the small component that's missile
defense is understood to be an offensive
weapon
so China for example says just says what
everybody knows when they observe the
top officials that once the United
States believes it has both a strong
spear and a strong shield it could lead
them to conclude that nobody can harm
the United States and they can harm
anybody they like anywhere in the world
well the US RAND Corporation the top
military analysis agency they agree in
the same words virtually they point out
that ballistic missile defense I'm
quoting is not simply a shield but an an
enabler of US action and the logic is
obvious you have a shield the other
spear it's pretty obvious the n
strategic analysts agree so kind of at
the right end of the spectrum and the
Journal of national interest well-known
analyst Andrew bacevich writes that by
insulating the homeland from reprisal
missile defense will underwrite the
capacity and willingness of the United
States to shape the environment
elsewhere and he cites approvingly a
commentator from the liberal end of the
spectrum the opposite end
Lawrence Kaplan and the New Republic who
says missile defense isn't really meant
to protect America it's a tool for
global dominance it's about preserving
America's ability to wield power abroad
it's not about defense it's about
offense and that's exactly why we need
it he says it'll provide the United
States with absolute freedom in using or
threatening to use force in
international relations he Kaplan the
New Republic repeats China's complaint
which he thinks is correct then he
proved
of it namely that it will give the
United States the opportunity to do it
it wants it will in his words cement us
hegemony and make Americans masters of
the world and that's the way things
should be and for exactly that reason he
says liberal critics are missing the
point they have things exactly backwards
he says the missile defense will
facilitate the kind of interventions
that liberals champion and therefore
they should applaud it right you get the
logic I don't have to explain it well
there's kind of a background to this if
you read the same authors other than
many others they explain further that
there's good reason why we should be in
favor of American hegemony the reason is
that history has a natural course and
the United States represents the
realization of history's purpose so
there I'm quoting and therefore US
domination is kind of by logic
beneficial to the rest of the world if
you think is anything new about this you
haven't studied the right history
courses they're just repeating what was
said by leading British intellectuals
people like John Stuart Mill and others
at the peak when Britain joyed it's day
and the Sun and the same is true of they
find the same among lesser aspirants for
the prize that standard whoever you are
the leading intellectuals explain that
you represent history's purpose and is
therefore beneficial if you rule the
world that's elementary and therefore if
we have a system that allows us to
exercise the Gemini and rule the world
that's in everybody's interest and in
fact realizes history's purpose these
are the hard-headed realists I'm not
talking about the sentimental types the
now there is a kind of a problem about
missile defense kind of like a technical
paradox which you can see discussed in
the you know even in journals like say
Foreign Affairs main estab
Journal the problem is that missile
defense relies on satellites and
satellites are very easy to shoot down
they're much easier to shoot them than
missiles
you know missiles you know where they're
going and you know anything else
satellites they're right there you can
track them shooting down satellites it's
kind of like a poor man's technology so
how can you have if we destroy as we
already have the anti ABM and treaties
well that means anti-satellite weapons
are now legitimate and that undermines
the possibility of missile defense so
there's kind of like a paradox but
there's an answer the paradox is it's at
least in some imagined world there's an
answer the answer is what's called full
spectrum dominance
now that means such overwhelming
superiority over everyone else that
nobody can even use the poor man's
weapon because we will have offensive
weapons in space here's where the rest
of the story comes in will have
offensive weapons in space of extreme
destructive power
probably nuclear-powered because there's
no other way to get that much energy up
there and they'll be ready for launch
with instant computer-controlled the
reaction because can't waste any time in
these cases well that's that very much
increases the risk of total destruction
mass slaughter and destruction oh if
only because of what are called in the
trade literally normal accidents
normal accidents are the kind of
accidents that occur in any complicated
system unpredictably you know are gonna
occur you just don't know when or why I
mean anybody who has a computer tried to
install DSL or take part like I took
part today and at one point the doors
decided they weren't going to open or
something like that that kind of thing
is what's called a normal accident and
it's going to happen in any complicated
system it's even
almost provable and this kind of thing
guarantees normal accidents along the
line and that one once the first one
happens you can say goodbye that's the
end of everything
well the goals of militarization of
space in fact go way beyond this and
this is all public documents there's no
reason not to know it the Clinton
Clinton documents of the Space Command
in charge of this stuff they actually
published brochures for Pupp for public
use you know like you look at the front
page it's like a kind of thing that you
know people give the corporate
executives with big words and
underlining so the dumbest person who
can follow it that sort of thing on the
front page of the document called
there's one called vision for 2020 and
it announces the primary goal of
militarization of space namely
dominating the space dimension of
military operations to protect us
interests and investment and that's
described accurately as the next
plausible stage in a historic task so in
the Fourier on you know people develop
the countries developed armies like the
United States they said needed an army
during the westward expansion of the
continental United States which of
course was in self-defense comment about
that and nations also built navies to
protect and enhance their commercial
interests and the next logical step is
space forces quoting still to protect
u.s. national interests military and
commercial and investments that's just
normal that includes nuclear national
missile defense but also space-based
strike weapons enabling the application
of precision force from to and through
space so that's the next step beyond
navies but there's going to be different
from navies in one fresh over spec the
British could construct a huge Navy but
it could be countered like Germany could
the Navy the counters and Japan could
build a Navy and that had certain
consequences which we don't have to talk
about but this is going to be different
the reason is that the United States
will be so far in the lead so
overwhelmingly dominate a dominant in
militarization of space and placing
destructive offensive military weapons
there on on computer control will alert
that nobody will be able to counter at
least in the imagined world that will
make the u.s. immune that's one of the
reasons why we have to vastly out spend
all adversaries and allies combined and
even increase it further requires total
dominance so nothing can counter us
hegemony which remember is for the
benefit of the world by logic and the US
will then remain immune except for one
thing that very narrowly circumscribed
category of terrorism which is allowed
to enter the Canon because somebody else
does it to us well they go on
interestingly to say that this need for
talking about the military planners the
need for total dominance will increase
as a result of the globalization of the
world economy the reason is that
globalization is expected to bring about
a widening of the divide between the
haves and the have-nots
that's an assessment which is shared by
US intelligence and by US academic
specialists big study was just put out
under CIA auspices which the whole
intelligence agencies with outside
academic experts and others called it's
a planning for the next 15 years and
their conclusion is that globalization
should proceed on course though its
evolution will be rocky marked by
chronic financial volatility which
instantly translates into lower lower
slower growth and more suffering for the
majority and also widening a can
davai okay that's the prediction if
everything works right you know slower
growth and a widening economic divide of
the military planners make the same
assessment and they are concerned that
the widening divide is going to lead to
unrest among the have-nots
you know the growing numbers of
have-nots and that of course requires
that the US has the force to control it
as you quoting them using Space Systems
and planning for precision strike from
space as a counter to the worldwide
proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction by unruly elements which is
a predictable consequence of the
recommended programs and is pretty easy
in the future just as the widening
divide is an expected consequence of the
preferred form of globalization and
notice that that's counter to the
economic theories that are professed
right according to the economic theories
that you study at the Stanford
globalization is supposed to lead to a
single market right that's the measure
of international integration but what's
expected is exactly the opposite and
then it's going to lead to a widening
divide which is correct for the form of
globalization that is intended it's not
international economic integration it's
a particular form of corporate oriented
and globalization which is sometimes
described honestly so like The Wall
Street Journal describes what would have
presented publicly as free trade
agreements they call them free
investment agreements and that's correct
that kind of globalization you expect to
reduce globalization and the technical
sense but to increase it in the
doctrinally preferred sense with much
slower growth which has been a
characteristic of the past 25 years
anyway it's going to slow even more
because of increasing financial
volatility more suffering and a widening
divide
meaning less globalization in the sense
of an economics course but more in the
sense of reality
you know preferred doctrine at least
well they could have gone on to give
them deeper historical background that's
getting late know them do it but if you
look at the history of industrialization
history of industrial development you
discover very quickly that is since the
18th century the modern Industrial
Revolution it's been very heavily
military based that includes the
American system of mass production that
amazed the world in the 19th century
which came out of armories Springfield
Armory mainly it includes the basis of
the automotive industry century ago the
main technical problems in mechanical
and electrical engineering had to do
with things like placing a huge gun
emplacement on a moving object namely
ship and trying to set it up so it could
hit another moving object namely another
ship those were problems which are kind
of analogous to the problems of space
vehicles today and working on those
within the military system made it
possible to socialize the costs and the
risks means the public pays for them
under the military cover but then
privatize the profits if anything works
out and that's exactly what's expected
from the current space system and in
fact anyone who looks at the modern
economy knows that's how it developed so
the so-called new economy you know
computers and telecommunications and all
that kind of stuff almost entirely comes
out of the very dynamic state sector
that's why if you look at the work at
the World Trade Organization rules you
know they have a thing called a national
security exemption which means that
you're allowed to violate the rules for
national security
well national security means anything
having to do with the military and for
the United States that means the whole
cutting edge of the economy for the last
50 years and for the future and
good bit of the past and the same for
other industrial countries doesn't do
Haiti much good but for the guys who run
the world the Masters of the Universe he
does them a lot of good well throughout
history it has been understood that all
of this is very dangerous and in fact
that's we we have a history of wars that
tells us how dangerous it is what's
different now is just the scale and the
scale is qualitatively different it's
not slight differences well I'm gonna
stop there's a lot more to say about all
of this these are the some some not all
of the deep of this's into which we
ought to be peering the good side of the
story which there really is less need to
talk about because we all know it and we
don't have to congratulate ourselves on
achievements but there have been plenty
of I mentioned that we're now
commemorating the 40th anniversary of
the attack on South Vietnam without any
notice the reason there's no notice is
because there was no protest at that
point and say Berkeley or anywhere else
nobody cared if the United States was
gonna start bombing another country and
attack it with chemical warfare that's
fine
that's what we do no American president
could conceivably do anything like that
today it took years at that time before
any protest developed out of that
protest and the parallel civil rights
movement and other popular developments
big changes took place one change that
the government should the changes that
took place over the past 30 or 40 years
have made the country a lot more
civilized that couldn't conceivably have
been a meeting like this 40 years ago or
probably even 20 years ago there's been
a constant improvement places just a lot
more civilized in every lots of
dimensions you go back to the 1960s
there was no feminist movement there was
no environmental movement which meant
nobody cared with there's not going to
be in you
if there won't be a environment in which
our grandchildren could survive just
wasn't an issue there were no solidarity
movements no mass anti-nuclear movement
no anti-apartheid movement no
anti-sweatshop movements no movements
opposing international economic
integration of the investor rights style
which was already going on nothing no I
mean it's something but not very much
kind of marginal now it's enormous
furthermore it's worldwide the
particularly with regard to
international economic integration the
what's ludicrously called globalization
that our free trade or one of these
other propaganda terms that's opposition
of that has been going on extensively in
the south like in Brazil and in India
for years for decades in fact finally in
the last couple of years that hit the
North in Seattle that's why you
constantly read and when it's in the
north you can't ignore it like it's just
hundreds of thousands of Indian peasants
and so on you can kind of pretend it's
not happening but when you see it in the
streets of Seattle it's happening so
therefore that's called the beginning of
the anti-globalization movement which is
ridiculous for one thing cause it's not
opposed to globalization and nobody's
saying as opposed to that and it's not
starting in the north it's we're coming
along behind but it's a good thing
because it's the first time ever ever
that there has been a real international
the beginnings of a real international
that's what's been the core ideal of the
the left and the working-class movement
since their beginning of since their
beginning in the 19th century and this
is the first seeds of it in Porto Alegre
in Brazil
a month ago it was very impressive 60 70
thousand people from all over the world
South North every possible you know
peasants worker
environmentalists all kinds of activists
essentially working on the same things
and very seriously I mean the
descriptions in the press which are
comical are comical because they're
terrified they're terrified of what's
going on
and rightly what's going on our
substantial popular movements which are
completely unprecedented and scale are
growing out of the changes that have
been taking place over the past few
decades continues a historical course I
mean there's been a long struggle to
attain more more rights more democratic
control and it's continuing and probably
accelerating and it's a tendency running
counter to the tendency towards
destruction and exactly which curve is
going to move up faster will determine
the fate of the species that question is
pretty much in the hands of people like
you
[Applause]
we're gonna give professor Chomsky a
couple of moments to catch his breath
and write his next book and then we'll
have a question and answer session as I
mentioned this is the peace and justice
Center's 20th anniversary and I know
there are a whole lot of people in this
room because we looked at the ticket
orders who are not members of the peace
and justice center we're going to take
just a couple of minutes to tell you
about the peace and justice center and
what a little bit of that history is how
the peace and justice center fits into
this movement that Professor Chomsky was
just talking about to do this I'd like
to introduce Peggy Laws she's the
executive director the national radio
project the national radio project
produces a weekly half-hour program
that's distributed for free to community
radio stations all around the country
150 stations putting on the air the
voices of people who need to be heard
and aren't and who are normally
overlooked by the mainstream media
please welcome Peggy long
I'm not going to take up very much time
because I know you want to get to the
questions and answers but I didn't want
to say that I've been a supporter of the
peace and justice center for a couple of
decades and there's a reason for that
when I look at the world that our
children and our grandchildren are
growing into my own in yours it's not a
very hopeful place and the peninsula
peace and justice center is one of the
places that brings that hope professor
Chomsky spoke tonight about the crimes
that we never hear about and at the
center there are people who dare day in
and day out to name the crimes to say
them out loud to bring them to the
streets to educate to mobilize a place
where people can hold one another close
when they think that the only ones in
the world and around them or in their
families or in their workplaces who are
thinking differently and they're not
alone and they've done it now for twenty
years they have done it when we were
committing crimes in Central America and
they got representative Tom Campbell one
of only five Republicans to vote to stop
aid to El Salvador they did it when the
guns quieted a bit in Central America
and the new or not new weapon but the
next weapon was economics that it was
NAFTA and then GATT and the World Trade
Organization those crimes and the
peninsula peace and justice center had
people in the streets when the Gulf War
came those of you who were here then
5,000 people in the Palo Alto streets
and then 200,000 in San Francisco the
Venessa peace and justice center being
one of the main leaders of that
coalition that was a big moment in our
family we had three generations in the
streets and a young granddaughter
puzzled and puzzled as to what all this
was looking through a three-year-old
eyes and then she looked up and she said
I got it
I think our leader needs a
I'm out that gift for her would not have
been there if the Venise peninsula peace
and justice center had not been there it
would not have been a place where she
could be with others who were thinking
and puzzling it out and has changed her
life and in many ways changed ours and
it's not just looking overseas that's
looking here into our own communities
because it's a peninsula peace and
justice center that asks the questions
about the race and class bias in the
obscene crime of the death penalty and
those pastors are piece going to Cuba
women in black demonstrating against the
violence in the Middle East against a
Palestinian people here in Palo Alto it
has been continuously including a couple
of days ago and this is where the
movement building is professor Chomsky
referred to the hope the hope is here
locally is here in an institution of
hope in our own communities called the
peninsula peace and justice center is
movement building here it is moving
building many of you are part of it is
movement building which is growing and I
ask you now to reach for your Wallis I
ask you to reach for your checkbooks and
right Peninsula peace and justice center
or PP JC on them because I invite you to
think of your own lives and the lives of
your children and the lives of your
grandchildren and a place of hope and a
place of naming the crimes and a place
of building the movement for a better
world the world we all want to see and
deserve and right here locally this is
what you can do so thank you to the
pinnace of peace and justice center for
making all of that possible and tonight
possible because tonight would not have
been possible
so the buckets are coming and I'd be
proud to put in the first check thanks a
lot
[Applause]
thank you very much Peggy for the
question-and-answer session since we are
filming here tonight and we have the
peace and justice Center zone video crew
here plus a documentary crew visiting
from Japan who are doing a feature
documentary on Professor Chomsky if they
want to talk to you afterwards it's okay
that's what the camera in your face is
but since we are putting it on video
we'd like you to come up to the
microphones on either side for your
questions so we can get your questions
on tape that helps everybody in the
audience hear the questions as well so
we invite you to come up to the
microphones as people are getting lined
up for the questions let me just give
you a real quick rundown of some events
coming up there are Flyers for all of
these out on the tables our 20th
anniversary dinner celebration dinner
who is coming up on May 5th Norman
Solomon the great media critic and media
analyst will be our keynote speaker
there we have free monthly forums first
Tuesday of every month next month is
david bacon the labor correspondent for
KPFA the peace and justice center is
going to be hosting at the end of May
the third national organizing conference
on Iraq
we are expecting representatives from
nearly a hundred grassroots
organizations from around the nation to
gather here on the peninsula to plan a
strong strategy to oppose the coming war
on Iraq we're going to need your help
we're going to need your couches your
floors your extra rooms to house these
activists we need your help to drive
people back and forth to the conference
and and from the airport get one of
these orange flyers and give us a call
and volunteer and get directly involved
in the effort to stop the coming war
against Iraq we offer free these classes
for free and Doug will tell you some
interesting stories if maybe a little
elastic with the truth of his adventures
with Noam Chomsky in Vietnam for example
wonderful storyteller two events coming
up that we aren't organizing directly
but we certainly
are endorsing and strongly urge you to
attend next Wednesday at noon in San
Francisco a Jewish Voice for Peace will
be launching their campaign to suspend
US military aid to Israel Passover
liberation rally I love that a Passover
liberation rally Wednesday March 27th 12
noon at the UN Plaza in San Francisco
there are Flyers for that out there and
of course the national mobilization in
Washington DC and San Francisco we meet
hundreds of thousands of people walking
in the streets April 20th marching
against the real axis of evil war racism
and poverty join us in all these and
other coming activities and now I invite
your questions and I ask professor
Chomsky to come back up here
[Applause]
okay I don't think first of all I don't
think what happened was racism
particularly it's just that that didn't
matter much remember he was talking
about what happened in Rwanda in 1994
but that's been going on in Burundi and
Rwanda for years I mean hidden Herman
and I wrote a book 20 years ago over 23
years ago in which we discussed that
Hutu Tutsi atrocities in Burundi and
Rwanda which in which hundreds of
thousands of people were killed nobody
cared then and nobody cares now just
like in the last just in the last two or
three years probably several million
people have been killed in in the Congo
and you know it doesn't really matter it
doesn't affect the Western interests so
you don't try to do anything about it
but they can be any color you know any
religion doesn't really matter the
principle is does it affect US interest
if you take a look at the Kurds who I
was talking about I'm their Aryan you
know if anybody cares if they walked
around the streets we'd say more Aryans
maybe slightly darker skin but we
wouldn't notice but if a couple if they
get slaughtered that's fine because in
fact in that case notice it's not like
the layer he's talking about something
bad namely
our unwillingness to do anything to stop
atrocities but much worse than that you
know in comparably worse is their
willingness to participate in atrocities
like it would have been much worse if we
had not only not done anything about
that but in fact put the going ahead and
continued to put the guns in the hands
of the murderers as they were committing
murder I'd be a little cautious on the
kind of statement he's making is correct
but that's the kind that's tolerable so
for example if you take a look at the
New York Review of Books this week
there's a passionate article by the head
of the Carr Center for Human Rights at
the Kennedy School of Harvard which is
talking discussing you know their tragic
failure to pay attention to atrocities
that other people are committing and to
do something about them and some
profound and flaw in our character okay
it's a problem but a much more serious
problem like orders of magnitude more
serious which is not mentioned in the
article and which would be
unintelligible if it were mentioned is
the fact that we pay very close
attention to atrocities and intervene to
escalate them and often even applaud
them a case of Turkey is only one case
no no such examples are mentioned in the
article and couldn't be if you wrote an
article about that you wouldn't get it
published and if you did and nobody
would understand that at least nobody
was a good education and that's the
important I mean you know it's yeah it's
bad to overlook the crimes that are
committed by others and not to do enough
about them but it's much worse and far
more important to look into the mirror
and look what you you're doing yourself
and do something about that so yeah I
kind of agree with him but it seems to
me a bad problem but small on the scale
of moral responsibilities or human
consequences
also thank you country and it seems like
in this room there are a lot of people
who are very focused on the action and
in light of what you said perhaps one of
the actions that we have is divestiture
in the companies that are sponsoring the
SP the proliferation of weapons that are
helping to create and build the ethnic
tension and create atrocities after
atrocity so I wanted to ask you whether
this subject of divestiture work
actually in this realm has been
discussed elsewhere yeah it's being
discussed I mean it surely has been and
should be and sometimes it's a it's a I
mean it's it's you know it's it it's
it's a tactical question by which I
don't mean a minor question that a huge
question of huge significance it's the
tactical questions that have human
consequences but these are delicate
judgments like you have to try to figure
out what's the consequence of carrying
out this act under existing
circumstances and who will you reach and
how will people understand that and will
it be the basis for an organizing effort
that will go on to something else and so
on those are hard judgments and I
certainly don't trust my own about
assessment of them no reason why you
should but yea such campaigns have been
have sometimes been successful in the
case of South Africa there were similar
campaigns and they had an effect on US
policy
remember what US policy was this is one
of the things that swept under the rug
so living in 1988 okay not that long ago
Nelson Mandela's African National
Congress was a terrorist or an
officially designated
first organization in fact worse than
that the State Department listed it as
one of the more notorious terrorist
organizations in the same year 1988
South Africa was welcomed as a favored
ally just in the reagan-bush years alone
in 1980s South Africa had killed about a
million and a half people in the
surrounding countries not inside South
Africa and caused about sixty billion
dollars of damage with action supported
by the United States and Britain okay
that was 1988 okay in fact in 1987 the
United Nations passed its major
resolution condemning terrorism in all
its forms you know plague etc etc called
on all countries of the world to do
everything they could to stamp out this
terrible plague that's December 1987 it
didn't pass unanimously it was almost
unanimous at one country abstained
namely Honduras and two countries voted
against it namely the United States and
Israel which when the u.s. votes against
a resolution it disappears from it's not
reported and it disappears from history
which is what happened to the major UN
resolution against terrorism and the
two- voters explained why there was a
paragraph in the resolution which said
virtually a quote it said nothing in
this resolution shall prejudice the
right of people to struggle for freedom
and independence against racist and
colonialist regimes and foreign military
occupation and to gain support from
others in accord with the charter of the
United Nations and both the United
States and Israel had to vote against
that they both understood that the
phrase racist and colonialist regimes
refers to South Africa and that was a
valued ally while the ANC was one of the
more notorious terrorist organization
so obviously they didn't have a right to
struggle against apartheid and foreign
military occupation referred to the
Israeli military occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza which was maintained
precisely for the same reason it is now
by unilateral US intervention the US has
been blocking a diplomatic settlement of
this for over thirty years now the
process of preventing a diplomatic
settlement has a name it's called the
peace process literally the peace
process is refers to whatever the u.s.
happens to be doing very often
preventing political settlement as in
this case and in this case it's
unilateral and therefore and it's not a
pretty regime it's harsh and brutal and
has been from the beginning
still is and therefore the u.s. M Israel
had to vote against that qualification
well that was 1988 okay within a couple
of years just a few years three or four
years the United States had been
compelled to shift its position on South
Africa it had been compelled by popular
action including divestment campaigns
which didn't really affect the companies
very much but had a big symbolic effect
on undermining the u.s. u.s. actions
which went around I mean it was
technically an embargo but US trade with
South Africa increased under the embargo
because nobody's they weren't paying
attention to it for the reasons I just
mentioned but the popular campaigns
shifted it on the other case they
haven't yet shifted it but they could
and the same is and in fact there is
there are proposals for divestment
campaigns on that and on military
weapons yes definitely they have to of
course understand that when you talk
about military producers you're talking
about virtually the whole high-tech
economy okay like you can't pick out the
military producers and leave the rest as
I mentioned military production has been
the cover for almost everything you know
computers lasers telecommunications the
Automation you know you barely mention
anything all practically all of
electronics in fact if you look at
government spending you'll notice the
scientists among you will certainly know
this that in the last couple of years
spending on the biology based areas has
been rapidly increasing there's a reason
for that
every senator and guy in Congress person
in Congress no matter how right wing
they are in fact the right wingers know
it better than the rest understands that
the way the economy works is you have to
have a dynamic state sector in which the
public assumes the costs and the risks
and if anything comes out you put it
into deep corporate profits that's
what's called free enterprise when you
take an economics course that's the way
it works and the cutting edge of the
economy in the future is very likely to
be the biology based industries biotech
and genetic engineering that kind of
stuff so therefore there's be a lot more
money going into basic biology and
applications of now under the pretext of
fighting bioterrorism and that's and you
should see some of the things that are
going on under that pretext so for
example the as you know the USA should
know the the u.s. just destroyed the
international effort six-year effort to
try to set up an anti bioterrorism
treaty verification procedure for that
there was the Clinton administration was
opposed to it primarily because it did
not protect work US commercial interests
that is the interest of US
pharmaceutical and biotech companies
since the verification system might look
into there what they're up to
so the Clinton administration was
opposed but the Bush administration has
killed it it's a theory there were a
number of reasons one one I just
mentioned but there are others I turned
out that the US is violating the
treaties that already exist against
bioterrorism one of the ways it's doing
it is
by genetic engineering apparently there
there are there is an effort to
genetically engineer vaccine resistant
anthrax strains okay that's the
considered the nightmare scenario among
microbiologists to create strains of a
killer whatever it happens to be virus
bacteria whatever it is but can develop
strains that will be resistant to any
vaccine or treatment that's always been
assumed to have been banned but
apparently the US has been doing it and
there a couple of other similar projects
and that's going to go on under no
pretext of protection against
bioterrorism but the main thing we'll go
on is developing the science and
technology which will allow the biology
based industries of the future to be
dominated by the United States so when
you talk about going after weapons
producers it's a very broad category in
fact yeah you might pick up right so
that's your you're exactly right I mean
it has to be understood that these are
symbolic gestures which doesn't make
them unimportant they're symbolic but
extremely important and they can be
important if used as an educational and
organizing device that's very important
so no illusions about you're going to
shut down weapons production obviously
not that means shutting down the economy
but a very important just like in the
South African case because it's a way of
organizing and educating and it can have
big effects within a couple of years it
shifted US policy on that
as an Egyptian American I lived on both
sides of the fence but when he is each
tell you whether coming as an Egyptian
[Music]
last December had an excellent article
about the Carlyle Group and the
relationship between senior Bush and the
bin Laden's family and the defense the
floundering defense industry and how
they're pushing for war would you be
kind enough to allude to that please
about the the relations we in the Bush
family and bin Laden's and defense
industry the Lockheed Martin big
contract four hundred billion dollar
there was a it's pretty hard to find out
about this because there's been very
little investigation of it as far as I
know but I think was in it must have
been an early November there was a BBC
news program which discussed connections
between Bush and the guys around them
and the bin Laden family and efforts
alleged efforts by the Bush
administration to cut down investigation
of bin Laden's family and associates
okay that was over BBC one of their main
news programs it was over the wire
services naturally I didn't see any
reporting of it there actually I
happened to be in India at that time and
the Times of India did run a report on
it but when I got back to the United
States and tried to check up I couldn't
find anything maybe there was I didn't
really do a full database search so
maybe there was some reporting but as
far as I know there has been no further
serious investigation of them but it's
very likely I mean if anybody were to
look into say Cheney's and operations
it looks very likely I mean I don't know
enough to prove it I'm not sure enough
it around to prove it but I'll bet
anything that it's going to turn out
that Halliburton his company I was
getting a very substantial part of its
profit from iraqi oil and
oil and natural yes through various
offshore you know the companies and so
on
and as soon as you start opening this
can of worms up Enron is going to look
like no tea party but nobody unless I
suppose why nobody's looking at it
notice there's only one way to get
answers to these questions corporations
remember our totalitarian institutions
they are the most perfect tell apparent
institutions that humans have ever
created
totally totalitarian in fact their
origins their intellectual origins are
more or less the same as those of
Bolshevism and fascism go into that but
they are totalitarian institutions and
they're almost unaccountable to the
public almost not entirely Congress has
the capacity to investigate them so
Congress can subpoena records of the
totalitarian institutions and has
occasionally done so there was one major
case and most of our knowledge of
multinational corporations comes from
these this one series of enquiries
namely the Church Committee around 1975
had this is right in the wake of all the
the activism and the popular movements
and you know any war movement the whole
business there was a lot of turmoil in
the country and in that context
Frank church's Senate committee did
carry out a series of investigations of
multinational corporations many many
volumes and they're very interesting so
practically everything we know about the
energy corporations comes from the
inquiries of the multinational oil em
NOC multinational oil companies
inquiries of the Church Committee and
they could do it in this case too but
nobody else can do it I mean there's no
way for you and me to get access to the
internal records of these totalitarian
institutions they're protected from
people except through the
parliamentary inquiry congressional
enquiries so pressure on Congress could
in principle at least lead to inquiry
that could answer these questions
there's almost no other way to do it I
mean you know investigative reporting
can be pick up bits and pieces but to
really get to the heart of it you have
to be able to subpoena the basic records
that's it's kind of like you know
governments do declassified documents
not everything but at least some
governments you know at least more
governments that have been under enough
pressure so they've become more or less
free like heirs do have are to some
extent accountable to their citizens you
can get a fair amount of information
about what the government is doing to
you and incidentally most of those of
you who've worked on secret records
Declassified records will know something
which shouldn't be a secret name lose
almost nothing in them that has anything
to do with security
almost everything in them has to do with
protecting the government from scrutiny
by the public well it just take do it
careful study sometimes that's what you
find they want to protect themselves
from public scrutiny
so say take what are called clandestine
operations
who are they secret from like the not
secret from the targets obviously they
know all about them they're not secret
from the other states that are hired to
carry them out they know all about them
they're not even secrets from the media
you know they're just kind of low enough
level so you know if the report them the
main they are mainly secret from the
population in the United States that's
who they have to be kept secret from and
when the documents come out you know 30
years later that's to find out but
governments are at least to some extent
accountable to the public corporations
are not and therefore it's really hard
to pursue that it's a very important
question and hard to pursue I mean
frankly I don't think that George Bush
is going to there'll be much about him
he's too small a player he's a nothing
person but the people around him they're
important and probably there are a huge
scale
they're just barely beneath the surface
thank you
actually I did a lot of research on the
connections between Bush the CIA and
9/11 and Kevin Danaher had the idea of
demanding a congressional inquiry
because there is just so much
information all over the Internet
so I compile about three or four inches
of documents for our senators and we
marched on them in January demanding a
congressional inquiry of 9/11 and we
specifically wanted to know about Bush
and Cheney relationships with the oil
companies the drug industry's al Qaeda
and Michelle Chaucer domsky compiled
some of great articles and I just have a
stack of his new magazine global outlook
which has what he considers to be the
truth of 9/11 and shortly after that
March both Bush and Cheney asked
Congress to limit the investigations to
just the CIA's failure and how to
prevent the next terrorist attack and
just completely missing the bulk of our
questions and and what you mentioned
about the microbiologists Michael Rupert
did a lot of investigation on that and
he spoke recently in San Francisco and
we felt what was significant was that
they were targeting the United States
and trying really to criminalize dissent
in this country who is Oh with the
attack on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon look let me just tell you I
mean I've read most of that stuff and I
don't think it's credible I really don't
I think it's very unlikely that part of
it is going to be true like the
connections between Cheney and those
guys and the energy corporations that's
going to be a can of worms but the idea
that the CIA or US intelligence had
anything to do with blowing up the World
Trade Center in my opinion that's pretty
outlandish I've read chess Tedeschi
stuff and other things and I really
enjoyed Israel yeah
Oh Jared is real stuff in my opinion is
off-the-wall I don't think it counts as
evidence I mean you have to look at it
and decide for yourself but my own
judgment is that that's very low
credibility material on the internet is
a very valuable instrument but it's also
a lethal weapon you can put up anything
you like
you don't need any evidence you you can
make allegations you can refer to this
bit of data and that bit of data and you
really have to be very careful about
what you see there not that you don't
have to be careful about what you see
and you know from an affair of course
you do but here even more so but what
about the government store I mean I
think it's most preposterous I mean the
the government mainstream media
interpretation of not exactly Act I mean
okay then it was a huge surprise and it
was a devastating blow to the United
States that part is accurate I think I
disagree yeah okay I'm not saying you
should agree with me if you think the
that pictures credible then by all means
investigated but like just if you're
interested in my opinion having looked
at it it seems to me of extremely low
credibility but you know that's a
judgment call you think it's important
by all means look at it instantly I
should say that in the whole historical
record that I've ever looked at I've
never seen anything remotely like that
maybe the only thing that even begins to
come closest the Reichstag fire which is
a tiny thing in comparison but if
there's ever been anything like that
it's been you know so deeply hidden you
don't find a trace of it I don't think
government's work like that or could and
in this case in my opinion we're being
crazy if they had done it anyhow if you
think it's interesting
by all means investigative
yeah professor Chomsky the name of the
country that we are discussing today
could have been X instead of the United
States and the time that we are in today
could have been year something instead
of 2002 and when you look at the history
you see a lot of Empires and the
powerful countries did not operate that
differently than the United States
operates today the impact of what's
going on today is much more powerful
because of globalization and the power
of Technology and because the economy is
also much global do you think there is
any way but throughout history power
centers shifted do you think might shift
again however nothing really changed in
the nature of humans and the new power
pretty much operated the same way the
previous one did what do you think about
global globalization today and do you
think this attitude can change well or
it will be just the same thing well
first of all I don't agree that nothing
has changed I mean I think the world is
way better than it was 40 years ago and
it's incomparably better than it was a
hundred years ago and indescribably
better than it was 200 years ago in man
all sorts of respects and we don't live
under kings and princes we don't have we
don't accept slavery there's a degree of
women's rights you know there's a degree
of control over the Democratic control
over what the governments do not just a
million things around that are Amin
health has vastly improved you know
poverty poverty is terrible but it's
nothing like it what it was there have
been tremendous improvement it hasn't
come as a gift from above it's come from
popular struggles which are hard and
difficult and committed and it has
achievements we shouldn't overlook the
achievements which are extremely
significant and in their just in our own
recent lifetimes they're very big so
it's I don't agree that nothing
but you're right in one respect power
acts the same way it always did it
doesn't have the capacity at once had
but it still tries okay so like after
September 11th immediately after
September 11th and incidentally this was
totally predictable I mean like the
first interview I had after September
11th they said what was trivially
obvious that every harsh repressive
force in the world is going to use this
as an opportunity to pursue their own
agendas more relentlessly and they're
going to do it in different ways
depending on who they are you know like
you will do it one way and Turkey will
do it another way and Russia will do it
a different way and of course that's
exactly what happened didn't take any
particular brilliance to see then so
yeah they're gonna try to do what they
can and you're absolutely right I made a
couple of marginal allusions to this
that when the the way the u.s. acts now
is not fundamentally different from the
way say Britain acted you know 100 years
ago and France and it's smaller domains
and back as far as you can go in history
but with those qualifications let's turn
to the main point globalization first of
all what is it you know I mean
globalization just misused neutrally
globalization just means international
integration okay everybody's in favor of
it I mean it's been the core principle
of the left and the working-class
movement since their origins that's why
every Union is called an international
okay everybody's in favor of
globalization now the term has been
appropriated by a narrow sector of power
and privilege to refer to their version
of international global integration the
investor rights version and that makes
sense for them to try to buy you know to
own the term because anyone whose
approach to their version then becomes
anti-globalization meaning some kind of
primitive who wants to go back to the
Stone Age or something like that it's a
bad error on the part of the critics of
this investor rights version of
integration to accept the term
anti-globalization they should not we're
all in favor of globalization the
question is is it going to be an
interesting the interests of private
power but everybody's in favor of it
okay like nobody's opposed to the fact
you can call up your friend and Italy or
something like that that's integration
but now has internet just using the term
neutrally now what has it increased or
hasn't decreased well you know in many
respects it's decreased so if you look
at international economic integration
there are a lot of different measures I
mean I mentioned one there's a technical
measure which is convergence towards a
single price and wage single market well
that's declining during the period of
the last 25 years has been declining
furthermore it's predicted to decline
even further okay so the investor rights
version of globalization is predicted by
its advocates to lead to less
globalization in the technical sense
more globalization in the air sense
means they have control more of the
wealth and power in the world so that's
one question take what Adam Smith meant
by it okay are you supposed to love Adam
Smith the core of free trade according
to Adam Smith is what he called free
circulation of labour meaning people can
go wherever they want if you don't have
that you can't begin to talk about free
trade well if we measure that what's
happened to globalization well it turns
out the peak period was over a century
ago relative to population the ability
of people to move around was higher than
than it's ever been since not for pretty
reasons incidentally I don't mean that
the reasons were nice the reasons were
that people from who are fleeing the
horrors of the Industrial Revolution in
Europe could come to the United States
and Massacre the population and take
over their lands okay like it wasn't a
pretty reason but the fact just in terms
of movement of people across borders is
that it was higher than
than it is now I mean that's why I'm you
know my parents didn't end up in a gas
chamber okay because there was a lot of
globalization in the sense of movement
across borders that's declined and if I
what has any other hand other by other
measures globalization has increased
very fast like movement of capital so
increase of capital flow across borders
has just increased escalated
astronomically in the last 25 years many
international economists mainstream ones
can assume conclude that that's a
substantial part of the reason why the
International weather performance of the
International economy has been so poor
in the last 25 years and it has by
almost every macroeconomic measure the
performance of the economy is worse in
the past 25 years than I was in the
preceding 25 years considerably the
period that's called globalization the
last 25 years has seen a decline in just
about everything
rate of growth rate of investment even
the rate of growth of trade has declined
in the last 25 years and a lot of
economists attributed that to the
increased financial volatility the huge
increase in capital flows across borders
in fact this period of globalization
what's called globalization past 25
years it was really initiated by the
breakdown of capital controls the
Bretton Woods system the preceding 25
years was based on control of capital
movements you know the countries could
control capital movements and currencies
were regulated relative to one another
within a pretty narrow band which backed
speculation and that was a period of
huge growth the period since has been
much worse
so by that measure freedom of movement
of say speculative speculation on
against currencies that kind of thing
capital flow across foreign exchange
movement that's just escalated enormous
Lee so by that measure there's more
globalization you measure by people less
globalization
by Capitol movement more globalization
in fact this very you see it very
dramatically in the us-mexico relation
so the us-mexico border is of course an
artificial border like just about every
word it was established by conquest ok
u.s. conquered half of Mexico but gives
you the border that's been a very porous
border throughout history people go up
and back pretty freely in both
directions for all kinds of reasons
it was militarized in 1994 under
Clinton's operation gatekeeper that it
was militarized in order to stop the
movement of people across the border
that is to cut back international
integration why in 1994 well because
that was the year when NAFTA was
initiated NAFTA is called claimed to be
something that increases integration
between Mexico and the United States but
not people by measured by people it cuts
back to the flow that's why you had to
militarize the border why did they want
to militarize the border well because
what they predicted in Mexico is what's
called an economic miracle from NAFTA
which means a disaster for most of the
population what was predicted was that
the effect of NAFTA on Mexico would be a
devastating blow to the majority of the
population which is indeed happen wages
have dropped precipitously hundreds of
thousands of people driven off the land
investment has declined though foreign
investment has increased and in general
it's been a kind of a economic miracle
economic miracle means that for a small
sector or wealthy people and for foreign
investors it's fantastic that's the
definition of a miracle for most of the
populations been awful and they expected
that and that's why you had to
militarize the border so did that
increase integration or decrease it well
you know that's an ideological question
depends what you want to measure when
you're militarize a border to prevent
people from moving freely by adam
smith's measure it decreases it okay by
the measure of you know the owners of
the economy it increases that they make
more profit what about trade you know
everybody reads the trade increased
between Mexico and the United States did
it well not by Adam Smith's measures
before NAFTA you know in 1993 there was
plenty of so-called there was plenty of
movement of commodities across the
border but about 50% of it was internal
to a firm okay that's not trade okay at
least by classical economic measures
that's no more trade than if General
Motors move something from Indiana to
Illinois you know if internal to it the
talat Aryan institution a command
economy you move something and it
happens across a border that's not trade
in any meaningful sense well it was 50%
before NAFTA now it's about 66 percent
so what about actual trade you know
trade in some meaningful sense well you
know nobody's measured it but I wouldn't
be surprised if it's declined yeah we
don't know that it's even grown even as
fast as it was growing before and intra
firm transfers are only a small part of
centrally managed interactions there's
also what are called strategic alliances
you know like IBM and Toshiba
makes them deal or there's what's called
outsourcing when a corporation uses some
small non-unionized outfit somewhere to
make things very cheaply and they don't
have to worry about wages and benefits
but they control it and if it happens to
cross borders that still centrally
managed well there haven't been any
really careful analyses that I'm aware
of but the few studies that have been
done one but I think workings
institution estimated that around 70
percent of cross-border interactions are
probably centrally managed in one
fashion or another you know intra firm
or strategic alliances or
you know outsourcing or other devices
actually you could only get answers to
this one if anybody studied it and
nobody studies it and to if you could
get into the the old question the former
question if you could get into the
internal workings of the totalitarian
institutions that are running the
command economies that are running it
but these estimates are probably in
somewhere in the right ballpark which
means that very little of what's going
on across borders is trade in any
serious sense
some things are have definitely declined
like movement of people in the case of
NAFTA not just by accident by
militarizing the border just they are
through ago Bush announced further
militarization of the border
that's cutting back international
integration
I mean pretext is drugs but you know
that's pretext for anything the so you
just can't answer these questions simply
about globalization there's just too
many different ways of looking at it if
you look at it from the point of view of
people's interests looks very different
but if you look at it from the point of
view of investors interests just totally
different will there be a change over
the future well you know that's nobody
can predict human affairs at all so much
depends on what people like you to
decide to do it's a question of will and
a choice
that's why predictions of human affairs
are so ridiculous
but there are some tendencies so if you
go back to say 1950 the US had about
half of the world controlled about half
the world's economy and well roughly 50%
if you go to 19 say say 1970 was down to
about 25% what had happened was recovery
of the other major industrial centers
from the effects of the war and
decolonization and a bunch of other
things and by around 1970 economically
speaking the world was what's called
tri-polar like three major economic
centers more or less on a part one is US
space North America the others
based Europe and the third is Japan
based Asia but by now it's more
complicated so like Japan and China and
Germany and France and a little more
diverse but basically have the same
three centers they're kind of comparable
roughly speaking you look at resources
industrial capacity so on that you know
financial reserves actually in that by
that measure age is actually ahead
there's kind of on a par so you have
three major economic poles in the world
you got one military force in military
terms the u.s. is overwhelmingly
dominant but that's the only respect the
only major respect where is that gonna
go well you know that's pretty hard to
predict I mean it could remember you go
back to say the 18th century the global
centers of economic life were Asian I
mean China and India were the major
commercial and industrial powers Europe
kind of a backwater that changed for you
know not again not pretty reasons over
the next couple of centuries but it
could go back that way there is
interesting scholarly work that suggests
it might go back that way no we don't
know so I don't really think you can
predict things like that and just
quickly one more question on language
globalization of languages what do you
think if you get you know I mean first
of all let me just say as you know it
says linguist done right there but as
but that tells you nothing about this
English is the international language
for a very simple system a reason the
English and they're offshoots namely us
conquered the world okay that with the
english-speaking people had way more
guns and much more savagery than anybody
else so English is the international
language if somebody else gets the guns
and you know develops a comparable
culture of savagery something else will
be the
it's not a linguistic question thanks
[Music]
I want to take just a moment to
acknowledge our many volunteers who
helped make this evening possible and
when our volunteers put in a substantial
amount of time they get a t-shirt from
the peace and justice center
I think noam chomsky just qualified for
his t-shirt let me
