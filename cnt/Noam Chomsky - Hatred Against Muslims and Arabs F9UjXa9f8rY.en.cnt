let me personalize it against jews i
mean when i grew up
as a kid we were jewish uh anti-semitism
was a very
very visible phenomenon i mean i grew up
in a
part of a middle lower middle class
section of a city where we happen to be
the only jewish family
in an irish and german catholic
neighborhood which were mostly
nazis pro-nazi pretty openly and
you know i grew up with a visceral fear
of catholics
it wasn't until i was an adult that i
could deal with catholics and
somehow not be afraid uh it wasn't much
fun you know
when they came out of that jesuit school
you know they were frightening creatures
furthermore when my father finally got
enough money to
get a second-hand car and we could drive
around a little
uh if we'd get to the nearby mountains
we'd have to look for a motel because a
lot of motels had on them restricted
that means no jews you know when i got
to harvard
in 1950 the anti-semitism was so
thick you could cut it with a knife by
one of the reasons mit
here is a great university is because a
lot of
first grade people like paul samuelson
and robert weiner didn't get jobs at
harvard because they were jewish
in fact harvard got their first jewish
mathematician
that's a jewish field well i was there
1953 because the department was so
anti-semitic
i mean this all changed in the 50s but
up until that time
anti-semitism was perfectly overt and
very real
and the jewish community was subdued you
didn't want to be too
visible you know because it's
got enough problems uh it's one of the
reasons why
refugees from the holocaust didn't come
here
you know almost anybody in europe
certainly people in the dp
camps would have been delighted to come
to the united states
they didn't uh refugees from the people
who were
sim were dying in the dp camps after uh
you know after the germans were defeated
they were still there and it wasn't very
nice
that hadn't changed much except the
crematoria weren't going
uh they didn't very few of them came to
the united states
partly because of anti-semitism partly
because the jewish community didn't want
them
didn't push to bring them here
and for reasons that are you know not
pretty but are understandable
and we've got enough problems uh the
uh anti-semitism is no longer a
legitimate
form of racism anti-arab
uh bias is a legitimate form of racism
meaning you don't have to hide it
in most forms of racism you have to
pretend you're not a racist
so just pretend i'm not a i'm not a
semitic i'm not
any black you may be but you don't
advertise it
uh anti-arab racism you're allowed to
advertise
this is way before september 11th and
the
community you see it in films and books
and attitudes it's just not even hidden
you know i mean nobody will come out and
say i'm an anti-arab racist
but it's in you know it's everywhere and
every muslim or arab in the country
knows it
okay uh now after september 11th
i should add that this shows up in
behavior two
so for just to give you an illustration
boston
happens to have a big lebanese community
and while they're not
super wealthy they have money you know
there's storekeepers and
businessmen and so on uh in 1982
at the time of the israeli invasion of
lebanon which was a
total horrible atrocity a few of us
made an effort to organize just a
charitable relief
program for people in lebanon
we could not get any support from the
lebanese community here and i think i
understand
why because i remember it from childhood
i think they just don't want to be too
visible
and i think that's understandable i
can't prove that but that's the sense
that i had
uh and uh and it's not just uh since
september 11th yes it's increased but
not only
arabs i mean anybody who looks a little
bit dark
