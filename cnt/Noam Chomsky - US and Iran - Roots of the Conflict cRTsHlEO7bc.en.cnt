receive more from a public intellectual
though Chomsky himself would and often
has declined that label so with that I

shifting gears a bit but I presume
you've made that transition us-iran
relations really begin in 1952 that when
the British were attempting to overthrow
the parliamentary regime and were
capable of doing so and called in the
big muscles from overseas but just as
they had done a couple years earlier in
Greece what's particularly striking
about us-iranian relations since that
auspicious moment is the radical
asymmetry which is very much reminiscent
of the famous words of Athenian
conquerors to Meadows 2,500 years ago
responding to the plea for justice on
the part of the weaker people of Milla's
and they responded that what is right as
the world goes is only in question
between equal power while the strong do
what they wish and the weak suffer as
they must doctrine that has held for
2,500 years without very much change the
doctrine of the Imperial essence that
the
height of its power the captures very
accurately the relations between the
United States and Iran ever since the
United States displaced Britain as the
global hegemon in power in the Middle
East in fact in the world I'll come back
to that in a moment
but I think its first kind of useful to
think about the general geostrategic
background in which US Iranian relations
found their place so prior to World War
two the United States was by far the
richest country in the world in fact it
had been for a long time but it was not
the major actor in world affairs that
rule was built by Britain secondarily
France the United States of course did
have a long history of armed
intervention but it was mostly Latin
America some forays into the Pacific
around the turn of the century but US
international expansion greatly
increased when the world began to shift
to an oil economy at the beginning of
the twenty nineteen the 20th century the
United States itself was the leading oil
producer for most of the period since it
is again right now but that in fact is
pretty much irrelevant to policy
contrary to what's often believed I'll
come back to that
so a century ago major oil resources
were discovered in Venezuela
that at the time was a British
dependency the Woodrow Wilson
administration took care of that take
the British out u.s. took over and
basically ran the country until 1999
when Hugo Chavez was elected the
trevor's quickly began to move
independent course he managed to
persuade the OPEC countries the major
oil cartel to reduce production to raise
prices for the benefit itself the United
States didn't like that in 2002 shortly
after there was a military coup in
Venezuela throughout the executive
disbanded Parliament dismissed the
courts it was openly and
enthusiastically supported by the United
States no secret about it and the press
was also very enthusiastic about his
achievement
well the coup was quickly overturned by
a popular uprising and since then the
United States has had to resort to
subversion sabotage to try to restore
things to their proper course by the
1920s it was recognized that the Middle
East was going to be the major center of
the oil production at the time it's its
resources were divided between the
Britain and France the redline agreement
it was called the United States was not
satisfied with that demanded them the
achieved a role within the for the
division of Middle East resources things
changed substantially ten years later in
the 1930s when the normans oil reserves
were discovered in Saudi Arabia and then
the question is who's gonna run those
that the US and Britain contended over
that in fact break through through the
Second World War there was a kind of a
mini war between the United States and
Britain as to who would take control of
Saudi Arabia given the circumstances the
outcome was never really in doubt of
these reasons well at that time second
world war
the United US government analysts
recognized that Middle East oil was I'll
just put their own words Middle East oil
is a stupendous source of strategic
power one of the greatest material
prizes in world history and probably the
richest economic prize in the world in
the field of foreign investment the most
strategically important area in the
world in President Eisenhower's words we
can almost say that since that time it's
been close to axiom one of international
affairs that the US will do whatever it
can to ensure that it controls this
enormous prize now it is not that the
United States itself needed the oil
that's important to understand in fact
it did not for most of this period the
US has been the major oil producer as it
is today but the actual reasons have
been explained by leading statesmen so
George Kennan one of the founders of the
structure of the post-war world he
pointed out that control of Middle East
oil it gives the United States what he
called veto power over other industrial
economies including primarily animal
allies they rely on the resource we have
our hand on the pump he's a lot of power
more recently same point was reiterated
by speaking of prevents key one of the
most influential current strategic
analysts policy planners he he was kind
of critical of the invasion of Iraq he
didn't think it was a good idea but he
did say that if we managed to control
the Iraq that would give the United
States on quoting him critical leverage
on the European and Asian economy that
and Middle East oil there's an enormous
effort in the United States to pretend
that the United States didn't care about
oil what a invaded Iraq so we would have
done the same thing if you're X major
export was asparagus and the source of
the main source of Middle East oil was
in South Pacific or something but you
can believe that if you like that's the
standard money well by the but but I
think these insights of cannon and the
Brzezinski others a pretty much account
for of the explained the thinking behind
the axiom one of the rural affairs again
as you policy has remained the same
whether the US was using parts of Middle
East Louisville or wasn't but didn't the
matter was the same dishes rise well by
the end of World War two the United
States was the unquestioned the global
hegemonic power with in fact on a scale
that had no historical precedent well so
what happened to the Middle East well it
was first the problem of France they had
had part of Middle East oil they were
unceremoniously dismissed on the grounds
that France was an enemy power since it
has been occupied by the Germans I said
they lost their part as far as the
British were concerned it's more nuanced
but over time the United States
gradually displaced the fading that
Britain were greatly weakened of course
by the war and the British had
absolutely no illusions about what was
happening they have a sophisticated
foreign affairs bureaucracy than the
British Foreign Office I'll just put
them that recognize that the economic
imperialism of American business
interests is quite active under the
cloak of a benign
an avuncular internationalist and is
attempting to elbow a cell the Americans
believe that the United States stands
for something in the world something of
which the world has need something which
the world is going to like something in
the final analysis which the world is
going to take whether it likes it or not
that's internal rhetoric not what you
read in the New York Times or learn in
school then it's a rather lucid version
of the Athenian doctor well Iran did
have enormous oil resources they were
controlled by Britain as you all know
the government sought to nationalize the
industry that Britain tried but failed
to crush the effort that when they
called on the u.s. to intervene and it
did succeed in the overthrowing the
parliamentary government 1953 installing
the dictatorship of the Shah Menezes
entirely normal that this achievement
was recognized and applauded publicly
applauded so for example the editors of
the New York Times explained that as a
result of this achievement quote them to
underdeveloped countries with rich
resources now have an object lesson in
the heavy cost that must be paid by one
of their number which goes berserk with
fanatical nationalism that's the
Iranians had done it's perhaps too much
to hope that Iran's experience will
prevent the rise of Mossad eggs in other
countries but that experience may at
least strengthen the hands of more
reasonable and more Farsi leaders that
means leaders who have a clear right and
understanding of u.s. priorities that's
the New York Times very typical same
with the Venezuelan - same with the
Brazilian coup in 1964 quite standard
will Iran's resources were then went
back to British hands but not completely
in a way that's quite interesting
Washington insisted that about 40% of
Iran's resources that go to US
corporations us should take over almost
half of the Iranian resources US
corporations objected didn't want to do
that but because they could lift oil
more economically from Saudi Arabia we
really have to do was stick a whole and
buy in the land and oil them so so US
corporations didn't want to do it but
they were forced to by the US government
under severe threat they were compelled
to take over Iranian substantial Iranian
and resources now the reason was that
the Eisenhower administration that they
have global concerns they represent the
long-term global interests of the
corporate sector among the local
parochial short-term interests of profit
tomorrow which is quite an interesting
development and the worth remembering
because it's quite similar to what's
happening right now before our eyes
though we don't have internal documents
yet but you can pretty well - US oil
corporations would be very pleased to be
able to move into the about a market
their share of this enormous resource
not just as Boeing other corporations US
corporations of course would like to
enter the Iranian market but the bar by
state power which once again has
longer-term concerns the has the state
interest in punishing Iran that
overwhelms the parochial interests and
short-term profit so it's rather similar
to what happened in the early 50
now that's not the only such case
another one close why is Cuba where US
corporations have been very eager for
years to exploit the Cuban market
especially US pharmaceutical
corporations interested in connections
with advanced pharmaceutical industry in
Cuba but therefore by state power which
again has to punish Cuba for its crimes
in this case we do have internal records
far enough back the crime of Cuba is
successful defiance of Washington it's
the way the CIA that described the crime
in the early 1960s now this was a time
when the Kennedy administration was
carrying out a major a terrorist war
against Cuba no laughing matter in fact
almost led to terminal destruction
during the Little Miss a Cuban Missile
Crisis
well examples like these are of a lot of
interest for the general study is formed
relationships it's no secret that the
corporate sector pretty much controls
the state but there are moments when
state power which is upholding long term
corporate interests overwhelms more
parochial concerns for short-term gains
and Iran today is a case in point it's
another case of the crime of the
successful clients that since 1979
well this threat of successful defiance
resonates through the internal
documentary record if you look at it and
it's not by no means original to the
United States fact it's tradition though
so King Jordan 3rd 1770s was concerned
about the successful defiance of the
and colonies and the consequences this
you might have for erosion of the
British Empire
though he was joined by great statesmen
of Europe the Tsar met her neck sewer
the deeply concerned by the spread of
such very dangerous
Republican heresies and what this might
do to world order these are principles
that endure consistently over long
periods very much like the doctor of
Imperial Athens 2,500 years ago well
turning to thee as soon as the Shah was
installed Iran became a valued u.s.
client state in fact it was one of the
pillars of the local regional control of
the Middle East along with the savuti
family dictatorship they were joined by
Israel in 1967 became a third pillar and
it was in 1967 the us-israeli relations
were established in the form of the
forum which still persists today quite
different from before and there were
good reasons for it and these
developments provides very important
background for understanding what's
happening right now on the region so
what happened in 1967 well in 1967
Israel performed a huge service to the
United States and it's Sonia
ally Israel destroyed the center of
secular Arab nationalism Nasser CG which
the United States regarded there's a
bitter enemy condemned this Italy rien
generally a very much like Britain
before the United States has tended to
support a radical Islam in opposition to
secular nationalism which is considered
a much more severe threat
because of the danger of it spread to
others the and at the time in the night
mid 1960s there was a war going on
between the radical Islamist Saudi
Arabia and secular nationalist nasara to
Egypt and Israel self a problem
destroyed secular nationalism worded
radical Islam the US relations with
Israel immediately became when unique in
world affairs have remained so further
Israeli service it's the u.s. power have
simply intensified that there's no time
to go into it the but in any way that
that was a crucial moment for modern
Middle East history well in the u.s.
Israeli Iranian relations also became
quite close at that time there was
wasn't official but unofficially the
Israel had a what was in effect embassy
in in Iran in Tehran and the defective
Israeli ambassador early hurry
LeBron II he reported after the fourth
show he reported that the entire top
Israeli political echelon had been
visiting here and regularly that
includes David ben-gurion
Golda Meir the Moshe Dayan it's dr. bean
Menachem Begin fact all he also
described the very warm relations that
developed between Israel's Labour Party
which was burning at the time and the
notorious secret police of Iran the sava
which in fact was posting and arranging
the visits of the labor ministers to
Darren has the series analysts in the
United States that were also quite
cognizant of the
has it tripartite Israel of Iran Saudi
alliance on which the United States had
relied for local control of the Middle
East
the sentence ranking the oil experts of
Senator Henry Jackson and hit he quoting
him he emphasized the strength and
Western orientation of Israel on the
Mediterranean and Iran on the Persian
Gulf to reliable friends of the United
States who along with Saudi Arabia have
served to inhibit and contain those
irresponsible and radical elements in
certain Arab states who if they were
free to do so would pose a grave threat
indeed to our principal sources of
petroleum in the Persian Gulf
again notice resources in the United
States in need and barely used but they
were needed as a reserve and leader of
world nation same time the Nixon
Doctrine had established Iran and Israel
as the cops on the beat they were called
by defense secretary Melvin there the
police headquarters of course remains in
Washington the cops on the beat were to
ensure that radical nationalists as
they're told would not pose danger to
order robert RepA who was one of the
main Defense Intelligence Agency
analysts on the Middle East wrote that
Israeli power protected the regime's of
Jordan and Saudi Arabia from a
militarily strong Egypt in the 1960s
settled in 1967 and then the Israeli
Iranian relationship that continued to
contribute to the stability what we call
the stability of the region stability
means securing US interests
that's very much what the situation was
like from 67 till 79 when Iran moved
again to successful defiance and there's
an earlier record too which is worth
looking at
as early as 1958 the National Security
Council
had concluded that what they call the
logical corollary of opposition to
radical Arab nationalism we need to
support Israel as the only strong
pro-western power left in the Middle
East and ten years earlier in 1948
Israel's military successes in the 1948
war that led the US Joint Chiefs of
Staff that the describe Israel as the
major regional military power after
turkey offering the United States to
gain what they called strategic
advantage in the Middle East to become a
base for u.s. power that now is could go
into the details but it is basically a
US base in the Middle East no questions
about well what about the Palestinians
back in 48 the u.s. planners had no
reason to doubt the assessments of
Israeli government specialists that as
they put it the Palestinian refugees
would either assimilate elsewhere or
would be crushed that some of them would
die and most of them would turn into
human dust and the waste of society and
join the most impoverished classes and
they are our countries so there wasn't
any particular reason to concern oneself
about them well without comment it
should be clear that the roots of
today's the circumstances and policies
are actually quite deep haven't changed
much well as far as Iran was concerned
over men in order and
1979 shakaal was overthrown the year of
successful defiance began and as you can
imagine that the overthrow of the Shah
is a very serious shock but to the
United States and its Israeli Ally that
probably to Saudi Arabia but the Saudi
Arabian government is a totalitarian
that we have absolutely no records of
anything that goes on inside the just
guess but you can make a successful kids
well the chief of the Israeli Mossad
Secret Service Jacob in Rudy who was
actually in Iran over undercover he
urged that the West in Israel to carry
out a military coup that to return it
ran to proper behavior the normal
response worried the brawny the ex the
fact that one ambassador and he he
thought that this shouldn't be too
difficult as he put it
Tehran could be taken over by a small
force determined ruthless cruel men
emotionally geared to killing 10,000
people but should be enough to reverse
this heresy President Carter president
dime Ascenta native general robert
voicer and to iran apparently to see if
he could find elements in the Iranian
military which was had been closely
linked to the United States who might be
able to implement a coon but that effort
failed then Iran went off on its own way
not for long the Iraq immediately
invaded 1980 Iraq invaded and as you
know who's a terrible war the
interesting Lea Israel continued to
provide arms to Iran during the
iraq-iran war presumably to try to
maintain
relations with elements in the Iranian
military and probably also in the hope
and expectation that both sides in the
war would simply destroy themselves
would be weakened very much what
happened that the United States and
contrast provided very strong support to
its friend Saddam Hussein many who will
remember defense secretary Donald
Rumsfeld visit the Saddam in 1983 that
was a famous handshake firmed up the
u.s. support for Saddam that continued
right to the end and a trim of the u.s.
support for Saddam approved it decisive
and convincing Khomeini finally to
accept the settlement this was after the
US had intervened directly in the Gulf
with the naval forces to protect the
Iraqi shipping and firstly after the
u.s. guided missile cruiser and the USS
Vincennes shut down an Iranian airliner
in a commercial corridor killing 290
people then returned to its port in the
United States to receive medals of Honor
for the achievement previously President
Reagan had blamed Iran therefore
Saddam's chemical warfare massacres of
curves and had blocked as congressional
condemnation of the atrocity shortly
after that shocking crime ABC Middle
East correspondent Charles bless
discovered Iraqi biological warfare
sites he was using the French commercial
satellites and defector testimony his
report was aired by ABC but it was
instantly denied by the Pentagon and the
story die until Saddam made a mistake he
committed the sin of defiance himself 19
months later invaded Kuwait
then the very same state sites were long
than were trumpeted as proof that Saddam
must be destroyed for us of course
except that all of this quietly without
comment also academic analysts the
intimacy of you as Saddam relations was
revealed very graphically in 1987 when
Saddam's missiles hit us ship the USS
start in the bill of killing 37 seamen
there was no punishment now that's
pretty rare but the only other country
that can get away with something like
that is in fact Israel the beach did get
away with it in 1967 and the attack on
the USS Liberty so you have to have a
really close intimate friendship to be
able to get away with things like that
the in the case of the Iraqi attack on
historic President Reagan immediately
declared that he brand was the villain
so accordingly the u.s. imposed heavy
sanctions on Iran new ones they were
reverse them for the foot because it was
interfering with u.s. naval actions and
the Gulf like the ones I've just
described affect protecting the record
shipment well that pretty much led to
the end of the war and matters continued
pretty much the same way soon as the war
ended August 1989 the Pentagon invited
Iraqi nuclear engineers to the United
States for advanced training in nuclear
weapons production of course that's a
severe threat to Iran a couple months
later by now President Bush as Bush
number one the President Bush sent a
high-level congressional delegation
severe and it was led by Senate Majority
Leader Robert dole things later there
Republican presidential candidate the he
was sent the delegation was sent to
convey Bush's personal greetings to his
good friend Saddam Hussein and to assure
Saddam that he should disregard
criticisms by what they delegate called
the haughty and pampered press who were
out of control and every muscle while
criticized said humble into those guys
fake news as it's now cool well
President Bush also provided subsidized
food supplies to the Saddam regime but
these were badly needed after the
destruction of agricultural areas in the
chemical warfare attacks against the
Kurdish region the uncle operations were
also sent to advanced technology that
was adaptable to military production
that some of it was specifically
designated for protection of the head of
state our friend Saddam Hussein well a
couple months later
Saddam defied or misunderstood maybe the
orders and invaded Kuwait and he
instantly shifted from highly admired
friends to embodiment of evil much as
Iran had done 10 years earlier the Bush
administration fear that Saddam would
immediately withdraw from Kuwait but
leaving a puppet regime in place in
internal discussions knee the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin
Powell warned his words that in the next
few days Iraq will withdraw putting his
puppet in and everyone in the Arab world
who will be happy we can't permit that
therefore in fact what was fear if you
look back was that Saddam would do
exactly what the United States had done
few months earlier that when it invaded
not on the Haitians are quite similar
the difference was that there were
apparently many more civilian casualties
in the US invasion of Panama but US did
invade put its puppet in one difference
was that the the latin-american
countries were anything but happy that
they vigorously protested but of course
in vain the Saddam actually made a
series of offers for negotiated
withdrawal now these were rejected
evidence was leaked from inside the
government but it was suppressed by the
media it's quite an interesting story
and finally the u.s. invaded Iraq was
subjected to brutal was destructive
bombing than extremely harsh sanctions
the tensions were so severe that the
distinguished international diplomats
who administered them through the UN
that both resigned in protest on grounds
that the sent US sanctions were what
they called genocide of course the US
was subjected to nothing for its
invasion of Panama nothing more than a
Security Council resolution which the
u.s. vetoed along with France and
England that says no bombing of
sanctions the discussion it's all
forgotten again the doctrine of imperial
essence will Iran was not so lucky
successful appliances not horrible
so sanctions were regularly extended
various pretexts very harsh effects
sanctions imposed after 2010 alone
reduced Iran's economy by 15 to 20
percent now they block growth almost
entirely in the subsequent years until
2015 the sanctions on oil production
were
particularly damaging the sanctions were
shortly intensified as you know last
November after Trump that withdrawn from
the nuclear agreement in this case the
sanctions very clearly designed to
punish the population severely and hope
that they'll somehow that the regime
maids and I'll collapse or stated before
the the hidden will you is a very
powerful state it's the god and US
sanctions have a multiplier effect so
other states even Europe are afraid to
antagonize the local enforcer that which
virtually controls international
financial transactions they go through
New York mostly than anybody who tries
to evade them can expect severe
punishment if the United States is
crossed and of course this we all know
the long reach of Uncle Sam has extended
to this room the conference cannot be
livestream to Iran because that would
provide what's called a service to
arraigning scholars that can it be color
aided by the drunk on pale Bolton
surround through at the tempting at this
point borrow phrase about an axis from
the George Bush administration but that
would be impolite so the frame well the
punishment of Iran because beyond
sanctions of the US and Israel openly
take pride in cyber war cyber war
attacks against Iran these actions are
what the Pentagon the designate says
acts of war which justify military
action in retaliation but those
structures of course again after
conformed to the Athenian doctrine every
US administration
everyone else has declared and continues
declare that all options are open that's
quite an interesting phrase the phrase
is in strict violation to the
foundations of international law article
2.4 of the UN Charter which bans the
threat or use of force in international
affairs but that was of course
established under us initiative but it's
not applicable to the powerful and the
fact that every u.s. leader openly
publicly radically defies international
law receives no comment in like check
and see I've talked about this
occasionally in law schools and the
reactions kind of interesting sort of
what else is moved but of course there
is some comment from people who the
National Security Advisor for Kennedy
and Johnson McGeorge Bundy called the
wild men in the wings so they
occasionally bring this up but they can
of course be dismissed well in public
Durant
like cubed other enemies is not charged
with successful defiance of the master
that's for internal documents rather the
primary charge in the case of Iran for
some years has been that Iran is the
greatest threat to world peace and is
even developing nuclear weapons on the
question of the threat to peace of the
world happens disagree the there are
international polls of public opinion
run by the Gallup Organization the main
organization though they once only
interestingly asked the question on
their international polls who was the
greatest threat to world peace the
answer came out the wrong way
face was for even close round was purely
mentioned they never asked that question
again and in the u.s. population was
protected from the bad news by the Free
Press which refused to publish it
putting that aside what exactly is the
Iranian threat to peace actually we have
an authoritative answer that from US
intelligence they give regular reports
to Congress on the global situation of
course to talk about Iran and what they
report is that Iranian military
expenditures are extremely low by the
standards of the region u.s. standards
so for example in 1917 2017 the Iranian
military expensive expenditures were 1/7
that of the GCC both Walker assured
Canada Council the Sunni Nia oil
dictatorships 1/7 of theirs the loan
israel of the US and furthermore the GCC
states receive very advanced technology
the most advanced military technology
that the US and its allies export in
contrast the Iranian military military
system is mostly obsolete from many
years ago because of the sanctions
well intelligence also points out that
us that Iranian strategic doctrines are
defensive designed to hold growth and
invasion long enough for diplomacy to
set in and add that they don't know but
it is Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons
program that would be part of its
deterrent strategy that deterrence is
unacceptable to states that want to be
able to rampage freely from the region
but all of this to passes unmentioned
well as we all know even US intelligence
has agreed that Iran has lived up to the
terms of the joint agreement on nuclear
weapons that the US has just rejected
the current news reports indicate that
the Trump administration is trying to
concoct some new tale about this which
will hear about soon well we might ask
finally whether there's any far-reaching
solution to the u.s. Iran confrontation
over nuclear weapons
here's one idea you might consider the
first Iran should have the right to
develop nuclear energy like every other
state but not weapons that's in accord
with the non-proliferation treaty
secondly a nuclear weapons free zone
should be established in the region I
would include Iran and of course thirdly
the US should end the illegal threats
against iran mr Turner is diplomacy
that's three possibilities but they're
not original they didn't make them up in
fact I'm quoting from polls that these
happen to be the Preferences of the
large majority of both Americans and
Iranians little polls taken by the world
policy opinion in 2007 that's right at
the height of the confrontation
showed that Americans and Iranians agree
very closely on basic issues when these
polls were released the well-known
strategic analyst
disarmament specialist Joseph chairman
Tony that commented for him the polls
showed the common sense of both the
American and Iranian people who seemed
to be able to rise above the rhetoric of
their own leaders to find common sense
solutions to some of the most crucial
question
facing the two nations favoring
diplomatic solutions to their
differences the results he said suggest
that putting it a little differently
from his words let me make it my
statement they suggest that if the u.s.
and Iran were functioning democracies
which neither of them is now then this
is very dangerous a confrontation that
could probably be resolved peaceably
well then these are the opinions of the
populations and not the leadership
obviously the or for exempt or for that
matter of the experts they're different
it's an interesting study in the current
issue of the that political science
quarterly main journal of the political
science association they reviewed
opinions among experts and found that
their bars a few agree with the
populations but they say they're very
marginal
so marginal don't have to be considered
them they mentioned only one person
infected treated harshly perhaps all
that causal center well let's turn to
the second point of agreement between
Iranian and American populations
establish a nuclear weapons free zone in
the Middle East if you did that that
would terminate any alleged the Iranian
threat so what are the prospects for
that well no problem with the Arab
states they're strongly in favor in fact
they're the ones who initiated the
proposal back in the 1990s no problem
with Iran they strongly supported along
with g77 the former online countries
again the strongest forces will the same
with the rest of the world but not
unanimously as one country blocks the
united states regularly this comes up
regularly at the non-proliferation
treaty review
the meetings and us regularly finds a
way to block it most recently Obama 2015
but there are of course free tips but
nobody doubts the reasons this occasion
even read them and arms control journals
the reasons are that if there was a
Middle East
nuclear weapons free zone Israel's
nuclear arsenal would be subject to
inspection in fact the United States
cannot concede its existence
u.s. continues to deny that it exists of
course everyone knows that does and
there's a reason for that if the u.s.
recognized its existence military in
Israel enough stop under US law assuming
the government might follow us law so
anyway there can't be a nuclear weapons
free zone that we oughta notice that
along with Britain the United States has
a special responsibility to devote its
efforts to establishing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East the
reason is that when the US and Britain
were looking for some kind of thin legal
cover for their invasion of Iraq the -
the grocer's States appealed to a
Security Council resolution 687 1990
Warner they claimed falsely that Saddam
had violated its demand to end his
nuclear weapons program well that
resolution has another paragraph which
nobody wants to cite paragraph 14 which
falls in a course for steps towards the
goal of establishing in the Middle East
a zone free from weapons of mass
destruction and notice that that
obligates the United States and Britain
even more than others but to take this
initiative seriously none of this enters
into political this public discussion in
the United States
apart from the wild men of the wings who
repeatedly bring it up but in vain well
these remarks of course barely scratch

omitted but I think if you fill in the
details leaves the basic story pretty
much intact including the shared opinion
of Iranian and American public ones I
quoted that the US should end threats
against Iran and turned as here is
diplomacy the main point is that the
issues are resolved about and the
failure to make use of the opportunities
that might have very consequences
