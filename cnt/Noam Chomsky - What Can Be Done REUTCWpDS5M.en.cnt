what direct action can the population
take what what are the most important
direct actions that the population can
take against this collusion against this
complex well you know with regard to
voting I don't think there's a general
principle I mean you just make your
decisions I don't think it's it's
usually not a major decision like it's
not going to be effect on things it may
have some effect on things so you just
decide like is it important enough to
have an effect in this in that case and
there's no general principle but on the
other question what can be done well you
know everything can be done everything
can be done up to the point of
eliminating all structures of authority
and repression they're all create their
human institutions they can be
dismantled if you ask yourself what's
the most important well you know then
you know we need that's not the kind of
thing you decide in a meeting like this
I mean those are the kinds of decisions
that come by serious thought among
people who are really trying to do
change well you know typically the I
mean given the world the way it is you
start with where the world is okay like
you don't start by saying ok let's
overthrow transnational corporations ok
I think that's what because it's just
not within range so you start with
saying look here's where the world is
what can we begin to do well you can
begin to do things which will get people
to understand better what the source of
real power is and just how much they can
achieve like you can start by say first
we can start by getting us to stop
torturing people right like there's easy
things to do or getting you know stop
killing children and Cuba let's say stop
you know massacring in East Timor those
are easy things so let's do those first
do the easy things with regard of the
domestic scene XA Kronk the crime bills
I mean they're just like I said they're
the domestic equivalent of death squads
the fact that they're targeting
vulnerable populations who are being
turned into people under military
occupation look that's not that's an
easy one to change I mean you really
just have to change
on that one yet you know that's it's
it's the you aren't striking at the core
of private power when you begin to have
a civilized criminal system instead of a
brutal barbaric one so that one I think
is changeable what about the war against
Children and Families another case that
I mentioned well that's another easy one
I mean the Anglo you know the European
Japanese model in Zoli it's not
pertinent I don't want to suggest it so
beautiful and except in comparison to
errors but those are countries very much
like us you know they have the same
institutions the same economy and so on
and so forth they have simply you know
not been subjected to the unilateral
business power as much as here for all
kind of historical reasons and we can
certainly become like those countries
you know there's a type of model so
you're in frontier countries very much
like us
that takes a health care well you know
the u.s. is off the spectrum on that one
too again I think for the same reasons I
mean even if you just looked a couple of
miles to the north there's a country
very much like us which happens to have
instituted a semi civilized again plenty
of things wrong with it but a semi
similar civilized system of health care
not that far back back in the 1960s
under conditions that we could easily
duplicate well those are things that I
don't want to say those things will be
easy but they're within range on things
like GATT how you're getting into harder
territory because here crucial interests
of authoritarian institutions are at
stake and then you're going to begin to
face the fact which after all is a fact
that sooner or later you have to face
that may be the most totalitarian
institution in human history are
certainly close to it as a corporation
it's an institution which with power in
which authority goes strictly from top
to bottom if you're insulting relates in
the hands of owners and investors if
you're inside the system you take orders
from above and transmit them down if
you're outside the system there are very
weak popular controls which indeed or
roading I should say that this is not an
inside of mine it was pointed out but
Thomas Jefferson in his later years when
he warned was just the early days of
corporations he warned that if private
if you if power was going to shift into
the hands of what he called banking
institutions and moneyed in corporations
then we then the democratic experiment
would be over we'd be back to an
absolute war form of absolutism worse
than what they struggled against Thomas
Jefferson is not exactly a figure who's
off the spectrum an American you know
American history so you know this is not
a new insight it's as American as apple
pie we should recognize what Thomas
Jefferson could see in fact Adam Smith
but when you see that you realize that
it's a hard nut to crack because there
are enormous agglomerations of power in
the concentrating and indeed
transnational which are protected from
scrutiny or from popular action and
that's got to change after all why do
corporations have the rights they do why
are they treated as immortal persons
contrary to the warnings of people like
Adam Smith and others it was not by law
you know this was by decisions made in
courts and by judges and by lawyers
which simply changed the climate totally
and that can be reversed to institutions
can be under popular control including
the economic institutions well you know
organizing to try to achieve that is a
much more long-term operation but it's
got to begin somewhere you know so if
you ask what should be done well you
know I don't think any sane human being
and look around at the world around them
and not figure out things that have to
be done I don't take a walk through
Baltimore you know you'll find plenty of
things that have to be done so you know
you get started doing some of them are
broader and scale so you know you think
about those but they're not going to
people y'all can do them alone like if
you take a walk down the streets of
Baltimore and you say oh yeah that ought
to be done nothing's going to happen on
the other hand if people are organized
enough to act about it yeah they can
achieve things and there's no particular
limit what they can achieve and that's
why we don't live under slavery there
feudalism and so on mention specific
organizations that are involved that
they're involved in breaking apart this
collusion even if you want I know you
can't I know you can't mention specific
actions but can you mention
organizations that are involved in
working on this problem specifically the
problem of collusion between governments
and government well you know a lot of
organizations are involved from
different points of view for example I
mean like take say that one level which
is important though of course their
official Nader's Public Citizen is
involved but that's important as I say
but kind of not really touching the
structure of power beyond that I mean
any you know if the American labor
movement ever recovers the insights that
ordinary working people and in fact the
labor movement had a hundred years ago
it'll be working against them you go
back a hundred years and in fact up
until much more recently than that and
the major you know the major thrust of
the labor movement was what was
sometimes you know industrial democracy
placing the workplace under Democratic
control I mean that wasn't you know you
didn't read that in Marx I mean
everybody figured it out after
themselves long before Marx and that's
the needn't he in fact didn't say
anything much about it the this is you
know could be the labor movement let's
say and in fact just about every you
know any there's tons of activism going
on on usually focused on pretty narrow
issues but they all ultimately they're
all talking about illegitimate Authority
of one form or another and their
interests and are common and you know
they just they have to be built up and
extended I mean I you know I have my own
views as to if you want some a list you
know it's easy to find there's easy find
lots of lists so if you write to any of
the major funding organizations like say
resist in Boston they'll be delighted to
give you a list of the couple hundred
groups they funded in the last couple of
years and you will find among them
groups involved in anything
and imagine or if you go to eat some I
mean I'm sure there's some church bass
troupe and either bought
baltimore-washington I don't know the
scene well enough which is a center for
you know a coordinating Center for all
kinds of peace and justice activities
and you'll find anything in the world
they're just about and that happens
everywhere
