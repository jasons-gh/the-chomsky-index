remember all this privatization you hear
about it's supposed to be very efficient
and buy some measure you know by some
ludicrous measure it probably is
efficient you know and they're part of
the reason why it's efficient is you
don't count the costs okay so like if
you suppose they're talking about
privatizing the MTA around you know the
public transportation thing all right
suppose you privatize the system you and
I know how to make it more efficient by
the economist measures you throw out
union workers and you get temps for half
the price and if there is an accident
because they never had any training was
just people are getting killed you don't
measure that and you cut off the so
called unprofitable bus routes okay or
subway ver it's like you don't make a
lot of money at 11pm okay so let's throw
them out well suppose somebody stuck
somewhere at 11pm and wants to get home
oh well you know its entrepreneurial
values you know let them hire a
limousine or something you know and in
ways like that you can make the system
more efficient simply by transferring
the costs over the public where you'll
measure the costs okay so you know looks
nice and efficient on some some you know
some economists paper but of course you
just this huge costs transferred over
the public which you don't measure we
all know this and that's what
privatizing the educational system will
be also it's doing something else it's
it's going after exactly that moral
conception that underlies the labor
movement from its origins mainly we're
in it together you know it's not just
gain wealth forgetting all but self like
I we should care not only that my kid
can go to school but the kid down the
street can go to school that's what's
being driven out of people's heads you
know that a very powerful effort to
drive any of that out of people's hit
you're only supposed to care about
yourself unless you're rich of course if
you're rich you're part of big socialist
structures called corporations with
strategic alliances and play of support
from the state and then you're allowed
to have all these feelings about yeah we
work together for us the rich guys
but everybody else is supposed to be on
their own you know you're not supposed
to care whether the kid down the street
goes to school it's like breaking its I
mean should be very familiar to people
in the labor movement this is the main
propaganda against the labor movement
all the time I mean right to work laws
everything else you shouldn't work
together that's bad if you work together
you might do something that matters okay
so just be out on your own you know and
if you can get a voucher so maybe your
kid you go to school forget about
everything else I look this this is a
very much a business run society you
know I mean about the last figures I saw
about one out of six dollars and the
whole economy is spent on marketing it's
extremely inefficient use of funds of
course marketing them produce anything
any public goods but marketing is a form
of manipulation and deceit it's it's an
effort to create artificial wants you
know to put people to control the way
people look and think about things a lot
of that marketing is straight propaganda
advertising instantly most of it is tax
free or a lot of it as tax free which
means the way our system works you pay
for the privilege of being propagandized
you know of having all this stuff dumped
on you those are not small figures
that's like a trillion dollars a year in
1992 something on that order and yes
these when you're when you've got that
much of a commitment to controlling
Minds and manipulating desires and so on
and doing all the things they talk about
in the public relations literature
making it up you can read it there and
the social science literature because
this is also standard academic book too
I well you know when you've got those
steaks you're going to work on it hard
and it's going to be hard to fight
against that's what makes organizing
tough it's not just you know well you
know way better than me and I'm not
going to talk about it but you have to
break through a lot of psychic
resistance the whole history of the
labor movement tells you that and as I
say this was well understood by mill
hands and Lowell minor fifty years ago
but yeah it's a big battle and you're
not just struggling against somebody who
calls it a right-to-work act you're
struggling against five hours a day of
television and the movie industry and
the books and the schools and everything
else the scale of the efforts to win the
battle for men's minds is enormous I
mean I thought I knew something about
this stuff but when I read Elizabeth
phones wolf book I was pretty shocked
just to see the scale of the efforts and
the dedication you know the frenzied
dedication to winning this everlasting
battle it's really pretty impressive
although if you think of the stakes it's
not too surprising remarks about the
millions of all and may be the best idea
was for okay let's just talk about the
principle okay I mean I the principle as
far as i can see goes right back to the
Enlightenment you know like if you go
back to classical and liteon month
thought I'm not talking about time Smith
and you know Jefferson and those guys I
the sort of core idea is people have a
right to control their own work you know
ok that the that if a person here i'll
quote some standard formula back in a
18th century you know leading heroes of
the Enlightenment is if a person works
on it if a person does beautiful work
under external command meaning for wages
we may admire what he does but we
despise what he is because not for human
being okay that goes all the way through
classical liberal thought and lighten
methought I mean you know Alexis de
Tocqueville says under wage labor the
art advances the artisan declines now
you find this going right into the
working class movements and Lowell and
Lawrence I think that's just natural I
wouldn't try to convince anybody of it
it seems to me if you think about it
yeah why should you work on command I
mean if you work on command you're some
kind of slave
now why not work because it's coming out
of your needs and interests I mean like
cheap for me to say I'm gonna fence a
university in a science department and I
can do that one of the nice things about
being in the sun in sciences offense a
university is you really do have workers
control I'm to a very large extent we
control what we do you know want to work
on this topic I work on that topic I
mean you gotta sell it to funders and
this and that but the degree of workers
control at the elite level is quite
substantial I mean that's why it's such
a privilege to be in a science
department you know enormously
privileged existence forget the money if
they pay you one tenth the amount of
money it would still be a much better
existence than working on command now I
think people do know that you know I
don't think that these Enlightenment
ideas are hard to grasp I think people
know that if you work on under external
control you may despise admire what the
person does but despise what he is
because his labor you know the sort of
central part of your life is being done
at somebody else's orders and you are
not controlling the way it's done or why
it's done or how it's used or anything
else well you can't have every
individual controlling every single
thing but that's why you have democratic
structures because people control things
together you know okay I I don't know
how to I wouldn't try to convince
anybody of this because I'd frankly just
don't believe that everyone doesn't know
it I think maybe I'm sentimental but it
seems to me if you sort of cut away
waves of you know layers of distortion
and delusion these things that we're
considered pretty obvious 200 years ago
or still obvious
