all right welcome to the conversation on
the tyt network
um tonight we've got a living legend for
you guys
i'm so honored that i get to do these
interviews
uh professor noam chomsky is one of the
most cited
scholars in world history that's literal
uh he's been a long time professor at
mit and now emeritus
uh and uh one of the leading
intellectuals of our times so professor
noam chomsky great to have you back on
the young turks
nice to be with you again all right um
so there's so much to talk about
elections cancel culture
you name it but i can't help but dive in
on manufacturing consent
um so uh
this primary the democratic primary in
2020 to me
uh she probably was a shining example of
of manufacturing consent but i want to
ch check it out at the source here
but the way that i saw it was the
media had done a great number of
negative articles about bernie sanders
uh they had done positive articles about
a number of different candidates but had
not focused on buying after biden one
south carolina
they appeared to be unified in saying
biden is the only electable one and and
bernie uh
will create a massive trouble for the
democratic party
am i seeing that wrong or or did you get
a sense that that's what
was happening and if that's what was
happening
what's the mechanics behind that that
manufactures that particular consent
well there's no question that the
media including the liberal media new
york times and so on
were uniformly opposed to sanders
and dedicated to ensuring that
he would not be nominated that
was hardly concealed
uh they uh however the
narrow question of why he wasn't
nominated should be looked at more
carefully
uh he uh it's true that the media were
completely opposed but that's not the
entire story
uh if if you look at the
exit polls and so on it seemed that
sanders was
counting on a surge of young voters
uh didn't materialize
that was one gift he
basically lost two important
constituencies
women and afro-americans
now the exit polls indicated
that they tended to support
sanders's programs but felt that he
would not be able to
reach out to uh construct a broad enough
coalition
to uh defeat trump which is the
overwhelming concern for pretty obvious
reasons
maybe they were right maybe they were
wrong but that's what it looks like
now the extent to which they were
influenced by
media insistence that he couldn't win
it's very hard to estimate we don't know
what the german judgment hasn't been
looked into
so professor chomsky uh you know the
politics of whether bernie could have
won
or not without the media and how much it
affected it
is super interesting but but in this
context i
what i find to be more interesting is
the mechanics
of how the media comes to a consensus
how does the new york times and npr
and and cnn and msnbc without ever
talking to each other because i don't
think it's a conspiracy i don't think
they talk to one another i don't think
there's memos passed back and forth
how do they come to the same consensus
on their own
they come from a very narrow shared
background where these are deeply
indoctrinated commitments you can see it
very clearly by looking at this
morning's press
so for example there's i think it's in
the washington post
article on the convention you know the
primaries
who spoke last night what they said and
so on
and it's very striking to see that what
they say is
that there was a small voice
didn't dominate for the far
left notice far left
positions of bernie sanders and then it
names the far
left positions what were they
universal medical care and free
higher education can you think of a
country that doesn't have universal
medical care
in the developed world we're the only
one that's far left
how about free higher education all over
the place
finland the country that does best in
international
comparisons rich country germany
rich country mexico poor country
what they call far left
is trying to rise to the level of other
countries
that tells you something that tells you
where that consensus lies the consensus
is
so far to the right that what is
normal throughout the world is
incomparable countries is called far
left well that's an example of how
indoctrination works now it's not that
they talk to each other and say let's
all be on the far right
it's just that's the it's kind of like
the air you breathe
that's what antonio gramsci called the
hegemonic common sense
you just accept it because it's normal
yeah
same on issue after issue so professor
chomsky uh i think that's of course i
think that's exactly right and i mean i
quote you on it
often uh but um and there's
and and so it's in the hiring decisions
and they hire in a very narrow bandwidth
of
of acceptable ideas so
given that is there any hope for the
mainstream media or corporate media
or are they forever going to be
economically conservative because of the
invisible hand of the market and this
process that we have talked about
there's plenty of they're a lot better
than they used to be
i mean we've forgotten what it's like
but if you have a nice long beard you
can remember
you can go back to earlier years i could
give you examples if there was time but
there's no time
but in fact the media that they are
considerably more
open critical uh
open to new ideas than they were
just a few years ago certainly 50 or 60
years ago
the reason i think is uh twofold
partly it's changes in the
those who those who write for the media
today
columnists commentators reporters
are people who came out of the
background that came out of the life of
the
60s and 70s and the aftermath
this was a period of popular ferment
of a highly civilizing effect on the
society
the things that we
that were taken for granted then would
be anathema today
i could run through them but there's no
time and the people have come through
that are just different people
they have a different view of the world
so the
media have somewhat opened furthermore
the general population has changed
there's popular support for
what the media calls far left meaning
moderate social democratic attitudes
comment elsewhere that was not true
before
and the media have to respond to that so
is there hope sure
and the hope lies and where it's always
been popular
activism once every four years to push a
lever is okay
but real politics is what you do day by
day
which lays the basis for the changes
that are sometimes reflected in the
elective system and in the media
well i i wasn't sure you were going to
say that so it's actually encouraging to
hear that and
it sounds like the culture moves the
media
uh and so you could actually create
potentially a virtuous cycle rather than
the visual cycle
that used to exist so but as currently
as things currently stand
that consensus uh that again is at a
bare minimum
very conservative economically still
exists in the corporate media
uh so how do you read a paper day i know
you read
four to five papers a day or you used to
for sure
knowing that they have a certain agenda
and that they will never
admit that agenda how do you physically
how do you consume the news in a way
where you could filter out their agenda
well that makes it easy when propaganda
is hidden
it has to take some work and effort to
dismantle it and correct for it
when it's right on the surface it takes
a minute
you know the way it's going to be
slanted so you instantly compensate for
it it's easy it's even easier in a
totalitarian state
when the propaganda is so gross
that people just laugh at it and then
you
dismantle it quickly it's a little more
subtle here
but not that difficult it's not quantum
physics
that's under where they're coming from
what their assumptions are
and correct for them and then there's
plenty of information
a lot to learn so profess chomsky uh
as as you do that and as you look at the
landscape if you told anybody in
washington
new york hey fox news is propaganda for
the republican party they would largely
agree and they would understand that
how that works uh because but they're
not in that bandwidth of thinking
but if you told them that cnn and ms
well maybe they might believe a little
bit that msnbc is doing propaganda for
the democratic party because they've
been so brazen but if you told them cnn
and new york times and npr are doing
propaganda for the status quo
and the establishment they would think
that you have three heads and that
you're the craziest person that ever
walked the earth
uh so do you do you and they probably do
think that
about you and me but uh what do you
think
that cnn does prop again and new york
times
in a similar way to fox news but it's
just geared towards a different audience
how did i don't try to convince them
just as i wouldn't try to convince the
people who wrote for
profited during the stallions years
they undoubtedly believe what they're
saying i don't think they're lying
it's just that they are the
indoctrination is so profound
that they can't see it i mean take the
one example i gave
uh i'm sure they do think that it's far
left to be to try to rise to the level
of
comparable countries they think that's
far left
okay i'm not going to try to convince
them that it isn't
i would like the audience the population
to understand what's being presented to
them
it's for the public that we're it's the
public that you and i
are approaching not the editors of
journals
we're trying to get the public to see
what's happening in front of their eyes
so that they can compensate for it
and can go on to engage in the kind of
direct constant activism
that has made a considerable change in
the country
and has affected the media too you want
to affect the media
you don't go to them and say look what
you're doing is
propaganda what you do is change the
background situation within which they
function
and from which their journalists
arise where they grew up and developed
that changes things that's why you can't
have the kinds of things
that used to be normal at 450 years ago
in the media
it's changed it's changed because of
popular
engagement that's the way to change
things
that's the way yeah
that's you we're seeing it unfold in
front of ours like just like you said
i'm wondering
one last thing on this is there uh one
or a couple of news sources that you
find to be the most objective that is
more reliable than the rest
first of all the the media say the new
york times washington post
the financial times are perfectly
reliable journalists do serious work
they're
courageous honest you just have to
compensate
for what's left out the shaping
the attitudes and so on
there's many other media with different
points of view we can
turn to your program we can turn to
democracy now
we can turn to the foreign press
many other business press many other
ways of
compensating there's no shortage of
information
and it's really not all that difficult
to overcome the
uh the specific form of
shaping and modifying uh
news and discussion that you see in the
media
once you understand how it works you
quickly compensate for it
pick what's valuable compensate for the
rest
yeah we try to help our audience for
what it's worth by simply declaring our
perspective
so that they know what they're getting
uh and we hope that that's a little
helpful
um we're progressive and we don't mind
saying it i think that pretending
uh that you don't have a perspective is
is
uh problematic ridiculous everyone does
you do i do
we just try to be open and clear about
it
not conceal it make it very clear so
everyone knows where we're coming from
then they can deal with that yeah so
uh you recently signed on to a letter uh
decrying cancer culture
now a lot of people have different uh
ideas about what cancer culture
is and what you meant and everybody else
meant
by signing that uh letter so
i wanted to ask you directly uh what was
your sense of what that letter was
trying to accomplish and why did you
sign it
first of all the letter didn't talk
about canceled culture didn't mention
it there is a canceled culture which the
letter didn't discuss
if i'd written it i would have discussed
it
there's overwhelming resort to castle
culture
on the part of the mainstream
establishment it's their
bread and butter i can give you plenty
of examples from my own experience
ranging from being cut off
at the last second from talking on nbr
because an executive didn't want me to
be on to
closing an entire publisher and
destroying all its
uh stock because they didn't an
executive didn't want a book of mine to
distribute and plenty more in between
and for me it's minor for others it's
much worse
that's just constant what i
understood the litter to be about is
kind of a anodyne comment
in favor of freedom of expression aimed
at
telling small segments of the left
that they're making a mistake both in
principle
and tactically if they adopt
the principles of the mainstream
they're making a mistake and i tell them
directly
so if you wanna if you don't like
charles murray giving a talk the wrong
way to deal with it
is to break up his meeting it's wrong in
principle and it's a gift to the far
right and to him
the right way to deal with it is to
set up a counter
meaning in which you talk about what
he's saying
uses an educational opportunity
everyone gains from it if you break up
the meeting you're saying
you're giving the right wing an
opportunity to say we're the good guys
we have to protect ourselves against
these thugs over there
so giving them a gift is tactically
wrong
and principled wrong and there are good
ways to approach it
that it's a very minor thing you know i
say it all the time
to people on the left i see nothing
wrong with
signing a letter that says we should
defend free speech
so uh profess champion let's give an
example here um i interviewed david duke
back in 2015 because
uh trump was rising and he was a big
supporter of trump
and i wanted to see what form of
discrimination he cares most about
and i thought it was informative because
i thought he was going to say against
latinos or muslims
or or african-americans but he didn't he
mainly focused
on jews and and and then we saw the
trump administration there was attacks
on
synagogues there was charlottesville so
i thought that was a tele
telling interview but there are many who
say no you should not do that
that's platforming david duke and
allowing him to spread his
ideas to more people how would you
respond to that
that's a different question uh
universities
uh other institutions have no
responsibility to invite everyone
okay absolutely not that's not even a
question
they have no responsibility to invite
david duke
okay however if someone in the
university
does invite david duke the right
response
is not to give him a great gift by
breaking it
up and letting him look like the good
guy
the right response at that point is to
expose him
have me have people at his meeting if
you want raising questions
have your own meetings where you bring
up who he's coming from what he's doing
why he's getting support from the trump
administration with their deep-seated
racism and white supremacy bring all
that out
that teaches people organizes people
leads them to do something positive of
course it's harder than just getting in
and shouting and screaming
but it's much more effective right and
uh and i thought the right way to handle
it from my point of view was to
challenge every one of his assertions
with facts and
and show how silly he is but all right
uh i want to use the remaining time to
talk about um perhaps one of the most
important elections of our lifetime this
one
uh so i know that the media says that
about every election
um we're a little different i i thought
the bob dole bill clinton election was
nearly identical candidates uh mitt
romney barack obama it's
uh heresy to say that that they were
very similar candidates in mainstream
media that'll get you banned
uh but they were they're incredibly
similar candidates uh i think
trump is not similar to anyone else but
i i'm
very curious about your opinion uh do
you think that this is an
uh easy decision uh in terms of voting
for buying over
trump or over the green party or anyone
else or do you think it's difficult
well first of all i would take the
traditional left opinion
and say i think it's a completely
not even controversial that we should
vote against
trump now it happens in the system that
exists
voting against trump means taking
five minutes and pushing the lever for
the opposition
okay that's a very small part of
politics
politics is the daily activism
constantly that's teaching
people why trump isn't one of the
fact of the matter the most dangerous
figure
in human history literally
there has been no one else hitler anyone
else
who was dedicated to destroying the
prospects
of human life on earth in the next
in the short term and that's exactly
what he's doing
just take the last couple days which are
typical
opening up new uh
in this case a wildlife reserve a new
region in the alaska for fossil fuel
uh exploitation uh cutting back
regulations on
a release of methane
we see this daily everyone is driving a
spike
into the possibility of organized human
society he does it with wonderful
delicacy
like these last two decisions happen to
coincide
with the report that the green land ice
is probably
reaching an irreversible tipping point
in melting
i mean we have a very severe problem
we have an individual who stands alone
in the world of any significant person
and trying to make the crisis worse
uncontrollable uh destroy
organized human life on earth in order
to enrich his
rich constituency of uh fossil fuel
industries and others
there's been nothing like this there is
simply no
question about who to vote against
now turning to real politics what you do
is vote against and then continue
the work that is pressing the democratic
party program
to the left farther than
any in memory for quite some time
didn't happen because they underwent a
religious conversion
they don't they want to win it because
of groups like
sunrise movement but other activists who
were
pressing all the time were able to get
a number of very good president
delegates elected
where it will change sanders had
enormous success
in shifting the range of
discussable issues and
and even getting the dnc
much against their will i have no doubt
to accept a program that's
well to the left of anything perceiving
that's real politics you also take a
couple of minutes
to do something that is so obvious that
we shouldn't even be discussing
press the lever to get this malignancy
out of our lives and it has to be an
overwhelming vote remember ordinarily
when i'm asked i would say that if
you're not in a sweet state
sometimes even if you're in a sweden
state of it doesn't matter
but if you're not in this wing state do
what you like and don't vote
put green whatever it is this time's a
little bit different
we have a person in office who is unique
in the history of parliamentary
democracy
he has already made it very clear
that he does not intend to accept the
outcome of an election if he loses
they're very clear and there are there
are now
high-level discussions not out of the
fringe
about the ways he would might do it it's
all very possible
now it gets harder for him to peel off
pull off this dictatorial scheme
if there's an overwhelming vote against
it
so in this particular case my
own opinion is even in a swing state one
should vote against it
this is a unique moment there has not
been anyone
like this it's not just
me who thinks so you can read the same
thing in the
state and conservative financial times
of london
where they want to say it'll be terrible
if easily
so uh professor chomsky i gotta ask one
more question then uh so
i think he's an existential threat to
democracy itself
uh bernie sanders said likewise last
night
uh you seem to be indicating something
uh similar to that
but you also mentioned that uh he was
if i i don't want to misquote you you're
right here but it sounded like you were
saying
that he's worse than hitler on mainly on
the issue of climate change because it's
an existence
to all of us right now if that's
true isn't the entire republican party
and some uh democratic
politicians that still take money from
fossil fuel companies
uh if any of them deny climate change
and
in any way slow down efforts uh to
to fix it wouldn't they be in the same
camp as trump then
they're all culpable and in fact what
actually happened
we should look at closely it's
for the republican party it's pretty
recent
in 2008 not that long ago
john mccain ran for president on the
republican ticket
he had a a a climate
a global warming plank in his platform
was nowhere near enough but it was at
least something
the republican senate was
considering legislation about mild
efforts to mitigate climate change
the koch brothers heard this
they'd been pouring money into the
republican party
to ensure that it would not commit this
heresy
uh late david hoke launched a
juggernaut to try to turn the republican
party around
bribing senators intimidating them
threats of running candidates against
them huge
lobbying campaign astroturf campaigns
they switched they became denialists
they were all bought off
now you look at the 2016 primary
every single candidate
either denied that what's happening is
or said maybe it is but it doesn't
matter
there was one who spoke at the
democratic party
a convention yesterday the day before
john kasich he was admired
because he said in 2016 he said yes
global warming is happening in fact he
was the worst of them all
what he said is yes global warming is
happening
he was governor of ohio he said but we
in ohio are going to use our coal
and not apologize for it in other words
he said yes i know we're destroying the
prospects for human life on earth
but we don't mind we're going to
continue doing it
that's what he was praised for okay
so praise that he spoke at the
democratic primary
so yes they're all culpable but trump
is off the spectrum not of course just
him
he and the people around him uh there's
just
nothing like i mean there are some minor
figures in the world like
bolsonaro and brazil who imitate him
but in the may among major figures
is unique in fact unique in history so
i'll say it again
yes worse than hitler hitler wanted to
kill
all the jews as the 30 million slavs
to name to destroy organize human life
on earth
it sounds outrageous but it's true
all right professor noam chomsky uh
