the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
were on the road in Portland Oregon part
of our hundred city tour today though
we're spending the hour with
world-renowned political dissident
linguist author MIT professor Noam
Chomsky as Election Day comes closer
Chomsky examines topics largely ignored
or glossed over during the presidential
campaign including the threat posed to
us power by the Arab Spring well moving
on to just last year the Arab Spring is
another such threat it threatens to take
that big region out of the grand area
that's a lot more significant than
Southeast Asia or South America to go
back to the 1940s the State Department
recognized that the energy resources of
the Middle East are what they call the
one of the greatest material prizes in
world history spectacular sources of
strategic power if we can control Middle
East energy we can control the world and
they take a look at the u.s. you can
British who and Iran in 1953 very
important event its shadow cast over the
world until today that was was a
pretense that it was part of the Cold
War had nothing to with Cold War what it
had to do was the usual fear independent
nationalism and wasn't even concerned
with access to oil or profits it was
concerned with control control of the
oil resources of Iran and in fact of the
region and that's a theme that runs
right through policy decisions not
discussed much but it's very important
to have control exactly as State
Department pointed advisers
out in the 40s you can control control
the oil you can control most of the
world and that goes on so far the threat
of the Arab Spring has been pretty well
contained in the oil dictatorships which
are the most important ones for the West
every effort to join the Arab Spring has
just been crushed by force Saudi Arabia
was so extreme that when there was an
effort to you know go out into the
streets the security presence was so
enormous that people were even afraid to
go out there's a little discussion of
what goes on in Bahrain or it's been
crushed but eastern Saudi Arabia it was
much worse the Emirates totally
controlled so that's okay we managed to
ensure that the threat of democracy
would be smashed in the most important
places and Egypt is an interesting case
it's important country not oil producer
is small one but in Egypt the united
states followed a standard operating
procedure maeve you're going into the
Diplomatic Service you might as well
learn it there's a standard procedure
when one of your favorite dictators gets
into trouble first you support him as
long as possible but if it becomes
really impossible say the army turns
against him then you send them out to
pasture and get the intellectual class
to issue ringing declarations about your
love of democracy and then try to
restore the old system as much as
possible there's case after case of that
somoza and Nicaragua de value in Haiti
and Marcus and the Philippines China and
South Korea abou two in the Congo over
and over limit X genius not to see it
and that's exactly what was done in
in Egypt and what France tried to do not
quite with as much success in Tunisia
well the future is uncertain but the
threat of democracy so far is contained
and it's a real threat I'll return to
that it's also the record important to
recognize that the decline over the past
50 years is to a significant extent
self-inflicted particularly since the
seven days I'll go back to that too but
first let me say a couple of things
about the issues that are most important
today and that are being ignored or not
dealt seriously dealt with seriously in
the electoral campaigns for good reasons
so let me start with the most important
issues there are two of these they're of
overwhelming significance because the
fate of the species depends on them one
is environmental disaster the others
nuclear war I'm not going to take much
time reviewing the threats of
environmental disaster actually there on
the front pages almost daily so for
example last week the New York Times at
a front-page story with the headline
ending its summer melt Arctic sea ice
sets a new low that leads to warnings
the melting this summer was fast far
faster than it was predicted by the
sophisticated computer models and the
most recent United Nations report it's
now predicted that the summer ice and
might be gone by 2020 it was assumed
before that it may be 2050 they quoted
scientists who said this is a prime
example of the built-in conservatism of
our climate forecasts as dire the
warnings are about the long-term
consequences of heat-trapping emissions
many of us fear that they may still be
on us under estimating the speed and
severity of the
pending changes after there's a climate
change study program at MIT where I am
they've been worrying about this for
years and repeatedly have been proven
right The Times report discusses briefly
the severe attacked the severe impact of
all of the sudden the global climate and
it adds but governments have not
responded to the change with any greater
urgency about limiting greenhouse
emissions to the contrary their main
response has been to plan for
exploitation of newly accessible
minerals in the Arctic including
drilling for more oil that is to
accelerate the catastrophe that's quite
interesting it demonstrates an
extraordinary willingness to sacrifice
the lives of our children and
grandchildren for short-term gain or
perhaps an equally remarkable
willingness to shut our eyes so as not
to see impending peril this thing's you
sometimes find with young infants
something looks dangerous close my eyes
and look at it well there is another
possibility I mean maybe humans are
somehow trying to fulfill a prediction
of great American biologist who died
recently Ernst Meier now he argued years
ago that intelligence seems to be a
lethal mutation he had some pretty good
evidence there's a notion of biological
success which is how many of you are
there around you know that's biological
success they pointed out that if you
look at the the tens of billions of
species in human in world history the
ones that are very successful are the
ones that mutate very quickly like
bacteria are the ones that have a fixed
ecological niche like beetles they seem
to make out fine but as you move up the
scale of what we call intelligence
success d climbs steadily when you get
up to mammals it's very low they're very
few of them around there's a lot of cows
it's not because we domesticate them
when you get to humans it's the same
till very recently much to recent that
time to show up in it any evolutionary
accounting the humans were very
scattered there were plenty of other
hominids but they disappeared probably
because humans exterminated them but
nobody knows for sure anyhow maybe we're
trying to trying to show that humans
just fit into the general pattern we can
exterminate ourselves to the rest of the
world with us and we're hell-bent on it
right now well let's turn to the
elections of both political parties
demand that we make the problem worse in
2008 both party flat platforms devoted
some space to how the government should
address climate change today the in the
Republican platform the issue is
essentially disappeared but the platform
does demand that Congress take quick
action to prevent the Environmental
Protection Agency from regulating
greenhouse gases so let's make sure to
make it worse and it also demands that
we open the Alaska's Arctic refuge to
drilling I'm quoting now in order to
take advantage of all of our American
god-given resources it can't disobey God
after all on environmental policy the
program says we must restore scientific
integrity to our public research
institutions and remove political
incentives from publicly funded research
oh that's a code word for climate
science stop funding climate science
Romney himself says there's no
scientific consensus so we should
support more debate and investigation
within the scientific community but no
action except to act to make the
problems worse well what about the
Democrats they concede that there's a
problem and advocate that we should work
toward an agreement to set emissions
limits in unison with other emerging
powers but that's it and no action and
in fact as Obama has emphasized we have
to work hard to gain recalls a hundred
years of energy independence by
exploiting domestic or Canadian
resources by fracking and other
elaborate technologies it doesn't ask
what the world would look like in a
hundred years so there are differences
that the differences are basically about
how enthusiastically the lemmings should
march towards the cliff
let's turn to the second major issue in
nuclear war it's also on the front pages
daily but in a way that would seem
outlandish to some independent observer
the viewing what's going on on earth and
in fact does seem outlandish to a
considerable majority of the countries
of the world the current threat not for
the first time is in the Middle East
focusing on Iran the general picture in
the West is very clear it's far too
dangerous to allow Iran to reach what's
called nuclear capability that is the
capability enjoyed by many powers and
dozens of them to produce nuclear
weapons if they decide to do so as to
whether they've decided US intelligence
says it doesn't know the International
Atomic Energy Agency just produced most
recent report a couple weeks ago and it
concludes all quoted it cannot
demonstrate the absence of an undeclared
of undeclared nuclear material and
activities in Iran that is it can't
demonstrate something which cannot a
condition it can't be satisfied there's
no way to demonstrate the absence of the
work that's convenient therefore Iran
must be denied the right to enrich
uranium that's guaranteed to every Power
that signed the non-proliferation treaty
well that's the picture in the West it's
not the picture in the rest of the world
yes you know I'm sure there was just a
meeting of the non-aligned movement that
large majority of the countries in the
world and of representing most of the
world's population a meeting in Tehran
and once again not for the first time
they issued a ringing declaration of
support for Iran's right to
rich uranium right that every country
has that signed the non-proliferation
treaty pretty much same is true in the
Arab world that's interesting i'll
return to that in a moment there is a
basic reason for the concern it was
expressed succinctly by General Lee
Butler he's the former head of the US
Strategic Command which controls nuclear
weapons nuclear strategy now he wrote
that it is dangerous in the extreme that
in the cauldron of animosities that we
call the Middle East one nation should
arm itself with nuclear weapons which
may inspire other nations to do so
general Butler however was not referring
to Iran he was referring to Israel the
country that ranks highest in European
polls as the most dangerous country in
the world right above Iran and not
incidentally in the Arab world where the
public regard the United States as the
second most dangerous country right
after Israel in the Arab world i ran the
disliked it ranks far lower as a threat
among the populations that is not the
dictatorships with regard to iranian
nuclear weapons nobody wants them to
have them but in many Poles majorities
sometimes considerable majorities have
said that the region would be more
secure if Iran had nuclear weapons to
balance those of their major threats now
there's a lot of commentary in the
Western media journals about our
attitudes towards Iran and what you read
commonly is that the Arabs want decisive
action against Iran which true of the
dictators it's not true of the
populations but who cares about the
poppy
what are called disparagingly the Arab
Street don't care about them that's a
reflection of the extremely deep
contempt for democracy among Western a
leaks I'm so deep that it can't be
perceived you know it's just I like
reflexive this study of popular
attitudes in the Arab world and there is
very extensive study by Western polling
agencies it reveals very quickly why the
US and its allies are so concerned about
the threat of democracy and are doing
what they can to prevent it stick they
certainly don't want attitudes like
lizza just indicated to be become policy
while of course issuing rousing
statements about our passionate
dedication democracy those are relayed
obediently by reporters and commentators
well unlike Iran Israel refuses to allow
inspections at all that refuses to join
the non-proliferation treaty has
hundreds of nuclear weapons as advanced
delivery systems also it has a long
record of violence and repression it has
annexed and settle conquered territories
illegally violation of security council
orders many acts of aggression five
times against lebanon alone no credible
pretext New York Times yesterday you can
read that the Golan Heights are disputed
territory Syrian Golan Heights there is
a UN Security Council resolution 497
which is unanimous declaring Israel's
annexation of Golan Heights illegal and
demanding that it be rescinded and in
fact its disputed only in Israel
and in the New York Times which in fact
is reflecting actual US policy not
formal US policy Iran has a record of
aggression to it in the last several
hundred years it has invaded and
conquered a couple of Arab islands that
was under the Shah u.s. imposed dictator
with us support that's actually the only
case in several hundred years meanwhile
the severe threats of attack continue
you've just been hearing them at the UN
from the United States but particularly
Israel there is a reaction to this at
the highest level in the United States
Leon Panetta Secretary of Defense he
said that we don't want to attack Iran
we hope that Israel won't attack Iran
but Israel's a sovereign country and
they have to make their own decisions
about what they'll do you might ask what
the reaction would be if you reverse the
cast of characters and those of you who
have the antiquarian interests it might
remember that there's a document called
the United Nations Charter foundation of
modern international law which bars the
threat or use of force in international
affairs there are two rogue states
united states and israel with for whom
which regard that the Charter and
international law is just boring or
elements so what they like and that's
accepted well these are not just words
there is an ongoing war includes
terrorism fascination of nuclear
scientists includes economic war us
threats not international ones us
threats have cut I ran out of the
international financial system Western
military analysts
identify what they call weapons of
finance as acts of war the justify
violent response when they're directed
against us that is cutting Iran out of
global financial markets is different
the United States is openly carrying out
extensive cyber war against Iran that's
praised the Pentagon regards cyber war
as an equivalent of an armed attack
which justifies military response but
that's of course when it's directed
against us the leading liberal figure in
the State Department Harold Koh is the
top State Department legal advisor he
says that cyber war is an act of war if
it results in significant destruction
like the attacks against Iranian nuclear
facilities and such acts he says
justified force in self-defense but of
course he means only attacks against the
United States or its clients well
Israel's lethal armory which is enormous
includes advanced submarines recently
provided by Germany the these are
capable of carrying Israel's nuclear
tipped missiles and these are sure to be
deployed and the Persian Gulf or nearby
if Israel proceeds with its plans to
bomb Iran or more likely I suspect to
try to set up conditions in which the
United States will do so and the United
States of course as a vast array of
nuclear weapons all over the world but
surrounding the region from the
Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean
including enough firepower and the
Persian Gulf to destroy most of the
world another story that's in the news
right now is
the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi reactor
in OC rock which is suggested as a model
for Israeli bombing of Iran it's rarely
mentioned however that the bombing of
the osirak reactor didn't end Saddam
Hussein's nuclear weapons program it
initiated it there wasn't a program
before and the osirak reactor was not
capable of producing uranium for nuclear
weapons but of course after the bombing
Saddam immediately turned to developing
a nuclear weapons program and if Iran is
bombed it's almost certain to proceed
just as Saddam Hussein did after the
osirak bombing MIT professor and author
Noam Chomsky continues in a moment if
you'd like a copy of today's show you
can go to our website at
democracynow.org professor Chomsky will
next look at nuclear weapons race as
this week marks the 50th anniversary of
the Cuban Missile Crisis often referred
to as the most dangerous moment and us
in human history back in a moment
