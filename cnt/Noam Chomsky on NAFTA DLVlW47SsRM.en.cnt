the intention and NASA remember was to
ram it through without anybody knowing
about it that's another one of those
stories that was suppressed the NASA
which is obviously a major story the
NAFTA agreement was signed by the three
executives Canada United States and mrs.
Bush and Mexico on it was August 12th
1992 that's right in the middle of a
presidential campaign
you know everybody talking about policy
they signed the NAFTA agreement not a P
you know nobody knew about it there's a
law in the United States 1974 trade law
which requires that the labor Advisory
Council at the Union based organization
be involved in consultation and advice
and you know decisions about any trade
related legislation well they weren't
informed actually they were informed 24
hours before a deadline to give an
opinion they were told on I think it was
September 15th like a month later you
have 24 hour here's the 2,200 page text
they didn't give them the text they just
said here we have a 2,200 page text
tomorrow is your deadline for giving
your opinion about it so they couldn't
even meet actually they did publish
quite a good analysis which was also
none of this was ever recorded nor was
the they're quite good analysis ever
recorded and in fact the idea was that
the whole thing would just ran be rammed
through that by knowing knowing about it
well that didn't quite happen and it
didn't happen precisely because there
was a lot of popular agitation which
made it a big issue and it meant it
continued to the right through the whole
business with not with the public's
pretty strongly opposed to NASA I mean
over the part of the public of had an
opinion it wasn't a lot of people to
know that but of the people who had an
opinion that was roughly 60% were
opposed right through till the end and
that was because of the public agitation
and you know the labor movement and
others and on GATT you know there's been
a huge mobilization 50 years is enough
you know
lost gasquatch change the world bank and
so on of course it doesn't get any
publicity but it's substantial
incidentally as the consequences of
NAFTA you can get them straight out in
the mainstream press very straight the
day after the NAFTA and they're very
revealing the day after NAFTA was passed
finally hey you know they the press was
a hundred percent in favor of it in fact
fanatic about it you know they were
hysterical this goes all the way over
the left
you know what's called the left anthony
louis some people absolutely hysterical
you know bitterly attacking labor for
what louis called its crude threatening
tactics and it's you know unenlightened
attitude because it was opposing this
obviously great thing the Medway know if
i i didn't see an exception to this all
the way across maybe you can find one if
you look but it was close to a hundred
percent hysterical advocacy not just
advocacy the day after NAFTA was passed
the new york times ran its first story
on the expected impact in the new york
region today after it was passed
well the story was euphoric want to be
really terrific and then they described
what would happen they said that it will
be really great for corporate law firms
and investment banks and the public the
publications industry like the new york
times and capital intensive industry
like chemical corporations and you know
all the nice people they'll do fine then
it said there'll also be some losers and
the losers are women blacks hispanics
and semi-skilled workers meaning seventy
percent of the workforce
okay so women blacks hispanics from
seventy percent of the workforce
they'll be losers but you know there's
always got to be winners and losers so
therefore it's terrific
it wasn't a secret though also this was
known in advance like if you read The
Economist so we're advocating NAFTA like
safe Paul Krugman who was in at MIT who
were saying a great thing there was
always a line there somewhere
well yeah semi-skilled workers all lose
income like 70% of the workforce but it
was never really a secret you I mean of
course in a sense it was a secret
because you really had to be in
searching to find it and had to wait
until the day after it was passed to get
the New York Times in the houses of what
I was going to do to the region but they
understood and the same nature of Mexico
at exactly the same effect on Mexico
uses a lot of talk about is it good for
the United States or is it bad for the
United States and that's just totally
meaningless you know you have to ask who
in the United States and who in Mexico I
mean it's great for rich people in
Mexico great for rich people in the
United States and it's bad for everybody
else but that's the purpose of social
policy after all and pretty much names 2
rakat insanely these things are not free
trade agreements these are investor
rights agreements which are a
complicated combination of protection
and Liber liberalisation one of the
things that the times for example
approved of most was the protectionist
elements in NAFTA which they call
intellectual property rights which
radically extend protectionism and
completely new and unprecedented
directions to ensure that the technology
the future will be monopolized by major
corporations and that they India can't
produce cheap drugs or its populations
on those are the things they really were
enthusiastic about these are not free
trade agreements
