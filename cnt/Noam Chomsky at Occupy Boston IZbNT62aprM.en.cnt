how's that okay okay well it's it's a
little hard to talk at a give a talk in
a Howard Zinn memorial lecture at at
occupy meeting and there's mixed
feelings necessarily go along with it
closer
first of all regret that Howard's not
here to take part in and invigorate in
his inimitable way something that would
have been the dream of his life secondly
excitement that the dreams actually
being fulfilled its to dream that for
which he gave he laid a lot of the
groundwork that I said it would have
been the fulfillment of a dream for him
to
I've been here with you and it is a very
exciting development well it is an
extremely exciting development in fact
it's kind of spectacular unprecedented
has never been anything like it that I
can think of if the bonds and
associations that are being established
in these remarkable events can be
sustained through a long art period
ahead because victories don't come
quickly it could turn out to be a really
historic
a very significant moment of American
history the fact that the demonstrations
are on Presley Occupy movement is
unprecedented is quite appropriate the
it's an unprecedented era not just this
moment but actually since the 1970s in
the 1970s there was began a major
turning point in American history since
the four centuries since the country
began it had been developing society and
not in very pretty ways that's another
story but it was a developing society
with ups and downs but the general
progress towards well the
industrialization and development even
in dark and hope there was a lot of a
pretty near constant expectation that
was going to go on like this
that was true even in very dark time so
I'm just old enough to remember the
Great Depression and after the first few
years by the mid 30s although the
situation was objectively that much
harsher than it is today but
nevertheless the Spirit was quite
different there was a sense that we're
going to get out of it even among
unemployed people a lot of my relatives
that it'll get better there's this
there's a militant labor movement
organizing CIO organizing
that was getting to the point of
sit-down strikes which really are very
frightening to the business world you
can see it in the business present of
time and because the sit-down strike is
just a step before taking over the
factory and running it yourself and
something which incidentally is very
much on the agenda today and we should
keep in mind I'll come back to it also
the New Deal legislations were beginning
to come under popular pressure and there
just was a sense somehow we're going to
get out of it that's quite different now
and now there's a kind of pervasive
sense of hopelessness sometimes despair
I think it's quite new in American
history and it has an objective basis in
the 1930s unemployed working people
could anticipate realistically that the
jobs are going to come back if you're a
worker in manufacturing today and they
low unemployment in manufacturing is
approximately like the depression if
current tendencies persist it's not
those jobs aren't going to come back
this the change took place in the 70s a
lot of reasons for it one of the
underlying reasons discussed mainly by
economic historian Robert Brenner's done
a lot of work on it is the falling rate
of profit there were other factors it
led to major changes in the economy a
reversal of the several hundred years of
progress towards industrialization and
development and turned to a process of
the industrialization in the development
of course manufacturing production
continued but overseas very profitable
but
no good for the workforce and along with
that came a significant shift of the
economy from productive enterprise
producing things people need or can use
to the financial manipulation
financialization of the economy really
took off at that time before the before
the 70s banks were banks they did what
banks are supposed to do in a state
capitalist economy take unused funds
like say your bank account transferred
to some potentially useful purpose
buying a home sending a kid to college
or whatever might be that changed
radically in the Senate only there were
no financial crises it was a period of
enormous growth highest growth in
American history maybe in economic
history sustained growth for the 50s and
60s and it was a Galit area so the
lowest quintile did about as well as the
highest went down a lot of people moved
into reasonable lifestyles what's called
your middle class working classic skull
from other countries but they thought
was real and that the sixties
accelerated the activism the sixties
after a pretty dismal decade really
civilized the country in lots of ways
that are permanent you know did I change
your staying
70s came along sudden sharp change the
industrialization offshoring of
production shifting to financial
institutions which grew enormously also
and I should say that in the 50s and 60s
there was also the development of what
several decades later became the
high-tech economy computers internet IT
revolution mostly developed in the 50s
and 60s substantially in the state
sector took a couple of decades before
took off but it was developed there the
1970s the developments it took place set
off a a kind of a vicious cycle that
because it led to concentration of
concentration of wealth increasingly in
the hands of the financial sector which
doesn't benefit the economy probably
harms it in the society but it did lead
to tremendous concentration of wealth
substantially there the concentration of
wealth yields concentration of political
power which in turn gives rise to
legislation that increases that
accelerates the cycle the physical
policies tax changes rules of corporate
governance deregulation essentially
bipartisan along side of this cave
began the very sharp rise in the costs
of elections which drives
the political party is even deeper than
before into the pockets of the corporate
sector couple years later started a
different process which has been
described particularly but Tom Ferguson
is going to be here Monday he probably
will talk about it so I won't much but
the party's people was dissolved
essentially it used to be that if you
wanted to if a person in Congress hoped
for a position of say a committee chair
or something or some position of
responsibility you've got it mainly
through seniority and service no within
a couple of years you started having to
put money into the party coffers in
order to get ahead that just drove the
whole system even deeper into the
pockets of the corporate sector increase
in the financial sector that tremendous
concentration of wealth mainly
the top one-tenth of one percent of the
population meanwhile for the general
population it began it opened a period
of this pretty much stagnation or even
decline for the majority people got by
but by artificial means of borrowings
about a bit the longer working hours
pretty soon much higher than in other
industrial countries he passed your fan
can't hear me
sorry still how about that so there was
a period of stagnation and decline for
the majority that continued long side of
our sharp concentration of wealth the
political system began to dissolve that
has always been a gap between public
policy and the public will but it just
proved kind of astronomically that you
can see it right now in fact the the big
thing can't hear me I don't know what to
do about it these things are in my mouth
I'll just keep going you can make it up
okay all right let's take a look at
what's on YouTube okay take a look
what's happening right now the the big
topic in Washington everyone
concentrates on is the deficit for the
public correctly the deficit is not
regarded as much of an issue and it
isn't really much of an issue then the
issues joblessness not a deficit there's
a deficit Commission but there's no
joblessness commission as far as the
definitions deficit is concerned they
won't pay attention to it
the public has opinions take a look at
the polls overwhelmingly support higher
taxes on the wealthy which is declined
sharply
stagnation period period of decline
higher taxes on the wealthy and preserve
the limited social benefits the outcome
of the deficit Commission is probably
going to be the opposite either they'll
reach an agreement which will be the
opposite of what the public wants or
else it goes into the kind of a
automatic procedure which is going to
have those effect actually that's
something that has to be done very
quickly deficit Commission is gonna come
up with its decision in a couple of
weeks the Occupy movements could provide
a mass base for trying to avert what
amounts to a dagger pointed at the heart
of the country could have very negative
effects it's an immediate test well
without going on the details what's
being played out for the last 30 years
is actually a kind of a nightmare that
was anticipated by the classical
economists it takes a Adam Smith bother
to read wealth of nations and he
considered the past
ability that the merchants and
manufacturers in England might decide to
do their business abroad invest abroad
and import from abroad he said they
would profit but England would be harmed
however he went on to say that they
would prefer to the merchants
manufacturers would prefer to operate in
their own country but sometimes called a
home buyer and so as if by an invisible
hand England would be saved the ravages
of what's now called neoliberal
globalization that's a pretty hard
passage to miss in his classic Wealth of
Nations that's the only occurrence of
the phrase invisible and maybe England
would be saved from neoliberal
globalization by an invisible hand is
the other great classical economist
David Ricardo recognized the same thing
and hoped that it wouldn't happen kind
of sentimental hope and it didn't for a
long time but now it's happening the
last 30 years that's exactly what's been
underway for the general population you
know the 99% in the imagery of the
Occupy movements that said it's been
pretty harsh and could get worse that
this could be a period of irreversible
decline for the 1% even more 1/10 of 1%
it's just fine there are you know at the
top of the Richard never more powerful
than ever
controlling the political system
disregarding the public and if it can
continue sure why not just what
some Ricardo warned about the so for
example takes a city group one of the
most for decades one of the most corrupt
of the major kind of investment banking
corporations repeatedly bailed out by
the taxpayer over and over again
starting in the early breagan years no
once again that won't run through the
corruption probably know about it it's
pretty astonishing a couple of years ago
they came out with a brochure for
investors they urged investors to put
their money in what they called the
plutonomy index i said the country the
world is dividing into a plutonomy you
know the rich that medicines buy luxury
goods and so on and that's where the
action is they said their economy index
is way outperforming the stock market so
put your money into it and as for the
rest we set on a drift in order to care
about them you don't need them they have
to be around to provide a powerful state
which will protect us and bail us out
when we get to trouble but other than
that they essentially have no function
and they're sometimes called these days
the precariat the people who live a
precarious existence of the periphery of
society it's not the periphery anymore -
becoming very substantial part of the
society in the United States and indeed
elsewhere and that this is considered a
good thing
so for example Alan Greenspan
at the time doctors
now I'm Greenspan was still you know st.
Allen hailed by the economics profession
it was one of the greatest economists of
all time this was before the crash that
for which he was substantially
responsible he was testifying to
Congress in the Clinton years explaining
the wonders of the great economy that he
was supervising and he said a lot of the
success of this economy said is based on
substantially on way called growing
worker insecurity please please stay off
of the roped in grass area over there
that's a very nicely done organic area
and we're trying to keep it clean
Greenspan Greenspan testified that the
very successful economy he was
supervising which has the properties I
described was based substantially on
growing worker insecurity if working
people are insecure if they're part of
what we now call the precariat living
precarious existences then we're gonna
make demands and I'm gonna try get wages
they won't get benefits we can kick them
out if we don't like them and that's
good for the health of the economy
that's what's called a healthy economy
technically and he was very highly
praised for this greatly admire well now
the world is indeed splitting into a
putana me and a precariat again in the
imagery of the Occupy movements the 1%
in the 99% literal numbers that's the
right picture and the plutonomy is where
the action is well it could continue
like this and if it does continue this
historic a reversal that began in the
1970s could be
irreversible but we were heading and the
Occupy movements are you know the first
real major reaction popular reaction
which could have hurt this but as I said
it's going to be necessary to face the
fact that it's a long hard struggle you
know win victories tomorrow have to go
on they have to form the structures that
will be sustained they'll go on through
hard times and can win major victories
now there are a lot of things that we've
done I mentioned before the I mentioned
before that in the 1930s one of the most
effective actions was a sit-down strike
the and the reason is very simple that's
just a step before takeover of the
industry well at through the 70s as the
decline was setting in there were some
very important events that took place
one was in the late 70s of 1937 the US
Steel decided to close one of its major
facilities Youngstown Ohio and instead
of just walking away the workforce and
the community that decided to get
together and buy it from u.s. steel and
hand it over to the workforce to run and
turn it into a worker owned worker
management facility they didn't win but
with enough popular support they could
have won and it was a partial victory is
a topic that the gar alperovitz
particularly is discussed in detail as a
partial victory because even though they
lost it set off other
efforts and now throughout Ohio it
affected other places there's a
scattering of hundreds maybe thousands
of sometimes not so small worker-owned
or at least partially worker owned
industries which could become worker
managed and that's the basis for a real
revolution that's how it takes place
it's happening here too just in one of
the suburbs of Boston about a year ago
something similar happened multinational
decided to close down a profitable
functioning manufacturing facility whose
when some high-tech manufacturing not
profitable enough for them the workforce
in the Union offered to buy it and take
it over and run it themselves and the
multinational decided to close it down
instead probably for reasons of class
consciousness I don't think they want
things like this to happen if there had
been enough popular support if there'd
been something like this movement and it
could have gotten involved they might
have succeeded and there other things
going on like that in fact some of them
are major so not long ago Obama took
over the auto industry
it's basically owned by the public and
there were a number of things that could
have been done one was what was done at
reconstitute it so that it can be handed
back to the ownership or very similar
ownership and continue on its
traditional path the other possibility
was to hand it over to the workforce
which owned it anyway turn it into
worker owned worker managed major
industrial system that's a big part of
the economy and have it produced things
that people need and there's a lot that
we need we all know or should know that
the u.s. is just really backward
globally in high-tech and high-speed
transportation it's very sorry serious
that not only affects people's lives
affects
economy it's a very serious business
just had a personal story I happen to be
giving talks in France a couple months
ago and ended up in southern France and
had to take a train from Avignon
southern southern France but to the de
Gaulle Airport in Paris it took two
hours it's the same distance as
Washington to Boston I don't know if
you've taken that train but it's about
what it was you know 60 years ago when
my wife and I first took it and it says
it's a scandal you know but it could be
done they had the capacity to do it the
skilled workforce we've taken a little
support that popular support and that
could have made a major change in the
economy just to make it more surreal
now while this option was being avoided
the Obama administration was sending its
Transportation Secretary to Spain to get
contracts for developing high-speed rail
for the United States which could have
been done right in the rest bill which
is being closed down there's no economic
reasons why this can't happen these are
class reason and reflect the lack of
popular political mobilization well
things like this continue
you can see why I'm not a public speaker
this doesn't okay well I'll just like
then a little late but well I think I've
probably talked enough anyway so let me
just say that and I'd like to make more
sense to turn this over to public
discussion but I kept to domestic issues
and these are by no means the only ones
you all know that there's very dangerous
developments in the international arena
including two of them which are kind of
a shadow that hangs over almost at
everything we discuss there are for the
first time in human history real threats
to peace and survival of the species
they're to the one has been hanging
around for since 1945 and it's kind of a
miracle we escaped it that's the threat
of nuclear nuclear war nuclear weapons
and though it isn't being less discussed
that threat is in fact being escalated
by policies of this administration and
its allies and that something has to be
done about that or we're in real trouble
now the other of course is an
environmental catastrophe the world is
frankly every country in the world is
taking at least halting steps towards
trying to do something about it
the u.s. is also taking steps mainly to
accelerate the threat the u.s. is the
only country major country that's not
I'm not doing something constructive but
it's not climbing on the train it's
pulling it backward
Congress right now is a dismantling and
the legislation instituted by the Nixon
really the last liberal president of the
United States it shows you what's been
going on there dismantling the limited
measures of the Nixon administration to
try to do something about what's a
growing emerging catastrophe and this is
connected with a huge propaganda system
perfectly openly declared by the
business world to try to convince people
that it's all just the liberal hoax
there what the attention these
scientists are really regressing back to
the medial period it's not a joke
now if that's happening in the most
powerful richest country in history this
catastrophe isn't going to be averted
and everything else we're talking about
won't matter in a generation or two well
all that's going on right now something
has to be done about it very soon very
you know dedicated sustained way it's
going to be it's not gonna be easy to
proceed there are gonna be barriers
difficulties hardships failures it's
inevitable but unless the process that's
taking place here and elsewhere in the
country and around the world
unless that continues to grow and
becomes kind of a major force in the
social and political world the chances
for a decent future are not very high
so few questions right now it's a little
hard to see I guess why don't we take oh
hold on room I just called on this
person I think if I'm doing it I'll do
it and I'll call you next as far as
fixing
invention
so hold on just a sec he's talking about
corporate personhood and getting the
money out of that stream in politics
yeah that's these are very good things
to do but you can't do this or anything
else unless there's a large active
popular base mostly if the Occupy
movement was you know the leading force
in the country you could push this
forward but remember most people don't
know that this is happening
um they may know about it but not know
what it is and among those who do know
polls show that a lot of support but
that assigns a task it's necessary to
get out into the country and get people
to understand what this is about and
what they can do about it
and what the consequences are of not
doing about it
not doing anything about it and
corporate personhood is a important case
in point but pay attention to what it is
we should think about it how did you
read the you know we're supposed to
worship the Constitution these days the
Fifth Amendment the Constitution says
that no person shall be deprived of
Rights without due process of law
well the founding fathers didn't mean by
person they didn't mean person so for
example there were a lot of creatures of
flesh and blood who weren't persons the
indigenous population for example though
they didn't have any rights though there
was a category of creatures called
three-fifths human in the Constitution
slave population they weren't persons
and in fact women women were barely
persons so they
have rights well a lot of this was
somewhat rectified over the years
they've during the civil war the 14th
amendment raised the 3/5 humans to full
humans at least in principle but that
was only in principle I won't go through
what happened next
but at least in principle now if you
come tilt over the following years the
concept of person was changed by the
courts in two ways the one way it was to
broaden it to include corporations legal
fictions established and sustained by
the state in fact these persons later
became the management of corporations
according to the court decisions so the
management of corporations they became
persons first it's not what about what
the 14th amendments that it was it also
narrowed that to undocumented immigrants
they had to be excluded from the
category of persons and that's happening
right now
so the legislations that you're talking
about they go two ways
they broaden the category of persons to
include corporate persons which may now
have rights way beyond human beings
given by the trade agreements and others
and they exclude the people who flee
from you know Central America or the
u.s. devastated their homelands free
from Mexico because they can't they
can't compete with the US say highly
subsidized US agribusiness remember when
NAFTA was passed in 1994 Clinton
administration understood very well that
it was going to devastate the Mexican
economy and that's the year when they
started militarizing the border well
okay
now we're getting the consequences and
these people have to be excluded from
the category of persons so when you talk
about personhood that's right but
there's more than one aspect to it and
it ought to be pushed forward and all
ought to be understood and acted upon
but that requires a mass base it
requires that the population understands
this and is committed to it so it's easy
to think of a lot of things that should
be done but they all have a prerequisite
namely a mass popular base is there
which is committed to implementing and
we have a question about the ruling
class and America how likely is it that
they will have an open fascist system
here I think it's very unlikely frankly
the they don't have the force about a
century ago in the freest countries in
the world Britain in the United States
the at that time theme you know the
dominant classes came to understand that
they can't control the population by
force any longer too much freedom had
been won by struggles like these at so
they and they realized it I mean it's
self conscious discussed in their
literature and they recognize that
they're gonna have to shift the tactics
to control of attitudes and beliefs
instead of just the cudgel them you
don't throw away the cudgel but it's not
can't do what it used to do you have to
control attitudes and beliefs in fact
that's when the public relations
industry began began in United States
and England the free countries really
have a major industry to control beliefs
and attitudes to induce consumerism and
there's passivity apathy distraction all
the things you know very well and that's
what's been going on but you know it's
it's a barrier but it's a lot easier to
over
then you know torture and you know gonna
stop and I don't think they are anymore
in the circumstances exist any longer
for instituting anything like what we
called fascism
excellent and John from the library
would like to ask his question and then
I have a few notes here if you stand up
I will pass a note card to you and if
you could write your question I've got
one question over here and one question
over there headed towards me but if you
stand up we'll try to fit in a few
others sir I have a two-part question
that I've been waiting to ask you my
whole life you mentioned earlier that
sit-down protests were just precursors
to a takeover of industry I'd ask a like
oh I'd like to ask you if today you
would advocate a general strike as an
effective tactic moving forward and
second if would you ever if asked allow
for your voice to relay the
democratically chosen will of our nation
not sure and my voice wouldn't help I
can't even reach you and besides you
don't want leaders you want to do it
yourself
we need representation but you should
pick it yourselves and they should be
recallable representatives you're not
gonna fall into some system of control
in hierarchy but it's this question of
the general strike is like the others
you can't it's you can think of it as a
possible idea at a time when the
population is ready for it we can't like
we can't sit here and declare a general
strike obviously there has to be
approval agreement willingness to take
the risks to participate on the part of
a large mass of the population and that
takes organization education activism
education doesn't mean just you know
telling people what to believe it means
learning ourselves as a famous line of
car walks which I'm sure you all know
that the task is not just to understand
the world but to change it and there's a
variant of that which also should be
kept in mind if you want to change the
world in a constructive direction you
better try to understand
first and understanding it doesn't mean
listening to a talk reading a book
although that's helpful sometimes it
means learning and learning you learn
through participation that you learn
from others you learn from the people
you're trying to organize and you have
to gain the experience and understanding
which will make it possible to maybe to
implement ideas like that as a tactic
but there's a long way to go
that doesn't happen by a flick of a
wrist that happens by hard long-term
dedicated work and I think in many ways
maybe the most exciting aspect of the
Occupy movement is just the construction
of these associations and bonds linkages
and others that are taking place all
over the place all over whether it's a
cooperative kitchen or something else
and out of that if they can be sustained
can come and expand it to the large part
of the population that doesn't even know
what's going on if that can happen then
you can raise questions about tactics
like this which could cook very well at
some point be appropriate we have two
questions about the Occupy worldwide how
do you think we can effectively target
problems to bring about change and what
should we make demands
the other thing they should have
proposals and ideas they don't they
don't have to be total agreement on them
there's good reason to let a hundred
flowers bloom there's lots possibilities
but there are very sensible proposals
starting from very short-term ones to
let's prevent the deficit Commission
from carrying out a really lethal blow
against the society that might have
lasting effects in the next couple of
weeks
that's pretty short-term there are
longer term things like say the ones I
mentioned helping the the workforce and
the Boston suburb I mentioned to take
over their own industry instead of
becoming jobless that going on to say
maybe do the same thing with all the
auto industry now there's many more
things like that coming along turning
the country to a leader in the effort to
try to mitigate maybe overcome the
tremendous threat of global warming
instead of a follower in fact a leader
in the practically the only participant
in the campaign to accelerate the threat
all of those are things that you can do
that we should have those proposals
about dealing with corporate personhood
is another proposal but I would suggest
that it be broadened to deal with the
distortion gross distortion in the
concept of person which both broadens it
to include corporate entities and
narrows it to exclude people know people
who have every reason to be treated as
persons and they're plenty of other
demands you can think of and they should
be formulated maybe not everyone has to
agree on the ranking of priorities or
and the choice of demands but groups can
pursue and there's a lot that can be
done should we rewrite the system and
how can we mobilize the American public
the only way to mobilize the American
public that I've never heard of or any
other public is by going out and joining
them so going out to wherever people are
the churches clubs schools unions
wherever they may be and getting
involved with them and trying to learn
yourself from them and to bring about a
change of consciousness among them and
again this is can be very concrete when
I take say the electoral system in the
United States it has a lot of flaws like
what I mentioned that public policy and
public opinion are so radically divorced
but there's some narrower things that
you can do something about right away
let me take the front we're coming up to
the primary system okay suppose we had a
functioning Democratic Society let's
just imagine that what would a primary
be say New Hampshire that what would
happen at a primary would be that the
people in a town would get together and
discuss and talk about and argue about
what they want policy to be kind of like
what goes on here and they should
formulate their conception of what the
policy should be then if a candidate
says I want to come talk to you the
people in the town or to say well you
can come listen to us if you want so you
come in we'll tell you what we want and
if you can sort of persuade us that
maybe you'll do it
maybe we'll vote for you that's what
would happen in a democratic society
that what happens in our society the
candidate comes to town with his PR
agents and the rest of
and give some talks and says look how
great I am there's what I'm going to do
for you anybody with a gray cell
function and doesn't bleep work and burn
he or she says and then you know maybe
they vote or maybe they don't
now that's very different from a
Democratic Society and you know making
moves in that direction is not utopian
those are things can be done in
particular communities and it could lead
to a noticeable change in the political
system
oh yeah sure we should get money out of
politics but that's gonna take yeah a
lot of a lot of work and one way to go
at it is just to elect our own
representatives and it's not impossible
and you know the same is true all across
the board I mean let's go back to the
deficit again the population understands
that it's not the primary problem in
fact not even a major problem the
population has a sensible attitude about
what ought to be done with it
higher taxes for the rich let's go back
to the way things were during the big
growth periods and preserve the benefits
which are limited they ought to be
improved but there's something else
which isn't even being discussed the
deficit would be eliminated literally if
the United States had a health care
system of a kind that other industrial
countries
that's not utopian you know the idea
that we should have a health care system
like other industrial countries and
that's not kind of wild radical raving
but that would probably leave a surplus
the u.s. I'm sure you'll know has its
health care systems a total
international scandal about twice the
per capita costs of comparable countries
some of the worst outcomes that huge
number of people just uninsured while to
get it that's going to get worse the
problems not Medicare the Medicare is
indeed a problem they talk about that
but it's a problem because it goes
through the privatized unregulated
system which is
totally dysfunctional well you can't
talk about this in Washington because of
the power of financial institutions the
public the large part of the public
wants it in fact for decades substantial
parts of the population often the big
majorities have been in favor of this
but it can't be talked about too much a
powernow of financial institutions well
that can be changed you know that's not
it's not pie in the sky and to the
extent that the deficit is a problem
that's one thing that could be done
about it and the other thing that we've
done you'll know about raised military
system which has about the same expenses
as the rest of the world combined and
not for defense in fact it's actually
harmful for to us if you look at it that
doesn't have to be like that so there
are things that are quite feasible but
of course proposals about them have to
be made and they have to be brought to
the population in a convincing way and
many most of the population already
agrees to most of them but you got to
turn it into a force that will be active
and engaged then you can have results
I also have two points of information
this presentation is on the livestream
and will be recorded at occupy
boston.com you can look on the
livestream and come back I also have a
phone number it seems a little odd to
say but if you could call this number
six zero five four seven five four zero
zero one and then put in the code six
one two eight nine one you can hear it
live and one other point of information
there is occupy Congress look for it on
the web it's very new let's just do it
well I think that's a pretty good answer
to the question publicly financed
campaigns let's just do it we pick our
own representatives we finance them we
vote for them and if the corporation's
pour money into somebody else's pockets
okay they can spend it on luxury goods
that can be done but only if you have an
organized engaged public there's lots of
things you can propose but they all go
back to the same basic conclusion you
have to have an organized dedicated
public that's willing to implement them
and if there is a lot of options are
open up including these
so I think this will be the last
question could you please share your
thoughts on the significance of occupy
of the Occupy the hood movement and any
insights you may have regarding
cross-cultural Organization for social
change oh that's a great movement and I
heard just coming out here to this
evening that the first occupy hood
action took place just yesterday in
Boston and it's been happening in other
places in New York and elsewhere and
that's perfect I mean it's the kind of
reaching out into the general community
that makes sense
people have to do it themselves you know
I can't tell people how to organize in
Roxbury and if I if I told them they
shouldn't listen to me they know how to
do it and they all of that we should
work hard to get this integrated and
that means again not just telling people
here's what you got to believe but
learning from them
what do they want what do they need what
can we learn from them how can we find
ways to work together to overcome
barriers and tensions and become part of
a you know a dedicated ongoing sustained
movement which and I stress again it's
gonna have to last a long time
because most of these goals that we're
talking about that can't be attained in
a couple of weeks or months actually
some of them can but most of them are
long struggle and people with power
don't give it up unless they have to
and that takes work
