one of the features of contemporary
economic systems is what's called
imposing flexibility and labor markets
that's considered a wonderful thing
labor markets are supposed to be
flexible it's a fancy way of seeing
saying you don't know when you go to
sleep at night whether they have a job
tomorrow morning and that can that
contributes to efficiency anybody who's
taken an economics course understands
that you get more efficiency if people
have no security they're not what's
going to happen to them tomorrow then
you can move around it's just like a
like a tool so if you can get labor
market flexibility then you get a kind
of efficiency but of course there's a
cost for example one of the costs is
mental illness the International Labour
Organization just did a study in which
they found that the incidence of mental
illness among workers has increased very
sharply which they attributed plausibly
to working insecure workers insecurity
on the other hand you can look at this
as a gain so like when Alan Greenspan
that the Federal Reserve tells Congress
about what a wonderful economy he's
running he a trip it's a good part of it
the what he calls growing worker
insecurity because then people can't
after they're afraid to ask for better
wages or more benefits and profits go up
and inflation stays down and you get a
fairytale economy except for the
population but you know they're tools
the tools of production and the units of
consumption so they're doing their job
if that's what they do
