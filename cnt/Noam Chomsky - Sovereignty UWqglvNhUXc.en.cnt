when you're part of any systems whatever
it is a family a country a world if you
want to be part of it
you're making a compromise you're giving
up certain degree of freedom of action
because of the gains that come to you or
to others not just to you from
solidarity and participation and the
same is true of sovereignty I said
national sovereignty is in itself is of
no value it's a value insofar as it
contributes to a human welfare the human
rights to freedom and so on in this
world participation in an international
community which is a constructive and a
healthy one is good for everybody not
just us but everyone else so I don't see
any contradiction between maintaining
our trying to maintain our control of
our own polity that is in fact trying to
create control over it because we're
gonna have much control over the way
decisions are made within our own
community state you know
nation and so on and making the decision
our own decision to subordinate some of
those choices to international
institutions which can express a broader
notion of solidarity and cooperation I
mean there's no you know these are like
the kind of choices you make if you
decide to live in a family and any
bigger unit
