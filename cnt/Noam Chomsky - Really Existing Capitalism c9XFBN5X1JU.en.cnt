capitalism would self-destruct and
that's why it hasn't been instituted the
Masters understand that they cannot
survive a capitalist economy plus a fair
economy they take a look at the history
it's pretty interesting so the United
States when it was was independent so it
could reject the rules with sound
economics that developed there were
other countries that were poised for
Industrial Revolution and were given the
same advice like Egypt and India in fact
India already was the commercial
industrial center of the world the more
so than England Egypt was poised for
Industrial Revolution and it's not
impossible that it might have developed
was a rich agrarian society it had
cotton produced cotton as I say that's
the main product like oil today and it
didn't need slaves that hasn't it had a
developmental government aimed at
industrial development that could have
taken off just as India could have taken
off but they were not free to reject
sound economics because they were ruled
by British force so they were forced to
accept sound economics and Egypt became
Egypt when the United States became the
United States India went through a
century of D development until it
finally got independence that's what
happens when you apply less a fair
principles in fact that's essentially
the third world and the first world
divided you take a look at the countries
that developed there are the countries
who violated the principles England the
United States Germany France the local
Netherlands
one country of the South one country
developed Japan the one country that
wasn't colonized and was able to pursue
the same course that the rich countries
developed I mentioned that in mid 19th
century 1846 Britain was so far ahead of
the rest of the world in industrial
development that they did I decide that
Lizzie fair would be possible so they
moved to what's called a free trade
Europe and didn't first of all they
imposed sharp constraints on it they cut
off the end india india was not allowed
that others could not invest in india
their main possession and india was not
allowed to develop there were other
restrictions and pretty soon british
capitalists called the game off because
they couldn't compete and by the 1920s
they couldn't compete with Japanese
production so they literally closed off
the Empire to Japanese exports as a part
of the background for the Pacific War at
nineteen in the 1940s that the United
States did the same with its smaller
environment Philippines the Dutch did
the same with Indonesia and all the
Imperial systems decided no more free
trade we can't compete so they closed
off the empire being in Japan had no
markets no resources and they went to
war that's a large part of the
background the United States in 1945 did
move towards as a fair fact that was an
important conference the United States
was basically running the world at that
point
obvious reasons that was a hemispheric
conference called by Washington February
1945 and thanks
so we're the Western Hemisphere was
compelled to adopt an economic charter
for the Americas which which bend any
interference with market principles the
goal was read the State Department
reports to oppose the new nationalism in
Latin America which is based on the idea
that the resource that the people of a
country should benefit from the
country's resources that's evil can't
allow that it's Western and us investors
who have to benefit from their resources
so that was the economic Charter the
Americas imposed on the countries that
hemisphere with one exception here the
United States did not follow those
policies quite the contrary
as I mentioned there was a massive
development of a state because based
economy with an industrial policy the
kind that created the modern high-tech
economy you can see it right across the
river take a look take a look at MIT
right one of the main centers of this if
you looked at MIT in the 1950s I got
there it was surrounded by electronics
based high-tech firms like Raytheon and
high tech you know huge IT firms you
take a look at MIT today take a look the
buildings its Novartis Pfizer and so on
the reason is completely obvious during
the fifties and sixties the cutting edge
of the economy was electronics based so
the way to get the public to pay for it
was to scream Russians and to get them
to pay higher taxes for the Pentagon and
then the Pentagon would fund
the research and development like my own
salary for example I shouldn't complain
too much and the and of course a private
is so-called private industry was around
they're like vultures to pick up the the
products and the research in this market
well since the seventies the cutting
edge of the economy has been moving
towards being biology based so funding
government funding has shifted Pentagon
fund a is declining funding from the NIH
and other for both health-related
government institutions is increasing
the private corporations understand that
so now the Novartis you know Jen genetic
engineering firms and so on are hanging
around trying to pick up the research
that you're paying for so that they
could market it and make profits
it's just transparent it's in front of
our eyes and it takes a very effective
educational system to prevent people
from seeing it it's virtually
transparent that's the way really
existing capitalist democracy works
