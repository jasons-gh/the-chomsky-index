Peace in the territory I guess there's
no chance key internationally respected
professor of linguistics linguistics at
MIT he's a political activist and he is
the author of a very controversial new
book called the faithful triangle it's
good to meet you good to have you here
Radley here um what happened at the end
of World War 2 1948 or so about the
territory that we're going to talk about
tonight well in 1937 the United Nations
made a recommendation that the territory
should be partitioned between the two
groups that claimed national rights
there where is there at that time well
originally of course there were passed
in ian's and has very small Jewish
community which in fact was a mostly
anti Zionist
was it a country of Palestine well this
is an area that had never none of these
regions had really been this is prior to
the establishment of a state system
these have been region basically under
the control of Britain and France and
earlier the the Turkish for many years
the state system was just emerging
throughout the whole region at that
point so for example Lebanon received
independence only in 1943 Palestine was
a part of was under the British crown
under British Mandate and the British
had at that point decided to give it up
the they turned the issue over to the
United Nations there was a conflict
between these two national groups the
original dominant population of
Palestinians the Jewish immigrants who
had come in over the years and the
partition was decided upon that Loeb to
a civil war in the Civil War we the
Jewish community which was much more
much better organized and better and in
fact was on the ascendancy by 1948 by
May 1948 when the State of Israel was
established
about 300,000 Palestinians had already
either fled or been expelled and the
Jewish state minute was established and
they 48 extended into the region well
into the region that was supposed to be
assigned to the Palestinian state at
that point Arab armies entered and
fighting went on for well over a year
the Jewish state expanded during the
fighting and that lid for the 1949
boundaries which were then stable until
until the 1967 war okay as long as you
can do it in pretty rapid order and yeah
take us what happened in 2a to the
elements and the territory okay in the
ensuing year well to be precise that
there was an armistice in 1949 and that
lasted really until 1956 in 1956 Israel
jointly with France and England attacked
Egypt and Israel conquered the Sinai the
United States at that point was opposed
to that and it forced them out at first
the British and the French out and
compelled Israel to withdraw to its 1949
boundaries when things did that way
there was always plenty conflict along
the border but there wasn't another
major war until 1967 when Israel
considering itself to be under threat
from Egypt attacked Egypt and in the
course of that war six-day war Israel
conquered the Sinai again conquered what
we now call the West Bank the Gaza Strip
and then after the ceasefire conquered
the Syrian Golan Heights where all that
led to the current borders up until 1982
in 1982 Israel attacked Lebanon and now
holds part of southern Lebanon and
that's roughly where things stand your
view if I understand correctly is both
the Palestinian integers have valid
claims in that area yeah I think so and
I think it's it's complicated but I
can't see how anyone can doubt that the
indigenous population has a valid claim
and I think it's just not questioned in
the world scene anymore
that Israel has whatever right any other
state has to its integrity and security
it was created to be the homeland of
Israel right it was well under what one
can argue about whether it was right or
wrong at the time but that's essentially
academic I mean the right it exists
there's no doubt that it exists it has a
right to exist as much as any other
state does the question is where does it
have a right to exist in a way which
denies to the Palestinians to the
indigenous population any national
rights the real question the real
operative question now is and it's
really a question for Americans is
whether the the United States will grant
to the Palestinians the right to
national self-determination in some part
of their former home you see the
Palestinians compared them somewhat with
like the American India you could say
I'm in there plenty of differences but
yes there's some carry for some
comparison in terms of their really
original population and in the case of
the American Indians well if we are
willing to face the truth about our own
history we really carried out genocide
and they were eliminated pretty much and
that that's been a great attractive it's
been erased from American history but
you know it's a very ugly chapter you're
talking about physical displacement
that's the very word that I was making
well in the in the in the American case
which is a very ugly one they were
physically displaced and largely
destroyed in the in the current case the
Palestinian population well about six or
seven hundred thousand either fled or
were expelled removal of each in 1948
and another seven hundred thousand were
expelled or fled both in 1967 at the
same time a great emigration and a large
Jewish immigration came in some of the
cleaner up some of it from the from the
Arab countries what is the basis as you
see it of the United States's
relationship with Israel now that's
changed over the years but since 1967 at
least the United States has supported a
in effect a greater Israel so the real
question in the world and there is a
kind of an international consensus on
how to solve the problem and there has
been for many years the international
consensus is that there should be a
political settlement on the pre June 67
borders that is the borders up to that
lasted from 1949 to 1967 and within the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip and those
two areas now occupied by Israel there
should be a Palestinian state and that
there might be various minor adjustments
on the borders and various guarantees of
territorial integrity
that's the international consensus has
been blocked by the United States and
hence there's constant war we have two
folks at home to jump into the
conversation I guess tonight is known
Chomsky he is a professor of the
linguistics and known throughout the
world for his work in that field
he is unfactored MIT he is obviously and
has been for a while a long while now a
political activist is the author of a
new and very country or a controversial
book called the fateful triangle and he
talks about the United States Israel and
the Palestinians your phone calls
invited an area code three one three in
Detroit eight seven two four zero four
zero as I said to Professor Chomsky as
we sat down they are here to learn um
try to keep the questions real tight
right to the point and we'll get through
more find out what his thesis is about
these three groups witnesses you said
something that I went to as opposed to
jump into the via the fray here with
their phone calls that you say that the
United States has blocked its running
from happening that which is the
international consensus to maybe throw
that Paris yes just to give a few high
points in February 1970 men so that who
has been prime minister of Egypt offered
a critical element
political settlement for peace treaty on
the internationally recognized borders
at that point he didn't offer anything
to the Palestinians this was just their
settlement on the 3 June 67 borders did
real rejected it and the United States
also rejected in January 1976 Syria
Jordan and Egypt so-called the
confrontation states ones right of a
murder brought to the United Nations a
proposal for a two-state settlement
exactly in terms of the international
consensus that I described it was
rejected by Israel it would be played by
the United States that means whenever we
was backed by the PLO in fact it was
actually prepared by the PLO it was also
backed by the Soviet Union by Europe I
just bet anyone the world and since then
there's been a repeated this is going on
I just take the most recent case in
April and May of this year of last year
1984 a yes RF at the PLO chairman
offered negotiations with Israel leading
to mutual recognition that's the most
the one can conceivably ask that was
rejected by Israel and simply
disregarded by the United States either
pale fading into the whole equation here
well the PLO has the same kind of
legitimacy that the rainiest
organization had in the 1940s
Palestinians have made it absolutely
clear under Israeli occupation in the
Palestinian exile everywhere that they
recognized the PLR has their
representative as their national
organization and there's in any readin
that any coming took to deny the PLA
participation would be like having
denied designers participation if David
Hayter pillow is a terrorist
organization
it's terrorist in the same sense in
which the Zionist Organization was
terrorists and in the same sense in
which just about any national movement
including our own American Revolution
was terrorist I don't know the case of a
national movement anywhere that the
black terrorists we're designers this
way is to peel off easily in fact if you
look at the history the history of -
terrorism goes way back and it's in fact
continue through the existence of the
State of Israel I don't say this in any
particular criticism of them
specifically that's characteristic of
national movements I mean Jade
Washington and associates that's her
head terrorists - oh yeah how do you
thirty hit upon the position that you're
putting forth here depends which meant
for example in in the United States
they're very adamantly opposed to it
under them in Israel I'm not out of the
spectrum of discussion you say the
Israeli president critical of Israel
days in the American press well you
think that's true is it true yeah the he
be present Israel happens to be a very
lively and which I fed up closely is a
lively independent press which includes
credible range of opinion and discussion
and after drama I've been asked to write
for these remain stream Israeli Chris I
wouldn't want to say be misleading if I
said I'm in the center on that I might
be at the outer limits of the Devesh
position but I do speak for physicians
which are represented within the Israel
respect to my discretion that is there
are groups there who also believe as I
do that a two-state political settlement
is the only alternative to disaster here
you see a criticism of Israel as after
being portrayed as anti-semitic
well it is a long among American
Zionists trying to undermine criticism
of Israeli policies by appealing to
anti-semitism I think that's quite
disrepute undoubtedly there are
anti-semite exist that criticism of the
policy of Israel is just as we've given
that as criticism of the policy of any
other state and it doesn't involve any
racist elements i we assume any one of
our colleagues will bring
I know you have some rather strongly
thoughts on the subject of the invasion
of Lebanon Noam Chomsky is our guest he
is professor of linguistics at NIT
political activist and author of the
faithful triangle youth phone calls
coming up next on a late night America
I'm where you're on late-night America
I guess this rally from Atlanta red-eye
my congratulations to the gentleman that
he has a very clear conscience and which
is seven the truth and American people
have been denied the truth about what is
really happening my question is that how
much do you think that the Jewish lobby
in this country and maybe around the
world
the use misuse and the Holocaust which
was a you know disaster for Humanity how
much they are using to to justify their
existence and their own mistreatment of
the Palestinians their oppression and
and this much has been been propagated
here through the Hollywood and through
the press okay thank you
well the the Holocaust those I think we
all must agree the most horrifying
monstrosity in human history and however
to exploit the Holocaust as
justification for oppressing another
people seems to me frankly obscene do
you think it's done I think it's time
you do man I mean I about others - for
example Nathan Goldman who is the
president of arab scientist organization
went correctly said that it's
sacrilegious to invoke the holocaust as
a justification for oppressive and acts
against the Palestinians and I think
that's quite an honest and courageous
and accurate statement do you fear that
the Holocaust is brought up to offer it
can't be brought up too often it's in
it's a bit later it's it's I would think
the lowest point of modern history and
one that we can never forget but
I can I agree with Goldman that it is
right when they say sacrilegious are
obscene so you don't want to put it into
the political arena I would definitely
put it into the political arena sure I
mean in fact that's part of a diagram
for the establishment of the State of
Israel and probably so right but you
know since 1967 you know in my view a
very ugly way the experience of the
Holocaust has been used to justify
oppression of the Palestinians when
that's what's unacceptable
how do you ladies in America sir my name
is Ronnie and colleague from Detroit I
want to take issue with the fact that
mr. Chomsky keeps taking the fact that
years are an indigenous population for
granted the only objective population
that is shown that the vast majority of
the Arabs are also recent immigrants
besides last 150 years if he pointed out
the vast majority of Jews the idea of a
two-state solution as an r-value echoes
breath to 1922 the British slop table
70% of it was on Palestine it created
Transjordan every time there's a
solution proposed the Jews brought along
with it and every time it's just been
more hacking off of the original idea
okay whoops question right actually my
whole point is on you brought up the
fact that mr. Chomsky is a trip and I'm
pretty rosy on this brief let you say
that well because he might be accurately
described as non Jewish you're a
self-hating Jew yeah okay what is your
question here
did you have one of this one to make the
point all right my question is mr.
Chomsky is that he seems to desire to
take issue with our as linguist it is
with words and simple okay we're getting
any place in the conversation so I'm
going to go on to somebody else
hi there you're on late-night America
yes name is Jill from Washington go
ahead Joe I don't like mr. Chomsky do a
comment on observation first of all I
would like him to like to know whether
he would agree that most of the
countries in the Middle East have a
pro-western or historically have been
Pro Western in their attitudes most of
the tensions with this by the fact that
Islam and communists don't mix witnessed
in Afghanistan and would he agree that
the major intrusion of Soviet influence
in the Middle East can be directly
respected
Soviet influence in the u.s. in in the
middle is there because of our one-sided
policy toward the Israelis and that
movement toward a settlement would more
or less negate any further aid to the
State of Israel because it's coming to
five billion dollars this year we're
asking our farmers and other people to
take cuts of their subsidies and the
Israelis are coming in and asking for
five to six billion dollars worth of
foreign aid okay well there are many
aspects of that but let me focus on the
last one the if the we should ask
ourselves with the assistance to
Israelis for and I think if we do we
will discover that that we are providing
funds to Israel not for its security but
rather to support its settlement in the
occupied territories and to support its
capacity to attack its northern neighbor
and I don't believe we should be doing
that I think that's a disaster for the
Palestinians it's a disaster for the
region and it's also driving Israel to
disaster it's leading it to become a
better way of Sparta a militarized state
without a
internal economy which exists by the
sword and which will ultimately be
destroyed as a result of the policy were
pursuing so adding that where we call
aid is in fact a disastrous in
intervention we should I think we should
move towards a political settlement of a
time which has been available for a long
time but which we infective got moving
on to the particles let me just say
something I love because you know
rolling this together I don't try to
make a you know a 14-page public
statement take your best shot
mr. Chomsky has been around he can
handle a tough ones any question worth
its weight in salt is a bowl you can
boil it down to about twelve fifteen
words and let's put personal calls here
all right hi there I'm live in America
hi this is Council and estate good job
mr. Kemp see I see a set of pretty much
a moderate and he has gotten into an
awful lot of trouble about being so he
was almost question what is the question
well if he if they negotiate if he was
to negotiate a full met with Israel
pretty tall on to power and if the other
two factions other two PLO forces got
into power in the Palestinian state they
would definitely be a threat to Israel
so what would it be if council at all
the power
well that asset represents the
mainstream of the Palestinian
organization here's overwhelming support
within the occupied territories we know
that from Israeli run plays and he's
strongly supported by Palestinians
outside be right that there are other
attractions
however percent of the Palestinian state
is being a threat to Israel I think is
frankly ludicrous Israel's main most
powerful military forces in the world
the past in Ian's state would be
lucky to exist it's the state that would
have the security problem I wouldn't I
would think that we're right and we
right in thinking that there might be
conflict within the Palestinian state
just as incidental there was
considerable conflict within Israel in
the early stages but that would probably
be ironed out and I think that every
reason to expect that the rff action
would emerge dominant and it's
essentially a conservative nationalist
factor do you think you could serve in
any kind of a leadership role and have
the respect for other countries and
other people's around the world we would
have whatever expect that tiny mini
state can have in the world he had the
respect to say that Luxembourg can have
he as a person as a person he's yes sir
I can't believe that
well doesn't well the image of Arafat in
the United States is very distorted he
is as the color said recognized
worldwide as a moderate spokesman for
Palestinian nationalism in inaccurate
how they are made in America all right
my name is Eric I'm from Washington DC
my question to mr. Chomsky is falling he
stated that to have a separate
Palestinian state will bring stability
to the region now my question is this if
you are a separate palliative
Palestinian state if you introduced the
state there and especially with appeal
plos Gadhafi ties particularly kotappa
ties and Soviet Union ties now if you
create a state with that sort of
influence in that region doesn't that
create more instability and that is
because historically we see wherever the
Soviet Union has intruded there it's
been great political instability and
repression of civil rights I give you
all the Eastern Bloc countries
Afghanistan parts of Africa Turkey opium
and also wherever the United States has
intruded we can talk about Central
America of Vietnam and so on when great
powers intrude there is instability but
we should ask ourselves why
has established context with the Soviet
Union the reason is because its efforts
and let me repeat again what is
unquestionably true and denied by no
serious Authority the PLO represents the
Palestinians who were the overwhelming
majority and are the indigenous
population as long as we're not as they
are denied any recognition of their
national rights they're going to turn to
anyone who can support them we would be
the same if we were denied national
rights if a Palestinian state were
established and integrated into the
region it would very quickly become as
much it would be in same kinds of
associations with the United States but
for example Egypt was high they run
Latin America they didn't do it from my
fabric advocate I wanted to ask years
ago why I saw on TV
Rebecca Lillian for he's an expert on
the subject - in familiar with some of
his works and he said it makes no
difficulty in getting a message across
because most of the networks would black
him out which I found a marvelous
material for Jewish and he was basically
one if a month if you have any trouble
along the slide well yes I'm waiting for
a case in point he's written a very
important Brook Lopez - connection I've
never seen a review of it my own works
on this issue very rarely reviewed in
the United States whether so in Canada
or England or Australia they're well
known and widely reviewed in fact there
has been an overwhelming dominance in
the United States a very specific point
of view and I think it's a little and
point of view and these questions have
never been able to enter the arena of
public debate that's a great tragedy but
this new book is being with you not in
the United States outside but not in the
reviewed in The New Yorker here works
but not on the American press is very
striking to contrast the United States
and Canada here - very similar countries
right the issues in that book basically
about the United States that much more
germane to American interests in Canada
it's been reviewed in just about every
newspaper financial newspapers local
newspapers that we have going on there
it's their error here here what's going
on here is that it's not very unpopular
position it's critical of American
policy and the press does not want that
to be known we must face that fact
you're accusing the American press were
protecting the American government
that's exactly the truth the press here
it has a misleading image of being
critical of a state but that is simply
untrue the press is quite servant to
state interests what one thing that's
been sticking in your craw for about
five years that you haven't been able to
say out loud that you really want people
to know for what I've said before for
example are very few people in the
United States who know although outside
it's well-known that the United States
has been leading the rejectionist camp
in the Middle East very few Americans
were it's very striking when an
important certain range an initiative on
the table no that's right and that's a
rejectionist initiative raven's
initiative rejects the idea of
self-determination for the Palestinians
furthermore let's let's say that the
Israelis are going to have to
accommodate the Palestinians in some way
shape it up with no Palestinian state
that's like is its obsession when it
said in 1947 would you rather have
self-determination but without
participation of the Zionists and
without a Jewish state that would have
been ridiculous
yeah but that's what Reagan is saying
about what do you say that Reagan is
saying we're rating factors is name what
is that initiative all about relative to
where the initiative was about nothing
because he would through it within about
a week what the core what happened this
again is not said in the United States
Reagan's initiative came out on
September 1st 1982 it was immediately
rejected by Israel
Reagan Court for settlement freeze
Israel mediately stated that it was
going to radically increase settlements
know it was Ravens reaction his reaction
was to call for an increase and they're
already enormous subsidy that we give to
Israel the Congress the Democratic
Congress then said no let's increase it
even further now that's a message to
Israel saying they're doing just the
right thing you're doing just what we
want you to do in fact the Reagan
administrative agency did was killed by
the United States
what if what you're saying is Israel
true why do you think that the United
States wants it that way because the
event was a split in planning circle in
the United States about whether to
accept the international consensus or
whether to continue to maintain support
frame for an Israeli spider a powerful
Israeli state which will serve American
interests as a guardian of the of the
Middle East are you looking at anything
the United States is looking upon Israel
isn't some kind of like a battleship out
there exactly that's in fact that was
exactly the position formulated in the
next year of a Nixon Doctrine the idea
of Nixon Doctrine was that they were to
be certainly that surrogate states that
would control their own region by threat
of force and that this would be done
within the overall framework of American
power now in the least the Nixon
Doctrine specified he ran and under the
Shah and Israel as major military forces
which would great American interests and
that with the char on Israel as the only
one that the position of the United
States has been to create a a dependent
Israel which is a highly militarized
technologically competent state that can
serve American interests that is very
dangerous for Israel and for the world
but in the United States has put the
scriptures say you better clean up some
of that inflation or some other way
you're running your country or if you're
not gonna get as much money - yes but
rather trying to get mint is - I mean
the Israeli that is true but that's but
you see what it is still providing
Israel with the first to maintain we're
providing them with the subsidy which
allows them to settle the occupied
territories and to maintain the invasion
of Lebanon and we have rejected the
peace settlements that's the crucial
thing for example when I thought I've
made a very reasonable offer the
couldn't even be more reasonable a
negotiation was leaving the mutual
recognition the United States did not
even respond
they run like that America yes this is
and this is Walter from Alexandria
Virginia
however I have a short statement and a
short question I've got a shrug question
first okay the short question is uh I
happen to see the show when you have
Minister Louis Farrakhan on your show
and he was saying that he really
wouldn't have any peace as long as they
would negotiate and I was wondering if
you if your guess agrees or disagrees
with it right well I agree as long as
Israel its uses to accept the right of
self-determination for the indigenous
Palestinian population there will be no
peace there will be a situation of
constant conflict ultimately I should
add that's going to lead the global war
that has repeatedly brought the
superpowers into very close to conflict
and sooner or later it will I want to
take another call here highway runways
in America New York today I'd like to
ask your guest and as a result of many
many wars there have been many many
displaced people with the existence of
Red China the existence of Pakistan
right now in Cambodia and I would like
to ask him why at no other time in
history has a group of people remain
displaced for 40 years and remain a big
political issue is why this one
difference exists with the Palestinians
well I can think of one other example
for example the Jews who were displaced
for 2,000 years and have now the man
didn't receive their right of
self-determination if that's if that's
legitimate for the Jews after 2,000
years I would think it's legitimate for
the Palestinians after 40 years highway
our lady in America yes or from Syracuse
ha I like out the considered comment on
the Palestinian mandate which presently
calls for the destruction of the State
of Israel which that certainly is not a
moderate stance the Palestinians had the
opportunity at several of their
congressmen to the boys himself from a
protected position just recently in
Jordan with King Hussein
the government began on that thank you
meant to Palestinian covenant not pass a
mandate the Palestinian covenant which
is has ears ago the Palestinian the PLO
made it clear and explicit
that the Palestinian covenant would not
govern interstate relations exactly as
statements by the Zionist Organization
do not giving interstate relations where
other interstate relations would be
governed by arrangements made between
these states and they proposed
explicitly for example in January 1976
and often since they proposed the
two-state for the cross element with
mutual recognition highway run lengthen
America is looking for Washington Valley
Washington Heather yes I have a question
for dr. Chomsky and the question is how
do you feel how feasible is it really
with Palestine were granted as their
homeland on the rest and is it in this
possible feasible that they could live
peacefully under this sort of lab
without fabrication so dividuals
well again if you look at this is very
odd but Americans look at it that way if
you look at the relative power of Israel
and the Palestinians
the opposite question is the one that
should be asked Israel is now ranked
literally as one of the most powerful
military states in the world the
Palestinians if a Palestinian state were
established it would be surrounded be a
very weak state it would be surrounded
by a hostile military alliance in fact
between Jordan and Israel it would be
back if it would survive at all that
would
at the will of the most conservative
elements in the Arab world such as Saudi
Arabia probably it would be
demilitarized the real security problem
would be for that Palestinian state
critic survived with its powerful
neighbors in particular in the State of
Israel do you say that the faithful a
triangle the purpose is a moral
indictment of how Israel is treated the
Palestinians violation only in part
because it's really directed to it to
the United States my main concern is
American policy tgd to criticize other
people and I think we should have the
honesty to face what we do and what we
have done is to support tendencies
within Israel that are leading it to be
oppressive and ultimately
self-destructive the Ambassador from the
Israel to the United States mr. Rosen
was here some time ago a few months ago
and I think I required him saying rather
clearly that the State of Israel
perceived those countries around it to
be the enemy and that if they all had
their graduated brothers Israel would be
out of existence tomorrow and yet you
say that Israel is afraid and I would
counter by saying with that kind of talk
and the kind of signals that they have
gotten from so many different countries
around them wouldn't you do it further
as well and you're saying that the
Third's are founded on that thing the
fears are founded in fact but remember
it works the other way too the Arab
countries are very much afraid of Israel
and for good reason Israel for since the
beginning since 1947 in fact Israel has
been the dominant military force in the
region and by now it's just by an
overwhelming
'banahna military force now the fact is
all the states of the region have reason
to fear one another in fact the arab
states also a fight among one another
looks like europe now throughout most of
the history of europe every state had a
reason beside fear every other state
well their way out of that is to try to
create political arrangements which were
mitigate those fears and there are such
possible political arrangements in fact
the international consensus which the
united states Brax is one such
arrangement are you optimistic or
pessimistic in a word very pessimistic
pessimistic the fateful triangle is the
title of Noam Chomsky's new book he is
professor of linguistics at MIT
political activists and if you want
further reading on the subject we've
been tackling for the last half hour
included including an incredible amount
of documentation this is the book we
thank you for being with us
