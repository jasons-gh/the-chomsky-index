good evening we start tonight's program
by talking about defense spending
nothing very unusual about that people
do that a lot these days but the way we
approach the subject is very unusual
because
we present the views of a man who
challenges assumptions
that's an exciting prospect because it
forces us to examine our own ideas
ideas that often make us feel secure
feeling secure in a world of superpower
confrontation in the age of nuclear
missiles is hard to do
and many of us cling to ideas of defense
that are familiar
and comforting not the man you're about
to hear he is noam chomsky one of the
world's leading authorities on
linguistics he teaches at mit
and a prolific and provocative analyst
of world affairs i talked with him when
he came here this winter to speak at the
university of minnesota
now chomsky has an idea about the nature
of the cold war
and how it has us hurtling toward
nuclear disaster
it is an idea we never hear included in
reporting or interpretation of world
events by
our mainstream news media chomsky
considers them
a major part of the problem here's how
he traces the roots of the cold war
during world war ii the state department
and the council on foreign relations
that is the big business oriented group
that involves itself in national policy
making
together they planned the shape of the
turf they wanted to control economically
after the war
here's what that turf included the
western hemisphere the far east and the
former british empire
at the least the question was how about
the soviet union and the turf it
collected during the war
of course the soviets had an answer for
that yet
chomsky says that even though all this
is documented no one has ever been
willing to talk about it not even
scholars
that is part of the cost he says of our
living according to values imposed by
the united states stance in the cold war
confrontation
well the cold war then continued and i
think it continued because
in fact it's very functional for the two
superpowers and if you look at the
incidents of the cold war you can see
exactly how it works
when we want to invade some country or
subvert its government unless they
overthrow the government of guatemala in
1954
we can't the government can't come to
the american people and say look there's
a
democratic government in guatemala which
is carrying out new deal measures and
trying to improve the lot of poor
peasants and giving them
you know unused land that's owned by the
united fruit company and therefore we
have to overthrow it and put in a gang
of
monsters who are going to destroy the
unions and carry a genocide you can't
say that
so what we say that's in fact roughly
what was happening
what we have to say is well we have to
defend ourselves from a russian attack
and i say guatemala is an outpost of
international communism and the
communists are brutal as they are
and so on and if we don't stop them
there they're going to be in new york
before you know it
and that's sufficient to frighten the
population and then we can overthrow the
government of guatemala and they can
count on the new york times and the
media to give that story which they did
they're pressed loyally reported the
government propaganda story
for many years in fact even today
they've barely unearthed the
the truth about it uh but
given that they can count on and that's
a typical cold war incident
same with the russians i mean when the
russians invaded hungary two years later
they told their own they didn't tell
their population look there's a
socialist revolution going on in hungary
and there are workers councils taking
over industry
therefore we have to move in and destroy
it can't say that you know
so what they said is well hungary is
being taken over by fascists who are
working for the cia and pretty soon
they're going to be in moscow
you know so we have to stop it and the
population believed it
now and of course the press reported it
because in the soviet union they do it
by order of the state that's a different
system than theirs
here they do it by moral cowardice and
class interest there they do it by
threat of state violence but the effects
are very similar and that's the way the
cold war has been going you pick any
incident and you'll find out this is
exactly the way it worked
on one level you talk about the military
threat
what about the threat that corporate
america says it sees creeping socialism
what's the story on socialism in the
soviet union and on
america's perceptions of it and russian
perceptions of it
that's a very interesting example of the
way propaganda were in fact this is one
of the greatest achievements of
20th century propaganda i think has been
to identify the soviet union with
socialism
now in fact there are two major
propaganda systems in the world
paris which is the dominant one and the
soviet one which is the secondary one
and when they agree on something it's
very hard for anybody to break out of
that
and they agree on this i mean the
american propaganda system insists that
what's happening they call it we call it
the socialist world
and the reason we do it is to try to
defame socialism
by identifying it with the russian
dungeon now the russians also call their
system socialist
and the reason they do it is to try to
pick up the credit of socialism
to you know to overcome these sort of
tarnished facts about their own
you know their own dungeon so for
different reasons both propaganda
systems want to identify the russians
with socialism in fact
the soviet system and this goes back to
1917 is diametrically opposed to
socialism
i mean the minimal minimal property that
any socialist system was supposed to
have
was controlled by producers over
production that's the essence of
socialism
that means that workers take control of
production
decide how it's done determine the
conditions of their work
in fact the whole meaning of socialism
was to extend the concept of
democratic control to the workplace i
mean the first thing that lenin and
trotsky did
after the coup which we call the
bolshevik revolution it was really just
a coup
first thing they did was to destroy all
the workers councils to destroy the
soviets to destroy the factory councils
and to
institute what they call militarization
of labor that is elimination of any
degree of worker participation and
production
and that was literally the first act of
the revolution so-called revolution
coup actually it's really a
counter-revolutionary coup the bolshevik
revolution
but of course again see they call it a
revolution we call it a revolution
for opposite reasons because we want to
we want to defame the concept of
popular worker revolution and they want
to appeal you know they want to
exploit the prestige associated with
with revolutionary socialism
but the whole thing's just a fraud you
know fraud from beginning to end
and uh both sides can persist in it
when there has been any authentic
socialist development anywhere we've all
opposed it
every single case i mean for example
there was a popular socialist revolution
in spain in 1936
the russians and the americans and the
british and the fact the nazis combined
to destroy
it okay both sides are in business to
survive and grow
why doesn't the united states cut a deal
with the soviet union
well we actually have a deal i mean the
cold war is a kind of a deal
it's kind of a tacit agreement yeah but
there are nuclear weapons
yeah but we see that we need too and
both sides need it
for their own reasons i mean i don't
want to make it sound as if they're
sitting down and planning this it just
you know it continues because it
satisfies
interests it's also dangerous they're in
conflict
and at the same time while they're well
while they're in opposition
they're also uh they're also cooperating
uh they're the the point is that as i
said each you know
the cold war system this idea that
there's this great enemy the great satan
which is you know the evil empire which
both sides exploit
that's the way they terrorize and
control their own populations
and nuclear weapons incidentally are in
part at least a method of controlling
your own population i mean any
every state wants nuclear weapons and
one of the reasons is that
the mere possession of nuclear weapons
extends and increases the power of the
state over its own population
if you have nuclear weapons you have a
secrecy system you have to have police
you know you have to have
you know authority which is impenetrable
that's just what governments want they
don't want to be perceived
you know so for example take the reagan
administration which is by no means
conservative i mean it's
sort of proto-fascist in a way and one
of the things the reagan administration
has tried to do is to
prevent see it's supposed to be their
pretense is
that they want to break down big
government the actuality is exactly the
opposite one of the things they've tried
to do is to protect
government from scrutiny let me
interrupt you for a second
there are probably thousands of people
listening to you right now who just
heard you say proto-fascist
and they think that this is the freest
country in the world
what do you say to people who criticize
you for criticizing the freest country
in the world
i'm talking about the administration i'm
talking about the instincts of the
administration what they want to do is
prevent this from being the freest
country in the world
it is in fact the freest country in the
world it's the country in the world that
has the most open acts
in which the government is least able to
protect itself from
scrutiny and is least able to exercise
violence over the population
among the countries in the world at
least the major you know luxembourg
maybe but
among the major countries in the world
this is the freest in this sense
but the instincts of the reagan
administration and their efforts are to
try to overcome that
what they regard as a defect in the
american system namely that it's a free
and open society
so in fact if you look at the policies
of the reagan administration what are
they after all
what the their their major social policy
is to create a a powerful state
they're they're in fact increasing the
role of the state in the economy
just the opposite of what they're
pretending to do the way that's what the
military system is about
the big military production has nothing
to do with defense of the united states
the united states in fact you can see
that you know
their their their their pretended
justification was what they called a
window of vulnerability
but the window of vulnerability was a
fraud and they now in fact concede that
it was a fraud
the scope of commission conceded that it
was a fraud but they continue
and the reason has to do with something
totally different that's the way in
which the state intervenes in the
economy
the state intervenes in the economy by
creating a huge government market state
market
for high technology production called
armaments and that's the way you give a
subsidy to the advanced sectors of the
economic of industrial economy are
weapons the only commodity that you can
make this work on
see the reason is that if the united if
the government were to become involved
in useful production production for the
market
say automobile production or subways or
something if it was to do that
it would begin to interfere with the
prerogatives of big business
as soon as you begin as soon as the
state begins to interfere in the market
system
it's constraining the operations of
business
now this is a business-run government
and policy has to be designed
so it doesn't interfere with the rights
and prerogatives and power of big
business
in fact policy has to be designed so it
supports them the government is
basically a support system for big
business
now the point is that and you see that's
why the government is going to
always be involved in waste production
it's going to be involved in the
production of high technology waste
and furthermore it has to be rapidly
obsoleting high technology waste
because you've got to keep replacing it
and furthermore the taxpayers got to pay
for it
which means the taxpayer has to have a
reason for
paying high technology industry to
produce waste
now that's a tricky set of constraints
very hard to convince people you can't
come to people and say look
you guys have to give your little bit of
money that you have
as a gift to the rich and powerful so
that they can produce waste
to be thrown away you can't say that
when the reagan administration came in
in 19 early 1981 you could predict at
once
well i mean i don't say this in
retrospect i was writing at the time
that they are going to see confrontation
everywhere
and the reason they're going to exceed
confrontation everywhere is for the same
reason the kennedy administration did
because of their domestic program
their domestic program is one of
militarization of the economy
an increase of state power and increase
of state repressiveness
the only way to achieve those domestic
programs is by
is with an external threat and therefore
they're going to seek an external threat
everywhere
they're going to seek confrontation
everywhere and that's exactly what
they've been doing before we meet our
invited guests i'd like to get some
response in the audience
you ever heard anything like that well i
think noam chomsky is extremely
articulate
i uh i myself am uh most interested in
how much of our defense
spending really goes to defense the
united states as opposed to
application of control around the world
and he sort of alluded to that but
didn't help me i was hoping some of your
guests would we'll
do that how about you well i i was not
really amused by norm chomsky's position
even though i don't have any class
interest in the defense industry i have
no financial interest
and i think really his his thesis falls
of its own weight for his
example his argument of an increased
governmental role of the state
in the reagan administration which he
labeled proto-fascist a totally
fantastic and extreme claim
falls of its own weight we've reduced
revenue sharing we've reduced education
funds
we've reduced domestic pork barrel
spending and you know
his claims are just totally out contra
factual
okay who wants to respond another
response to what you just heard
yeah at the same time we increase uh
government spending through the military
that's exactly what he's talking about
you take it away from people in the form
of education and welfare spending and
then you give it to the
corporations someone else
yes
well i'm wilfred webber and i think some
of the things that he said there about
high research
high research at 3m is not waste high
research at 3m is what built 3m
and i think that now that i've had 47
years of service there that
i should help keep our
production going not put them out of
work okay
