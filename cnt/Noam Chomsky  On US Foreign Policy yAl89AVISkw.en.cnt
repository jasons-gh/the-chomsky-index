good afternoon everybody I'm Jeff Sachs
director of the Earth Institute I'm
delighted to welcome you to this lecture
that I think we've all been anticipating
and hoping for you have a very hungry
audience here know looking for wisdom
and I hope also some ways out this is a
part of a lecture series sponsored by
begun by four faculty at the University
my colleagues Rashid Khalidi Mahmood
Mamdani professor Eric Foner and and
myself out of a feeling that we we
really desperately need to have a
vigorous ongoing systematic debate about
u.s. foreign policy and most importantly
we have to hear the critical voices now
because the critical voices have been
right and uncannily so and because we're
entering an even more dangerous period
clearly right now I think today's
speaker certainly is the person that one
would have in mind in the whole world in
terms of being a D leading critic and
somebody who was shed more light on the
issues of American foreign policy
behavior than perhaps anybody else all
of you know that when you visit an
english-language bookstore abroad it is
a Chomsky bookstore with a few other
books and I don't know whether it's
literally true that Noam Chomsky is the
most widely read American author in but
I I'm almost sure it's true in foreign
policy and deservedly so of course
professor Chomsky remade or invented or
revolutionized whatever term one wants
to use modern linguistics and in a way I
think he has
applied the linguistic tools to to
foreign policy to help us understand
what we hear and how we think about what
we hear and it's for that reason
breathtakingly exciting to have you here
Noam and we all look forward to your
remarks
the reason you're hungry and we're not
as we just came from very nice
the hideous crimes of the 20th century
led to dedicated efforts to save humans
from the curse of war and the word save
is no exaggeration surely since it
became clear in 1945 that the likelihood
of ultimate doom is well beyond what any
rational person would be willing to
tolerate actually the phrase ultimate
doom is not in mine as a more
interesting source I'm borrowing it from
two prominent strategic analysts writing
in the current issue of maybe the most
sober and respectable journal in the
world the Journal of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences not given
to hyperbole they conclude that
Washington's current military programs
and aggressive stance which have their
origins in the Clinton years but haven't
been accelerated very sharply in the
last few they say these carry an
appreciable risk of ultimate doom and
they go on to express the hope that the
threat will be countered by a coalition
of peace-loving nations led by China oK
we've we've come to a pretty pass when
such thoughts are expressed right at the
heart of the establishment and what that
implies about the state of American
democracy were the issues don't even
enter the electoral arena or the arena
of public discussion that's no less
shocking
and as for what we can do it's to
overcome that huge Democratic deficit
which may indeed lead to ultimate doom
shouldn't be waiting for China to do
something about it it's also not
comforting to read a related article in
the same issue in which a leading
authority on constitutional law
discusses the concept of sovereignty
that has been crafted by the Justice
Department articulating as he puts it a
view of presidential authority that is
all too close to the powers that Carl
Schmitt the leading German philosopher
of law during the Nazi period was
willing to Accord to his own Fuhrer and
to add a bit more the legal authority
who transmitted Smits view of
presidential authority to the president
also advised Bush to rescind the Geneva
Conventions the supreme law of the land
and the core of modern humanitarian law
and he did so for quite sound reasons he
explained that if the Geneva Conventions
remain in force the president and his
associates might be found guilty under
the War Crimes Act of 1996 passed by the
Republican Congress which carries the
death penalty he's just been appointed
Attorney General and is being described
as a moderate the efforts to end the
curse of war led to a consensus on the
principles that should guide state
action was in the immediate aftermath of
world war two formally the consensus
remains but it's quite interesting to
see how the spectrum has shifted within
intellectual opinion it shifted so much
that the post-war consensus has drifted
to the extremists end of public
discussion and electoral politics in
fact
it's off the spectrum of electoral
politics I'll return to the post-war
consensus and its fate and the current
implications but first we should take a
moment to remember the virtual
disappearance of it which is quite
reason in the last years of the last
millennium and the early years of this
millennium these were a remarkable
moment of intellectual history I'm not
sure there's anything quite like them in
the non - glorious history of
intellectuals across the spectrum of
articulate opinion in those few years
there was enthusiastic celebration these
are all quotes of a normative revolution
in world affairs with odd a claim for
the idealistic new world bent on ending
inhumanity which had entered a noble
phase in its foreign policy with a
saintly glow for the first time in
history state is dedicated to principles
and values acting from altruism and
moral fervor alone as the leader of the
enlightened States
hence free to resort to force to
determine - for what its leaders
determined to be right so post working
censuses off the agenda that's a very
small sample of an extraordinary deluge
I've selected only from the most
respected liberal voices kind of like
off at the critical end of the spectrum
after several years of such rhetorical
flights few events were brought forth as
evidence for this impressive exercise of
self-education primarily the bombing of
Serbia
it was regard with to that action that
the phrase illegal but legitimate was
coined in an unusually careful and sober
evaluation of the bombing very unusual
to it well in this atmosphere of self
adulation
highly-regarded legal scholars explained
that the framework of international law
that had been established after world
war ii was just quoting now hot air the
grand attempt to subject the rule of
force to the rule of law should be
deposited in the ashcan of history the
conclusive proof came a few years later
the same legal authority rights and he's
again on the liberal extreme when came a
few years later when washington made it
clear that it intends to do all it can
to maintain its preeminence that it
would ignore the UN Security Council
over Iraq and would no longer be bound
by the United Nations Charter the rules
governing the use of force therefore the
rules have collapsed and in the winter
of 2003 the entire edifice came crashing
down which is a good thing he concludes
because the leader of the enlightened
states his term that must resist any
effort to curb its use of force okay
again I'm quoting from the liberal end
of very distinguished legal
international legal opinion in the
leading establishment journals and a
highly praised book
well these declarations do encapsulate
with clarity and honesty what has become
in practice prevailing elite consensus
and it should be stressed however that
that is these are not the views of the
general public a those we know they
don't get reported but we know them from
very careful studies of the best public
opinion studies organizations many of
them last October released before the
election turns out that a considerable
majority of the population believed that
the United States should accept the
jurisdiction of the international
criminal
Court and the World Court should sign
the Kyoto Protocol should rely on the
United Nations to take the lead in
international crises including the
specific case of Iraq including security
reconstruction a political transition in
Iraq and the United States should even
abandon the Security Council veto it
should rely on diplomatic and economic
measures more than military ones and the
circle war on terror and I should use
force
only if quoting there is strong evidence
that the country is in imminent danger
of being attacked
that's rejecting the bipartisan
consensus on what's misleadingly called
pre-emptive war it's notable that it
goes on like this these views are held
by people in virtual isolation they very
rarely hear them probably the people who
give those answers assume I'm the only
one in the country who thinks this I
have no other basis for it none of this
is discussed publicly in the media the
journals except wait the extreme doesn't
enter political campaigns and only very
marginally in opinion opinion journals
and media and the same extends to other
domains go into it but it does raise
very important questions in our own
country about what we call a democratic
deficit when we talk about others
meaning formal institutions but not
functioning the efforts to spare the
world the horrors of war received their
formal expression first in the
kellogg-briand pact of 1928 which sought
to outlaw war but they took a definitive
form in the United Nations Charter which
opens by expressing the term
of the signatories including it to save
succeeding generations from the scourge
of war which twice in our lifetimes has
brought untold sorrow to mankind and by
then and not just untold sorrow but
total destruction as all participants
knew but also knew they could not
mention so the words atomic and nuclear
do not appear in the Charter in the
United States the Charter is part of the
supreme law of the land its provisions
were spelled out further in the
Nuremberg Tribunal judgments which
declares that initiation of a war of
aggression is the supreme international
crime differing only from other war
crimes in that it contains within itself
the accumulated evil of the whole so for
example it's in a way a mistake to talk
about the extreme and overt war crimes
that are being carried out in Fallujah
because they are simply part of the evil
of the whole once you carry out
aggression and particular war crimes
like attacking hospitals and so on don't
really count the at Nuremberg those who
were judged to have played any role in
the supreme crime for example the German
Foreign Minister that were sentenced to
death by hanging
the Tokyo tribunal was far more severe
well although the principles they
enunciated were significant both
tribunals Nuremberg and Tokyo were
deeply flawed by the most elementary
moral standards their founding
principles very explicitly rejected the
principle of universality the foundation
of all moral judgment which says that we
apply to ourselves the same standards we
apply to others if we're serious more
stringent ones now that was all rejected
very explicitly
they had to define X were crime and
crime against humanity and it was
crafted explicitly in such a way as to
exclude the victors it was not concealed
it was discussed openly that if the
victors had carried out a crime it
wasn't a worker so the the actual
definition of war crime and crime
against humanity for the tribunals was
crime that you carried out and we did
not and to underscore that fact in the
actual tribunal proceedings Nazi war
criminals were absolved if the defense
could show that their US counterparts
had carried out the the same crimes well
every subsequent tribunal is discredited
by the same moral flaw take one that's
going on right now
the Yugoslavia tribunal now and now in
session and The Hague
it's a striking example a group of
international lawyers requested the
tribunal to investigate nato crimes that
were recorded by the major human rights
organizations and other sources in fact
even admitted by the nato command the
prosecution rejected the request without
investigation which happens to be
violation of the laws of the trust
statutes of the tribunal the first
prosecutor Louise Arbour stated right in
the midst of the bombing that I accept
the I accept the assurance is given by
NATO leaders that they intend to comply
with international humanitarian law so
no investigation is necessary her
successor Carla del Ponte simply stated
that nato assurances left her very
satisfied that there is no basis for
opening an investigation of the nato air
campaign
okay fish is that that's actually
consistent with the Nuremberg and Tokyo
Tribunal judgments the powerful are
immune by definition
don't matter what the facts are so
there's no need for an investigation
Yugoslavia did bring charges to the
World Court that's also ongoing it
invoked among other things the Genocide
Convention and these proceedings do
continue but without the participation
of the United States the United States
excluded itself on the grounds that when
Washington finally signed the Genocide
Convention after 40 years it added a
reservation excluding itself from
charges and the court correctly accepted
that argument world court statutes
require that both sides agreed to be
subject to adjudication well much the
same happened in the case that was
brought by a Nicaraguan against the
United States 20 years ago a core part
of Nicaragua's case which was actually
presented by a distinguished Harvard
University law professor a large part of
the case was rejected by the court on
the grounds that when the United States
accepted World Court jurisdiction in
1946 it entered a reservation excluding
itself from prosecution under any
multilateral treaty
hence excluding the supreme crime of
aggression the court was therefore
compelled to restrict its deliberations
to what's called customary international
law and a single bilateral u.s.
Nicaragua treaty but even on these very
narrow grounds the court charged
Washington with unlawful use of force
that's technical term that in lay
language means international terrorism
and ordered the United States to
terminate the crimes and pay substantial
reparations
which would go far beyond paying off the
huge debt that is now strangling
Nicaragua
there are indeed some very conservative
ways to get rid of third-world debt like
following court orders the elite
consensus dismissed the court as a
hostile forum phrase used by the New
York Times editors reflecting the
prevailing view the u.s. reacted by
escalating the war against Nicaragua and
vetoing two Security Council resolutions
that affirmed the court judgment the
targeted country was virtually destroyed
sank further into misery after the u.s.
took that over again in 1990 by now 60
percent of children under 2 suffer
severe malnutrition probable brain
damage that's a radical change from 20
years ago when Washington was panicked
by reports from UNICEF the World Bank
and other international agencies about
what they called I'm quoting them
remarked Nicaragua was remarkable
achievements that were laying a solid
foundation for long-term socio-economic
development as the country enjoyed one
of the most dramatic improvements in
child survival in the developing world
no fear of that anymore
the none of this was deemed worthy of
attention as the wave of self adulation
Crested and the perpetrators of the
crime returned to office well in the
case of the Yugoslavia tribunal the u.s.
actually took no chances
Washington insisted that the tribunal
exclude crimes against peace that is the
most serious crimes aggression that's
the supreme crime of Nuremberg the u.s.
insisted that the tribunal not be
allowed to consider that the reason was
explained by the American drafter he
said that it did the u.s. did not want
to establish precedents that might
hamper US military acts
such as the invasion of Panama I which
are just taken place and which had been
condemned by the UN General Assembly but
not the Security Council of thanks to
the veto which prevents that rejection
of the principle of universality is
understandable all you have to do is
think through the consequences if we
were willing to entertain elementary
moral standards so if the United States
is entitled to carry out what's now
called anticipatory self-defense against
terror in accord with the elite
consensus there's no disagreement about
this if it's entitled to except for the
public but according to the elite
consensus you know right and then it
follows at once that Cuba and Nicaragua
host of others have long been entitled
to carry out terrorist acts within the
United States because there's no doubt
whatsoever of US involvement and very
serious tere terrorist attacks against
them extensively documented in
impeccable sources in the case of
Nicaragua even condemned by the World
Court and Security Council and vetoed
resolutions the conclusion of course is
utterly outrageous
nobody advocates that and in fact there
are still more outrageous conclusions
we're willing to think so for example no
one would agree that would argue that
Japan exercised the right of
anticipatory self defense when it bombed
US military bases in the US colonies of
Hawaii and the Philippines even though
the Japanese knew very well that b-17
Flying Fortresses were coming off the
Boeing assembly lines and they were
surely familiar with the very public
discussion and the u.s. press explaining
how these playing
that could be used to incinerate japan's
wooden cities in a war of extermination
taking off from their Hawaiian and
Philippine bases notice that Japan had
far better arguments for bombing Pearl
Harbor and the Philippines US colonies
military bases then the then Blair or
Bush ever concocted in the case of Iraq
but no one says we should therefore go
out and celebrate Pearl Harbor Day every
year because of the nobility of Japan's
foreign policy reason is the usual usual
one the powerful are exempt from moral
principles uniquely because they so
declare nor would any one a court accord
the right of anticipatory self defense
to any other state today apart from the
self declared enlightened States I which
have the power to determine norms and
they apply them to selectively will
while basking in self praise these are
among the prerogatives of power in well
disciplined societies the principle of
universality has a crucial exception and
rejection of moral norms of tomorrow
truisms the most elementary of them is
so deeply entrenched that even raising
the question would be considered an
unspeakable abomination these are these
happen to be our fundamental guiding
values we're thinking of them
well let's return to the resort to force
the UN Charter is quite explicit about
what's permitted the namely when it's
authorized by the Security Council or is
undertaken in self-defense against armed
attack until the Security Council acts
that concept is spelled out in the
famous wording of Daniel Webster quoted
that response to armed attack is
legitimate when the necessity for action
is instant overwhelming leaving though
choice of means no
of deliberation response under these
conditions is pre-emptive war any other
resort to force is the supreme
international crime which encompasses
all subsequent evil domestic and
international law are not formal axiom
systems and there's some scope for
interpretation but as far as human
affairs are concerned the meaning and
implications are very clear at the very
least they set a standard by which any
resort the force should be evaluated
that should be conventional
understanding I think it is not however
it's off the spectrum apart from the
general population
which accepts this stand as I mentioned
sharp split in the population here
between the educated elite in that's
actually been true for a long time
there's plenty of documentation for it
which I won't review in brief the the
idea that the US should adhere to
international law and its own
constitution
unless very powerful justification can
be given from departure for those
principles that's now an extremist
position innately discourse so extreme
that it's scarcely even mentioned in
very crucial and obvious cases now these
I think are matters that should concern
us quite apart from their non-trivial
connection to the likelihood of ultimate
doom the conventional position is that
the US has the unilateral right to
resort to force when it chooses to do so
it's the position of the Bush
administration formulated in its
national security strategy but expressed
clearly enough before 9/11 so in an
article in foreign affairs even before
the election Condoleezza Rice now the
new Secretary of State as of this
morning she condemned what she called
the reflexive appeal to notions of
international law and norm
and the belief that the support of many
states or even better of institutions
like the United Nations is essential to
the legitimate exercise of power in them
by the United States of course the usual
exception prevails doesn't work for
others this extremist position is in
fact convention now she wasn't breaking
any new ground so just keep to the left
liberal extreme for a few illustrations
elder statesman and Kennedy advisor Dean
Acheson informed the American Society of
international law in 1963 that in his
words no legal issue arises when the
u.s. responds to a challenge to its
power position and prestige he was we
don't even need any pretext in other
words he was speaking shortly after the
Cuban Missile Crisis which had brought
the world close to the brink of nuclear
war a few months earlier an important
part of the background for that which of
course knew was Kennedy's campaign to
bring out of the terrors of the earth to
Cuba phrases historian and Kennedy
advisor Arthur Schlesinger
in his biography of Robert Kennedy who
was assigned responsibility for the
massive international terrorist attack
which escalated in later years actually
continuing into the late 1990s oh that's
Kennedy and Ash's Clinton adopted
essentially the same position
there was a Clinton doctrine it
advocated quote unilateral use of
military power to defend vital interests
such as ensuring uninhibited access to
key markets energy supplies and
strategic resources without even the
pretext that bush and Blair devised well
taken literally the Clinton doctrine is
far more expansive than the bush
national security strategy which
declared
right to use force to dominate the world
and destroy any potential challenge the
Bush national security strategy aroused
enormous fear and concern around the
world and elicited very harsh criticism
even within the foreign policy
establishment the more expansive Clinton
doctrine in contrast was barely even
reported and the extensive literature on
the national security strategy that
makes the difference clear the
objections had to do with style and
manner of presentation not substance no
disagreement on that it was put rather
well by Clinton's Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and an article in
foreign affairs she pointed out that
every president has such a doctrine in
his back pocket but it's simply foolish
to smash people in the face with it and
to implement it in a manner which is
going to antagonize infuriate even
allies so to keep the doctor and it's
fine but kind of be sensible about it
that's the political spectrum that we
have well continuing with the current
consensus the position is expressed by
at chess in the Reagan State Department
Clinton the current administration they
also achieve receive an instructive
expression in the scholarly literature
that's a matter that's worth looking at
carefully particularly in an academic
setting so I hope you don't mind if I
take a little excursion into this there
actually is one book so far one leading
historian John Lewis Gaddis of Yale who
has just published a book that supports
Bush administration programs with the
usual provisos about error in tactics
the book was so popular in the White
House the New York Times reported that
Gaddis was invited over for a discussion
Gaddis is a very good historian kind of
on the liberal side he differs from
others
within the mainstream and that he goes
into the relevant historical background
he crucially with regard to what's
called pre-emptive war he traces the
doctrine to one of his intellectual
heroes the great grand strategist John
Quincy Adams in the accurate New York
Times paraphrase Gaddis suggests that
Bush's framework for fighting terrorism
has its roots in the lofty idealistic
tradition of John Quincy Adams and
Woodrow Wilson returned with couple of
words about Wilson's idealism but much
more important as Adams who established
the lofty idealistic tradition in a very
famous state paper justifying Andrew
Jackson's conquest of Florida in the
first seminal war of 1818 Adams argued
that the war was justified himself
defense
Gaddis agrees that its motives were
legitimate security concerns in
goddess's version after the British
sacked Washington in 1814 u.s. leaders
recognized that expansion is the path to
security and therefore Concord Florida a
doctrine now expanded to the whole world
by Bush properly so that's the story and
he in fact cites the right scholarly
sources get us good historian primarily
historian William are all weeks who did
the most careful analysis but he emits
what they say and actually we learn a
lot about the precedents for current
doctrines and the current consensus by
filling in the gaps so let's look at
what is what as weeks actually say what
follows is mostly quotes from his main
source weeks describes in lurid detail
what Jackson was doing in the exhibition
of murder and plunder known as the first
Seminole War which was just another
phase in his project of room
moving or eliminating Native Americans
from the southeast which was under way
long before 1814 I didn't do with it
Florida was a problem both because it
had not yet been incorporated into the
expanding American Empire as it was
frankly called by the founding fathers
and because it was quoting a haven for
Indians and runaway slaves fleeing the
wrath of Jackson or slavery there was in
fact an Indian attack which Jackson and
Adams used as a pretext for the
self-defense argument u.s. forces drove
a band of Seminoles off their lands
killing several of them and burning
their village to the ground they
retaliated by attacking a supply boat
under under military command and seizing
the opportunity Jackson quoting again
embarked on a campaign of terror
devastation and intimidation the
destroying villages and sources of food
in a calculated attempt to inflict
starvation on the tribes who sought
refuge from his wrath and the swamps and
so matters continued leading to Adams
highly regarded state paper which enjoy
endorsed Jackson's
unprovoked aggression to establish in
Florida the Dominion of this Republic
upon the odious basis of violence and
bloodshed those happen to be the words
of the Spanish ambassador but as weeks
writes a painfully precise description
weeks continues Adams had consciously
distorted dissembled and lied about the
goals and conduct of American foreign
policy to both Congress and the public
that sounds familiar accident he had
grossly violated his proclaimed moral
principles implicitly defending Indian
Removal and slavery the crimes of
Jackson and Adams
but a prelude to a second war of
extermination against the Seminoles in
which the remnants either fled to the
west to enjoy the same fate later or
were killed or forced to take refuge in
the dense swamps of Florida today weeks
concludes the Seminoles survive in the
national consciousness as the mascot of
the Florida State University which is
again a very typical case well
weeks also stresses the important point
that Addams is a forceful endorsement of
Jackson's crimes shifted the power to
make war from Congress so the
Constitution says to the executive in
violation of the Constitution it's a
principle that remains in force since
1818 not troubling strict
constructionists apparently he goes on
to point out that Adams is rhetoric also
established in quoting the presidential
rhetoric of Empire designed to marshal
public and congressional support for its
policies a durable and essential aspect
of American diplomacy inherited and
elaborated by successive generations of
American statesmen but fundamentally
unchanged over time the rhetorical
framework he says rested on thrist rests
on three pillars the assumption of the
unique moral virtue of the United States
the assertion of its mission to reform
the world to redeem the world by
spreading its professed ideals and the
American Way of life and the faith in
the nation's preordained destiny the
theological framework undercuts reasoned
debate and it reduces policy to a choice
between good and evil therefore reducing
the ever-present threat of democracy
critics can be dismissed as
anti-american an interesting concept
borrowed from the lexicon of
totalitarianism the issue of defense
against Britain the only potential enemy
never even arose
remotely the British Minister Minister
castlereagh was so eager to cement
anglo-american relations that he even
overlooked Jackson's murder of two
innocent British citizens which Adams
defended for as he put it for its
salutary efficacy for terror and example
week's suggests that Adams was heeding
the words of Tacitus his favorite
historian that crime once exposed had no
refuge but in audacity the goal of Adams
is diplomacy had named it security
it was territorial expansion to the
Pacific and that was finally achieved
although in one sense the British threat
was not overcome the British military
force barred the intended conquest of
Canada and Cuba Cuba Adams predicted
that it would drop into US hands like a
ripe fruit by the laws of political
gravitation once the US had succeeded in
overcoming its British enemy and by the
end of the century the laws of political
gravitation were working and the US was
able to intervene to bar
Cuba's liberation from Spain that's what
we call liberating Cuba but in fact it
was preventing the liberation of Cuba
and turning Cuba into a virtual colony
of the United States according to
respected Harvard historians quite
conservative until 1959 when we had
turned to international terrorism and
illegal embargo to restore this story
well filling in the blanks the picture
the actual picture does support
goddess's judgments about the precedents
for the Bush Doctrine and its
implementation as for the expansion of
the doctrine to the entire world
others may judge for themselves and the
world has judged as international polls
have shown fear and off
hatred of the United States has risen to
unprecedented Heights significantly
increasing the threat of terror and also
the likelihood of ultimate doom well to
summarize briefly there is a spectrum of
opinion on the resort to military force
at one extreme so remote from received
opinion that it's scarcely even
mentioned is the post-war consensus
formally articulated in the UN Charter
the Nuremberg Tribunal and subsequent
extensions of these principles the rest
of the spectrum being about a hundred
percent of it basically adopts the
principle that the United States is
uniquely exempt from international law
and is entitled to resort to any
measures it chooses to respond to a
challenge to its power position and
prestige and to ensure uninhibited
access to key markets energy supplies
and strategic resources just quoting
again from the left liberal end of the
consensus the more honest are explicit
in declaring these rights to be
restricted to the US and its clients not
to be universalized but I have to stress
again that the American public is off
the spectrum
it keeps seems to keep firmly to the
post-war consensus which is virtually
excluded totally excluded in fact from
the political system and virtually
excluded from articulate opinion except
at the margins now at the margins we do
find more nuanced opinions on the resort
to force one of the most important is
the independent international
independent commission of inquiry on the
Kosovo war was headed by the
distinguished South African jurist
Justice Richard Goldstone the Commission
rendered the harshest criticism of the
NATO bombing anywhere near the
mainstream concluding that the bombing
was illegal but
legitimate the phrase they used they
said it is illegal it was illegal
because it did not receive approval from
the UN Security Council but it was
legitimate because all diplomatic
avenues had been exhausted and there was
no other way to stop the killing this
and atrocities in Kosovo justice
Goldstone concluded from this that the
UN Charter may need revision in the
light of the report of his commission
and the judgments on which it's based
the NATO intervention he explains is too
important a precedent for it to be
regarded as an aberration rather state
sovereignty is being redefined in the
face of globalization and by the resolve
of the majority of the peoples of the
world that human rights have become the
business of the international community
and he also stressed the need for
objective analysis of human rights
abuses actually that last comment is
good advice so let's follow it
one question that an objective analysis
might address is whether indeed the
majority of the world's peoples accept
the judgment of the enlightened States
well you can review the world press and
official statements and if I do that's
totally false
in fact the bombing of Serbia is
bitterly condemned outside the NATO
countries very little of it reported
here furthermore it's hardly likely that
the self exemption of the enlightened
states from the UN Charter and the
Nuremberg principles would gain the
approval of much of the world's
population well another question that
objective analysis might address is
whether indeed the Coldstone all
diplomatic options had been exhausted in
Kosovo it's easy to check when NATO
decided to bomb there were two
diplomatic options on the table there
was a NATO proposal and a Serbian
proposal the latter kept from the public
here public document after 78 days of
bombing a compromise was reached between
them
indicates that diplomatic options were
indeed available a third question is
quoting again whether there was no other
way to stop the killings and atrocities
in Kosovo as the Commission asserted
crucial obviously a crucial matter well
here objective analysis happens to be
unusually easy there is a vast
documentary record available from
impeccable Western sources that includes
several compilations big compilations
put together by the State Department the
released and justification for the war
the detailed records of the OSCE of NATO
the United Nations lengthy and detailed
British parliamentary inquiry and other
similar sources they all reach the same
conclusion the killings and atrocities
followed the bombing as the mush of each
indictment itself indicates take a look
at it it's for crimes committed after
the bombing the marginal exception and
as the NATO command had announced at
once and later confirmed more detail it
was anticipated that the bombing would
elicit the crimes that followed how is
this handled what a huge literature on
Kosovo after all that was the proof of
the normative revolution handles it very
easily it ignores the enormous
documentary record entirely they try to
find a reference to it and it's West
it's impeccable
Western documentation couldn't get
anything more reliable and almost
invariably the literature reverses the
chronology so that the bombing can be
justified in response to the atrocities
it elicited and is expected to elicit
that you have reviewed this rather
instructive record and some detail in
print and I I'll skip it here but check
can learn a lot about ourselves
Kosovo was not a pretty place before the
native mommy according to Western
sources about 2,000 people were killed
on all sides in the year prior to the
invasion and many of them by KLA
guerrillas Albanian guerrillas coming
attacking serbs from albania in an
effort as they quite openly announced to
elicit harsh reaction that could rally
Western opinion to their cause
the British government which is the most
was the most hawkish element in the
alliance they make the astonishing claim
that until January 1999 most of the 2000
were killed by the KLA and Western
sources consistently report that there
was no significant change after January
99 until March of that year when the
bombing started so they are basically
saying that most of the killings were by
the by then CIA backed gorilla gorilla
is attacking from Albanian that's the
most hawkish element in the Alliance one
of the very few scholarly studies even
to consider these matters estimates that
Serbs were responsible for 500 of the
2000 killed
that's a careful and judicious study by
Nicolas wheeler who supports the NATO
bombing on the grounds that there would
have been worse atrocities if NATO had
not bombed so the argument is that by
bombing with the anticipation that it
will lead to atrocities NATO was
preventing atrocities that such
arguments are taken seriously that gives
no slight insight into Western
intellectual culture particularly when
we recall that there were diplomatic
options and that the agreement reached
after 78 days of bombing was a
compromise between them formally at
least NATO instantly got rid of the
treaty that had signed and imposed its
own interpretation
there's no time to review the history
the Kosovo was actually one of the two
achievements that was brought forth to
give retrospective proof that for the
first time in history states were
observing principles and values all the
rest
the second example used with East Timor
that example is far more atrocious I
mean the fact that it can even be
brought up without shame is an amazing
comment on Western intellectual culture
and here almost the entire West is
complicit the us-british role was the
worst okay that too was extensively
discussed in print so I'll skip it and
end with what is commonly given as the
paradigm example of selfless
humanitarian intervention and is
unhappily again in the news right now
namely Haiti well there's no time to
review the history which is quite
horrifying the two most guilty parties
are France in the United States us the
u.s. role took an even uglier turn under
Wilsonian idealism Wilson's
Marines invaded in 1915 they killed
thousands of people reinstituted virtual
slavery turned Haiti into an American
plantation by a very simple device the
Parliament was disbanded by genuine
marine corps measures as the commander
reported it was disbanded because it
refused to accept what were what was
called a progressive measure necessary
to ensure Haiti's economic development
namely a law allowing US corporations to
take over the country by means quite
similar to those illegally instituted by
Viceroy grammar in Iraq in the last year
Wilson's Marines then ran a free
referendum because we really believe in
free elections in the referendum 5% of
the population participated and 99
percent voted in favor of the required
law for which Franklin Delano
later took credit rightly or not after
19 years the Marine occupation ended
having devastated much of the country it
left the country in the hands of the
vicious National Guard that Wilson
established I'll skip the rest of the
hideous story up to 1990 when a really
horrifying event took place the country
had a genuinely free election its first
the election was won by a populist
priest John Burton on our steed while
Washington's candidate a former World
Bank official received 14 percent of the
vote nobody expected that nobody had
been paying any attention to what was
going on in the slums and the hills of
Haiti we're a genuine democratic culture
developed in the poorest country in the
hemisphere and was able to have a
democratic election of a kind that is
unimaginable here they elected their own
candidate Washington was appalled of
course and moved it once to undermine
the democratic government and when I was
overthrown by a military coup a few
months later Bush number one and then
Clinton effectively supported the
military Hunta and it's wealthy
supporters they even authorized the
Texaco oil company to supply them with
oil and violation of presidential
directives thus rendering the OAS
blockade that the US had been openly
undermining almost entirely meaningless
after three days three years of state
violence Clinton decided that the
population had suffered enough torture
and murder and he allowed President RSD
to return but on a crucial condition
namely that he had to adopt the program
of the defeated us candidate in the 1990
elections okay that's what we call
restoring democracy and an altruistic
effort nation-building as was predicted
at once the harsh program
imposed on Haiti undermined what was
left of a current economic sovereignty
and drove the country into chaos and
violence that which was accelerated by
bush - who when he banned international
aid completely cynical ground last
February the Army and the murderers
Quinta were placed back in power with
the help of France in the United States
the two most guilty parties and now
there's a new reign of terror that's now
we read in the British press that the
most publicized case is that of Gerar
Jean just a Catholic priest who was
arrested last month at a soup kitchen
that he runs for children he's in jail
without charge struck a note with me I
happened to meet him in 1993 when I was
in Haiti at the height of the terror he
was an underground I've been in many
awful places in the world but I had
never seen anything like the terror in
the slums of port-au-prince under the
guns of the hunted and rarely anything
like the misery and poverty the Quinta's
now back in power thanks primarily to
the nobility of their foreign policy
with its saintly glow
well the paradigm example of
humanitarian intervention is not so
simple if we take the trouble to look at
the facts always a useful exercise a few
questions are more important today than
the propriety of the use of force and no
doubt one can imagine and maybe even
find genuine cases of humanitarian
intervention but there's always a heavy
burden of proof and the historical
record should give us pause not only our
own but that of others we might recall
for example the observations of maybe
the major scholarly study of
humanitarian intervention in legal
scholarship
it finds three examples of humanitarian
intervention between the kellogg-briand
pact of 1928 and the UN Charter the
three are Japan's invasion of Manchuria
and North China
Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia and
Hitler's takeover of the Sudetenland now
it's not of course that the author
regards these is genuine examples rather
they're the only potential ones there
and of course they were depicted as
humanitarian intervention and evidence
was indeed provided and however
grotesque it was it was regarded with
some sympathy in the United States and
Britain in fact the use of force is
almost always accompanied by professions
of benign intent near universal
predictable
therefore totally uninformative inquiry
might also unearth genuine cases of
intervention that is illegal but
legitimate although the prime example
offered leaves this as a dubious
doctrine for the times and it tends to
reinforce the measured judgment of the
World Court in 1949 which was reaffirmed
in the Nicaragua case and others that
unquote the court the court can only
regard the alleged right of intervention
as the manifestation of a policy of
force such as has in the past given rise
to most serious abuses and such as
cannot whatever be the defects in
international organization find a place
in international law from the nature of
things intervention would be reserved
for the most powerful states and might
easily lead to the perverting of the
administration of justice itself those
are words worth pondering I think
yes thank you for those powerful words
indeed we have 10 minutes for questions
we have microphones set up please
given the limited amount of time
professor Chomsky has to get to the
airport be brief and that do ask a
question and please identify yourself
first well actually be precise that's
not a consensus so Gonzalez's torture
memos it came under plenty of criticism
can you hear me the Gonzalez's torture
memos came under a lot of criticism so
the idea that we have the right to
commit torture and dismantle the Geneva
Conventions was not an elite consensus
there was plenty of criticism of that on
that issue there was debate how did this
come about you know you know the history
we're not the only country that does it
there are other countries where torture
is legitimate there's one country our
closest ally which I believe is the only
country in the world right now at least
the only Western country in which
evidence obtained under torture can be
used for conviction even without
supporting evidence
okay so torture is technically illegal
but if some if you get a confession
under torture it can still be used even
without supporting evidence that's
Israel where for years torture was legal
and of course it goes on all over the
place effect goes on in her own prisons
but to take a stand as strong as the one
that the Justice Department transmitted
to the bush that did raise objections
like the ones that quoted in fact which
compared it to the Nazis it's not an
usual comparison at the heart of the
establishment you generalize it and say
can you conceive of any action which any
state might take yeah sure you can
imagine such things I mean supposed to
let's say you're in Iran right now okay
Iran is I mean that's a real problem
Iran is surround first of all it's under
attack by the hemisphere by the world's
superpower with embargoes and the other
thing it's surrounded by States either
occupied by the its superpower enemy or
having nuclear weapons will the way down
the road is the regional superpower
which has hundreds of nuclear weapons
and other weapons of mass destruction
and it is essentially an offshore US
military base and has the biggest air
force and technologically most advanced
air force in NATO more than any native
power outside the United States and in
the past year has been supplied by the
global superpower with a hundred
advanced jet bombers openly advertised
as able to fly to Iran and back to bomb
it and also provided with what I'm
talking about Israel I'm
that provided with with the hebrew press
calls special weaponry well nobody knows
what that means but if you're an Iranian
intelligence analyst you're gonna give a
worst-case analysis of it of course and
has actually been publicly provided with
smart bombs and deep penetration weapons
and so on I mean you know they have a
terrific justification for anticipatory
self defense better than any other case
I can think of but do I approve it like
what I approve of their bombing Israel
or carrying out terrorist acts in
Washington and so on no even though they
have a pretty strong case better than
anything I can think of here just as the
Japanese had a much better case than any
that I can think of here so yeah we can
conceive of cases and in fact some of
them are right in front of our eyes but
none of us have proven none of us so if
we don't approve of them in real cases
which are right in front of our eyes
now why discuss hypothetical cases that
don't exist and we could do that in some
philosophy seminar somewhere but in the
real world there are real cases that are
a concern us not hypothetical ones that
somebody can invent and in fact the
threat of terror and weapons of mass
destruction is very severe very severe
and the Bush administration like the
Clinton administration doesn't care
about it in fact they are acting
consciously in ways to increase the
threat okay so yes it's a serious threat
which would be concerned about it in
fact the article I quoted on the threat
of ultimate doom is talking precisely
about that it's saying yeah we can carry
out actions in a way which increase the
threat of ultimate doom for ourselves
and increase the threat of terror to
ourselves but we shouldn't they say we
shouldn't do it and we should pray that
China will stop us and I think we should
pray that will stop us and that happens
all the time I mean like take say the
invasion of Iraq I was a big debate in
Washington was totally pointless and the
media about whether Bush downgraded
terror in order to evade Iraq
nothing to debate invaded Iraq okay
that proves beyond doubt that he
downgraded the threat of terror in favor
of invading Iraq they anticipated and
their own intelligence agencies told
them and everyone else did too that
invasion of Iraq was likely to increase
the threat of terror okay it's not a
high priority so the invaded Iraq
because that's much higher priority so
yeah there and increasing the threat of
terror is not a joke you know you could
get a nuclear weapon smuggled into a New
York hotel room and sooner or later
it'll happen and if we insist on
increasing the threat of terror and
increasing the threat of ultimate doom
we're likely to get it but we don't have
to think about these abstract cases we
this is Spartacus League okay
well I think we all know that line it's
false it's already false and the rest of
the line which most of us are familiar
with they're false that was always
opposed to the snakes
if anybody wants the spider Sisley
manifesto pick it up the door right I'd
love to see workers take power but the
place to organize workers is not here if
you want I'll pay you your car fare to
the nearest manufacturing plant and you
can go over and organize the workers to
take power the rest of this is a waste
of time yeah okay right fine so go do it
I think the there's a significant
literature on specialist literature on
terrorism in the United States you know
Israeli intelligence a lot of others
they all come the same conclusion terror
the the kind of terrorism we allow
ourselves to talk about that is what
somebody else does to us not what we do
to them that kind of terrorism is a
threat
it's double-edged I mean the terrorists
themselves you know they regard
themselves as a vanguard who are trying
to mobilize others and the others are
you know a potential reservoir of
sympathy on people who may hate them and
fear them but recognize that there's
some justice to their claims that's
standard whether it's the IRA in
Northern Ireland or you know or anything
else well we have two ways we ought to
therefore have a double-edge response
with response to terrorists themselves
terrorist acts
those are criminal acts they should be
treated like criminal acts that's police
action and that's worked in fact it's
had successes in Europe Southeast Asia
and elsewhere using Pakistan and other
places ordinary police measures to find
criminals
that works but the much more important
question is what about the people
they're trying to mobilize well there we
have a choice we can help the terrorists
mobilize the Vanguard by carrying out
acts of violence which will justify
their method message or we can deal with
the legitimate grievances of the people
who they are trying to appeal to which
we ought to do independently of
terrorism those are the answers to
terrorism you want to read about them
you can read about it in any of the
specialist literature or statements of
Israeli intelligence or anybody who even
thinks about the matter but we don't
want to do that
we I mean the guys who run the place
they don't want to deal with the
legitimate grievances because their own
interests and they don't care that much
about the threat of terror so they do
but we can change those policies so I
think there's a pretty clear
understanding about how to deal with the
category of terrorism that we allow
ourselves to look at the category in
which we're the victims and it's been it
works i'ma so takes it in Northern
Ireland for a long time the British
responded to IRA terror which was pretty
serious
by just more violence that's a gift of
the IRA they just just organized the
reservoir of sympathy and support for
more terror actually IRA terror was
being supported from here and like
churches in Boston we're supporting it
is supposed to stop funding terrorists
but finally the the British finally got
the idea that they better look at the
grievances and they started attending to
the grievances that lay beyond you know
that kind of were in in the reservoir of
potential sympathy and it worked I mean
then work perfectly like you know
Belfast isn't utopia but it's a lot
better than it was ten years ago yeah
that's the way to deal with terrorism if
you're interested in dealing with terror
if you're not interested in dealing with
it like US policy you just carry out
actions which extend and I have to tell
you a couple of months ago classified
document intriguing it's about the
Kennedy assassination from a couple of
years ago and it suggests to the
government they that they ought to
success
occasionally leaked information about
the Kennedy assassination to the public
so they'll keep the Kennedy
assassination industry going you know
people will continue to follow up leads
and put together complicated stories and
that will keep people away from asking
the serious questions well I don't know
if the CIA actually does that it's a
smart idea and and I don't know whether
they're pushing the stories about
electoral flaws or not but if they're
not they're not doing their job there
are problems with the election plenty
deep ones but they have nothing to do
with whether the votes in Ohio I mean
just have a look at the elections okay
each candidate got the usual thirty
percent of the vote the bush guys got a
little more Kerry guys a little less
tells us happily nothing about the
country if the votes had shifted a
little and carry a little word which
left different in the White House it
would still tell you nothing about the
country and the reasons are well known
and those are the serious questions the
reasons are that people about 10% of the
population
voted on what they call agenda policy
programs and ideas what an election
would be about in a free country ten
percent the rest voted on imagery the
elections are run by the same guys who
sell you toothpaste and cars their job
they don't tell you when they sell a car
you know here are the properties of the
car I did that we need advertising that
would be a market system but we don't
believe in market systems where you
provide information to people we believe
in systems that are based on deceit
you have to deceive the public into
carrying out what's called consumer
choice by you know putting in a sexy
model in the car or having it drive up a
sheer cliff or something like that and
it's the same with that's this whole
system you know that's the whole system
is based on deceit and that's the
opposite of a market system I should say
and it's the same as true in the
political arena it's based on deceit now
furthermore it's not concealed so like
take a look at yesterday's New York
Times and the op-ed pages to how the
Democrats could overcome their problems
and both op-eds
are won by a professor at NYU another
one at Berkeley are about ways to
deceive the public into sneaking in your
own policies by lying to them well that
makes perfect sense in a society that's
based on deceiving the public whether
it's to undermine markets or whether
it's to undermine democracy and in fact
that's what happened people voted for
images Bush is trained to project the
image of someone who will defend you
from terror and has moral values and
Kerry is trained to protect the image of
somebody who cares about the economy and
health and in fact if you look at the
voting voters they tended to believe
that the candidate they voted for had
their opinion which is totally false
when you look at the actual opinions
the positions of the candidates but you
vote for the image just like you buy a
Chevrolet because of the sexy model or
something you vote for the image and the
with the actual attitudes of the
population I gave a sample of them
before from studies that appeared right
before the election from the major
institutions but they're just off the
agenda totally you know just think of
the things that I mentioned they don't
even appear so people are voting for
images you know the bush image got a
little more than the Kerry image but
what it amounts to is flipping a coin
for King and if it turns out to get back
to the flaws to the electoral vote um I
suppose it turns out that the coin was a
little bit biased maybe it was it
doesn't change anything okay so they
flip the biased coin for the King that's
not the problem the problem is a quite
different one and it's the different one
that we ought to be concerned about
