Noam Chomsky is a professor of
linguistics at MIT University in
Cambridge Massachusetts he's been a
political activist and critic of u.s.
foreign policy since the Vietnam War
he's the author of more than 80 books on
politics media studies linguistics
philosophy and psychology his latest
book is middle-east illusions and for
the next three hours Noam Chomsky will
be taking your phone calls and emails as
our guest on book TVs in-depth
well some of it I do because I find it
intellectually challenging and exciting
and demanding and some of that I do
because I just feel it has to be done so
you know people are suffering bitterly
throughout the world there are a lot of
things we can do about it and that seems
to be a responsibility that comes with
privilege and freedom which we have to
an unusual degree maybe unique degree to
involve ourselves in these issues what
do you think of the United States I
think it's a complicated country it has
wonderful achievements it's in some
domains it's gone beyond any other
country in the world
protection for freedom of speech for
example many other liberties it's got
tremendous advantages incomparable had
the biggest economy in the world over a
century ago yeah I don't think it's used
them properly the there's plenty of many
of the actions that the US government
has taken in the world I think are
deplorable and should be stopped and
reversed and it's you can't really
comment on a country there's just too
many facets to it there's a society
there's a culture there's just too many
things I mean when I take my grandson to
a baseball game as I did last Sunday I
enjoy being part of mainstream America
when I look at US government foreign
policy or the domestic highly regressive
domestic policies I'm extremely critical
Noam Chomsky will be with us for just a
little under three hours and we will go
to the phones in the next several
minutes but for the first part of this
program we want to chat a bit about his
life Philadelphia played a big role in
your life what year were you born
I was born in 1928 in Philadelphia a
immigrant first-generation immigrant
family Jewish my parents were very much
involved in fact immersed in the Jewish
community
Hebrew culture my father was a Hebrew
scholar ran the Hebrew school systems my
mother taught in it deeply committed to
Zionist Zionism we have to remember that
that was something different than from
what it is today and actually I grew up
in a community which in which we were
for most of the time the only Jewish
family in a mostly German and Irish
Catholic community and a lot of problems
which incidentally my parents never knew
about but the streets were complicated
places problems for you that they never
give us an example well as I say there
was a lot of anti-semitism of those this
is a 1930s deeply anti-semitic period
the I don't like to say it but I grew up
with a kind of a visceral fear of
Catholics I knew it was irrational got
over it but it was just this street
experience and there were periods during
these were periods of complex ethnic
conflicts in the cities um there were
times when I was a young teenager where
in Philadelphia there was a curfew I
think a seven or eight o'clock curfew on
teenagers if we wanted to go out in the
evening we had to have parental
authority there were times when the walk
from the subway station to the Hebrew
school was under police guard and it
wasn't just
Jews were not you know there was a lot
of anti-semitism but a win at all
directions actually get a pretty good
picture of it from some of the novels
written about the period describing
urban ethnic conflicts which are
complicated and real wrote in the middle
of them where had your parents come from
and what were they like my father had
come from Ukraine right before the first
world war escaping the Czarist army my
mother had come from what's now Belarus
her family she came when she was a baby
actually but and the two families were
were first-generation immigrant families
what were they like over your parents
life well had a very warm loving child
that I looked back at it with a lot of
warmth and affection we they were both
working
they taught Hebrew school so I was in
school actually from all day from the
time I was about a year and a half old
and it I was actually in an early years
up to high school in a experimental
school that was run by Temple University
a dewy-eyed
a school a wonderful place I don't know
if there's anything like it today
fostered creative activity there was no
competition that I didn't know I was a
good student until I got to high school
because the question never arose you
know you weren't graded by your
achievements I mean I knew I skipped the
class but I didn't think anything
particularly of it and nor did anyone
else
it was a very healthy exciting
intellectual learning social environment
why did you decide to go to the
University of Pennsylvania where you've
got I believe your undergraduate your
masters and your PhD question never
arose you didn't go into the idea of
public
leaving home was inconceivable yet we
were working students both my wife and I
you lived at home you went to the local
school I worked in the afternoon the the
the concept of going away to college
just wasn't it wasn't in the you know
didn't exist you didn't the question
never came up when did you first get
interested in linguistics that was sort
of accident well it's complicated my
father was a Hebrew scholar he did work
on medieval in grammar and growing up as
a child I read his manuscripts and the
drafts of the book and so on I was kind
of intrigued by it but then I happened
through actually through political
contacts to meet zelich Harris who I
later discovered was the most important
and influential linguist in the country
happened to be teaching at the
University of Pennsylvania I was
actually on the verge of dropping out of
college at that time I was pretty bored
with the dice I got in at 16 and a lot
of anticipation and excitement and was
mostly killed in the first year and I
was not really committed to staying I
met him and he drew me back into college
I suspect in retrospect that he was
doing it on purpose but I don't know
anyhow I started taking his graduate
courses and through his influence other
also mostly graduate courses and other
fields and he was an extremely brilliant
and exciting a person in many respects
and my interests developed through those
contacts and then on from there when did
you meet your wife Carol
she was about two years old and I was
about in four years old I guess these
were closely knit communities
she was also from a Jewish community her
father and mother were from European
immigrants and the families knew each
other and we had sort of met as children
and they went through a kind of similar
history you know Hebrew schools Hebrew
camps by time we were teenagers we
interacted in a different fashion we
married pretty young she was nineteen I
had just turned 21 there are people that
say there are two Noam Chomsky's as you
know the language and the political
activists which one of those do you
prefer well I can't really say if the
world would go away I would much I would
be very happy to keep to what's called
my professional work linguistics
philosophy cognitive science and so on
which I do find that exciting
exhilarating challenging and demanding
and easily could could easily put my
full-time activities into it on the
other hand the other activities in their
own way are difficult
rewarding complicated also challenging
unnecessary again if you've just joined
us our guests for the next two hours and
45 minutes Noam Chomsky who is now
located at MIT how long have you been
there almost 50 years what year did you
go there and why I went there in 1955
and actually at that I had just I had
been at Harvard for four years and a
graduate fellowship and had just gotten
a PhD from University of Pennsylvania
where actually hadn't been for four
years I had no recognized academic field
the work that I had was doing was
it didn't fit anywhere didn't have any
academic home and I had no particular
expectations of going on into an
academic career because they didn't for
one thing they didn't seem to be any
possibilities but I did receive an
invitation from MIT to be in the
electronics lab I don't know a tape
recorder from a telephone practically
and annoint nothing about electronics
but I was the electronics lab at the
time was directed by Jerry Wiesner later
became Kennedy's science advisor who was
a pretty very imaginative person he was
he the laboratory itself was a mixture
of all kinds of exciting activities a
good deal of MIT at that time was in a
transition from being primarily an
engineering school to becoming primarily
in fact totally a science-based
University it's a 10-year transition
which had a lot to do with things
happening in American science and
technology and so on and the electronics
lab where I was was the center of a lot
of these activities biology
neurophysiology mathematics linguistics
acoustics just on and on many of these
were experimental efforts it wasn't at
all clear that they were going to go
anywhere some of them succeeded very
well others failed but it was a great
ferment of intellectual excitement and
interaction and challenge now there were
other places like it at the same time
for example laboratories and as I was
primarily in the electronics lab in a
research position but I also was asked
to do some teaching
I did I was able to teach introductory
linguistics and philosophy courses the
first ones and these areas that had been
taught there but mainly I was my service
to the university was teaching cram
courses in French and German to graduate
students who in those days had to pass a
reading exam in French and German which
they considered a total waste of time
because they knew they were never going
to look at anything and there was a
technique for sort of getting them
through the exam essentially teaching
them to fake their way through the exam
and that's of course as I was teaching
first couple years on the screen is some
shots of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology which is on the Charles River
right across from Boston in Cambridge
Massachusetts how many students there
you know I think there's roughly last
time I looked it was about four thousand
undergraduates and I think about maybe
twice that many graduate students
something roughly on that order my
background on you says that you have
published 65 political books and 33
linguistic books from a total of 60
different publishers we have been doing
book shows here for many many years I've
never heard of anybody publishing 98
books well a lot of those books are
collections of talks interviews if you
looked at the ones I actually sat down
and wrote you know it wouldn't come to
anything like that what was your first
first book the first book was called
syntactic structures and that was
actually not intended for publication
it was notes for an undergraduate
linguistics course at MIT which at that
time this material was basically
unpublishable it did not belong in any
recognised field I had submitted a
couple of articles to journals which
were returned and I'd submitted a book
for publication and it was
return MIT press with the was returned
with the sensible comment that didn't
seem to belong anywhere or in iota and
wait until the field exists before
trying to submit a book which was not an
unreasonable comment it did come out
twenty years later by then the field
have been established the first
syntactic structures was actually a note
which Dutch publisher who visited the
saw sitting on my desk and asked if I
would put it together and let them
publish it as a monograph and they did
what was your first political book first
political book was American power and
the new mandarins which was a collection
of essays came out in 1969 it's just
been reprinted it was essays and taught
mostly a lot of them based on talks
through the 1960s starting around 1963 I
began I became pretty much involved in
the Vietnam War issues and was giving
many talks usually to audiences of two
or three people that was absolutely no
interest at the time but over the years
had built up button to by the late
sixties they were that there were way
more invitations and opportunities than
I could take up I was also directly
involved in activism and resistance
what am I have to say for years every
time I came to Washington the first
thought that came to mind was the smell
of tear gas in and out of demonstrations
in and out of jail a number of times and
the the essays were a collection of in
the book were collection of the talks
commentary discussions based on these
activities I have on my lap here a
Norman Mailer book called the armies of
the night and up at the top is a picture
of you back in 1967 what were you doing
there at the Pentagon
that was a big demonstration at the
Pentagon and suppose it was October 1967
one of the first large-scale
national demonstration is not the first
that one of the biggest on the national
level actually Miller and I ended up in
the adjacent cots and a detention center
somewhere after we were arrested over
the years lots of controversy lots of
books we're gonna go the phones in about
ten minutes and they'll have a chance to
deal with these but the other book that
I have in my lap and I've got a lot of
your books is one that's a small one
it's called 9/11 and it was a
best-seller what was what's your main
point in this book about 9/11 well that
book is a collection of interviews it's
a it's not a it's a sample of interviews
and it happens to be just those that
happen to be electronically stored so
for example it doesn't include
interviews on BBC and so on and right
after 9/11 there was a massive requests
from the United States and around the
world for discussion of the events their
background what they meant
what their gonna lead to and this is a
slightly edited collection of a number
of those interviews the point was if
there is a single point that we should
be aware of the role that we play in the
world what happened on 9/11 is a
horrifying atrocity it's probably the
worst single act of large-scale terror
that's ever taken place I don't think
there's another single case where
thousands of people were killed in one
act on the other hand for much of the
world the response to 9/11 was welcome
to the club we've been through this and
you often done it to us so for example
the Forgotten over there
quoted it in there but the the research
Journal of the Jesuit University in
Managua Nicaragua which is one of the
main research journals in Central
America they published an editorial
immediately after 9/11 describing it as
everyone did as a horrifying atrocity
expressing sympathy for the victims
saying you could call it Armageddon and
then they added but we have been through
our own Armageddon in slow motion under
the under massive terrorist attack
organized and directed by the United
States which led tens of thousands of
people killed in the country practically
ruined that may never recovered so we do
sympathise with the terrible atrocity
that was carried out against you but
it's not unfamiliar to us and that was a
reaction through a good deal of the
world now that's why if you look at the
there was an international Gallup poll
taken shortly after September 11th I
think it was about September 20th
roughly in that about a week after
asking this was at a time when the
bombing of Afghanistan had in effect an
announced but had not yet been
undertaken so it was in that interim
period and the question asked around the
world was do you support what it said
actually is if the perpetrators of the
terrorist attack are identified on that
assumption would you be in favor of
bombing the place where they came from
their refuge and then there were two
questions if it attacked only military
targets second if it also hit civilians
well it was never published in the
United States but the responses were
interesting there was very little
support for the policy that was actually
undertaken and incidentally we should
say that they hadn't identified
perfect perpetrators but in Latin
America which is the region of most
experienced with us domination and
intervention responsive the support was
extremely low it ranged from about 2%
and support in Mexico to about 11% I
think in Colombia and Venezuela
the only marginal exception was Panama
which has a very Anglo an American
component there and even there 16
percent supported bombing I think 80
percent supported diplomatic means for
the efforts for extradition and that
reflects a history of experience long
experience so yes all over the world
there was overwhelming sympathy for the
victims horror of the terrible atrocity
but a recognition that life's more
complicated we've been on the receiving
end for a long time from European
imperialism which was violent and
destructive and from the us variant of
it and I think it's only the first of
all it's the merest honesty to face this
but if we're interested in reducing the
threat of terrorism which is enormous
exodus if you want to really be
frightened to read the recent heart
Redman study sponsored study of the
Council on Foreign Relations on
terrorist threats to the United States
and they're pretty awesome well if you
if you hope to reduce and lessen these
threats you have to make a crucial
distinction between the terrorists
themselves who are carrying out criminal
acts and you treat it like criminal acts
and the reservoir of in which they're
concerned their message kind of
resonates even among people who hate and
despise them but nevertheless recognize
some authenticity to what they say
and it's that a reservoir of you can't
really call it sympathy but
understanding where real grievances lie
that have to be dealt with that's true
no matter what kind of terrorism you're
facing if you want to reduce the threat
pay attention to the grievances from
which they arise and if they're
legitimate and then they often are to
deal with them for one thing because
they're legitimate not for another
because it's just sanity if you're
hoping to reduce the terror these are
topics discussed in jest interviews
Justin and Noam Chomsky's are guests and
we're gonna go to the phones we have a
call from Maryville Illinois first up go
ahead please hello dr. Tomsky I was
introduced to your writings and works as
an undergraduate about four years ago at
the University of Illinois and I was I
was intrigued by your you know by the
straightforwardness that you had in your
writings and I first read them on the
net and anyway my question it's a
two-part question they're unrelated
parts my first question is where do you
attribute the incompetence of today's
leaders in this country as compared to
you know the leaders such as FDR in the
early 20th century you know men of
distinction and and honor I know you
know presidents like Andrew Jackson and
and some other ones were you know not
very honorable but uh what do you would
you attribute this I mean it's been it's
been decades now where we've had leaders
you know one after the other just you
know promote these policies and enact
these you know these wars and these you
know what do you attribute that to do
you nice car that's good well I'm not
sure I would use the word incompetence I
mean I think they're very competent they
know what they're doing they're
dedicated committed are they even tell
us very frankly what they're doing so
for example the national security
strategy that was announced last
September was a very clear brazen
statement of a
a program of sustaining world dominance
by means of force and announcing the
intention to rely on force to suppress
any potential challenge to that
dominance that's quite a departure as a
policy statement and it's sent many
shutters around the world including the
foreign policy a lead at home but
there's nothing incompetent about it
it's a very clear explicit statement
Frank statement why they're pursuing
those policies well we can look at them
but if we take an honest look at the
past it's not very pretty I mean we can
ask for example why we were sitting
where we're sitting there were people
here after all lots of them you know
millions of them what happened to them
well
the founding fathers were pretty frank
about it they knew what they were doing
so John Quincy Adams for example many
years after his own very ugly
contributions to this were over did have
a change of heart and he condemned what
they had done for in what he called
exterminating the hapless race of Native
Americans with ferocious cruelty or
words approximately like that they
understood what they were doing they
cleared the continent they conquered
half of Mexico in a war which was
bitterly condemned within the country
correctly it was a terrible war a
century ago the United States conquered
the Philippines killed a couple hundred
thousand people that a good part of the
military command ended up facing war
crimes trials afterwards there was
bitter condemnation of that to Mark
Twain for example leading may be the
leading writer in the United States
wrote very bitter sardonic anti-war
essays
and and we can go on the history has not
been a pretty one and that's why the the
after the national territory was
conquered power extended to the region
of the United States was not a major
actor in the global scene until after
Second World War but it was regionally
the dominant power in the Caribbean and
Central America extending to Hawaii
which was taken from its own citizens by
force and guile on to the Philippines
but particularly in Central America and
the Caribbean now those are not if you
take a look at the record there it's not
at all attractive Washington DC for Noam
Chomsky good morning good day um well
there's more like 300,000 Philippines
and that's my point and my disagreement
with mr. Chomsky it's to general mr.
Chavez be specific as a prosecutor and
factually and the facts are known the
body counts are well known and everyone
quotes them incorrectly
that's my disagree with the I like to
work very much and many people follow
you but I think you need to
if Hussein's criminal to be prosecuted
then our involvement and participation
and Helmut Kohl's involvement
participation ATS is a prosecutable
crime also and also our uranium war
crimes or the wars in Ethiopia James
Baker restarted in 91 and now 20 million
Ethiopians are in risk of starving to
death and there's plenty of food in this
world there's no famine without war this
is the heart of the matter and the
generalizations goes farther away from
it and look at their faces see them and
thank you for your time well I certainly
agree with you that one should be
accurate about the facts and if you
would like to bring up some specific
questions about facts be happy to answer
to think about them and if you know I
made a mistake to correct it you're
right about the tremendous suffering and
agony throughout the world much of it we
it
by no means all the result of US policy
obviously not problems in Africa are
extremely ugly and complex in the Congo
alone several million people have been
killed in the last few years in the wars
that would not be easy to handle and
deal with though a good deal could be
done about them there's plenty of
starvation I don't think war is the only
factor that lies behind the famine that
often famines take place when as you say
there's plenty of food but social and
political conditions are such that the
food isn't getting to the people who
need it and there's plenty that can be
done about that the AIDS epidemic is
devastating not only Africa but many
other parts of the world and resources
there there are methods of treatment
which require not huge sums of money and
we could dedicate ourselves our portion
of our resources to dealing with that we
have ample resources many of them being
used in destructive ways but your point
is correct there's all sorts of horrible
things going on in the world some of
them were responsible for and there we
have a direct responsibility to
terminate what we're doing and improve
the situation
others are things we could assist and to
the extent possible we have a
responsibility to do that there are
plenty of others which are going to be
well out of our control this book called
middle-east illusions is in the
bookstores right now by Noam Chomsky as
we go to North Andover Massachusetts
you're next go ahead please well
professor Chomsky good afternoon I'm
honored to ask you a question
I have when you said to the grandson
that you were able to enjoy a baseball
game with last week with your love of
words and your love of linguistics I was
just curious
if you ever had the opportunity to have
any connection with mr. Edward L Bernays
who was a resident of Cambridge for the
last 40 years of his life was first in
New York City and was for almost a
hundred years connected with very
powerfully the public affairs work of
the American tobacco company working
with Guatemala for a war that almost was
started because of bananas in the 50s
and all of these different media actions
that I believe have really contributed
to where we are now
in our our world view of we have got a
corporate mentality of destroying what
we don't like taking it over
manipulation of it because his luring
from his uncle Sigmund Freud was
utilized to his best ability with
twisting people's view of what was good
for them so that he could sell products
to them thanks caller Eddie Bernays
actually I never you're right he lived
in Cambridge we weren't that for a part
I never actually met him but all the
other public relations yeah but I've
written a fair amount I've looked a lot
that a lot of his work and in fact I've
written a fair amount about it I suspect
that it wasn't his Freud who was the big
influence on him but rather in fact
exactly what he said he said the major
influence on him was his participation
in the first state propaganda agency in
the United States Woodrow Wilson's
Committee on Public Information which
was established in order to try to drive
a basically pacifist population into
support for the war that Wilson very
much wanted to get into and in Europe
and it succeeded within a short period
of time the propaganda efforts they were
called propaganda in those days it was
more honest use of terminology the
Buganda efforts of the Committee on
Public Information a very Orwellian name
was did succeed in driving a pacifist
population into raving aunty German
fanatics you know to the point where in
the Boston Symphony Orchestra couldn't
play Beethoven things like that it drove
the country into a kind of hysteria and
the participants in that committee
included many people of subsequent great
distinction and influence Edward Bernays
was one another was walter Lippmann
leading public intellectual at 20th
century and most important figure in
American media both of them went through
the that experience and learned from it
and wrote about what they learned from
it
what they learned as Bernays put it in
his famous book of his called propaganda
late 1920s I think he said that we have
learned that the intelligent minorities
can engineer consent through the use of
manipulation propaganda and control and
we should do it
for the benefit of the public it's for
the benefit of the public that we should
control them an engineer their consent
Lippmann said pretty much the same thing
also drawing from the experience of the
wartime propaganda agency he wrote
significant important essays on
democracy in the 1920s called
progressive essays and democracy they
were both liberals kind of wilsonian
progressives he said that well we've
learned that there's a new art in the
practice of democracy the art of what he
called manufacturing consent Brunei's
this term was engineering of consent and
this is very significant because the
public should not be participants in the
democratic process
they should be spectators not
participants they are ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders as he put it and
for their own benefit
we the intelligent minority the
responsible men must control them
Bernays is particular significance this
had all sorts of influence all over the
place but for in the intellectual
culture in political science and so on
but Bernays particular influence was
exactly as you say and he was one of the
founders of the modern public relations
industry which grew into a massive
industry right at that period and had it
existed before but it became very
important after the at this time and its
goal was to control attitudes beliefs to
marginalize people to induce to drive
them towards what we're called the
superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption and keeps them
out of the public arena where they don't
belong Bernays --is first major
achievement was a program that convinced
women to smoke cigarettes women didn't
smoke in those days but he had an
elaborate public relations program
including models walking down Fifth
Avenue you know to show with cigarettes
showing this is what modern women are
like and it did succeed in turning women
into smokers with a toll that we need
not discuss the Guatemala case you're
correct he was the public relations
he ran the public relations for the
propaganda effort to support the
overthrow the democratic government of
Guatemala which led to horrifying
atrocities which the country is still
suffering from one of the examples that
we should be anything but proud of and
he did play a role on that he did a lot
of other things he's famous at Cambridge
for a campaign to save the Sycamores on
Memorial Drive which was again a
successful public relations campaign
that many people admired
Springfield Massachusetts for noam
chomsky hello good afternoon professor
Chomsky
question to you is view believe that a
nation should suffer a denture
detrimental cost in order to compensate
for wrongs committed by the governors of
that nation nearby segments of that
nation in the past I'm not sure exactly
what the question means are we
responding under let me see if I can
understand it suppose you're living
under a dictatorship and the dictators
carry out some horrendous act so you're
living in Stalinist Russia let's say
and Stalin carries out horrible crimes
are the people of Russia responsible for
those crimes well to only a very limited
extent because living under a brutal
harsh terrorist regime there isn't very
much I can do about it they could think
there's something they could do and to
the extent that you can do something
you're responsible for what happens
suppose you're living in a free
democratic society with lots of
privilege enormous incomparable freedoms
and the government carries out two
violent brutal acts are you responsible
for it yeah a lot more responsible
because there's a lot you can do about
it and therefore the the cost of if
you're responsible if you share
responsibility in criminal acts you are
liable for the consequences Jacksonville
Florida good afternoon i professor
Chomsky it's an honor to speak to you
sir
I'd like to have you addressed the idea
of 9/11 as like a false flag or a let it
happen on purpose kind of situation I
mean it's not exactly unprecedented and
unprecedented in American history or
world history for that matter especially
given the project for the American
century where Paul Wolfowitz said that
it would take like a Pearl Harbor like
attack on America to be able to
implement their plans and could you just
that for me please well I know that's a
widely held belief frankly I'm
personally extremely skeptical about it
I don't think there's any likelihood
that an action like that could have been
planned and I don't really think there
are any historical precedents for it if
the White House had been in any way
involved in planning this it would have
been an act of absolute madness on their
part but for one thing you could never
tell where what was going to where it
was going to go for another would
certainly have leaked
I mean it's inconceivable that a plan of
that nature wouldn't have leaked and it
just doesn't make any sense in my
opinion and I don't think the evidence
is at all compelling that read but there
is you're quite right about the
exploitation of it when it happened it
was exploited not just in the United
States but all over the world so for
example the Russians were exploited
September 11th as they saw it as a
window of opportunity to step up their
really brutal repression and violence in
Chechnya claiming for presenting it as a
struggle against terrorism and expecting
to get authorization from the United
States the world ruler which indeed
happened Israel used it as a window of
opportunity to step up repression and
the occupied territories claiming it's a
war against terror China did the same in
western China where they're carrying out
again harsh repressive activities
against the dissidents sometimes rebel
groups again expecting u.s.
authorization which they got all over
the world governments including more
democratic governments used it as an
opportunity to impose more discipline on
their own populations so yes it was
recognized throughout the world by state
power as an opportunity to increase
repressive actions that were underway or
to imposed discipline and so on but that
doesn't mean that all those countries
planned they just recognized it as a
window of opportunity and I think the
same was true here if you just joining
us we have about two hours and 15
minutes to go on our in-depth
program on this Sunday afternoon with
noam chomsky next call
tre Illinois hello hello I'd like to
question the effectiveness of
demonstrations and especially civil
disobedience in effectively changing US
policy in the Vietnam War dragged out
for 17 years public opinion turned
against the war in 1968 if the war
dragged on for seven more years and the
PIA impulse and public opinion research
showed that the public even though they
hated the war they hated the
demonstrators even more so that just
prolonged the war like we have a March
here in Peoria a rally against the war
in Iraq we had 200 marchers we've got
five inches in the newspaper one little
inch of new information why people
should be against the war you're never
going to be able to demonstrate in the
street get coverage like that and get
your message across you had to do direct
door-to-door lit dropping literature
dropping stuffing doorknobs or
canvassing toward the door to get your
message out with a full sheet of paper
with all your arguments the media is not
going to do the job for you did not get
your message across in the detail and
