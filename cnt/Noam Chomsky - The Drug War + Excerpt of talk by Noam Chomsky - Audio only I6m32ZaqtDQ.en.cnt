welcome to making contact an
international radio program seeking to
create connections between people vital
ideas and important information this
week I'm making contact the US
Department of Agriculture recognizes
that hemp is the fire superior and
profitable agriculture renewable fiber
however they can't grow it because of
the current administrative language well
we're real happy that our products are
high in protein high in dietary fiber
lion iron also hemp seed is the most
nutritionally complete seed on the
planet for human consumption once a
mainstay of us agriculture growing hemp
has been illegal in the United States
since the 1930s hemp fiber and seeds can
be used to make a variety of products
such as clothing and food but since hemp
fiber is derived from the same plant as
marijuana it's been difficult for
supporters of industrial hemp to
overturn the ban on this program you'll
hear from farmers and hemp activists in
the United States and Canada who are
developing cooperatives and other
programs to bring hemp back to the
agriculture scene I'm Philip average
your host this week on making contact
Rolla miracle revitalize itself if we're
given the chance to have a crop that we
can process at home and have value added
to it Bob winter is a farmer in Colorado
who is fighting against what some
activists term depression-era economics
with a vengeance out of the dust of the
depression came the marihuana Tax Act
which banned industrial hemp to farmers
like winter this decades-old prohibition
has been costly hemp is easy to farm and
potentially profitable farmers have a
need for an alternative crop something
that's good for the country save our
trees reduced pesticide use everything
that everybody wants environmentally and
farmers want profitability industrial
hemp can fill the bill
the family farm started to erode about
the same time soil did at the same time
him prohibition had not come about 1937
there's no coincidence in that you have
to really there's something that about
that that really rings a bell because
the family farm really started to lose
out when it is lost it's one commodity
that was to provide real value to the
farm that's him Dave almquist makes food
products using hemp and hemp seeds he
and his business partner kathleen chip i
sell cookies pancake mixes burger mixes
and now hemp chips correspondent may
Jarrell visited with them at their home
in Boulder County Colorado is they
prepared to fill orders for local health
food stores well we're real happy that
our products are high in protein high in
dietary fiber high and iron also and low
in saturated fat zero saturated fat
total fat grams in our products is never
more than 3 grams of fat per serving
which is phenomenal and this is good fat
anyways hemp seed is the most
nutritionally complete seed on the
planet for human consumption it contains
a perfect three to one ratio of omega-3
omega-6 essential fatty acids gamma
linoleic and gamma linolenic acids and
they are the building blocks of your
entire system we're talking twenty eight
percent protein and this is comparable
to a steak or to any kind of meat like
lean meat like whale lean steak lean
ground beef twenty-eight percent protein
by a volume per ounce is very hard to
beat the two met a couple of years ago
and started the boulder hemp company I'd
passed through Lawrence about a month
prior to that after leaving I believe
hash bash and stopped in a music store
and an alternative store called creation
station and saw a poster about Omega
music festival and sky Lister the guy
owner of creation station told me that
his partner Dave um Chris would be
selling hemp food there and he thought
our hemp food would go well so headed
out to Kansas where we met Dave but it's
been a rocky road to success there's
been a lot of confusion because
partially because police officers have
been miss educated about the hemp plant
and in 1996 while vending with a
peddlers permit in Denver at the monthly
smoking at the State Capitol unbeknownst
to us we arrived to find at least a
hundred training officers for the State
Patrol learning how to handle crowd
control and riots and they were
practicing on the hemp hemp events and I
was arrested at the very beginning for
my cookies the police officers checked
my permit and said I was free to go
because I was I hadn't done anything
illegal but they refused to give me my
five hundred cookies back and I asked
them for a receipt and they said no
receipt and that I would never see my
things again and so I told them they
couldn't steal from me and I began to
walk away with my cookies and seven
grown police officers grown men jumped
on top of me through cuffs on me for
interfering with police officers who
were confiscating my things so I was put
under arrest and released after two
hours of verbal education I should say
to the police officer I was released and
returned all my cookies and but we also
recently in November of 97 had a package
confiscated at the UPS by the Milwaukee
Police Department the package was headed
to Madison and it contained 50 pounds of
sterilized hemp seed well the Milwaukee
Police Department is confusing
sterilized hemp seed with cannabis for
some reason and burned our product and
told us we wouldn't we would not see it
again so right now the Builder hem
company is in has filed a suit against
the Milwaukee Police Department we're
merely asking for 480 some dollars
whatever whatever our package was worth
plus time we've put into this but
there's a lot of controversy because
police officers and just regular jim and
joe on the street cannot they've been
miss educated in what hemp and cannabis
are and the legalities of it and i think
right now in the United States all over
the country we're still deciding on how
we feel about hemp and cannabis I don't
think all the laws that are out there
going to be around much longer Kathleen
ship I and Dave own quest of Boulder
hemp company speaking with may Jarrell
in Canada there's been a lot of
political support for encouraging hemp
production last March it was legalized
according to hemp farmer Don Dean who
helps run the White Buffalo renewable
cooperative in Ontario the process to
obtain permits and licenses to cultivate
hemp is long in bureaucratic but Dean
says that that doesn't bother him too
much he's just happy to be farming him I
understand it then the farmers
understand respective to you know we
have no interest in doing anything
illegal i mean really mean we don't mind
going to the process if that's what we
have to do to grow italy green and to
meet those requirements Dean adds that
since hemp has been legalized it's been
embraced in Canada white buffalo
cooperative works with local governments
to farm the plans we go to a
municipalities and their tax base is all
of this agricultural land you know I
mean all this farmland that they have
you know that they've taken back you
through the person the farmers died and
the left of the the stator you know or
whatever so white buffalo renewables
what we do is we approach these town
while they actually approached us we put
little ads in the paper farmer
landowners wanted to grow industrial
hemp we have a phone number and then
people call and uh and what we do then
as we grow and meet with the mayor and
in the city through the town council or
the county officials and everything and
we hope may the plan is that we would do
is the town applies for a license to
grow to the Government of Canada to grow
hemp ok so the license is actually to
that community and they get the license
approved and then they tell us the way
Buffalo we know what we do as we come in
and we hold a public meeting with the
farmers in that area ok and we say ok
there's this 10,000 hectares or a
thousand hectares that this county wants
to grow a hemp on
and what we do is we get farmers in that
locality to join in that community they
join is the these white buffalo
cooperatives are set in different places
like there's one in British Columbia
which is very doing very well white
buffalo renewables out there and and so
we get the farmers in that community
involved in in the actual labor and
everything like that the city of town
why's the the seeds and everything to be
planted in the weak will become and
using that those people we grow the
thing for them we bring in the
processing to make it into it like the
seeds we make into food products either
a milk or rice camp ice cream or things
like this and the stocks that are used
in different ways the bedding for the
animals for the herds and the fibers of
course you know we can use it in many
many things we're looking at generating
energy for electricity up here using the
stocks for that manner and because we
have a big thing happening with
deregulation in ontario right now and
and that and in the electrical field
lectric generation fields there's an
opportunity for us and growers there to
generate electricity for that community
and that and what we do is is we give
that community if 500 all we'll just I
don't call them while giving quote 500
approximately five hundred dollars per
hectare every year for the next five
years to that community so if he's got a
thousand hectares that community is
getting a five hundred thousand dollars
a year every year for the next five
years you're listening to making contact
a production of the national radio
project this radio program can now be
heard on over 130 stations in the United
States Canada Haiti and South Africa and
around the world on radio for peace
international shortwave if you want to
learn how you can get involved with
making contact or you'd like to get in
touch with any of the organization's you
hear about in this program
please give us a call it's toll free 800
five two nine five seven three six call
that same phone number for tapes and
transcripts that's eight hundred five
two nine five seven three six we also
welcome comments and suggestions for
future programs in the state of Kentucky
farmers are also looking to hemp as a
viable crop something that can help
small and mid-sized farmers stay afloat
Joe Hickey who runs the Kentucky hemp
cooperative says that his organization
is engaged in advocacy work and
political actions to try and legalize
hemp you have a lot of farmers that are
dependent on to tobacco crops especially
here in Kentucky so what happens with
the legislation that is pending right
now a lot of the Kentucky farmers are
going to you know potentially lose you
know their ability to make a living stay
on the farm so if they lose that they
are looking for an alternative source of
of an income so it's something that
these guys absolutely want to do you
know the tobacco farmers have got to
find something else to do you know with
this land people say well you know
industrial hemp will never replace
tobacco nobody ever said it would and we
don't believe it will and the farmers
that want to grow you know tobacco are
not going to quit growing it you know
they're going to continue to grow
tobacco until you know they can anymore
but they want to have access to a way of
allowing their self the financial
ability to you know to make that happen
make it a reality foam and industrial
hemp does that there's a lot of farmers
that just don't want to be perceived as
killing you know thousands and millions
of people it's just the you know it's
something that I think a lot of farmers
are really you know kind of given second
thoughts to a crop that has that is
known to be more addictive than a lot of
other drugs that are illegal Hickey says
that he's encountered little opposition
in Kentucky to his legalization drive
I've been involved in this since 1993
and the only time I've ever seen any
opposition to this was always related to
the federal government in their drug
program or the marijuana growers that's
the only two people that we've ever seen
have any kind of opposition to this
according to Hickey marijuana growers
don't like industrial hemp firms because
the crops are made up of mostly male
plants that pollinate the pot growers
female plants causing them to flower
prematurely Hickey filed a lawsuit
against the federal government for its
ban on industrial hemp in addition actor
Woody Harrelson whose celebrity has
helped to publicize the hemp issue is in
court on a hemp case of his own Joe
Hickey is the state lawsuit where he
planted for industrial hemp seeds and
you know he basically did it in front of
everybody to test the legality of the
Kentucky statute and the district judge
said that you know it it didn't pass
mustard and threw it out of court then
the prosecutor appealed the judge's
ruling and went to Circuit Court the
circuit court also said that woody was
right there is a difference they
appealed it again to the court court of
appeals here in Kentucky so it sits at
the court of appeals here in Kentucky
and so at this point we're basically
sitting back and waiting to see what the
court of appeals does Joe Hickey of the
Kentucky hemp cooperative
hemp has won over some high-level
officials within agriculture regulatory
agencies bud Schultz is the director of
agriculture development and
diversification for the state of
Wisconsin an industrial hemp supporter
Schultz says he's frustrated with the
Drug Enforcement Agency which has
jurisdiction over him making
agricultural decisions the US Department
of Agriculture recognizes that hemp is
the fire's superior and profitable
agriculture renewable fiber however they
can't grow it because of the current
administrative language is legal in
other countries because they've said
that industrial hemp of over one percent
THC as a drug craft that means they can
grow crops of less than that our
administrative language says the
cannabis sativa plant is a drug crop
period with or without THC you know and
so we want to change that verbiage so
that the Department of Agriculture can
move on developing their growing
protocol these strains of industrial
hemp that would be grown are strange
with 0.3 or 0.2 THC considerably below
the world standard the u.s. agriculture
industry is in crisis set Schultz and it
needs new crops this industry can't
survive on corn soybeans and wheat in
the 21st century we've taught other
countries how well to do this and we've
got considerable more land from the
Conservation Reserve Program and if we
continue to plan it to corn and soybeans
which we generally produce right now a
unique surplus every year we're going to
drive that price down till you break
this industry we have to have major in
industrial and alternative crops that
can absorb those acreages if you produce
11 billion bushel of corn ear you're
going to get two dollars or less for it
if you produce 8.5 you're going to get
350 the 350 is a profit the other is a
loss and this industry out here cannot
sustain that over the long period of
time Schultz adds that the word in
agriculture is sustainability and for
that in other environmental concerns
hemp looks promising you can make a
high-quality paper out of industrial
hemp without the use of chlorine when
you use chlorine in the bleaching
process it then produces dioxins which
are a severe pollutant and that's why
the environmental groups in the country
support this the other thing is that you
don't have to use herbicides or
pesticides in the growing of industrial
hemp despite the ban the hemp industry
in the United States has thrived in
recent years manufacturers and food
processors are able to import certain
parts of the hemp plants into the
country Mary Cain is publisher and
editor of hemp world sales are around
around the world are around a hundred
million but that's a little hard to say
because you know some countries don't
report figures on him um basically the
part of the plant that can be used in
the United States is the stalk which
hold the fiber and the seeds which must
be sterilized once they reach the United
States they are sterilized for you know
a few minutes at 200 degrees and that of
course prevents them from being able to
sprout the major part of the industry is
makes use of the fiber from the plant
and in the fiber is you know is among
the strongest fiber in the world it's
right up there with flax which is what
linen is made with law enforcement
agencies have opposed attempts to reform
hemp laws in the United States drug
enforcement officials say that hemp
crops can be used to camouflage
marijuana crops opponents also say that
lifting the hemp ban takes the country
one step closer to legalizing marijuana
and meanwhile this so-called war on
drugs continues creating an enormous
crime control industry is linguist Noam
Chomsky puts it increasingly the
criminalization is for things like
possession or small street sales and so
on in fact I think about eighty-four
eighty-five percent of the growth and
incarceration is drug-related well
prison industry is so big now I mean if
you take a look at what in the standard
criminology literature i'm not talking
about Radek i'm not talking about
zeemagazine the standard criminology
literature calls it has been for years
calling at the crime control industry
it's an industry which is creating its
own concept of crime and then
controlling it and getting paid off by
the public and in fact the crime control
industry at this stage is getting close
to the scale of the Pentagon and it's
attracting the interest of its
interactive attracting very powerful
interest so the military industry for
example has noticed that there's a big
market there for you know high-tech
surveillance and control it's not yet at
the scale of the Pentagon but it's
substantial it's kind of like a
corollary to the social policies that
are being carried out the social
policies are imposing a sort of like a
third-world model on the United States I
mean I say it's so rich not gonna look
like Brazil but it's that kind of
structural model with highly
concentrated wealth and a lot of people
sort of more or less making out and then
a lot of superfluous people you know who
just aren't useful for profit-making
well if you're in the US dependent
is there's actually a name for them
they're called this disposable people
and you carry out what's called social
cleansing it's like you send out death
squads or something here we're more
civilized so you know murderer would you
do is throw them in jail and the the
policies of declaring a war against the
poor and the black and so on that's a
very specific policy which in fact is
targeting that part of the population
that isn't contributing much to wealth
production in this kind of economy
geared to the wealthy these are classic
devices there's nothing new about them
they're kind of extreme here but they're
not unknown and the marijuana thing is a
big piece of it noam chomsky by not
taking advantage of ecologically
sustainable materials such as hemp for
raw fiber and energy resources changes
in the Earth's climate may continue
already the planet's temperature has
increased slightly and the unusual
weather caused by El Nino is an
indicator to some scientists that the
so-called greenhouse effect has begun a
phenomenon linked to fossil fuel
consumption aside from the ecological
consequences of the energy practices of
the United States and other
industrialized nations there's an
immediate human cost in countries where
week regulatory oversight allows
multinational companies to drill log in
mine Natural Resources virtually
unchecked in the Indian state of erisa
says Daphne y sham energy and aluminium
companies are mining some of the last
vestiges of coal and polluting the
drinking water why sham a research
fellow for the Institute for Policy
Studies in Washington DC says that the
World Bank forced the state to privatize
the power sector allowing us
corporations to establish coal-fired
power plants there what I did when I
visited ERISA is I went to see how the
women were dealing with this because as
you may know in virtually every
developing country it's women who are
the energy managers and when I say
energy i'm talking about energy for
human needs like
cooking and heating whether you're in
India or country in Africa it's usually
women that you will see head loading
wood gathering fuel for cooking as that
fuel wood grows more and more scarce
they're increasingly turning to things
like cow dung or crop ways to cook with
the story of the women in ERISA is that
they're not they're not there's no
longer any fuel what it's gone in fact
there's no longer really any any brush
left they're digging coal directly out
of the ground and burning it and they're
using cow and they're using cow dung for
fuel when I spoke to them they said yeah
okay we've gotten used to using cow dung
we're dealing with that what we can't
accept is what is happening thanks to
this rapid coal mining that's going on
in the area their water tables have been
totally destroyed by the open pit coal
mining that's going on so they no longer
have ground water okay they have no
longer no the wells that are in all the
villages have all run dry so their only
option is to go to the river well the
river has now been so vastly polluted by
the ash from the burning of coal once
they burn the coal there's all of this
ash creative they've dumped them in
enough pits there's no more land so it's
just going directly into the river the
rivers are gray and of course incredibly
toxic so what they're doing is they're
digging what they call Chua's on the
riverbanks with their bare hands and
scooping the water out of the sandy bank
of the river hoping that there's they're
protecting the health of their children
by this this primitive filtration
divisive of sand this is a direct
consequence of the World Bank moving in
privatizing the power sector saying we
we can we can throw a lot of money at
energy will see an increase in GNP
that's what they they love that equation
between an increase in energy investment
in an increase in GMP which other
they're certainly doing you certainly
are seeing an increase in G&P it's when
you look at look behind those numbers
and you look look at the human face of
this energy development that you see a
completely different picture Daphne why
sham of the institute for policy studies
