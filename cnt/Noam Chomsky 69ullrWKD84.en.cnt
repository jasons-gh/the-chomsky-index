from the KPFK Studios in Southern
California it's the Ralph Nader Radio
Hour
[Music]
welcome to the Ralph Nader radio hour my
name is Steve Grove and along with my
co-host David Feldman hello David
hello sir and we also have the man of
the hour Ralph Nader hello Ralph
good day to all of you and by the way a
happy birthday Ralph just want to throw
that in thank you now on the show today
we've special show professor Noam
Chomsky will be making his third visit
to the Ralph Nader Radio Hour the first
time he was on the show was actually the
first time these two progressive leaders
had ever had an on-the-record public
conversation so let's get right to it
David our guests theory of
transformational grammar revolutionized
the scientific study of language he is
also one of the most influential public
intellectuals in the world having
written more than 100 books many of
which target the role of the mainstream
corporate mass media which he maintains
manufacturers consent in favor of the
capitalist system and the political
powers that support it welcome back to
the Ralph Nader radio our professor Noam
Chomsky very glad to be with you press
on Skeets as David mentioned linguistics
the press has been full of denunciations
of people who say things that some
considered to be racist or unkind we
have the situation that has dominated
news here in Washington Governor Northam
of Virginia who used blackface when he
was a medical student 1984 to play
Michael Jackson in a play at the Medical
School and an uproar occurred and people
in the legislature were demanding his
resignation members of Congress and
presidential candidates Democratic Party
were demanding his resignation on the
other hand these are the same people
that supported the slaughter of
civilians all over the world and us his
Imperial policies they slaughtered the
gazans and Palestinians and didn't
denounce these people so there's a real
split between words and fury aiding
people
and deeds that are far more
consequential escaping condemnation I'm
sure you thought about this it's the way
the press crowds out very serious issues
on the ground and the battle is will you
apologize
do you regret how dare you have said
something like this thirty years ago can
we have your views on on this because I
don't think it's a minor matter well
first of all I should say that
linguistics has actually nothing to do
with it so it's just so we can draw up a
snit but sure there's and in fact it's
not only deeds it's also words deeds of
course are for worse but take words
since we're talking about that there
happens to be something called the US
Constitution conservatives are supposed
to honor that it has an article article
6 saying that treaties entered into by
the federal government or the supreme
lawful and the major modern treaty
having to do with international affairs
as the United Nations Charter which
states explicitly that the threat of
force is banned in international affairs
every president violates that constantly
every time anyone says all options are
open in the case of Iran or Venezuela
whatever they are issuing a major threat
of force
in violation of the US Constitution
anybody care about that and Cortes si si
beads are far more extreme yeah as we
speak John Bolton national security
adviser to trump and Michael Pompeo
Secretary of State going all over the
world threatening military force
military intervention without ever
mentioning international law or the
Constitution this is quite extraordinary
these are graduates of Yale and Harvard
Law School by the way and there's no
mention in the media coverage they never
say well mr. Bolton's is this legal what
you're threatening just lawful what
you're going around threatening
secretary Pompeo or were you always well
let's
take it a step further the threat of
force is banned but also the use of
force which is a force far more extreme
does the u.s. use force in international
affairs without the narrow exceptions
granted by the Charter of course all the
time
take the invasion of Iraq it's a
textbook example of aggression without
any credible pretext
it's what the Nuremberg Tribunal called
the supreme international crime
differing from other war crimes only in
that it includes all the evil that
follows terror Isis everything else have
you seen a word in the media since 2003
saying we have committed the supreme
international crime and it should be
condemned in fact the harshest criticism
you ever see is say Obama it was a
strategic blunder kind of like what the
Russian generals said when Russia
invaded Afghanistan should have done it
it was a blunder but do we say it's a
gross violation not just as
international law but of our own
Constitution I mean as a matter of fact
former Judge Napolitano who is the
commentator on Fox in an interview I had
with him said what are the prosecutors
and Obama's Justice Department waiting
for they ought to indict George W Bush
and Dick Cheney for war crimes instead
these two men are going around getting
honorifics that some democratic leaders
are embracing george w bush and contrast
to trump and there is no law enforcement
i agree with that but i think didn't go
a step further how about the people who
refused now we're talking about
virtually a hundred percent of
commentators who refused to describe
that as a war crime who say that the
worst problem was it was a blunder like
nazi generals after the failure of the
two-front war criticized hitler for
carrying out a strategic
wonder by not knocking out England first
I mean do we praise them for them
yeah Hillary Clinton's said what she
regrets voting for the war in Iraq
witches destroyed over a million rock
all discovered a mistake take Barack
Obama it was a strategic blunder in fact
can you find anyone who's colder to work
run well some of us have obviously but
we're not and I mean we're not weigh our
way out at the fringe anyone one comment
in an any editorial on a mainstream
journal it is astonishing they don't
come to the conclusion even of their own
editorials the New York Times is famous
for this they lay the case for war
crimes and for impeachment and they
don't draw the conclusion based on
welder prior paragraph II I think Orwell
had the right insight into this in his
introduction to animal form which was
not published it was found years later
in his unpublished archives he did write
an introduction an interesting one and
which he said it's addressed to the
people of England he says look this book
is obviously a satire on the
totalitarian enemy but the people of
England shouldn't be too self-righteous
about it because in England and know
virtually quoting unpopular ideas can be
suppressed without the use of force and
he doesn't say much about the mechanisms
as about two sentences one is that the
press is owned by wealthy men who have
every interest in not having certain
ideas expressed and second and I think
more important if you basically have a
good education you know you have
internalized the understanding that
there are certain things it wouldn't do
to say and I think we can add it
wouldn't even do to think and I think
he's pretty much on target there there
are certain things that the intellectual
culture simply inculcates into you
as an understanding that there are
certain things it wouldn't do to say and
that should never even come into your
mind you see that all in our my NPR and
PBS all the time
never mind diversify networks why do you
think the left has abandoned the public
Airways struggle and the struggle to
retain some sanity to cable channels
there are 600 cable channels and full of
junk
there's no cable channel devoted to
foreign and military policy or to labor
or to consumer health issues on and on
and then the network's the over-the-air
is supposed to be modestly regulated in
the public interest convenience and
necessity by the Federal Communications
Commission is beyond caricature it just
seems that progressive groups have given
up that fight they gave up when the
Fairness Doctrine was overturned the
right of reply was overturned that
helped to keep you off the public
airwaves why do you think they've given
up this fight area the public areas
belong to the people they're the
landlords and they're giving it away
free without a resistance 24 hours a day
to the broadcast radio and TV industry
well there's some as I'm sure you know
there's a long and interesting history
about this when radio came along in the
1920s there was a struggle about whether
that public domain the public airwaves
should be used for the public interest
or should be handed over to private
corporations for profit and at that time
the church groups liberal groups
progressive activists and others did
struggle hard to try to have it at least
partially significantly handed over to
the public who actually owned the
airwaves
well they lost unlike almost every other
major country the u.s. termly
airwaves over almost entirely to private
commercial interests that repeated
itself in the late 1940s when television
was coming along and
again the same struggle same defeat was
handed over to private corporations
there's a kind of a fringe operation
that's public but nothing like public
broadcast nothing like say the BBC
almost every every other country
furthermore as he say then the Fairness
Doctrine was overturned under Reagan and
we can even on the part of the
establishment of the cable networks of
course a gift to private corporations
was a requirement that the cable
companies install a fairly reasonable
television installation in communities
and they're there like Cambridge Mass
almost any community has a small public
cable broadcasting option which reaches
a large part of the community even those
haven't been exploited by progressives
and they should have been that's at
least something you know it doesn't
impinge on the overwhelming gift of
private power that's been given in the
transfer of commercial rights to the
entire air wave spectrum but it's at
least something these are opportunities
that have not been properly exploited
and as you say it should go way beyond
that there should be a real effort to
ensure that popular organizations and
mass popular organizations and so on
have really unimpeded and large-scale
access to the media that the airwaves
that the public in fact owns in that
context fresher Chomsky we had a public
hearing chaired by then representative
Edward Markey Democrat Massachusetts
over 20 years ago about our proposal to
create an audience network which would
program several hours a day returned to
the public by the radio and TV stations
under director of the Federal
Communications Commission and that the
commercial broadcasters would be charged
rent they pay nothing now for
controlling the public spectrum there
would be charged rent the money would go
to
support Studios reporters producers
commentators all around the country on
the 2 or 3 hours of the audience Network
well you can't imagine how the
broadcaster's reared up on Congress and
they got calls from television station
owners back home and it never saw the
light of day other than a printed
transcript so I think people have got to
start thinking about what they own
because the people on the greatest
wealth in the country they don't seem to
know it they own trillions of dollars of
pension funds and mutual funds they own
the public Airways they own one-third of
America which is the public lands they
own the research and development that
comes out of Washington spilt most of
these modern industries from Silicon
Valley on and they just don't have a
sense of ownership do you see this
upcoming presidential campaign given
there are so many different candidates
throwing their hat in the ring
raising the issue of the Commons which
is really a ultimate shift of power from
the few to the many I think you're
absolutely right and we can carry it
considerably further take the modern
high-tech economy computers internet
lasers satellites iPhones the whole
spectrum where does that come from well
if you look back a very substantial part
of it in fact the core part comes from
public spending back in the 1950s and
60s the risky creative work on
developing what became the high-tech
economy was mostly done by public
funding at universities and research
labs funded through taxpayer funding and
so on well you know suppose you had a
functioning capitalist system if
somebody makes a risky long-term
investment and ultimately after several
decades there's some profit they're
supposed to get something from it does
that happen
no the profit goes to the private
corporations that were able to
pick up on work that was done
substantially under public funding and
they make the profit from it what's more
they make exorbitant profits so take
right now for example though there's a
huge attack on China across the board
for not allegedly not honoring
intellectual property rights well these
are established in the World Trade
Organization rules designed of course by
the investor class they give huge patent
rights way beyond anything in history to
pharmaceutical corporations to Microsoft
and so on so why should anyone honor
those rights I mean all of this goes
back to major public contributions
suppose for example that China or
somebody doesn't accept Microsoft's
patent on Windows ok that means that
Bill Gates gets a little less money and
the public gets cheaper computers same
with pharmaceuticals I mean this whole
system is so fundamentally corrupt that
it has to be investigated from bottom up
I should mention another aspect of the
transfer of radio and television to
private hands it has a big impact on the
political system quite a big impact and
say take television soon as television
came along it offered an opportunity for
candidates to reach a large public
through television but you have to pay
for that so it's one of the factors that
led to a situation in which our
political system is based on essentially
bought elections and it didn't begin
then but it took a quantum leap forward
at that point it meant that you needed
enormous amounts of money to run a
political campaign well where do you get
that enormous amount of money from
corporate wealth private wealth we end
up with a situation and we
you can predict the outcome of an
election with Congress or president with
remarkable precision simply by looking
at campaign spending this excellent work
on this primarily by a political
scientist Thomas Ferguson and although
as is we're chose it goes far back it
did take a major leap forward simply
with the transfer of television rights
into private hands meaning that to run a
campaign is very costly of course this
has been expedited by the decisions of
the most reactionary Supreme Court and
living memory but simply this one
element that you bring up of the
transfer of the public airwaves to
private hands happens not only has a
range of malicious consequences but one
of them is the simple undermining of the
political system these things should be
part of general discourse understanding
activism and a significant change I'm
still waiting for a mass rally around a
two story television station somewhere
in America just before evening news
making these kinds of demands because
now people like Rush Limbaugh and Sean
Hannity can attack a political candidate
and that candidate has no more right of
reply which they had before late 1980s
core was reversed and the same for the
Fairness Doctrine that's why someone
like Rush can promote nuclear power and
the other side has no right to go on the
station and give the downside of nuclear
power one thing about your writings
pressure Chomsky is you don't just deal
with discriminatory injustice you deal
with non-discriminatory injustice that
affects everybody so let's turn to the
climate disruption climate catastrophe I
don't like the word climate changes too
benign and refer to a comment you made
which was quote and a couple of
generations organized human society may
not survive and quote and of course
leading the race toward on the side are
these giant corporations refusing to
convert to renewable energy and energy
efficiency and they want to push more
fossil fuels and more nuclear plants
something very positive happened the
other day down at the Senate office
building I don't know if you were aware
but there's a new group of youngsters
that's called the sunrise movement rose
movement yeah it's just nine ten eleven
year olds Margaret Reid the
anthropologist told me on more than one
occasion she thought youngsters could
really have an effect because of their
moral authority their innocence and the
fact that they're going to inherit the
country and the world in a way they
confronted senator Feinstein outside her
office and asked her a number of
questions and it was a very patronizing
put down by the senator really know how
to handle nine-year-old questions
anymore than Ronald Reagan did they tend
to be direct
they tend to be uncensored and
politicians are not used to it they're
used to professional reporters with
marbles in their mouths I think that a
mobilization of pre-teenage youngsters
who really get it and they know what the
fundamental questions are and they don't
abide political rhetoric and evasive
responses could really begin to mobilize
at the level that's necessary youngsters
would tell their parents why aren't you
using your seat belt youngsters would
tell in the past their parents why are
you smoking how long are you going to be
around if you don't stop what do you
think of that because we're all looking
for ways to elevate the level of urgency
which is simply not coming close to the
kind of description you're portraying
around the globe yeah well actually what
the
session with the children and senator
Feinstein was quite revealing they kept
trying to point out to her look we're
the ones who are going to be impacted by
the disaster that you're helping to
create and the slow reformist steps of
the kind you're advocating simply aren't
commensurate at all with the scale of
the problem these kids were making that
point very forcefully and she basically
had no answer now the sunrise movement
has done pretty remarkable things this
is mostly young kids they're the ones
who are have a major responsibility for
putting the green new deal on the public
agenda that's a pretty remarkable change
a couple of years ago this is unheard of
it was the sunrise movement who were
joined with a few new women progressive
candidate Ocasio Cortes in particular
were able to press to get the green New
Deal idea on the public agenda of course
it's mocked it's ridiculed even Nancy
Pelosi dismissed it but it's there and
it's getting support maybe not in the
precise detailed form that was proposed
but something like it which is a very
significant first step towards trying to
address this crisis now with regard to
children in Europe particularly there
have been a series of large-scale
children strikes the children is walking
out striking leaving school protesting
against the failure to deal with a major
crisis that is going to severely impact
their lives and coming generations and
it's important to recognize just how
serious this is
we're coming pretty close on the you
know the discussions are mostly about
storms and so on okay that's bad enough
but we're coming pretty close to the
level of warming of 125,000 years ago
when the Seas
level was about 30 feet higher than it
is today
I simply imagine that now right now the
huge Antarctic ice sheets are melting
and more rapidly than had been expected
as a huge amount of water there that
could easily bring us to something like
what the world was like 125,000 years
ago what happens to organized life at
that point can you even imagine the
consequences of a sea level rise at that
time well it's kind of interesting to
see the way across the spectrum how this
is being dealt with I mean at the right
say the Trump administration produced
one of the most astonishing documents
that has ever existed in human history
I'm not exaggerating a bureaucracy
naturally the Transportation Bureau came
out with a long detailed document which
was argument it was leading to the
conclusion that we shouldn't have any
constraints on emissions in
transportation cars trucks and so on
just let them emit everything you know
no matter what and the art of our
interesting argument the argument was
look at the rate of global warming now
taking place by the end of the century
it will be maybe they estimated 7
degrees or something like that higher
and by then we're basically over the
cliff anyway there's no chance of
survival after that so what the hell why
not just enjoy it while we can
of course the tacit assumption is that
everyone in the world is as criminally
insane as we are as they are you know
and will not try to do anything about it
can you find any document like that in
human history I mean you know Nero is
supposed to have filled while Rome
burned these guys are saying let's enjoy
ourselves while the planet burns to make
more profit for the next couple of years
fights the phrase institutional insanity
the evidence is all around us it's no
longer just models of climate scientists
it's devastating floods it's devastating
hurricanes it's rising sea levels it's
spreading disease because of habitat
changes it's extinction of species and
these people who are in power we've got
their heads in the sand or their minds
are so monetized by Exxon Mobil and
others that they refuse to see what's
coming up I mean the water is going to
start lapping up and Morrow logo or
whatever the place is called the Trump
is in Florida so we're led here in a
moment of maximum urgency by the worst
leaders collaborating with the worst
CEOs of global corporations who have no
allegiance to any community in the
country or any country other than to
exploit them and our political system
simply not up to it you've taken a dim
view of third parties because we live in
a winner-take-all two-party duopoly that
basically tells the American people it's
either Republican or Democrat get in
line
but in the 19th century there was easier
opportunity to get on the ballot an
anti-slavery Liberty Party in 1840 the
women's suffrage party that labor farmer
parties they never won an election but
they pushed one or two of the major
parties in that direction the same is
true for progressive taxation Medicare
Social Security that was Norman Thomas
Socialist Party Eugene Debs the Labor
Party if the straightjacket is such that
the Democrats and Republicans cannot put
a halt to this on the side and we're
going to talk about the nuclear arms
race that's getting underway and
speeding up how do you get out of this
electoral straightjacket well I think we
have to think about the time skills
involved we're facing urgent problems
too urgent to await a radical
formation of the political and economic
system so let's take for example some
concrete cases I take the JPMorgan Chase
biggest Bank the CEO Jamie Dimon I'm
sure knows about everything we're
talking about concerning the devastating
impact of global warming so how does he
react by investing more funds in fossil
fuels including the most lethal of them
a Canadian tar sands now why is he doing
that
let's ask about the choices that he has
in the institutional structures that
exist he basically has two choices one
to do exactly what he's doing to try to
maximize profit with a certain knowledge
that this is going to have devastating
effects in the short term the other
choice he has is to resign and be
replaced by somebody he'll do exactly
the same thing those are the choices
it's an as you mentioned before is a
deep institutional problem now the way
to confront that in the present
situation is pretty much the way the
sunrise movement is doing and other
popular movements are doing and Public
Citizen is doing try to develop mass
popular action which will compel people
within the existing institutions to act
differently and of course at the same
time try to educate the public to
understand that there are deep
institutional problems that have to be
changed now with regard to Amara logon
the sea level rise President Trump is
already given the answer to that he's a
firm believer in global warming we know
that he recently petitioned the
government of Ireland is businessed in
for permission to build a wall you know
he loves walls to build a wall to
protect his fancy Golf Course in Ireland
from rising sea levels okay so that they
understand then
when it goes to the bottom line they
become very pragmatic this gets us into
the nuclear arms race because years ago
what you just suggested mass
mobilization occurred at a significant
scale there were mass rallies and
marches in New York City in Washington
San Francisco and Ronald Reagan looked
out the window of the White House and he
said you know there's some well-dressed
Republicans marching down Pennsylvania
Avenue or in New York City demanding
nuclear arms agreements and suspension
of nuclear tests and the relationship
with the Soviet Union and you know while
people can say it wasn't enough these
nuclear arms reduction Accords did lead
to the dismantling of over half of the
nuclear weapons that the US and Soviet
Union has and their inspectors in the
u.s. from Russia right now and
inspectors in Russia who are Americans
right now supervising this gradual
dismantling but at the same time the
Trump stirs the Bolton's and pump aoes
are pushing to scrap these Accords not
to renew the START treaty and to get out
of the INF - Trump as done I don't know
whether you're familiar with professor
Ted postal emeritus of MIT but he's just
come out with a major article The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists saying
that both the US and Russia have
violated this intermediate nuclear
treaty it isn't true that Trump and
others say that the US has not violated
it and this and other things can unleash
another massive nuclear arms race which
is another wing of the 'unless Idol
trends on this tormented planet what's
your view of this well I think what you
say is extremely important the mass
mobilizations in the early 80s did
provide the background for a very
important treaty the
INF tree which was signed by Reagan and
Gorbachev shortly after that in 1987
now that was of critical importance
because what was happening at that time
was that the United States was
installing Pershing two missiles in
Western Europe which had nuclear tipped
missiles which have a about a five to
ten minute flight time to Moscow meaning
devastating first strike can happen
before anyone even notices it now this
was in response to the Russians
developing similar missiles which could
hit Western Europe okay now there were
enormous protests in Europe there were
these massive protests here that you
mentioned and it did lead to the INF
treaty which eliminated a major threat
of nuclear war total nuclear war and we
have to understand that nobody survives
a nuclear war it's been clear for
decades that a first strike because of
its consequences including nuclear
winter would probably destroy the
attacker along with everyone else these
are just unthinkable prospects the INF
treaty did sharply reduce the danger of
war there are three such treaties major
treaties but the first one is the ABM
Treaty anti-ballistic missile treaty
which barred ABM systems now they sound
defensive but every strategic analyst
knows that they're basically first
strike weapons most imaginable ABM
system would ever stop a first strike
conceivably it might stop a weak
retaliatory strike though people like
postal you know even that but that's at
most what it could do which means
essentially it's a threat of first
strike the ABM Treaty was the u.s.
withdrew from the ABM Treaty under w
bush 2002 now the u.s. is withdrawing
from the INF treaty and as you mentioned
Trump and Bolton or indicating that they
would probably
Thrall from the third the New START
treaty that's the treaty that did lead
to the sharp reduction of nuclear
weapons on both sides this is you know
beyond words I mean anyone who's taken
the trouble to look at the record of the
nuclear age becomes quickly aware that
it's almost a miracle that we survived
on theirs case after case literally
hundreds of examples that we know where
we came pretty close to having a nuclear
war sometimes stopped within minutes by
human intervention some of it is highly
adventurist actions of political leaders
but most of it is just accident of the
systems you know the detection systems
just consistently fail that's true of
ours and it's where we have a lot of
records it's surely true of the Russians
new systems are much more primitive than
ours
we need a new wave here that gets into
the electoral process of the candidates
which have been uniquely ignoring the
much of military and foreign policy the
progressive Democratic candidates they
don't like to talk about the military
budget or nuclear arms race or the whole
Middle East situation other than support
the Israeli position a Saudi position
but you're right this mass rallies and
it never was more than one tenth of one
percent of the American people but they
represented the yearning desire for arms
control by huge numbers of American
people the 1980s what these that's what
these children are doing though that's
right as sunrise movement as a couple
dozen people but they have managed to
bring it to the public in a way which is
placing the need for a green new deal
right on the major legislative agenda
and as it can be achieved they had 250
of them in front of the office of Mitch
McConnell the Senate Majority is every
it was not there
course to talk with them but let's talk
about in the concluding time we have
available we're talking with Fastenal
Chomsky which everybody listening this
program knows it's many books and stand
up positions that facts matter you've
written a lot about the Middle East
what's going on now is that dissent both
within the Democratic Party and what's
left to the Republican Party on the
us-israeli position in the middle east
and the role of the oil industry and so
on it's just being stifled people on
Capitol Hill now are are scared to
criticize the secular government of
Israel because they'll be accused of
anti-semitism two new members to leave
and Omar were denounced by Pelosi and
Steny Hoyer and other leaders of the
Democratic Party in the house because
one of them mentioned whose interests
should be focused on in the Israeli us
relationship and and the other said
something about a pact money
affecting decisions in the house dozens
of small Apax around the country who
contribute to campaigns and then they
were denounced as anti-semites by people
like Pelosi and Hoyer who again and
again by word by deed by supporting
funding and military weapons back the
slaughter of Palestinians especially in
Gaza and hundreds of children so this is
crazy what's going on I want to tell our
listeners that you wrote this book with
the eminent Israeli historian Ilan pappe
that's Noam Chomsky and Ilan Pappe Gaza
and crisis reflections on the US Israeli
war on the Palestinians about 15-20
years ago the head of the arab-american
Institute Jim Zogby gave a speech at a
Israeli University at a symposium called
the other anti-semitism and the racist
commentary over the years by Israeli
political leaders against Palestinians
is mind-boggling I mean one would not
even want to mention the
his racist comments by prime ministers
and heads of Israeli political parties
except to say that years ago the founder
of modern Israel David ben-gurion told
Nahum Goldmann and a widely quoted
phrase it was their land and we took it
and then the racist comments has never
talked about any Semitism against Arabs
so this is a huge censorship now on
Capitol Hill and the only person who
seems to be breaking through on this is
Bernie Sanders who is Jewish and feels
freer to talk and just the other day he
decried the rise of authoritarianism by
talking about air daguan and Turkey
orban and Hungary Putin and Russia and
he included Prime Minister Netanyahu in
Israel so what is your forecast is
whether we can have a national debate on
this which you've led but have been kept
off the mass media well I think it's
very important that things have been
changing you don't see it in Congress
yet except for tiny cases like those you
mentioned but it's happening among the
population very significantly including
the Jewish population we saw it one
striking example just a couple of days
ago the latest move of the Netanyahu
government as to Netanyahu himself is
facing an election on serious corruption
charges and he's reaching out to
wherever he can he just introduced into
his coalition a group which is the
inheritor of the infamous rabbi cahana
who kind of an openly racist virtual
neo-nazi who was banned from the Israeli
political system welcomed the 1980s
because of his extremist racist policies
the successor of his group which has the
same policies was just admitted into the
Netanyahu coalition that led to protests
even by many of the major strong
scientist groups
like the American Jewish Committee and
so on the Israeli government is moving
so far to the right not only including
their practices with regard to the
occupied territories that it's come to
be alienating much of the moderately
liberal including Jewish population
right now among Democrats people
identifies Democrats actually more
indicate more sympathy for the
Palestinians than for Israel that's a
massive change the main support for
Israeli policies now in the United
States is Christian evangelicals and the
who are deeply anti-semitic themselves
in a profound way we could get talked
about and the right wing and some rich
Jewish donors Adel's and the rest and
this is happening all over the world the
Gaza situation has been instrumental and
I've been giving talks on these issues
for 50 years until fairly recently at
university campuses including my own in
fact I literally had death police
protection police would even accompany
me back to my car afterwards meetings
were held under airport security you
know investigating people's handbags
when they walked in meetings were
disrupted and broken up right in Boston
the most liberal city in the country
that changed changed dramatically and
one of the things that changed it you
can almost time it was the Israeli
operations in Gaza Operation Cast Lead
was so vicious and brutal that although
kind of Obama glossed over it a lot of
the public didn't and that's continued
now the situation in Gaza no is
literally catastrophic
I mean international monitors predict
that within a couple of years Gaza will
literally be uninhabitable about 95% of
the waters polluted people are living
and essentially caged I've been there
it's like being in a prison the sewage
plants of power plants
been repeatedly bombed often destroyed
by Israeli bombing people are not
allowed to fish more than two or three
few kilometers offshore and polluted
waters the main lifeline for Gaza which
is sort of kept people alive barely is
in wrong the UN relief Works Agency the
Trump administration is just cut off
funding equipment the situation is
really desperate
well people here or not you know may not
know all the details there's enough
that's seeping through to arouse
considerable opposition meanwhile in the
West Bank almost daily some atrocity
takes place by settlers or by the
Israeli army doesn't get reported here
most of the time but the general picture
you can see is the illegal settlements
expend now what I think although it has
not as yet had an impact on Congress
sooner or later it will sooner or later
they'll be recognition that our arms
sales to Israel are illegal under US law
there is a US law called the Laidlaw
Patrick lay which bans arms sales to any
military units that are involved in
systematic human rights abuses well you
know the record of human rights abuses
by the Israeli army is just overwhelming
which means that the military aid is
basically illegal a circulator they'll
be recognition of that we'll see some
changes when the peace groups can
persuade a congressional committee to
have the first hearing in over 60 years
represented by the Israeli peace
movement which includes former generals
former heads of national security and
the Israeli FBI who have turned against
Netanyahu and favored a viable two-state
solution there hasn't been the Senate
House Foreign Relations committees any
movement on that direction but that as
you suggest that would be the next
breakthrough in the few minutes we have
left professor
we talked about Venezuela in in a
different kind of way we know that Trump
wants to overthrow the Maduro government
we know what Bolton and Pompeyo were
doing we know what Pence is doing in the
Colombian border we know the history of
intervention in South America by the
u.s. we know the books by people like
Smedley Butler wars Iraq how he was
represented the Bank of National Bank in
New York and Cuba and the oil companies
elsewhere but what is very troubling is
that people who are really progressive
who spent a lot of time in Venezuela
have basically said that the Chavez
Medora regime has given the left
terrible reputation that the cronyism
the corruption the colossal
mismanagement of Chavez and Maduro have
been so deep that you can't simply write
it off as a consequence of foreign
intervention I just like to read very
briefly a comment by someone who's been
there for years then you'll see where
he's coming from he says quote Chavez
nationalized companies and left them to
ruin and looting he destroyed thousands
of small farmers in favor of Brazilian
Factory chicken and meat he imported
black beans from China and considered
for a moment all of his meddling and
squandering of cash early in his
presidency his criminal negligence
directly cost at least 10,000 lives of
poor people and amply forewarned
landslides on the coast because he
wanted the populations stay put and vote
in an election this is an eyewitness
account what he and Maduro have done is
to serve the country up to the
neoliberal elite that will once again
rule when Trump Bolton and Abrams are
long gone Venezuelans have endured so
much pain for so long with ten times the
murder rate total stagnation abrupt
decline in hospital infrastructure
before and especially during 2000 to the
present that they will be forced to
accept as saviors the foreign oil mining
and timber companies
so long rubbing their hands over
Venezuela's riches not to mention IMF
style austerity measures that will seem
like a picnic next to medoras madness
this is a diabolical result we can
anticipate for one of the most beautiful
and wealthy countries on earth and quote
and also he went to talk about the
sweetheart deals that Chavez Maduro have
developed with Chevron and other US and
foreign oil companies in Venezuela what
do you think of this commentary well you
know it take a good bit of time to go
through it sentence by sentence and take
it apart but there's a few comments that
we can begin with for one thing there
were plenty of problems during the
Chavez years of but on the other hand
poverty was very sharply reduced
educational opportunities are greatly
expanded there are regular polls taken
of latin-american countries by the major
latin-american polling agency Latino
barometer oh it's in Chile
not at all sympathetic to each others
take a look at their polls through the
through the Chavez years Venezuela
ranked right at the top along with
Uruguay in publics popular support food
Democracy and popular support for the
government it was a reason for that
there was election after election a
referendum after referendum carefully
monitored the Carter monitoring
foundation among others I determined
that the Venezuelan elections were among
the most free in the world okay that's a
record of how the population felt and
there were reasons for it there were
serious errors actually I've been
criticizing for years one was failure to
change the colonial economy the US has
been running Venezuela for a century
essentially kicked out the British under
Woodrow Wilson when oil was discovered
the u.s. expelled Britain on
ceremoniously and essentially took over
the
country and since then it's been pretty
much dominating it lots of hideous
atrocities don't to go through that but
one effect was that the economy was
almost entirely based on oil now one of
Chavez errors was not to change that the
economy is still overwhelmingly based on
oil it was not diversified a second
error here on quoting the chief
opposition economist Francisco Rodriguez
that's a spokesman for the opposition
serious economist he says a serious
error of the Chavez government was not
to put aside reserves during the period
of high oil prices rather to expense
spend the reserves they were spent on
social programs and others inside the
country they were spent on
internationalist efforts to say provide
cheap oil to Haiti which obviously could
can barely survive and many others also
despite the crazy talk about socialism
he left the capitalist class untouched
allowed them to enrich themselves in
fact during this whole period to that
limited extent the critique you mention
is correct what all that meant was that
when the after his death the oil per
couple years after the oil price
declined and the government did not have
reserves on hand to try to deal with the
crisis so they had to go to the
international credit markets I don't
have to tell you who runs them so you
can guess what the reaction is then came
the sanctions which are harsh brutal
devastating the population all again put
Rodriguez the chief opposition economist
and a serious economist he points out
that the sanctions have turned a crisis
into a humanitarian catastrophe and by
now the latest sanctions literally a bar
the government from almost any resources
effort to starve the population into
submission
now Maduro has his own policies have
been awful in many respects economic
repression and others but this is in the
face of constant subversion talk about
the media again for ever since the
beginning of the Chavez years the media
have been virtually an open voice for
the anti Chavez opposition in ways that
are almost unimaginable so for example
in 2002 at the beginning of the Chavez
years there was a military coup it was a
coup which throughout the government
throughout the president dismantled the
Parliament throughout the Supreme Court
the u.s. of course openly supported it
take a look at the media the New York
Times they applauded it they thought oh
this is wonderful we're getting back to
freedom and democracy
well the coup was pretty quickly
overthrown by a popular uprising has
anyone ever withdrawn their praise for
the military coup and after that came
years of subversion sabotage internal
problems and errors and some of them
very serious I could say that I was
personally one of the people who was
actually very active in opposing human
rights violations but to disregard the
achievements of those years and the
popular support for them in not only in
the polls but an election a fair
election after election that's
ridiculous and I chose the and by now
the media barely even pretend to be
covering situation their opposition the
New York Times The Washington Post true
of the European major media
they're simply journals for the
opposition that's what they describe
there's a lot to be said there's no time
here to go into the full details but
it's a really atrocious situation and
what is happening as you mentioned
there's a soft coup a stranglehold which
will lead to somehow the overthrow that
go
and return of Venezuela to the kinds of
circumstances that you see in the other
us-run countries of the region you want
to look at atrocities crimes and so on
simply look at the countries that the US
has maintained where it's maintained
control the Central American countries
at Colombia which is the most dangerous
country in the world for union activists
and human rights activists and it has
been during again there's just no time
to go through the details thank you very
much for the discussion always say to be
continued but you're as a voice of
towering intellect and reason and
factual rendition which is rare today in
public discourse and we hope to see you
want more on the mass media to reach
more people thanks very much no glad to
be with you we've been speaking with no
I'm Chomsky we were linked to his work
at Ralph Nader radio our calm I want to
thank our guests again professor Noam
Chomsky for those of you listening on
the radio that's our show for you
podcast listeners they tuned for some
bonus material we call the wrap up where
we pick up on this sunrise movement
viral video and Ralph comments not only
on that but on some of the adult
reaction on the cable news shows join us
next week on the Ralph Nader radio hour
when we speak to Darth Maul author of
end of ice and Ray Metcalf author of the
bribery stops here thank you very much
Ralph thank you everybody and people are
ordering as a rap book five at a time
and I have a proposal
anybody who orders ten for a discussion
in their living room I'll do a squawk
box discussion with them for 20 minutes
hi this is Jimmy Lee Wert producer of
the Ralph Nader radio hour welcome to
the wrap-up where Steve plays for Ralph
the confrontation the young people of
the sunrise movement had in senator
dianne feinstein's office as they
deconstruct the reaction of the
commentators on Meet the Press now Ralph
I wanted to pick up on something that
you talked to
Chomsky about in terms of that video
that went viral from the sunrise
movement when they confronted Senator
Dianne Feinstein in her office and I'm
just gonna play a little bit of that for
our audience and get your comments then
I want to talk about the commentary that
I heard on Meet the Press the following
Sunday that had me yelling at the TV so
much actually scared my wife so here's a
little sample of that video for those
who are not familiar with it we are
trying to ask you to vote YES on the
green new movie okay I'll tell you what
we have our own green new deal
scientists has said that we have 12
years to turn this around
well it's not going to get turned around
in 10 years what we can do is just
something get around in 10 years is
looking at the faces of the people who
are going to be living with it because
I'm supposed to be for the people by the
people and I know what's interesting
about this group is I've been doing this
for 30 years I know what I'm doing you
come in here and you say it has to be my
way or the highway I don't respond to
that I've gotten elected I just ran I
was elected by almost a million vote
plurality and I know what I'm doing so
you know maybe people should listen a
little bit I hear what you're saying but
where the people who voted you you're
supposed to listen to us that's your how
old are you I'm 16 I we have didn't vote
for me
something will get it either one you got
impact it I understand that I have seven
grandchildren I understand it very well
senator the cost of not taking this
action is far higher than the cost of
what the green new deal will be and
there are the enormous popularity for
this bill around the whole country here
and we're asking you to be more able and
do this for us and for your
grandchildren or get enough bourbon I'm
trying to do the best I can which was to
write a responsible resolution a plan
that does a full transformative action
is not going to be what we need well you
know better than I do so I think one day
you should run for the Senate I want to
do it your world meantime at time
there's I just probably the way she
violated almost every rule of how to
speak to young children and she proved
their point again and again there's
tone-deaf she's full of herself
politically she brandished the 30 years
experience language and of course it's
30 years of ignoring the need for a
transforming shift to renewables and
energy efficiency from fossil fuels and
nuclear she has supported the fossil
fuel industry and she has taken money
from the fossil fuel industry for her
campaign so she basically was more than
patronizing she demonstrated to these
young people how a much more vigorous
they have to be and how much more focus
they have to be to replace the ancient
regime of indentured corporatist
politicians like Diane Feinstein and
here's the thing that had me cursing at
the TV which was the following Sunday on
Meet the Press on NBC but the supposed
real enemy of the people according to
trump and it's Chuck Todd he's
introducing the video and this is what
Chuck Todd said I think a lot of people
look at a lot of that Andrea and think
boy she could have been more less
tone-deaf and how to talk to the kids
and
or the adults that are using kids to to
practice politics it was the whole thing
was uncomfortable very uncomfortable and
let me just say I think first of all she
is a leader on this subject so why
didn't they go after someone who's
against climate change
she has legislation she's saying I don't
want to sign on to the new Green Deal
because it's aspirational it's not
legislation I'm working on something
that's real also who are the adults who
bring their kids who don't understand
this stuff seven eight nine ten year
olds I understand the passion of
children and how important it is but to
ambush a senator this way well Sandra
Mitchell has been on TV saying very
similar things over the years so that's
no surprise
the problem with corporate indentured
politicians is they don't understand the
clarity that is being communicated to
them by these youngsters these
youngsters don't have the baggage that
we cloud the conscience and intellect
and factual urgency of politicians they
don't have that they don't have an axe
to grind that's why they have great
moral authority that's why this should
be tens of thousands of nine ten eleven
twelve year olds mobilized to confront
the 535 members of Congress and their
state legislatures and maybe the
politicians will be surprised some of
these tenure rules actually have more
factual knowledge and content than the
so called politicians with all their
years of experience it's just amazing to
see the lack of the elderly politicians
sensitivity to these youngsters they
don't even have a sense of an arm around
the shoulder they don't even have a
sense of conveying wisdom they get up on
their high and horse and become very
defensive and start saying well maybe
when you run for the Senate you can do
it your way there's no doubt the senator
Feinstein recognizes the climate crisis
and she's not a denier but over the
years she has not ruffled many feathers
in the 'unless idol saturation of the
planet with greenhouse gases
by the fossil fuel industry and she
wasn't a leader in opposing nuclear
power the nuclear power plants in
California were being shut down and are
being shut down in spite of the senator
from California this is a relatively
recent phenomenon David and Steve in the
old days when politicians were
confronted by youngsters like this they
assumed a more wise heir they assumed
the more grandfatherly Ram motherly air
so to speak they didn't get so defensive
it's all part of this generation gap I
think our generation has spent too
little time with the younger generation
and I'm not just talking about
Millennials I'm talking about kids in
grade school and by the same token
because of the iPhone and all the screen
time children today have spent less time
with adults including their own parents
than any generation in human history and
we're seeing the results of that I'm
gonna play one more short clip it takes
it to a different problem that I have
which is the condescension and the idea
that children should not be concerned
with politics this was another person
Meet the Press he's a Republican
political strategist named Al Cardenas
and this is what he said I mean I can't
agree more that we need to have focus on
climate change I just as a as a father
of five children would have very much
resented anybody in this school pounding
my kids with propaganda either left or
right as to any political issue teach
them civility teach them the art of
listening teach them the art of of
developing it but not stand in front of
an elected official and I don't imagine
any anti-democratic statement that we've
heard from these people on the Sunday
corporate indentured news shows that
have pretty much fungible people coming
on the same people the same topics
whether it's ABC CBS NBC CNN or Fox
that's what happens when people like
Chuck Todd don't have a program where
they bring these children on why not a
pan
of ten eleven twelve year olds express
their sentiment they might be surprised
how much they know factually how much
they know in terms of their
responsibilities how much they can tell
people who are five times older than
them that they are going to suffer the
results of an overheated planet far more
than people who are not going to be on
the planet that many years there needs
to be a jolt here this idea is how dare
they speak uncivil II I didn't see any
swearing words did you Steve and it snow
is completely so and there was no yep
basically these are at best guilt ridden
people on the mass media they know that
they've looked the other way too long
they know that they've been wined and
dined by the corporate is too long they
know that their bread and butter is not
on the side of the people they know they
want to be invited back by NBC or CBS so
they can't make too many waves and they
camouflage it by saying how how dare
these uppity ten-year-olds challenge
these political representatives yet the
whole idea that they both both Andrew
Mitchell and this guy cartoonists go to
the fact that there are adults
supposedly using these children and
filling their minds with god forbid
political thought that was just so
offensive to me well it's even worse
than that Steve my experience is the
best questions asked politicians are
asked by ten year olds or eleven year
olds remember the one when a 10 year old
asked Ronald Reagan about air pollution
and you well you know most of air
pollution comes from trees well you see
that would never be a question asked by
a White House reporter if you had 10 and
11 year olds in the White House press
corps and the seasoned reporters took a
week or two off and didn't show up the
press briefings would be much more
exciting much more relevant much more
truthful and the president would never
come into the press briefing room I love
that idea
that's our classic the Parkland students
prove that with
Rubio exactly at home yeah you know the
10 year olds are topeka their idealism
but teenagers can challenge politicians
very directly socially after the
harrowing experience down there and they
just cut right through the BS that these
politicians have been using year after
year successfully to circumvent the
inhibited professional press corps from
getting it the truth
yeah well thanks Ralph for commenting it
that that had really innervated me this
weekend because I thought that my son
sent me that video and I was very
impressed with it and very impressed
with the South position and the
knowledge that the children showed
supported by some older people but the
reaction to it by my generation our
generation was just infuriating to me so
thanks for commenting on that and that's
a wrap join us next week on the Ralph
Nader radio hour when we continue on the
climate theme with dard Jamal author of
the end of ice
