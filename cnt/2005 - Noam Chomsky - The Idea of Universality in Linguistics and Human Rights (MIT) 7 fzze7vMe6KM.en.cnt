this would react well babies had a very
clear reliable preference between these
two people they stayed away from the guy
who pushed the little girl they actually
looked at that person longer
suspiciously and interacted much more
readily taking a toy for example from
the person who hit the backpack this is
it's very early days for this kind of
research but I think it converges with
the cross-cultural studies suggesting
that the reason we see universality and
moral evaluations of actions across
widely divergent cultures and adults may
well be because there is a system of
knowledge that's emerging early in
development that we're all equipped with
it allows us to grow up in any of these
cultures and express this moral system
in different ways well given these
universal systems i think we now have we
next have to ask where does human
variability come from why don't we all
speak the same language and listen to
the same music and and live in the sea
exactly the same kinds of family
arrangements and so forth well I think
part of this variability comes from
another universal human capacity which
is our capacity to combine together
distinct core concepts freely and
productively to give you a couple
examples to give a feel for this
phenomenon I think it's very likely that
tool use develops from an ability to
combine together representations of
objects as mechanical bodies with
representations of goal-directed actions
so that you can come to see an object as
at one in the same time a material body
that participates in a set of human
determined intentions similarly exact
natural number representations may
result from our capacity to combine
representations of numerically distinct
individual objects precise
representations of small numbers of
objects with the large approximate
number representations that I was
talking about a minute ago now some of
the research that I've done and that
some other people have done suggests
that this combinatorial capacity may be
tied to natural language that's a
controversial suggestion it may turn out
to be wrong what I think is clear is
that this capacity is unique to humans
and it's universal across humans and it
may be at the root of many of the
diverse variable systems that we see in
different human societies well if all of
this is true that is if we're all
equipped with a common stock of core
knowledge systems and a comment capacity
to freely combine concepts from
different core systems together then it
would seem that humans might be gripped
by a tremendous illusion the illusion
that different members of different
groups really are fundamentally
different from one another and as I was
saying before I think this illusion may
be one of the forces certainly not the
only one but one of the forces that
leads that has led in the past two wars
and social divisions that feeds ethnic
conflicts today that maenner us in some
cases to reports of torture and human
rights violations that take place in
foreign lands now this illusion of
fundamental human differences may have
two different sources these are not
mutually exclusive they could both be at
work first as the psychologist Larry
hirschfeld has suggested it may partly
be learned by a pattern of false
induction from other kinds of categories
so for example hirschfeld has suggested
that children may learn that when two
animals for example look very different
and behave in very different ways
they're very likely to be members of
different species and from that they may
over generalize this learning to the
human case but a second possible
contributor to the solution could be a
predisposition that's actually present
in us as humans at an early age and we
don't have a lot of evidence that this
is true but I think we're starting to
see some tiny hints that it might be
true let me tell you about just one new
experiment by my student Katie Kinsler
at Harvard which has looked at how
infants react to people who stay
different languages what she did in this
study she took quite young infants six
month olds who aren't yet talking or
understanding much of anything that's
being said to them and she presented
them with two people who were in fact
Spanish English bilingual speakers but
for any given infant one of these two
people spoke to the infant in English
and the other spoke to the infant in
Spanish then the two people were
presented side-by-side very much like
the do poo and Jacob study I told you
about and they try to engage the child
and you look at how the child reacts now
in this sample of children they all came
from families where the language spoken
at home was English what she found was a
real difference in their orientation to
these two people even though unlike the
jacub studies the people weren't doing
anything objectively different the kids
were oriented more positively toward the
person who had previously spoken to them
in English then toward the person who
had previously spoken to them in Spanish
this is it's really too soon to draw
large conclusions from this but I think
it at least begins to suggest that early
in development children may already be
using some of these superficial
differences between people like the
sound pattern of their native language
as indicators of group membership maybe
we could be seeing here i think the
beginnings of tendencies to categorize
people as us versus them well if there's
anything to these speculations I think
they suggest that two aspects of human
nature may pose a challenge for us both
for our future and for the enterprise of
extending human rights around the world
one is our surface variability and the
other is our tendency to take this
surface variability much too seriously
and infer falsely from it that the
variability runs deep but I think a
third aspect of our human nature is
actually the most fundamental at all and
holds the potential key to a remedy to
this problem that is the combinatorial
capacity that allows us to articulate
deeply entrenched notions and criticize
them and get beyond them now we see this
capacity at work in the history of
science in a case that Chomsky has
discussed a lot in other
text though he didn't mention it today
in the development changing notions of
bodies with the revolution in Newtonian
mechanics now the core conception of
objects that we find in infants and that
we find an intuitive thinking all around
the world is centers on among other
things a constraint that objects can act
on each other only on contact but of
course as we all know in the history of
science that turned out not to provide a
very workable description of object
motion either on earth or in astronomy
and what happened is that by combining
other core concepts together
particularly concepts of space and
number Newton was able to come up with a
better account of object mechanics that
clashes with the court conception that
we hold but that nevertheless was able
to serve as a foundation for the
developed the further development of
science and technology and did so for
centuries until of course that theory
was replaced by even more counter
intuitive notions of bodies now I think
in the case of Human Rights a similar
process may be evident we have the
capacity to recognize that our notions
of human differences are wrong and the
dawning recognition of human universals
I think can already be seen in the
history of the human rights movement
from the very early days where it was
confined to relatively narrow circles of
people through the progressive
extensions to the current Universal
Declaration of Human Rights which
applies to everyone however this notion
clashes with entrenched beliefs it has
been articulated and it can be
implemented of course societies whose
laws and practices violate this
principle are far more common today as
professors chomsky's examples illustrate
then societies whose technologies
violate newtonian or quantum mechanics
and I think it's important to ask why it
might be that insights in this domain
are so much harder to grasp and put into
action
then our new insights in the domain of
physics now in part I think this may
well be because of the manipulative
effects of government and media that
Chomsky has so well described but in
part I think it also may be because
reasoning about other people engages our
emotions in a way that reasoning about
apples and bricks does not and that can
make the task of overcoming core
conceptions more difficult finally in
part I think it may just be because
cognitive science is less developed as a
discipline than physics is and the work
I was talking about today has for the
most part not entirely but for the most
part a much shorter history than the
history of insights and physics in any
case I think that one challenge that we
face now as a species is to see our
universal human nature through its
variable manifestations and then to
craft political institutions that build
on this insight and to end with the word
and again I actually think that both the
disciplines of linguistics and of human
rights are giving us our best starting
points here
is a mic here so I guess my question is
directed to both of you thank you very
much I'm actually a philosophy person
writing human rights and you've both
confirmed and sort of problem tires and
things that everything sort of curious
about one we taught professor charm's
you're talking you
