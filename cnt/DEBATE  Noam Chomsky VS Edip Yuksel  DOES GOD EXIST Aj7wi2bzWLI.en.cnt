thank you my last question is little
personal this opportunity to answer or
not if there is God which I argue there
is God in fact I had debate with
personal atheist organization in New
Jersey and also with Michael Shermer
skeptic Society but if you had your
question I mean God is so such a
genocide or fanatic that he was willing
to destroy every living thing on earth
no we have to have rain check for this
debate I think I think yeah I disagree
with that
I think I have very good discussion for
that but hopefully I don't know whether
you are interested to discussion of this
issue problem of evil and what was your
prayer my prayer yeah something that
wanted too many things yeah
this human species now is it not a
precipice facing disaster for true cases
the one is environmental catastrophe
which is coming then the other is
nuclear war which gets worse and worse
every year then I'm not interested in an
abstract situation I'd like to be able
to deal with those otherwise that's not
so talkative that's it
thank you
