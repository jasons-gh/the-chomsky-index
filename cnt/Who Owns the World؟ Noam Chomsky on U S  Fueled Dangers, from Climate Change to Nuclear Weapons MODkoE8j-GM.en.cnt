what I was thinking about these remarks
I had two topics and mind couldn't
decide between them actually pretty
obvious ones one topic is what are the
most important issues that we face the
second topic is what issues are not
being treated seriously or at all in the
quadrennial frenzy now underway called
an election but I realized that there's
no problem it's not a hard choice
they're the same topic and there are
reasons for it now which are very
significant in themselves I'd like to
return to that in a moment but first a
few words on the background beginning
with the announced title who owns the
world actually good answer to this was
given years ago by Adam Smith someone
we're supposed to worship it but not
read he was a little subversive when you
read him sometimes he was referring to
the most powerful country in the world
in his day and of course the country
that interested him namely England and
he pointed out that in England the
principal architects of policy are those
who own the country the merchants and
manufacturers in his day and he said
they make sure to design policy so that
their own interests are most peculiarly
attended to their interests are served
by policy however Grievous the impact on
others including the people of England
but he was an old-fashioned conservative
with moral principles so he added the
victims of England the victims of these
what he called the savage and justice of
the Europeans particular
in India well he had no illusions about
the owners so to quote him again all for
ourselves and nothing for other people
seems in every age of the world to have
been the vile Maxim of the Masters of
mankind was true then it's true del
Britain kept its position as the
dominant world power well into the 20th
century despite steady decline by the
end of World War two the dominance had
shifted decisively into the hands of the
upstart across the sea the United States
by far the most powerful and wealthy
society in world history Britain could
only aspire to be its junior partner as
the British Foreign Office ruefully
recognized at that point 1945 the United
States had literally half the world's
wealth incredible security controlled
the entire western hemisphere both
oceans the opposite sides of both oceans
is nothing there has never been anything
like that in history and planners
understood it Roosevelt's planners were
meeting right through the Second World
War designing the post-war world they
were quite sophisticated about it and
their plans were pretty much implemented
they wanted to make sure that the United
States would control what they called a
grand area which would include routinely
the entire western hemisphere the entire
Far East the former British Empire which
US would be taking over and as much of
Eurasia as possible crucially its
commercial and industrial centers in
Western Europe and within this region
they say
the United States should hold
unquestioned power with military and
economic supremacy while ensuring the
limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by states that might
interfere with these global designs and
those were pretty realistic plans at the
time given the enormous disparity of
power the US had been them by far the
richest country in the world even before
the second world war though it wasn't
was not yet the major global actor it
during the second world who were the
united states gained enormously the
industrial production almost quadrupled
got us out of the oppression meanwhile
industrial rivals were devastated or
seriously weakened so that was an
unbelievable system of power actually
the policies that were outlined then
still whole you can read them in
government pronouncements but the
capacity to implement them has
significantly declined actually there's
a major theme now in foreign policy
discussion you know journals and so on
the theme is called American decline so
for example in the most prestigious
establishment international relations
journal foreign affairs a couple of
months ago that was an issue which had
on the front cover and big bold letters
is America over ? that's announcing the
theme of the issue and there's a
standard collett corollary to this the
power is shifting to the west to China
and India the rising world powers which
are going to be the hegemonic states of
the future actually I think the decline
the decline is quite real but some
serious qualifications are in order
first of all the corollary is
highly unlikely least in the foreseeable
future a China and India are very poor
countries I just take a look at say the
human development index of the United
Nations their way down there China's
around 90th I think in these around 120
if they're so last time I looked and
they have tremendous internal problems
demographic problems extreme poverty
hopeless inequality ecological problems
China's great manufacturing center but
it's actually mostly an assembly plant
so it assembles parts and components
high technology that comes from the
surrounding industrial sent more
advanced industrial centers Japan Taiwan
South Korea Singapore at the United
States Europe that basically assembles
them so say you buy a one of these I
things you know an iPad from China that
it's called an export from China but the
parts and components and technology come
from outside and the value-added in
China is minuscule it's been calculated
they'll move up the technology ladder
but it's a hard climb in the even harder
well so I think one should be skeptical
about the car alert but the clep there's
another qualification that's more
serious decline is real but it's not new
it's been going on since 1945 in fact it
happened very quickly in the late 1940s
there's an event that's known here as
the loss of china china became
independent that's a loss of a huge
piece of the grand area of asia and it
became a major issue in American
domestic policy who's responsible for
the loss of China a lot of
recriminations and so on actually the
phrase is kind of interesting like I
can't lose your computer right because I
I can lose my computer well that phrase
lost of China kind of presupposes a
deeply held principle of kind of
American a leak consciousness we own the
world and if some piece of it becomes
independent we've lost it and that said
terrible loss we got to do something
about it it's never questioned which is
interesting in itself well right about
the same time around nineteen fifty
concerns developed about the loss of
Southeast Asia and that's what led the
United States into the Indochina wars
and the worst atrocities of the post-war
period that partly lost partly not very
significant event in modern history was
in 1965 when the in Indonesia which was
the main concern that's the country of
Southeast Asia with most of the wealth
and resources there was a coop military
coup in Indonesia it support the crew it
led to an extraordinary massacre what
the New York Times called a staggering
mass slaughter killed hundreds of
thousands of people mostly landless
peasants destroyed the only mass
political party and opened the country
up to Western exploitation euphoria in
the West was so enormous that it
couldn't be contained so in the New York
Times describing the staggering mass
slaughter called it a gleam of light in
Asia it was the column written by James
Reston the leading liberal thinker and
the times and the same elsewhere Europe
Australia was
fantastic event years later mcgeorge
bundy who was the national security
advisor for kennedy and johnson in
retrospect he pointed out that probably
would have been a good idea to end the
Vietnam War at that point pull out
contrary to a lot of illusions the
Vietnam War was fought primarily to
ensure that an independent Vietnam would
not develop successfully and become a
model for other countries in the region
would not to borrow Henry Kissinger's
terminology speaking about Chile we have
to prevent it the what they call the we
called the virus of independent
development from spreading contagion
elsewhere that's a critical part of
American foreign policy since the second
world war Britain France others to a
lesser degree and by 1965 that was over
Vietnam was South Vietnam was virtually
destroyed the word spread to the rest of
China wasn't going to be a model for
anyone and the contagion was contained
there were the suharto regime made sure
that Indonesia wouldn't be infected and
pretty soon the US had dictatorships in
every country of the region that Marcus
and Philippines dictatorship in
thailand's John and South Park in South
Korea it was no problem about the
infection so that would have been a good
time to end the Vietnam War he felt well
that's Southeast Asia but the decline
continues the last 10 years there's been
a very important event the loss of South
America for the first time in 500 years
the south and since the conquistadors
the South American countries have begun
to move towards independence and a
degree of integration
the typical structure of one of the
South American countries was tiny very
rich westernized elite often white or
mostly white and a huge mass of horrible
poverty countries separated from one
another or ended through each oriented
towards it's either Europe or more
recently the United States last 10 years
that's been overcome significantly
beginning to integrate the prerequisite
for independence of even beginning to
face some of their horrendous internal
problems that's the loss of South
America one sign is that the United
States has been driven out of every
single military base in South America
trying to restore a few but right now
there are none well moving on to just
last year the Arab Spring is another
such threat it threatens to take that
big region out of the grand area that's
a lot more significant than Southeast
Asia or South America to go back to the
1940s the State Department recognized
that the energy resources of the Middle
East are what they call the one of the
greatest material prizes and world
history spectacular sources of strategic
power if we can control Middle East
energy we can control the world and they
take a look at the u.s. you could
British coup and Iran in 1953 very
important event its shadow cast over the
world until today that was was a
pretense that it was part of the Cold
War had nothing to do with Cold War what
it had to do was the usual fear
independent nationalism and wasn't even
concerned with access to oil or
it was concerned with control control of
the oil resources of Iran and in fact of
the region and that's a theme that runs
right through policy decisions not
discussed much but it's very important
to have control exactly as State
Department pointed advisors pointed out
in the 40s if you can throw up control
the oil you can control most of the
world and that goes on so far the threat
of the Arab Spring has been pretty well
contained in the oil dictatorships which
are the most important ones for the West
every effort to join the Arab Spring has
just been crushed by force Saudi Arabia
was so extreme that when there was an
effort to you know go out into the
streets the security presence was so
enormous that people were even afraid to
go out there's a little discussion of
what goes on in Bahrain where it's been
crushed but eastern Saudi Arabia it was
much worse the Emirates totally
controlled so that's okay we managed to
ensure that the threat of democracy
would be smashed in the most important
places in Egypt is an interesting case
it's important country not oil producer
it is a small one but in Egypt the
United States followed a standard
operating procedure maeve you're going
into the Diplomatic Service you might as
well learn it there's a standard
procedure when one of your favorite
dictators gets into trouble first you
support him as long as possible but if
it becomes really impossible say the
army turns against him then you send
them out to pasture and get the
intellectual class to issue ringing
declarations about your love of
democracy and then try to restore the
old system as much as possible there's
case after case of that somoza and
Nicaragua
davila in Haiti and Marcus and the
Philippines China and South Korea Mobutu
in the Congo over and over them it takes
genius not to see it and that's exactly
what was done and in Egypt and what
France tried to do not quite with as
much success in Tunisia well the future
is uncertain but the threat of democracy
so far is contained and it's a real
threat I'll return to that it's also to
recognize that the decline over the past
50 years is to a significant extent
self-inflicted particularly since the
70s all go back to that too but first
let me say a couple of things about the
issues that are most important today and
that are being ignored or not dealt
seriously dealt with seriously in the
electoral campaigns for good reasons so
let me start with the most important
issues there are two of these they're of
overwhelming significance because the
fate of the species depends on them the
one is environmental disaster the others
nuclear war I'm not going to take much
time reviewing the threats of
environmental disaster actually there on
the front pages almost daily so for
example last week the New York Times at
a front-page story with the headline
ending its summer melt Arctic sea ice
that's a new low that leads to warnings
the melting this summer was fast far
faster than it was predicted by the
sophisticated computer models and the
most recent United Nations report that's
now predicted that the summer ice it
might be gone by 2020 it was assumed
before that it may be 2050 they quoted
scientists who said this is a prime
example of the built-in conservatism of
our climate forecasts as dire
the warnings are about the long-term
consequences of heat-trapping emissions
many of us fear that they may still be
on us under estimating the speed and
severity of the impending changes maybe
there's a climate change study program
at MIT where I am they've been worrying
about this for years and repeatedly have
been proven right The Times report
discusses briefly the severe attacked
the severe impact of all of the sudden
the global climate and it adds but
governments have not responded to the
change with any greater urgency about
limiting greenhouse emissions to the
contrary their main response has been to
plan for exploitation of newly
accessible minerals in the Arctic
including drilling for more oil that is
to accelerate the catastrophe that's
quite interesting it demonstrates an
extraordinary willingness to sacrifice
the lives of our children and
grandchildren for short-term gain or
perhaps an equally remarkable
willingness to shut our eyes so as not
to see impending peril this thing's you
sometimes find with young infants
something looks dangerous close my eyes
and look at it well there is another
possibility I mean maybe humans are
somehow trying to fulfill a prediction
of great American biologist who died
recently Ernst Meier now he argued years
ago that intelligence seems to be a
lethal mutation he had some pretty good
evidence there's a notion of biological
success which is how many of you are
there around you know that's biological
success they pointed out that if you
look at the
the tens of billions of species in human
world history the ones that are very
successful are the ones that mutate very
quickly like bacteria are the ones that
have a fixed ecological niche like
beetles they seem to make out fine but
as you move up the scale of what we call
intelligence success declines steadily
when you get up to mammals it's very low
they're very few of them around there's
a lot of cows it's not because we
domesticate them when you get to humans
it's the same till very recently much to
reason that time to show up in any
evolutionary counting the humans were
very scattered there were plenty of
other hominids but they disappeared
probably because humans exterminated
them but nobody knows for sure anyhow
maybe we're trying to show that humans
just fit into the general pattern we can
exterminate ourselves to the rest of the
world with us and we're hell-bent on it
right now well let's turn to the
elections both political parties demand
that we make the problem worse in 2008
both party flat platforms devoted some
space to how the government should
address climate change today the in the
Republican platform the issue is
essentially disappeared but the platform
does demand that Congress take quick
action to prevent the Environmental
Protection Agency from regulating
greenhouse gases so let's make sure to
make it worse and it also demands that
we open the Alaska's Arctic refuge to
drilling I'm quoting now in order to
take advantage of all of our America
and god-given resources can't disobey
God after all on environmental policy
the program says we must restore
scientific integrity to our public
research institutions and remove
political incentives from publicly
funded research oh that's a code word
for climate science stop funding climate
science Romney himself says there's no
scientific consensus so we should
support more debate and investigation
within the scientific community but no
action except to act to make the
problems worse well what about the
Democrats they concede that there's a
problem and advocate that we should work
toward an agreement to set emissions
limits in unison with other emerging
powers but that's it no action and in
fact as Obama has emphasized we have to
work hard to gain what he calls a
hundred years of energy independence by
exploiting domestic or Canadian
resources by fracking and other
elaborate technologies it doesn't ask
what the world would look like in a
hundred years so there are differences
that the differences are basically about
how enthusiastically the lemmings should
march towards the cliff
let's turn to the second major issue in
nuclear war it's also on the front pages
daily but in a way that would seem
outlandish to some independent observer
the viewing what's going on on earth and
in fact does seem outlandish to a
conservative the countries of the world
the current threat not for the first
time is in the Middle East focusing on
Iran the general picture in the West is
very clear it's far too dangerous to
allow Iran to reach what's called
nuclear capability that is the
capability enjoyed by many powers and
dozens of them to produce nuclear
weapons if they decide to do so as to
whether they've decided US intelligence
says it doesn't know the International
Atomic Energy Agency just produced its
most recent report a couple weeks ago
and it concludes I'll quoted it cannot
demonstrate the absence of an undeclared
of undeclared nuclear material and
activities in Iran that is it can't
demonstrate something which kind of a
condition that can't be satisfied
there's no way to demonstrate the
absence of the work that's convenient
therefore Iran must be denied the right
to enrich uranium that's guaranteed to
every Power that signed the
non-proliferation treaty well that's the
picture in the West it's not the picture
in the rest of the world as you know I'm
sure there was just a meeting of the
non-aligned movement that's large
majority of the countries in the world
and of representing most of the world's
population a meeting in Tehran and once
again not for the first time they issued
a ringing declaration of support for
Iran's right to
rich uranium right that every country
has that signed the non-proliferation
treaty pretty much the same is true in
the Arab world that's interesting i'll
return to that in a moment there is a
basic reason for the concern it was
expressed succinctly by General Lee
Butler he's the former head of the US
Strategic Command which controls nuclear
weapons and nuclear strategy now he
wrote that it is dangerous in the
extreme that in the cauldron of
animosities that we call the Middle East
one nation should arm itself with
nuclear weapons which may inspire other
nations to do so general Butler however
was not referring to Iran he was
referring to Israel the country that
ranks highest in European polls as the
most dangerous country in the world
right above Iran and not incidentally in
the Arab world where the public regard
the United States as the second most
dangerous country right after Israel in
the Arab world Iran though disliked it
ranks far lower as a threat among the
populations that is not the
dictatorships with regard to Iranian
nuclear weapons nobody wants them to
have them but in many polls majorities
sometimes considerable majorities have
said that the region would be more
secure if Iran had nuclear weapons to
balance those of their major threats now
there's a lot of commentary in the
Western media and journals about our
attitudes towards Iran and what you read
commonly is that the Arabs want decisive
action against Iran which is true of the
dictators it's not true of the
populations but who cares about the
popular
editions what are called disparagingly
the Arab Street I don't care about them
that's a reflection of the extremely
deep contempt for democracy among
Western elites I mean so deep that it
can't be perceived you know it's just
kinda like reflexive this study of
popular attitudes in our world and there
is very extensive study by Western
polling agencies it reveals very quickly
why the US and its allies are so
concerned about the threat of democracy
and are doing what they can to prevent
it they certainly don't want attitudes
like those I've just indicated to be
become policy while of course issuing
arousing statements about our passionate
dedication democracy those are relayed
obediently by reporters and commentators
well unlike Iran Israel refuses to allow
inspections at all that refuses to join
the non-proliferation treaty has
hundreds of nuclear weapons as advanced
delivery systems also it has a long
record of violence and repression it has
annexed and settled conquered
territories illegally violation of
security council orders many acts of
aggression five times against lebanon
alone no credible pretext New York Times
yesterday you can read that the Golan
Heights are disputed territory Syrian
Golan Heights there is a UN Security
Council resolution 497 which is
unanimous declaring Israel's annexation
of Golan Heights illegal and demanding
that it be rescinded and in fact its
disputed only in Israel and in the New
York Times
which in fact is reflecting actual US
policy not formal US policy Iran has a
record of aggression to it in the last
several hundred years it has invaded and
conquered a couple of Arab islands that
was under the Shah us imposed dictator
with us support it's actually the only
case in several hundred years meanwhile
the severe threats of attack continue
you've just been hearing them at the UN
from the United States but particularly
Israel there is a reaction to this at
the highest level in the United States
Leon Panetta Secretary of Defense he
said that we don't want to attack Iran
we hope that Israel won't attack Iran
about Israel's a sovereign country and
they have to make their own decisions
about what they'll do you might ask what
the reaction would be if you reverse the
cast of characters and those of you who
have antiquarian interests it might
remember that there's a document called
the United Nations Charter foundation of
modern international law which bars the
threat or use of force in international
affairs there are two rogue states
united states and israel with for whom
which regard that it the Charter and
international law is just boring
irrelevance so that what they like and
that's accepted well these are not just
words there is an ongoing war includes
terrorism assassination of nuclear
scientists includes economic war us
threats not international ones us
threats
have cut I ran out of the international
financial system Western military
analysts identify what they call weapons
of finance as acts of war the justify
violent response when they're directed
against us that is the cutting Iran out
of global financial markets is different
the United States is openly carrying out
extensive cyber war against Iran that's
praised the Pentagon regards cyber war
as an equivalent to an armed attack
which justifies military response but
that's of course when it's directed
against us the leading liberal figure in
the State Department Harold Koh is the
top State Department legal advisor he
says that cyber war is an act of war if
it results in significant destruction
like the attacks against Iranian nuclear
facilities and such acts he says justify
force in self-defense but of course he
means only attacks against the United
States or its clients well Israel's
lethal armory which is enormous includes
advanced submarines recently provided by
Germany these are capable of carrying
Israel's nuclear tipped missiles and
these are sure to be a deployed and the
Persian Gulf or nearby if Israel
proceeds with its plans to bomb Iran or
more likely I suspect to try to set up
conditions in which the United States
will do so and the United States of
course as a vast array of nuclear
weapons all over the world but
surrounding the region from the
Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean
including enough firepower and the
Persian Gulf to destroy most
world another story that's in the news
right now is the Israeli bombing of the
Iraqi reactor in OC rock which is
suggested as a model for Israeli bombing
of Iran it's rarely mentioned however
that the bombing of the osirak reactor
didn't end Saddam Hussein's nuclear
weapons program it initiated it there
was no program before and the osirak
reactor was not capable of producing
uranium for nuclear weapons but of
course after the bombing sonam
immediately turned to developing a
nuclear weapons program and if Iran is
bombed it's almost certain to proceed
just as Saddam Hussein did after the
osirak bombing in a few weeks we'll be
commemorating the 50th anniversary of
the most dangerous moment in human
history those are the words of historian
Kennedy advisor Arthur Schlesinger is
referring of course to the October 1962
Missile Crisis the most dangerous moment
in human history others agree at that
time Kennedy raised the nuclear alert to
the second-highest level just short of
launching weapons he authorized NATO
aircraft with Turkish or other pilots to
take off fly to Moscow drop bombs a
setting off a likely nuclear
conflagration at the peak of the missile
crisis a Kennedy estimated the
probability of nuclear war perhaps fifty
percent it's a war that would destroy
the northern hemisphere President
Eisenhower and warned and facing that
risk Kennedy refused to agree publicly
to an offer by her stuff to end the
crisis by simultaneous withdrawal of
Russian missiles from Cuba and us
missiles from Turkey these were obsolete
missiles
they were already being replaced by
invulnerable pull our submarines but it
was felt necessary to firmly establish
the principle that Russia has no right
to have any offensive weapons anywhere
beyond the borders of the USSR even to
defend an ally against us attack that's
now recognized to be the prime reason
for deploying missiles there and
actually a plausible one meanwhile the
United States must retain the right to
have them all over the world at
targeting Russia or China or any other
enemy in fact in 1962 the United stree
cently learned the United States had
just secretly deployed nuclear missiles
to Okinawa aimed at China it was a
moment of elevated regional tensions all
that is very consistent with grand area
conceptions the ones I mentioned that
were developed by Roosevelt's planners
well fortunately in 1962 cruise ship
back down but the world can't be assured
of such sanity forever and particularly
threatening my view is that intellectual
opinion and even scholarship the hell
Kennedy's behavior as his finest hour my
own view is is one of the worst moments
in history inability to face the truth
about ourselves is all too common a
feature of the intellectual cultural so
personal life has ominous implications
well 10 years later in 1973 during the
Israel Arab war Henry Kissinger called a
high-level nuclear
leur the purpose was to warn the
Russians to keep hands off while he was
so we have recently learned he was
secretly informing Israel that they were
authorized to violate the ceasefire that
had been imposed jointly by the US and
Russia when reagan came into office a
couple of years later the united states
launched operations probing russian
defenses flying into russia to probe the
fences and simulating air and naval
attacks i mean while placing Pershing
missiles in Germany that had a five
minute flight time to Russian targets
they were providing what the CIA called
a super sudden first-strike capability
the Russians not surprisingly were
deeply concerned actually that led to a
major war scare in 1983 there have been
hundreds of cases when human
intervention aborted first strike
launched just minutes before launch
that's after automated systems gave
false alarms that we don't have Russian
records but there's no doubt that their
systems are far more accident prone not
just a near miracle that nuclear war has
been avoided so far meanwhile indian
pakistani have come close to nuclear war
several times and the crises that led to
that especially Kashmir remain both
India and Pakistan have refused to sign
the non-proliferation treaty along with
Israel and both of them have received us
support for development of their nuclear
weapons programs actually until today in
the case of India which is now a US ally
war threats in the Middle East which
could become reality very soon once
again escalate the dangers well
fortunately there's a way out of
a simple way there's a way to mitigate
maybe end whatever threat Iran is
alleged to pose very simple move towards
establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone
in the Middle East the opportunities
coming again this December there's an
international conference scheduled to
deal with this proposal it has
overwhelming international support
including it's an early majority of the
population in Israel that's fortunately
unfortunately it's blocked by the United
States and Israel a couple of days ago
Israel announced that it's not going to
participate and it won't consider the
matter until there's a general regional
peace Obama takes the same stand now he
also insists that any agreement must
exclude Israel and even must exclude the
calls for other nations meaning the us
to provide information about Israeli
nuclear activities the United States and
Israel can delay regional peace
indefinitely they've been doing that for
35 years on Israel Palestine virtual
international isolations along important
story that I don't have time to go into
here so therefore there's no hope for an
easy way to end with the West regards as
the most severe current crisis in no way
unless there's large-scale public
pressure but the can't be large-scale
public pressure unless people at least
know about it and the media have done a
stellar job in averting that danger
nothing reported about the conference or
about any of the
ground no discussion apart from
specialist arms control journals where
you can read about it so that blocks the
easy way to end the worst existing
crisis unless people somehow find a way
to break through this MIT professor Noam
Chomsky spoke on September 27th of this
year at the University of Massachusetts
in Amherst his talk was entitled who
owns the world if you'd like to get a
