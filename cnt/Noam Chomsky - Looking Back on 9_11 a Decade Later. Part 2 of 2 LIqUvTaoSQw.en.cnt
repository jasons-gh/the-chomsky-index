as over 300 are I'm Amy Goodman with
Aaron Matta our guest for the hour is
MIT professor Noam Chomsky his latest
book is called 911 was there an
alternative that last question was there
an alternative referring to the
assassination of Osama bin Laden Aaron
well no you mentioned the changes in
discourse between ten years ago and
today and actually this issue of the
reasons behind 9/11 came up last night
at the Republican presidential debate
congressman Ron Paul of Texas drew boos
from the crowd and a rebuke from other
candidates on the podium when he
criticized u.s. foreign policy in
discussing the roots of 9/11
we're under great threat because we
occupy so many countries we're in a
hundred and thirty country we have 900
bases around the world we're going broke
the purpose of al Qaeda was to attack us
invite us over there where they can
target us and they have been doing it
they have more attacks against us and
the American interest per month then
occurred in all the years before 9/11
but we're they're occupying their land
and if we think that we can do that and
not have retaliation we're kidding
ourselves we have to be honest with
ourselves what would we do if another
country say China did to us what we do
to all those countries over there so
this whole idea that the whole Muslim
world is responsible for this and
they're attacking us because we're free
and prosperous that is just not true
Osama bin Laden and
I have been expressive
they have been explicit and they wrote
and said that we attacked we attacked
America because you had bases on our
holy land in Saudi Arabia you do not
give Palestinians a fair treatment and
you have been bombing I didn't say that
I'm trying to get you to understand what
the motive was behind the bombing at the
same time we had been bombing and
killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis
for ten years would you be annoyed if
you're not annoyed under some problem
that was Republican Congress member Ron
Paul of Texas speaking last night at the
Republican presidential debate no I'm
Chomsky your response I think what he
said is completely uncontroversial you
can read it in government documents you
can find it in polls maybe people don't
like to hear it but as I mentioned
before it goes back to the 1950s
actually right after 9/11 The Wall
Street Journal to its credit did a study
of privileged Muslims sometimes called
moneyed Muslims people in the Muslim
world who were deeply embedded in the
u.s. global project lawyers of directors
of multinational corporations and so on
the general population and it was very
much like what Eisenhower had it was
concerned about it and the National
Security Council in 1950s there was a
lot of antagonism
a lot of antagonism the US policy in the
region
partly support of dictators blocking
democracy and development just as the
National Security Council concluded in
1958 also by then by 2001 there were
much more specific things very much a
lot of anger about the u.s. backing for
the way Israeli occupation of the
occupied territories settlements the
bitter oppression of the Palestinians
and also something that isn't discussed
much here but meant a lot there and
remember these are privileged Muslims
leaders of those who kind of carry out
implement the general US economic and
social policies in the region this the
other thing besides that he's really
supportive Israeli crimes was the
sanctions against Iraq this is 2001
remember the sanctions against Iraq were
brutal and destructive they killed
hundreds of thousands of people the both
of the international diplomats who
administered the oil-for-food program
distinguished international diplomats at
Dennis holiday on sueance Banach in
sequence both of them resigned in
protest because they regarded the
sanctions as genocidal they were
carrying out a kind of a mass slaughter
of Iraqis they were strengthening Saddam
Hussein they were compelling the
population to rely on him just for
survival and these were major crimes
of the 1990s and privileged muslims
money muslims and the in in the saudi
arabia elsewhere they were bitterly
opposed to this not because they hate
our freedoms because they don't like
murders and brutal policies you know
before you were quoting a CIA analyst
saying that the u.s. had actually become
a son of enlightens biggest ally through
being drawn into so many wars abroad and
talking about how all this engagement
has undermine us standing well what has
this decade of war meant here at home
for the domestic situation and how that
relates to bin Laden the goals of
bleeding the united states yeah he was
pretty explicit about that he wanted he
wanted to draw the United States into it
intelligence agencies called a trap
which would lead which would inflame and
incite hostility in the Muslim world he
hoped help mobilize people for his cause
I don't think that happened but also
bankrupt the us at home I mean current
estimates was a recent estimate study at
Brown University estimated the cost just
of the two wars at about four trillion
dollars if you count in the costs of you
know how my security and so on probably
doubles that that's pretty serious
that's the between the wars the the
housing bubble and wishes tax cuts for
the rich that it creates the economic
crisis that we're now in
