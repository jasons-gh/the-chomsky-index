it reminded me of Steven Pinker's sort
of new book on the enlightenment and how
you know the triumph of the night but
recently in capitalism that mean and
there again you have someone who is one
of the more prominent intellectuals in
the world and whose words taken quite
seriously and then he said psychology
which is sort of it was he did serious
work and experimental psycho psycho
linguistics pheromonal psychology an
intelligent person actually is a friend
but frankly don't think much of these
recent looks so does that mean that I
mean you know you're critical of a lot
of obscurantists critical theory but
that's also the so you're also sort of
equally critical of the Social Sciences
which are not a lot of not entirely
they're serious work in social sciences
so take the take the to his topic you
know how everything's wonderful work for
grossing and so on actually there is
serious work on that topic so take
Robert Gordon's book about the exact
title but something like the rise and
fall of the American economy some very
serious both fine economic historian who
partially overlaps with what Pinker says
but it's done seriously what he points
out is that until it he says it was a
special since century roughly 1870 to
1970 at which point of the word there
were there was very substantial progress
made and it shows up in health
statistics you know longevity quality of
life and so on things like invention of
indoor plumbing which probably had a
better impact on quality of life than
all of medicine you know and the many
other discoveries he says prior to 1870
things were was kind of flat you know
there wasn't much of the way of growth
but that purity was huge growth and then
starting in 1970s or decline well that's
the neoliberal theory
that's why well you see mortality
increasing in the United States you
don't walk around the streets and see
people starving to death but the
majority of the population stagnated
real Millwood wages are lower than they
were in the 60s
what is that progress but and also what
this progress means yeah if you have an
iPhone right what about our phenomenal
as my points first of all we just if we
look at the technology that people have
it doesn't come from what Steven
Pinker's talking about things not modern
capitalism almost right this came out of
public funding through some state
systems then handed over to private
power but these as Gordon points out
these are frills iPhones as compared
with indoor plumbing or electricity is
almost invisible its rules around the
periphery which have a dubious effect on
your actual life one of your former
colleague Steve Pinker has written a
book the better angels of our nature
that in fact if you wanted to choose a
time to be around and have a happy
nonviolent life today is a lot better
than than when you've been being around
Neanderthal times well that's what he
claims but the weight of evidence is
strongly against it you think so I think
so there's very good work by serious
anthropologist Brian Ferguson is one
who's worked through his data and I
think shown that it's probably wrong for
about 95% of human existence namely the
hunter-gatherer periods it's really with
the emergence of state systems the
development of complex agriculture they
begin to get Wars that are very
destructive I'm there's killing among
hunter
you know but it's pretty limited but
there has been moral progress in fact he
wrote well one thing that he says is
correct I think that's about it since
since the since the Enlightenment there
has been moral progress in our own
lifetimes there's been moral progress so
consider for example the status of
women's rights today and in 1950 very
different status of civil rights very
different that gay rights very different
that's progress and it's been going on
slowly since the Enlightenment but
that's a pretty brief period of human
history it's but and in fact right at
the same time have been the most
murderous destructive Wars ever and even
the 70 years ago the creation by some of
the smartest people in the world of a
device that may destroy us all
that is on the verge of we'll get to
that as you know I'm a chairman of the
board of on the Atomic Scientists it's
an issue that's really of great names me
you actually just reproduced a quote I
was gonna talk about where is it that
that there has been moral progress in
many ways status of women and
particularly your daughters versus your
grandmother but it and you say it's
fairly brief but don't you think it's
interesting that that coincides with the
rise of science do you think that's
coincidental no it's not coincidental
part of the contribution of the
Enlightenment was to free inquiry from
constraints which led to the rise of
science so breaking free of these
fetters that society had imposed did
permit the rise of science it did permit
moral progress also permitted massive
destruction
