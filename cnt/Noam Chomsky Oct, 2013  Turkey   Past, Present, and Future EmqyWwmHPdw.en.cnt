thanks for staying to the rescue and we
are already at professor Chomsky Lucifer
mrs. Oscar how's this well one of the
things you learn if you're at MIT as
long as I've been about 60 years is that
there are technology has some easy
problems and some heart problems there
are easy problems like developing
computers
the internet on the nanotechnology
robotics that enables us to will soon
allow us to have fly sized drones on the
ceiling carrying out surveillance in our
living rooms and then they're a hard
problem getting a sound system anyone
who's been to an MIT commencement those
that there's almost a guarantee that
sounds
well I'm not the specialist on tortilla
and we won't talk much about Turkish
history I in the last 15 years
visited turkey repeatedly I've gotten a
kind of a snapshot guru and quite
interesting significant changes that
have been taking place my first visit
was about 15 years ago was at the end of
near the end of a very dark period in
Turkish history there had been a huge
state terror operation through the 1990s
aimed at the Kurdish population
southeastern Turkey tens of thousands of
people were killed several thousand
towns and villages were destroyed every
kind of torture you can imagine there
were hundreds or thousands maybe
millions of refugees driven into western
Turkey or beyond I visited slums and
Istanbul which people in Istanbul don't
know about in areas where there are
condemned buildings that are in fact
inhabited by Kurdish refugees from from
the east families living in a family
living in a small room where nobody the
father mother young child kind of leave
the room there it's too dangerous
outside there aren't either were in some
of these places teenage children who did
go out to earn some money I hate to
think what they were doing but they
could more or less survive I was told by
the people there that
that they could go back to their
destroyed villages and reconstruct them
they were allowed to do that or in one
condition that they stated signed
statement saying that the villages had
been destroyed destroyed by the Kurdish
guerrillas PKK which of course wasn't
true they were destroyed by the Turkish
army and refusing to sign these
statements they were consigned to the
slums were worse than slums we though
simply be there forever went on to a
couple of times to Java Kara you can't
understand any official capital of
Turkey in the southeast there were
people living in the city surrounded by
walls people living in caves and the
walls I've got the room followed by love
security and Turkish security also
television and my diets one of them head
of Human Rights Watch in Turkey if they
noticed it down the street that there
were children playing whose clothes
combination of their clothes match the
Kurdish flag they would steer us in
another direction because the parents
would suffer for allowing the children's
clothes that might suggest the Kurdish
fly and I didn't even talk in Jarvik
your first time I was their downfall and
at the end of the talk something very
dramatic happened a discussion and a
couple of young boys young men came up
carrying a book it was a Kurdish English
dictionary which was banned in Turkey so
it was illegal it had been smuggled in
from France and had an inscription in
the front which moving inscription was
my office if anyone wants to see it just
expressing their wish that someday they
would be able to
use their own language this is very
courageous act in front of Turkish
security and television I tried to find
that lady to find out later what
happened to them a couple of weeks later
that were arrested and disappeared after
that I haven't been able to trace it
further my first visit was to take part
two supposedly to observe a trial it was
a trial of a publisher who had
translated a book with published
translation of a book of mine at the
book had ten pages or so on turkey
coverings the atrocities of the
preceding decade the 1990s so he was
under the publisher and its owner aware
I'm going to fried the trials are before
a military court which has no
resemblance to a court his lawyer was
won by the mayor later in the mayor of
jariabek here more recently arrested in
the recent wave of arrests is why I
suggested that I should insist on being
a co-defendant in the trial assuming
turned out correctly that if I did of
the government would call off the trial
because they didn't want the publicity
it was a lot of international present
for them for that event so I did sure
enough the next day we walked into the
courtroom and the prosecutor informed
the judge that they were dropping the
charges and the trial ended a very
temporary victory because a couple of
months later he was arrested try it
again
or to find out what happened to him on
the way out learn something interesting
about the international press corps
there were there was a lot of
international press there including some
American journalists they were there for
the spectacle and when the trial was
called off they've all walked out as we
were walking down the police were
bringing in a young woman
I stopped to talk to her she's turned
out she's journalists who was being
tried before the same court if the press
had been willing to stay there for
another 20 minutes
she probably would have been released
because again for the same reason that I
went to publicity but not a single
journalist was willing to spend 20
minutes to save a young colleague from
being sent to a Turkish prison which is
not present with whatever followed
well that's these were some of the worst
atrocities of the 1990s and the u.s. was
involved up to its neck
80% of turkeys alarms were that were
used for the atrocities were coming from
the United States Clinton administration
they support the atrocities peaked in
1997 in 1997 that he would Clinton send
the level of alarm sent to Turkey in
1997 was about the same as the total
shipment of arms to Turkey and the
entire Cold War period up to the onset
of the counter insurgency the state of
terror all of this is unknown here there
were of course news bureaus and in
Turkey and Ankara but they wouldn't
report it actually one of the very few
people to have written about it to write
about it at the time was a John terment
it's now at the Center for International
Studies here it was unknown for two
reasons
first of all it's typical to the press
does not want a report and academics do
not want to discuss power on crimes
much nicer to talk about other people's
from although this was enhanced here
because there was a preferred story the
1990s were right after the fall of
Soviet Union and the story was that now
the United
is free to demonstrate its profound
commitment to principle values to actin
on the basis of altruism alone but to
lead the enlightened States as they can
now they're free to disregard
international law and very council and
carry out their marvelous missions the
United led by the the new world bent on
on a crusade in inhumanity Clinton's
foreign policy was described as having a
saintly glow as it entered into a noble
phase these are all quotes from leading
international left the world mostly
intellectuals that was the preferred
score and it's not nice to disturb the
preferred story with those of reality of
which the from the crucial decisive u.s.
participation in Turkish atrocities is
one and only one example the in fact
this was all of this episode is so
embarrassing that it's been erased from
history find any reference to it well in
the early years of this millennium there
were improvement he visited here by ear
detectable improvement in the human
rights conditions the attacks on the
Kurds declined circumstances approved
jarba theater was much more open as a
Biden air was elected mayor that
continued until about 2005 at that point
there was a very clear ship most
analysts in Turkey that
because implausibly to the fact that in
2005 the European Union have made pretty
clear that no matter what improvements
that were and Turkish remember X
behavior the he was not going to admit
Turkey as a as a member as the pretext
for not allowing them was human rights
violations of which members of the
European Union are not immune to charges
about that but Turkey didn't reach their
high standards as the standards improved
the bulk of the bar went higher and was
pretty clear that the real reason was
just playing European racism the
Europeans don't want Turks walking
around the streets now that became quite
obvious in Germany in particular there
was a government minister who could do
those hours and published a book which
would quickly became a best-seller in
Germany protesting the lifting Turks who
were not becoming Germans and they
weren't event they were still keeping
their own culture and staying together
that on further Markel the Chancellor
chimed in and of course condemn the book
everyone had to condemn the book but she
said it was for multiculturalism it
failed Turks were not put it
metaphorically becoming blonde and
blue-eyed problem
those were the sense of irony might bear
in mind that Benjamin Franklin the
leading Enlightenment figure in the
night from the early days of the United
States argued the Germans should not be
allowed to immigrate to the United
States because their disorder that
Swedes do their to swarthy demogroup but
today it's Turkish we can't be accepted
Europe so Turkey was not going to be
admitted no matter what and Turkish
policy changed notably at that time
possibly for that reason if he came the
report there was return to serious
repression the up to the events that the
reasons we've been hearing about u.s.
attitudes towards Turkey also have
changed but during the period of the
huge atrocities in the 90s it was
virtually no coverage but after 2003
there was a beginning of retrospective
coverage of Turkish atrocities always a
first excising the u.s. role that's
unmentionable as to what was the reason
one of those amazing that Turkey
committed a major crime in 2003 for
which which was unforgivable the Turkish
government to everyone's surprise had
followed the will of 90% 95% of the
population and refused to participate in
the US invasion of Iraq that's a real
crime and killing tens of thousands of
people informants we don't care about
that but following the will of the
overwhelming majority of the population
is a major crime and Turkey was a bit
earlier than them for that sanctions
were suggested the Paul Wolfowitz
government official it was known here as
he was called the idealist and cheetah
leading the democracy ledge of democracy
movement of the Bush administration he
went so far as to personally condemn the
Turkish military because they didn't
overthrow the government and force it to
carry out their duty of following the
United States
and invading Iraq and on the pretext
that 95% of the population disagree
that's so so at that point it did become
possible to start describing some of the
atrocities of the 90s ofcourse excising
the u.s. role and then as repression
increases in Turkey the US relations
with the government also improved that's
pretty normal and characteristic and the
repression became pretty severe as
you've heard as you just heard the now
husband the highest per capita
imprisonment for terror abide quite
longshot reportedly organization
reporters without borders published the
letter they published an annual report
of repression of journalists around the
world last year they published it and
they also published a special supplement
specifically about Turkey it was
entitled Turkey world's biggest prison
for journalists the report was based on
an intensive study concluded on quote
that the number of detained journalists
is unprecedented since the end of the
military rule
mostly representatives the Kurdish media
that was one aspect of rising repression
altogether there were messes of
political activists particularly Kurds
including mayor's former
parliamentarians and so on the u.s. as
usual is participating that's no secret
to anyone or it shouldn't be that the
Obama administration has gone out of its
way to lead a major attack on civil
liberties in the United States and one
of the most extreme cases which is not
as well-known as a truth II involves
Turkey it's a Justice Department case of
Brooklyn called holder versus
the humanitarian law project it's a case
brought by the Obama administration
against the humanitarian law project
that's a legal age Association which was
committing the crime of providing legal
advice to a Turkish organization it's on
the US terrorist list that's too much
for the Obama administration the Turkish
people read the court case II could
pretty well then condemn as a terrorist
anyone in the US who say advises a group
on the terrorist list turned to
nonviolent actions or just investigates
them out of a interesting research I've
done that others might we might
incidentally ask ourselves that's a very
sharp attack on freedom of speech the
will right we might ask ourselves just
what is the terrorist list as you heard
the terrorist the Turkish version of
what the terrorist is leading to huge
waves of imprisonment the US terrorist
list is also an interesting phenomenon
it's assumed here to be legitimate the
government can put in put anyone at
likes on the terrorist list without
judicial review without argument taking
up an awfully likes it should be
regarded as a scandal particularly when
you look at how it's used so for example
Nelson Mandela was on the terrorist list
until about four years ago if he wanted
to come to the United States and a
special dispensation the reason is that
the Reagan administration and at the
birth toward the very end of the
apartheid years condemned the African
National Congress
Mandela's African National Congress as
one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world that was Reagan's
justification for providing aid and
assistance to apartheid south
to defend themselves from the terror of
the ANC on the other hand takes the time
insane he was removed from the terrorist
list in 1982 by the Reagan
administration because they wanted to
provide a substantial aid to Saddam in
his invasion of Iran so there we had to
be removed from the terrorist list that
left a gap and the terrorist list so
they had put someone in what they did
was put Cuba name that was really hard
the fact that Cuba is the target of more
international terrorism than all states
in the world combined coming from the
United States and in fact there have
just been a huge job surgeon terrorism
against Cuba so they were put on the
terrorist list as Saddam Hussein was
removed and Mandela was put on a couple
of years laters just recently taken off
that's the terrorist was the fact that
we pay attention to it here's pretty
amazing well then comes Taksim Square
gezi Park heard about then being well I
should say to throughout this whole
period there have been enormous changes
among the Turkish public it's pretty
remarkable to see go through the details
but I was just there a couple of months
ago most recently and right before the
Taksim Square events I was there as a
to give a lecture and memoriae memorial
lecture for grunting grunting is the
journalist who exposed began to expose
the truth about the atrocities against
the Armenians hidden and denied and so
on he was assassinated almost surely by
government agents there was our story
concocted which nobody believes this so
this was a Memorial Lecture huge turnout
they marched for Istanbul ended with a
huge demonstration in front of the
building with in which they work where
it was assassinated with signs are all
prompting meanwhile there has been a
considerable exposure of the crimes
committed against the Armenians horrible
crimes century earlier for the first
time and also actions taken when I was
in Java care to begin
ten years ago than what I was interested
in the German care is one of the places
with the massacres there were really the
peak was horrible massacres there so I
asked if there was any remnant of the
Armenian community and I was taken to
the church ruins of a church
nothing virtually nothing left the roof
going a couple of pillars and that was
the main Armenian Church I asked if
anyone had collected anything from the
church where it was destroyed and they
told me that there was a tomato
storefront nearby was in our meeting a
man
jiae's who had collected artifacts from
the church that's what was left of the
Armenian community last time I was there
early this year I discovered that
activists in Turkey had collected have a
foundation which had rebuilt the church
rebuilt the Armenian Church was trying
to reconstruct the truth about what
happened and also the remnants of the
Armenian community these are very
significant development when took a look
at the knowing anything about this the
enormous protests at Times Square were
not that much of a surprise very brave
courageous brutally repressed was he
very not a surprise another element of
this is a Turkish bear in mind is the
striking fact about Turkey is it the
only country I know where the inlet with
leading intellectuals leading writers
artists journalists academics publishers
are constantly have constantly been
protesting the atrocities of the crimes
and not in protesting but engaged in
active resistance against them facing
imprisonment and sometimes enduring it
that's not a lot of fun but they keep
going no matter how bad the impression
was I don't have any other country like
that it's very impressive and a lesson
and in fact all of this I think teachers
teaches us a lot Americans here that we
could learn about a Rome record what
it's actually like what we've been doing
in the world and also what can be done
to change other much harsher conditions
than we end
