the the one on torture that I meant the
inhuman integrate well it's just a
general thing about prisoners being
given humane treatment having the right
of that that doesn't talk about
prisoners of war that's internal
prisoners like the prisoners in your own
society actually the United States has
condemned quite a lot for this also by
Human Rights Watch one of the condom
nations of the United States is actually
also involves article 8 of the
Constitution the one against cruel and
what's truly inhuman punishment or
something like that that has to do with
the sentencing laws the United States
has extremely strained
well not strange but unusual sentencing
laws I think they're explicable so for
example there's a big report of Human
Rights Watch that came you know the
major human rights monitor that came out
recently about u.s. sentencing
provisions it dealt specifically with
New York State but it's general in New
York State and this is quite general the
sentence for being found within with
possession of marijuana is the same as
for a rape rape of a child you know
burning down a house trying to try to
kill ten people and a whole bunch of
other crimes those crimes are the same
in terms of sentencing as having some
marijuana in your pocket well you know
this this is Human Rights Watch and
civil liberties groups condemned this as
a violation of article 8 of the
Constitution but also the Universal
Declaration which calls for appropriate
sentencing for crimes now you know
possession of marijuana whatever you
think about it it's it doesn't harm
anyone in fact fact is it doesn't even
harm the person who uses it much it's
probably no worse than having a cup of
coffee as far as its medical evidence is
concerned but the but in a van it
certainly doesn't harm anybody else you
know on the other hand say smoking a
cigarette that does harm other people
and there's no crime for that in fact
you look at the sentencing provisions
they're very striking how they work you
may notice this morning the Supreme
Court refused
to accept the case on discriminatory
sentencing provisions this is from the
sentencing the judges who set up the
sentencing project in Washington or try
to set sentences have argued for a
revision in the law because the
penalties for powder cocaine are for
crack cocaine or a hundred times as high
as for powder cocaine though it's the
same facts and everything else but its
class and race difference powder cocaine
is what they use in the rich suburbs you
know when you come back from the
stockbrokers office or whatever it is
crack cocaine is what they use in the
black ghetto and the sentences are about
a hundred times as high that runs across
on all sorts of things so the the major
cause of the major kind of killing of
people in the United States I mean
they're straight homicides but the one
that ranks right alongside it is driving
under the influence of alcohol that's
about the same as homicide the number of
deaths driving under the influence gets
extremely low penalties the penalty for
possession of drugs is about I think
twenty times as high or something like
that as driving under the influence well
just look at who's picked up driving
under the influence about ninety percent
white okay drugs the ones they pick up
are overwhelmingly blacks not because
they use drugs more attack they use
drugs at about the same level as white
but the laws and the police procedures
and so on are directed mainly against
the poor communities black communities
so these are radical violations of
conventions that call for equality of
sentencing you know appropriateness of
sentencing relation of a crime to the
way you're treated and so on and so
forth and the u.s. is repeatedly
condemned for that we're kind of off the
map on this one so in at the crime level
in the United States is not unlike other
industrial countries contrary to what
people believe the United States it's
kind of toward the high end but not over
the limit the only exception to this is
killings with guns on this the United
States
off the map but that's because of our
gun laws which nobody else says so in
other countries you know if people get
mad at each other they don't know punch
each other or something here they take
out an assault rifle and kill everybody
in sight so there are there are
differences in that but in every other
in other crimes the United States is
pretty much like other industrial
countries kind of toward the high end on
the other hand the name Carson and it
was an incarceration to you go back to
1980 the percentage of the population in
prison was roughly like other industrial
countries again toward the high end
since 1980 it's gone out of sight the
u.s. past South Africa past Russia it's
now competing approximately with China
for nobody knows the exact Chinese
figures so it's a rough estimate but
it's far out of line with any industrial
country and it's mostly drugs including
possession and it's mostly aimed at the
what are called the dangerous classes
you know poor people black people that
kind of thing in fact the number of
blacks the percentage of blacks from
cities in prison in major cities like
Washington and so on last figures I saw
was about twice as high as the
proportion of Russians in the gulag at
the peak of Stalin's last year's pretty
astonishing plenty of stuff in the
criminology literature about it well
it's pretty hard to reconcile these
things with the international
conventions or even the Constitution
who should not be well if if we want to
imprison people for crimes the worst
crimes are white-collar crimes so
corporate crimes are way beyond anything
like this and those people aren't in
prison at all I don't particularly think
they should be you know like I'm not
saying they ought to be in prison but
certainly things like possession of
marijuana shouldn't be a crime in fact
the u.s. agrees with that if you look at
the history of say take marijuana it's
very revealing the peak use of marijuana
in the United States peak use was in the
late 1970s incarceration was at the
lowest level in the nineteen seventies
although is technically illegal then the
use of marijuana started to go down and
incarceration started to go up for
possession of marijuana same laws what
happened well you know think about it
who was using marijuana in the late 70s
white middle class white kids who are
sons and daughters of lawyers you know
doctors and that kind of people you
don't throw those people in jail I mean
for them you have rehabilitation and
education and you know the rest and so
on and so forth
so the use of marijuana went peaked but
the incarceration plunged in the 80s
something happened among educated
sectors of the population there started
to be start in the early 80s a decline
in the use of any kind of substance
marijuana cocaine liquor tobacco red
meat you know anything all of this stuff
started to go down and you all know the
reasons you live in the middle of it but
it didn't go down among poor sectors in
fact it's a it's sort of sable so when
you called the drug war around nineteen
late 80s it was obvious from the trend
lines that you were going to pick up
poor black people okay and that's when
the harsh penalizing began
this was recognized at the time it was
pointed out right at the time you know
way up high Daniel Moynihan making a
speech in the Senate that these
decisions are simply criminalizing poor
people mostly black people yeah that's
what they were so whatever this stuff is
about it doesn't have anything to do
with crimes no you know what should you
do with people if you're seriously
interested in crime you treat it the way
it's treated in most countries the
United States is extremely rare and
treating crime is a political issue you
know and in the other industrial
countries candidates don't stand up
saying I'm going to be tougher on crime
than you are you know that's in a u.s.
thing in fact a rather recent us thing
in most countries this treat is a
problem okay so you try to figure out
how to deal with it and it involves the
conditions that create crime okay the
best ways of dealing with people who
have committed crimes rehabilitation and
education takes eight drugs it's well
known study after study shows that
educational programs are far more
effective than criminalization programs
in fact the drop in the trend lines that
they just mentioned chose it but no
money goes very little money goes into
that goes into criminalization these are
social policies designed to get rid of
the control the dangerous classes that's
the standard term used in the
criminological literature they've got
much to do with punishing people also
with frightening everybody else so like
fear of crime is enormous in the United
States even though crime is more or less
like other countries well yeah it's a
way of control the rest of the
population by frightening them social
policy after all as directed for the
last twenty years or so to harming the
majority of the population like around
maybe eighty percent of the population
in the United States has seen their
incomes either stagnate or decline for
about twenty years while a tiny sector
is getting super-rich it's becoming to
look kind of like a third world
country well that makes people unhappy
you know and you don't want them to look
at who's getting rich you know who's
responsible what you want them to do is
look somewhere else and there aren't a
lot of ways to do that everybody hits on
the same ways usually get people to hate
each other and be afraid of each other
and you know that sort of thing yeah we
that's the way our propaganda system
works too I mean just you know that's
Willie Horton and Ronald Reagan's
fraudulent welfare mothers and all that
kind of stuff okay it's standard every
propaganda system works like this and
crime plays that kind of role for us but
if you're seriously interested in the
problems look at the problems these
things aren't aimed at the problems
