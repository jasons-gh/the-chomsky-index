well just personal aside my political
activism started the 1930s I won't go
into the details but my first political
article was on the rise of fascism in
Europe 1939 but then it went on from
there
the Vietnam War was the first public
open visible activism beyond locally the
protest against the Vietnam War was very
much too late it should have begun
actually it should have begun in the
early 50s but at least it should have
begun in 1961 and 62 when the Kennedy
administration sharply escalated the war
with the US Air Force participating
directly in bombing South Vietnam
chemical warfare at the destroy crops
ground cover and so on authorization of
napalm it was pretty extreme that's when
it sort of started it didn't the I mean
I happened to become active that but
there were very few people the talks I
was giving there were a couple of people
in a church or something like that it
finally in many parts of the country
began to develop it really took
significant shape by 1967 or so much too
late but significant at that time there
was also significant resistance well
beyond purposed personally it was much
involved in that and it had an effect it
not enough of an effect Indochina was
virtually destroyed I mean was a
destruction was extraordinary but could
have been worse probably would have
could have lived in nuclear attacks and
so on so there's some constraints
imposed and we even have some evidence
about what the constraints were no time
to go into it but it belated but
significant and it had an effect on the
country that was if one effect was a
general opposition to aggression and
state violence which has manifested
itself over and over since it's not
discussed in the media
it's barely discussed in the scholarly
literature that's not the kind of thing
you want people to know but it's there
so for example in the earth when the
Reagan administration came in they
determined right away that they wanted
to carry out a war in Central America to
try to crush the popular movements there
and they tried to emulate what Kennedy
did almost step-by-step same white paper
the same propaganda you know it's I
don't know firstly we don't have records
but I assume they were just looking at
it and doing the same thing didn't work
in the Kennedy case it worked
there was no protest it was in the
Reagan case it immediately elicited
massive protest popular churches
elsewhere and they had to back off and
instead of directly attacking Central
America they had to carry out what
amounted to an international terrorist
war using security forces that they
organized in the countries and also
enlisting an international terrorist
apparatus so for example in Guatemala
which was the worst case Congress
blocked Reagan from directly supporting
the massacres which actually amounted to
genocide in the islands so the Reagan
administration had to bring in enlist
international terrorists to do it
primarily Israel which is always willing
to perform that test they sent arms
trainers and so on to expedite the
genocide elective --'tis of the
Guatemalan army still take a look at the
the equipment it still Israeli equipment
that Taiwan was another one that was
brought in Argentine neo-nazis were
enlisted until Argentina the
dictatorship was overthrown they
couldn't use those anymore
they were the favor of the Reagan
raishin and it devastated Central
America but nothing like Vietnam let's
go go on what about Iraq case of Iraq
was I think the first time in the
history of imperialism went in war of
aggression which of course is what it
was an imperial war of aggression was
massively protested before it was
officially launched which is very
unusual now it didn't stop the war and
the standard line is it failed I don't
think it failed the Bush administration
couldn't even begin to do the kinds of
things that Kennedy and Johnson did
almost reflexively because there was no
protest so it was bad not practically
destroyed Iraq it's set off sectarian
conflicts that are tearing the region to
shreds but again could have been a lot
worse so I think the general answer is
well too late through little but
significant and over time developing the
opposition to aggression and violence
which has some constraining effect on
natural tendencies of power systems to
resort to violence at will and they do
have this tendency it's entirely open
and public so it takes a year on today
across the spectrum
virtually everyone from the president
through the intellectual class asserts
openly publicly and with pride that if
we determine that Iran is doing
something we don't like we will
unilaterally resort resort to force to
stop it that's that's announcing loudly
as we can the we're a rogue state we
don't care about international law
international opinion anything we
monopolize the sources of violence and
we'll use them when we choose and
there's no protest about this virtually
nothing way at the fringes maybe
so
