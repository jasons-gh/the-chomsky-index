the trump phenomenon i was wondering if
you could expand a little on that
and tell us some of the long-term
consequences we will have
if trump is indeed put in office if
trump is in office
yes sir well first we have to ask
whether he means what he's saying
i don't know you know i assume that
he means what he's saying if he does
not only we but the human species
is in very deep trouble i'll
come back again to global warming that
is a
hugely significant phenomenon i mean we
are now
in a situation where the warming
of the planet is proceeding at a level
about
maybe a hundred some claim a thousand
times as high
as anything in history that can be
checked
way back in early pretty long pre-human
history nothing remotely like it
a sea level rise is now at a level
beyond anything that's gone on for
thousands of years
the effects of global warming are
already extremely severe
uh the uh simply in destruction of
species
species destruction now is at the level
of
65 million years ago when a huge
asteroid hit the earth ended the age of
the dinosaurs
of a huge destruction of species that's
what's happening right now
and it's accelerating at the
latitude where you and i live
roughly this temperate latitude we are
now
moving south 10 meters a day
just by the average effect of global
warming
and that's going to accelerate these are
things with
really lethal consequences now what is
the republican party doing
trump in particular uh there was there
was a conference in paris
last december which tried
an international conference we tried to
set
some uh policies to prevent
the global warming before it destroys us
it made some progress not anywhere near
enough
but the goal was to
reach a treaty among the countries of
the world
where they would commit themselves to
these measures inadequate measures but
at least some
couldn't be implemented very simple
reason
the republican congress would not accept
it so therefore there was no
treaty just verbal commitments
just a couple of weeks ago the
republican majority on the supreme court
sharply violated precedent
to block measures
limited measures to reduce
the extensive pollution from coal plants
well that's a message to the world and
that message is heard
saying don't bother doing anything
because the united states is not going
to allow it
it's because of the republican party
going back to trump
he simply says it's not happening so i'm
not going to do anything about it
so that's quite apart from other
policies he's advocated some of which
are really
hair raising like what he said about
torture
he said fine let's torture people in
fact the kind of torture that's outlawed
by
international law and became an
international scandal
waterboarding he says that's the least
of it let's do more
let's keep all muslims out of the
country
let's build a wall or rather let's get
mexico to build a wall
to prevent people from fleeing into the
united states
where are they fleeing from incidentally
most of them from central america
where they're fleeing from the results
of
our policies which that severely harmed
central america in time to go to the
details and we go through the rest of it
it's pretty frightening
that's why the world is frightened i
mean long before this couple of years
before this
uh the global opinion
regarded the united states as the
greatest threat to world peace
that's a gallup poll
american-run polls show that the world
has regarded the us as the gravest
threat to world peace by a large margin
incidentally
the americans don't know about this
because it wasn't reported here though
it should have been
right now the spectacle of the
republican primaries is
frightening people around the world
justifiably
the forces try you can kind of
comprehend the reasons
why uh people are flocking to trump's
banner these are the classes of people
for whom
uh uh the death rates mortality is
actually increasing
they see themselves as having their
lives taken away from their dignity
taken away the possibilities for the
future
taken away so they're rallying behind
that banner
things like that have happened before in
the past and as i mentioned the outcomes
were not pretty
so i think that's what we can
fairly anticipate now not entirely
because he's kind of a wild guard
he says all sorts of things some of them
make sense some of them are crazy
it's hard to know what he means but you
know
the us is an extremely powerful state
to have somebody who's kind of a wild
man
uh with his finger on the button that
could destroy the world
namely the nuclear weapons button where
he could make decisions of
an enormous influence i think is a very
frightening prospect
you want the truth my own feeling is
that his main competitor ted cruz is
even more dangerous
