yeah the last question I wanted to ask
you
Bertrand Russell who I understand is
well-regarded in your eyes was once
asked suppose this film was gonna be
looked at by our descendants in a
thousand years time would you think it's
worth it to tell that generation I know
you're not one for grand statements or
anything like that but do you want to
take a stab at that question well he
sure I would tell them if you're alive
and hearing this it's a miracle because
you're not so remote ancestors we're
acting in a way which was condemning you
and everyone else to do well on that on
that note No thank you very much for
your time
real pleasure doctor sorry we couldn't
be faced types hey no worries
