you were anywhere near the brain
sciences are aware of that there's a
huge project now a government project in
the United States to map the human brain
you know find out all the neuronal
connections of those tend to the pins
and rungs and somehow some kind of magic
is going to come out of that it a chance
that anything will come out of it is
pretty slight I mean it takes a insect
much easier study than humans like a bee
for example has about eight hundred
thousand neurons as a brain the size of
a grass seed there's a couple hundred
species a lot of comparative evidence
there's a gestation period of about
three days you can you know you can grow
them raising the way you like you can do
any kind of experiment you like you
don't have to have a consent for them if
you so it's a perfect perfect object of
inquiry nobody understands how the bees
brain is doing these extremely complex
that computational tasks that humans
can't perform the bees can do all kinds
of navigation that we can only do with
instruments how do they do it with this
tiny little brain well it's a very hard
problem
it hasn't been solved there are some of
the leading scientists in the field
they've like Rodolfo Lena we might know
NYU for years has been studying one
neuro is a big neuron in the giant squid
and he's been studying that neuron to
try to figure out how on earth does it
distinguish between a predator and food
let's say that turns out to be a very
hard problem I mentioned that there's a
huge literature on what's called
evolution of the language that take a
look at the literature on evolution of
be communication a vastly simpler topic
literature because scientists understand
it's just too hard okay getting back to
the brain project suppose you could map
all the neuronal connections of these
into the tenth neurons
what would you know probably nothing you
may not even be looking at the right
thing there's all kinds of things going
on in the brain apart from the Romo
connections just getting a lot of data
and the you know statistics and so on in
itself just doesn't tell you anything
um that's been the fate of the genome
project there were lots of expectations
at first a lot of propaganda about how
when you decoded the genome we'd have
wonderful curious world honor diseases
and so on well you know it's a valuable
project things have been learned but the
the transition from a genome to an
organism is extremely complex and
knowing the genome doesn't doesn't
answer how it happens
