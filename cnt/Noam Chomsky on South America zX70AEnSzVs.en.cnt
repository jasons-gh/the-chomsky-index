surely a major issue Venezuela has been
throw the US kicked Britain out of
Venezuela he years ago under Wilson just
at the point when the and US wasn't a
big global power at that time usually
was stuck around the Caribbean but the
first big move in the Western Hemisphere
was Venezuela and they got rid of the
British because they knew it was going
to be an oil producer I mean and then
the US was by far the main oil producer
but they're thinking ahead and that
continues I mean Venezuela remains since
around 1970 it's been the primary source
for external support for oil and yeah
Colombia's got the substantial resources
you know it's not Venezuela or Saudi
Arabia but it's kind of like Central
Asia that's significant and the same is
true of Raziel they're counting on the
Brazilian oil and possibly Ecuador and
you know there's no doubt that that's an
issue how big an issue you can alright
you but you look at the funding I mean
you know better than I do so I have to
tell you but the funding a lot of it
goes to protecting the oil pipelines you
know just training the forces to protect
the pipeline's at the count as far as
the how and the other that's a big piece
of the potential oil resources and just
not just oil but everything else too I
mean gold emeralds all kind of resources
they're actually the place where I was
we correspondent about this and Kalka in
the south part of the reason for driving
the peasant out is because of other is
there's a dynamic oil there but there's
just other resources including coal ones
only if you drive the peasants out of
the mountains you can strip my in the
mountains and apparently the coals very
high quality and like to be right around
Boston I'm not my daughter happens to be
in the Latin Americanist to kind of
political activist who works on she's
not working mostly on Colombia but where
she teaches a working-class college near
Boston they've
set up a sister city project fisa set up
a sister city project between a town and
we're at Columbia and go here on we're
because that's the source for the coal
that's used for a highly polluting power
plant and the town where she lives and
everybody hates the power plant so that
was a way to organize people in a poor
working-class town we don't think about
international affairs for Columbia
supports committee pretty well so
there's this kind of thing going on and
as far as the counter hegemonic bloc is
concerned I it's got to be a big issue
in the planning sections in the US the
Shirley upset about it and you can see
what happened in Brazil you know they
very quickly even before the election
they made sure that Lula is not going to
be able to follow the you know the
decision of the Democratic vote I mean
they were right away before the election
there's a big attack on the rail you
know went way down interest rates had to
shoot astronomically high growth stops
capital flows out of the country and
that's the main point of neoliberalism
the main point of neo that doesn't do
anything for the economy probably heart
arms it even harms profit but it does
undermine democracy it's a terrific tool
for undermining democracy that was
understood by Keynes and white back in
1945 that's why the Bretton Woods system
was based on capital control because
they understood that there's no other
way to allow governments to pursue
social democratic policy support for
them was enormous at the time so yeah
and that led to a huge period of great
economic growth the best in history and
also welfare state programs around much
of the world you know with egalitarian
growth in the early seventies when they
dismantled that system was completely
understood that this is simply going to
reverse the process it'll undermine the
threat of democratic governments and you
can see it playing out in Brazil just
dramatically
I mean the big Democratic majority you
know committed
decent guy he's right back following the
Cardozo programs and you can't blame
them there's nothing much else he could
do except declare a revolution or
something
and at the st. yeah it seems happening
and in Venezuela as they're moving right
onto the military coup forty years from
now we may get some documents saying
that you know the u.s. is sponsoring a
military coup but you can just see it
playing out on the streets day after day
Ecuador has a major US military base now
it's been put in sort of quietly but
it's there Peru is going to be the same
Argentina I don't know what they're
going to do with Argentina it's kind of
there's a lot of popular organizing
going on they're only takeover of plants
building up with them in a kind of a
popular economy
it's got to be a concern that from
Argentina up to Venezuela although
there's extreme unrest I mean it's kind
of interesting to compare it let's say
forty years ago so when Brazil did have
a populist president back in the early
60s cooler and at that time the
technique for stopping it was just a
military coup so Kennedy and Johnson
administration was carried out a
military coup that was the first big
national security state and Latin
America this time they don't have to do
it personally probably can't because the
military probably couldn't do it but
they don't also have to because Clinton
provided them with the techniques of
control namely neoliberal financial
liberalisation and privatization and
that's enough I mean unless there's a
real revolution so the effects of these
programs you know people have talked
about a lot about the move the popular
movements have talked like here you know
I've talked about the economic effects
which are real you know if those who
aren't people it destroys the
environment and so on but the main
effect is just undermine democracy it
eliminates the possibility of democratic
