I
you go back to say the mid 19th century
there was there was a very lively
independent working-class press run by
young women from the farms called
factory girls artisans from the town you
know shoemakers Irish immigrants and so
on and it's interesting reading I mean
they very bitterly condemned what they
called 150 years ago the new spirit of
the age gain wealth forgetting all but
self that's the doctrine of the modern
system and they recognized that they
condemned it it was the new spirit of
the age then they said it was totally
dehumanizing they did not want to be the
kind of people who would gain wealth
forgetting all of itself namely what
they taught to be and by now a huge
indoctrination system tries to force
them to be they regarded it is degrading
destructive of culture of independence
of freedom they described themselves as
being the subjects of a monarca calor
feudal system losing their rights as
Americans
