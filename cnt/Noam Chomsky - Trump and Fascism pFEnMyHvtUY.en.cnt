I think it does Trump too much credit to
call them neo-fascist but to be a
neo-fascist you have to have an ideology
as far as I can see as ideology is
simply me hmm I mean there are forces
that he's awakened I mean they're not a
really awakened they're already there
but kind of opened the door for which
are pretty dangerous but I don't think I
mean in my feeling at least the spread
of neo-fascism is much greater in Europe
where it has a history of basis
institutional basis could come back I
think what's happening here is somewhat
different I think it's it is pretty much
what Jason Deaton's pointed out
desperation there people there's all
kind of factors one factor is eventual
Christianity which is a huge phenomenon
in the United States and it hasn't been
it's become essentially the base of the
Republican Party now the Republican
Party went so far to the right that they
can't get votes on their actual policies
nobody did not vote for the Ryan
legislative program so they've had to
mobilize people on other grounds
nationalists ultra-religious and so on
and that's nuts there but a large part
of the slight swing and I was pretty
slight in the last election was a
working class lower middle class not a
very poor about people who have lost
their hope their dignity their sense of
self-worth and see the whole world as
against
they're being attacked from below by
worthless people who as they see it or
being helped by the federal government
attacked from above by the rich people
are taking everything don't have jobs
their social status is gone
mortality is increasing desperation is
increasing I said they turned to their
class enemy where else are they going to
go the Democratic Party abandoned the
working class forty years ago in fact a
lot of these people voted for Obama
believing the rhetoric about hope and
change no hope no change by 2010 that
right here in Massachusetts that was
already a reversal a lot of Union
households voted for brown in 2010 and
the Kennedy you know and then on the
seat that Kennedy had it was quite a
change and the studies of their voting
showed that a lot of it was just anger
at Obama he was attacking their the
rights that they had struggled for like
health friends and he wasn't doing
anything for them so they turned to
brown this time they turned to trump
what's gonna be interesting to see and
could lead to something like new fascism
I think is what will happen when the con
game collapses sooner or later working
people are going to see that the
programs that are being instituted or
directed against them
case by case you know it's kind of
hidden behind the bluster but if you
take a look at the programs the Ryan
style programs exactly what the
- sooner or later that games going to
collapse and then what happens
probably scapegoating maybe some wild
action may be the kind of thing that
could inspire some kind of ultra-right
xenophobic movement
