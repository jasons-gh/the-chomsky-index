bradley manning is should be regarded as
a hero he's doing what an honest decent
citizen ought to be doing letting the
population know what you're doing for
people who rule you are doing they want
to keep it secret of course I just like
the trans-pacific trade agreement they
don't want order like Obama's programs
they don't want it what they're doing
known for good reasons the public has a
right to know what's being done to them
by their so-called elected
representatives not really for all kind
of reasons but and Bradley Manning's
hoping and do it there's a principle
that he's violating namely that power
has to be protected from scrutiny it's
the principle of every dictatorship of
every autocracy I couldn't hear it from
high priests of Harvard and the
government department the power has to
be kept secret otherwise it will fade
and won't work but Bradley Manning's
violating that printer Noam Chomsky
thanks so much for sitting in with us
for just a little bit here at RIT TV
