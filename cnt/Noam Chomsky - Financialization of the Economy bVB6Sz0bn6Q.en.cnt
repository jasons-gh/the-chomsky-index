the economy's changed dramatically in
the last 35 years there's been a major
process of conscious process of
financialization of the economy and kind
of exporting of productive industry
that's very conscious and this is not
particularly obscure why by about that
time it was possible to make more profit
in shenanigans of money manipulation
than in doing anything productive and in
market societies and people with capital
go for what's profitable the one car
Lloyd that was that the political
pressures just dismantled the regulatory
apparatus with the support of economists
incidentally working with economic
theories that I mean it's astonishing
that they're not ashamed of themselves
but anyway that's what happened one
consequence of this one aspect of it is
that for roughly thirty years a little
over that for the majority of the
population wages have real wages a
pretty close to stagnated a little
growth but not much that's most of the
population families get by with two
husband and wife working we have very
limited support systems as compared to
the other country so that means families
are in trouble and that shows up in all
kind of ways people who you can keep
your income up by asset inflation you
know just and by debt the asset
inflation of course can't last so you
have repeated bubbles of collapsing the
last one was an eight trillion dollar
housing bubble which amazingly almost no
economists could see I mean the
trendline and housing prices is going
way beyond a hundred year record there
was no reason for it was obviously going
to burst that's every note that's the
assets of most people they're in trouble
people are in deep trouble you know not
trouble like Central Africa but that's
not the way you evaluate your
circumstance
you ask how and I what should I be able
to have in a rich country like this so
if people and they also see us
ostentatious wealth it's quite striking
that the for for a while after the
financial collapse the super-rich were
kind of playing it cool you know so they
weren't not to try to not be too
ostentatious doesn't look nice but now
it's over the New York Times a couple
days ago had a front page article saying
describing exactly this phenomenon you
know back to great parties a gala events
showing off how rich rich we are another
article in the same issue said corporate
profits of broken records banks have so
much money they don't what to do with it
well you know people may not know the
details but they can see this and they
can see what's happening in their own
lives in manufacturing industry
unemployment's about at the rate of the
Great Depression and much an old I'm old
enough to remember that and it was bad
but there was a kind of hopefulness
there's I know my relatives are mostly
unemployed workers but you know they
were not desperate they were poor but
not desperate because it looked like
something could happen we could do
things together there's a better future
my seamstress ants who were unemployed
we're in the garment workers union and
they got some benefits from that and
they also felt that also some
educational programs cultural programs
they felt that we can get out of this
working together people don't feel that
now and those manufacturing jobs are not
coming back not unless we have quite a
different social order here there's
plenty of need for them in fact what's
happening in this respect is sometimes
almost surreal like for example that the
government effectively owned most of the
auto industry for a while and the
policies they were pursuing was closing
down plants just like GM had been doing
at the same moment the Obama's
Transportation Secretary was in Europe
that traveling around in Spain trying to
get contracts using stimulus money for
Spanish factories to produce high-speed
transport for the United States which we
desperately need as anyone has taken the
train here in those that's a these
things could be produced very well in
Michigan and Indiana may be not
profitable for the bankers but certainly
good for the workforce in the
communities but that doesn't even
considered an option I'm in green
technology which is supposed to be the
expanding area go to China they go to
Spain go to Germany I mean investors in
the United States last figures I saw are
investing I think about twice as much in
China as they are in the United States
and Europe combined and in Germany Spain
France there's substantial and China
presumably be the leader and if it isn't
already and wind and solar technology
that can't that be done here sure can in
fact a lot of the high-technology the
innovations and the ideas come from here
but they're produced there you know
China is kind of like an assembly plant
which that were you the surrounding
industrial area in the United States
assemble the products that come back
here that we buy but it could be
produced here that takes different
social policies and as long as policies
in the hands of financial institutions
and corporate production corporations
like say General Electric GM which are
themselves financial institutions a lot
of their business you know they make
plenty of money if it's done somewhere
else
