actually the organization that's posting
you this morning technology and culture
organism celebrated its 50th anniversary
thank you for that and it's an
independent organization of faculty
students and staff that attempt to
address social political issues and
science technology that academic
departments won't touch university
administration well know that the reason
this is an independent group has to do
the fact of the Episcopal Diocese of
Massachusetts that it makes your
physical chaplaincy and MIT support this
work colleague will Johnson
SE mi tia is very complicated history
inspection ecuador went to the dropping
of the bomb on hiroshima nagasaki many
of the manhattan project that his sister
its first university california
university chicago demo team among the
group that came to MIT Victor busco the
parson many of you will remember his
colleagues in Scientific American are
not fellow who found it in the air to
the Atomic Scientists that group decided
that the development of nuclear weapons
head that's all instead and so they
maintained a kind of providing a base
for our nuclear disarmament presence on
the campus during the period in which
MIT was even for number one for the
number to do Pentagon University
contractor at Johns Hopkins physics lat
30 or 40 40 years and it's that history
provided some of the women here today
and then also do the resistance towards
what we need is American the sakowskis
cuz well known in those let me say that
we owe streak that lets you see the
concession it is still difficult to
raise these issues on the campus we
could oh great dead Massachusetts peace

Massachusetts global action and the
Democratic socialists of America thank
you to our sponsors
my friends is time for a change u.s.
foreign policy is mired in unsustainable
paradigm of worldwide military dominance
with force as an option of first resort
Washington seeks to act as the world's
policeman but the world did not choose
the United States is this policeman and
so this strategy causes insecurity and
resentment over the United States as the
United States tries to impose its will
tries to settle problems that are none
of his business a more restrained former
policy would more would be more
democratic and will cost less freeing up
attention and resources for our people's
needs the peace movement has spent the
last 13 years resisting the US wars in
Iraq Afghanistan and is now closing the
new mideast war on Isis we've exposed
nuclear weapons threat to human service
we've organized against us support for
the occupation of Palestine leave a post
secret drone warfare but to turn around
u.s. foreign policy we would need to
have a much broader movement than we
have built so far the traditional peace
movement cannot do it alone actually the
foreign policy is everyone's problem and
the issues go far beyond questions of
war peace new liberal Neal the world
globalization is a problem for the labor
movement it's a key driver of economic
inequality us resistance to global
climate negotiations is a problem for
the climate justice movement
neoliberalism is the structure of third
world living standards causes mass
emigration our government's resistance
to human rights treaties and its failure
to support the UN is a problem for the
women's movement for the GLBT movement
at the human rights advocates the
medical community needs a foreign policy
if it is going to deal with problems
with the Ebola outbreak and the national
security
state that we constructed to police the
world is now resorting to torture
surveillance of American citizens and
militarization of the domestic police
and our huge military budgets at over 1
million dollars a year are sucking their
resources all of these people's
movements need to address the needs of
our people so the so what port positive
do we need the former housekeeper off is
based on five basic values democracy we
don't want a foreign policy may by
elites created and secret we need
democratic control of our policy hes
numa national cooperation we need to
respect other nations and we need to
build collective security but justice we
can't accept unjust power structures and
we must respect international look human
rights we have to uphold the full range
of human rights and apply them to our
own society as well as joined in
promoting human rights worldwide and
sustainability we need to live in
harmony with the earth we must promote
climate justice and build a sustainable
time
and we'll find these five values if we
wrote a one-page summary called the
foreign policy for all that a glance and
same practice so you applying these five
values there and you'll also find the
basic policies of the fourth houses at
all nuclear disarmament we should
immediately start multinational t
federal negotiations leading to the
abolition of all nuclear weapons i'ma
justice we need an urgent national
effort to reverse climate change to
support green economic development in
less developed countries we need to
strengthen international law and
international organizations we need to
perform the u-men we need to sign on to
international course leads ratified
dozens of treaties international
treaties that the United States has
ratified in some cases is one of only
two or three nations in the world to not
trapped by some of these treaties we
should sign up to the five principles
that duck that were enunciated by the
non-aligned movement sovereignty
non-aggression non-interference equality
and mutual benefit and peaceful
coexistence these are good Maxim's to
guide relations on our countries
non-intervention we should renounce
pre-emptive strikes humanitarian
interventions if they're needed must be
led by can reform and democratic united
nations not by a soft selective about
countries peacebuilding abroad and at
home we should support international
grassroots efforts nation-states can't
do everything civil society can do a lot
we should protect the global Commons the
oceans the atmosphere outer space and
the polar zone a distributive property
of automated demilitarization we should
reduce not very spending by fifty
percent or more
both are always these bases we have over
1000 military bases around the world now
the country has anywhere to them we
should refocus the vision of our
military on defense of our national
territory and on participating in Ulan
measures we should ratify the arms trade
treaty and shut down the international
arms trade on the United States is of
course we should contribute to
generously to world green economic and
social development and we should make
these changes in a just where we should
have a just transition the workers that
currently were on military industries
and fossil fuel industries should that
be asked to bed bear the burden of this
transition the companies should not the
workers create justice we should base
our trade policy on cooperation
solidarity sustainable development and
democratic scrutiny and we should change
our policy in a number of key regional
areas such as China Korea the Middle
East the Persian Gulf israel-palestine
Africa Cuba Venezuela commercial islands
Nick Joe and more so they don't let the
foreign policy for all we will have to
confront corporate control corporate
control of foreign policy beans that
nations that do not fall into line based
economic ostracism and in some cases
military threats and attacks
multinational corporations think clover
they have a worldwide market they have a
worldwide production system this phone
parts of it were made in 50 different
countries Apple computer is an example
of any of the transnational corporation
for one country they built through the
entire world and that's when entire
world is a global market for the point
of view of the economic elite just
remain as one integrated marketing it's
us are forces that are called on to do
the guarantor our last resort the nation
was to leave that system that's wrong
the other big problem is the national
security state the Pentagon on the
National Security Council the State
Department the CIA NSA and congressional
leadership make policy in secret and are
hardly at all accountable to the
democratic institutions that are
supposed to control our own left there's
important by the military-industrial
complex he think tanks and academic
allies the media also plays a key role
in shaping the narrative and seven the
policy to the public we have to overturn
a grip of these is entrenched
institutions on our foreign policy
prevent implement policy for all the
foreign policy for all is only one part
of a people's agenda that is bringing
together pannu muke new labor movement
people of color immigrants women LGBT
people ex-prisoners environmentalists
community activists civil libertarians
and more and abroad progressive
coalition popular struggles are rising
against corporate abuses against this
extreme inequality about social
injustice racism money in politics
campaigns against those abuses are
joining with campaigns against an
unpopular Bork's killer drones nuclear
pollution surveillance wires happy
militarization of police mass
incarceration and
racial profiling these combined
movements will rise or fall together
because all our ultimately struggling
against the same corporate interests
that control our economy and politics
for the benefit of the one percent to
win a foreign policy bro we'll take the
United power of these progressive social
movements all working together so today
we are asking for your feedback on these
ideas speakers and workshops will dig
deeper into the specifics there's an
evaluation form in your packet switch s
for your comments there's also an online
forum because submit your comments in
the winter we will hold local discussion
meetings in several parts of
Massachusetts to get more input for a
policy for all after we collate and
integrate all your comments and input we
hope to update the foreign policy for
all statement and submitted to the
Massachusetts peace action annual
meeting in February will hopefully be
amended and passed as organizational
document and other of the coast
wrestling organizations will be working
with the four philosopher all in their
own way after that we hope to take these
ideas national to present them at
several national conferences next year
such as the people's mobilization for
the planet and and to abolish nuclear
weapons that is scheduled in New York on
April 24 26 I think their fires fires
with that outside okay um shoot
supposed to reminds me of the time left
for the day I haven't gotten funding
credits okay we're going to start with
the presentations by Noam Chomsky and go
Fletcher and they will be moderated by
Drew the black after that we'll have the
first workshop session and indian
actresses a list of workshops one
workshop has been added at the last
minute it wasn't in your packet it will
be in the morning session in room four
dash 145 and it will be on kind of
recruiting work in the highs in the
Chelsea high school experiences from
from working on smelters come on you
high and chelsea f the workshops are in
a variety of rooms around the MIT campus
unfortunately some of them are a bit of
a hike so there's a map in your hand in
your packages that shows you where those
buildings are but once you figure out
like workshop you're going to figure out
what building extent and follow the
signs the book how to get through the
workshops one of them is on the third
floor this book but most of the rooms
are buildings and so all those other
buildings you go out it's this door this
dope and enter your building a cross not
away and you will start to see signs
that directly to those bubbles lunch
will be at 12 45 it will be on the third
floor of this building and then we'll be
back here after lunch for the afternoon
piano with Phyllis Bennis and Stephen
Kinzer and ma Godiva while I recognize
it will have the second round of
workshops we're in the same list of
rooms and then we'll be back here for a
brief wrap up at the end of the day what
we're talking about the web Norwich
group this work bathrooms are to the
right enough to the elevator in that
direction once you leave the battery
room and the best unless I want to make
is that many of our presenters today
I've written books and then what's are
also able to purchase outside and many
of our presenters will also be able to
sign their goal this isn't what's your
body so i don't have to hand out in
front of me but that title but its
essence from counter recruitment work in
the chelsea high school for 145 that's a
bit too oh no no more this is building
34 it's a question of aragon you know
the plenary tough talks are being video
and i'll be available afterwards the
morning plenary will be shown on cable
average cable TV in the number of times
like a dozen times over the last couple
of months the afternoon would will not
people will be posted on YouTube club we
have no they've not made a richness to
record the workshops sorry yes well we
didn't do a very good job of giving the
numbers to the workshop some of the
documents the numbers of similar just
usernames it's on the back of the stage
its back on this schedule yeah on the
back of your schedule is the list of
workshops and each workshop has this
room
okay so now I'd like to turn over to
Judith of black Judith is a national
field director for peace action and she
is a veteran of many the progressive
struggles and organizations need before
peace action she was after the United
for peace justice forever here to us I
believe to two terms as national
coaching is that right and also estes
salesperson air so take it away dude so
I want to invite the panelists to join
me and open for you what's the tiny
referring to pee when do we end this
well I think there's a bit of time that
we could have planned to have this
conference because this is a moment
where there's a tremendous need for a
sense of urgency clarity and we need to
tweak some immediate action the
administration has doubled down on the
war in the wake of the elections we knew
the election results were that mean a
nuclide to escalate the war in Syria and
Iraq the little did we know that the
administration would announce this week
that they were doubling the number of
troops on the ground in Iraq and asking
for five billion dollars more on top of
the 85 billion that is already in the
pipeline for fighting wars so we know
that was not the answer to the crisis of
Isis and we are here together to spend a
day debating discussing and exploring
how fundamentally do you militarize u.s.
foreign policy so we're very loved the
piece option and the sponsoring
organizations organized this conference
and we are very lucky to start the day
with two speakers who are going to
reflect on the document little foreign
policy policy for all and then we will
have some time to discuss with them our
initial impressions of this government
and some of the questions that it's
tourism our two speakers they have
studied the trends of movement they
share a deep understanding of the
history of how the u.s. became the
biggest arms dealer and Worf maker on
this planet they both helped the peace
and justice movement from many many
years peel away the falsehoods of the
crisis in the Middle East and so today
they will reflect on this too lightly
document the panelists will speak for
picky in 20 minutes and then we will ask
all of you could jump into the down low
and join the discussion since we're
going to be discussing a 21st century
foreign policy we're going to get a 21st
century introduction of these panels so
if you don't know no Chomsky and Bill
Fletcher than Google go by the box
they're out there in the lobby no
Chomsky well you know he's an author
he's a teacher we sell a preacher peace
and justice you think he inspires us to
stay in it to win it to stay in it for
the long haul and when it when it comes
to ending endless wars that's what we
need a preacher who can give some
insight to keep us going along on Bill
Fletcher well I've seen up close and
personal that bill is not just a keen
observer of social movements he's a
hands-on activist leader he has the work
that he's done in the labor movement the
work that he's done to to strengthen and
build up the left in this country
fantastic but you don't know i'll fill
big fan of science fiction and frankly
the left should study more what goes on
in the science fiction about me bill
bill and I sure love Battlestar
Galactica out of here there is a stud
about militarism and what would happen
if we somehow lose mother earth and so
if he gets his speech with what say you
want no
love the dominant features of the
American self-image is what's called the
doctrine of American exceptionalism it's
fun ridicule but there is an element of
truth booth and portico the United
States is exceptional in many dimensions
and its power as well as natural
advantages and its security up in the
early years the United States will refer
to as the dangerous nation Quincy Adams
experience meant was that those near the
United States were in drugs they were as
pure Native Americans obviously United
States and Canada several times beaten
back by the British enemy sunny Florida
was conquered brutal Mexican surveys it
sees Texas Proctor half of Mexico and
what was described as one of history's
most women wars but General the
president this is his friend for the end
of the young officer 1898 whose power
expanded beyond the national territory
caribbean cuba rico y was sore from its
population portion job philippines are
invaded understand people killed the NSA
system surveillance
I Philippines control of the time
computers then ice technology that they
was used in berkeley replied back in the
united states rules Red Scare but the
United States face no authentic security
threats because the regions were
nominated it ruled but without series
embed it's interesting that the phrase
national security was almost never used
was not used really until the 1930s by
the 1930s the United States was becoming
a global power and the Middle East she
also heard and that means if its
dominance is threatened in green area of
our dreams world that becomes a matter
of national security and the concept
national security entered this first
president to use it scattered ways in
December 1941 worst US was the victim of
direct aggression but there are some
things that are useful to remember by
our standards Japan was entirely
justified in launching a preemptive
attack on military bases in two virtual
colonies which didn't do very well at
knew very well were being prepared for a
massive soft wood to burn out the
industrial part of the empire with fire
bomb attacks on the team and bamboo and
keeps upon xuan Kyushu and to set the
paper cities of Japan
fire hood plans that Japanese could read
in the American press that Franklin
Roosevelt was as he put it simply
delighted authorized our standards that
certainly justifies preempted to back on
military bases and colonies by the
United by 1945 the US security had
reached historically unprecedented
levels absolutely nothing like an issue
the US had half the world's will
industrial rivals were devastated
destroyed he was controlled the entire
hemisphere and broke both oceans the
opposite sides of both approaches that's
an incredible degree of power and
security it began to accomplish a lot
now off corner on after the end of the
prime rate of one per away food stay at
that level but the point is that it was
entirely natural that that with that
amount of power for us leaders of those
planners to seek to construct a global
system that would be conducive to the
interests that representative was dumb
sectors within society is the earth
multinational corporations and so on but
when you good morning home the warrior
possession for that we have everything
your possessions
threaten everyone so has u.s. security
increased presidenta levels so did fear
of that clearly by Dean Reston said
today we can only be secure to the
extent that our total environment is the
world the point was made kind of
mindedly by lyndon johnson and the
people who was addressing american
troops in asia in the mid-sixties oh he
said there are only 150 million that of
us three billion of them and it might
makes right they'll sweep over us and
take all we have is we have to stop and
Vietnam before they take over the year
that reflects a feeling that's deeply
rooted in American culture and society
as far back on the present they're
threatening us everywhere that that's
understand again if Gilmore and the room
the world is brenell illustrated pretty
remarkably Justin standard rhetoric it's
a big word loss in 1949 us power
suffered severe lon China is afraid that
describes that speech and discos local
loss of China the loss of china became a
huge issue an American policy
Kennedy was concerned about whether or
not the escalated into China he was
concerned about that he might be blamed
for the loss of Indochina and it goes
right up there president and it's an
interesting contribution I could lose
myself losing your soul exactly
Indochina may be losing Middle East
South America that simply expressed in
fact that we all know there are many
tries to take away from us their
happiness so we're under threat
constantly before we have a thousand
military bases around the world but
that's necessary for our protection if
you own the world that requires thousand
military bases preemptive war the
largest global terror campaign that's
ever been conceived the global
assassination campaign and so on another
striking illustration of it is native
for 50 years NATO was presented as
to defend Western Europe from the right
horse so very personal question is what
happened when the Russian whores
disappeared if anyone believe began the
past 50 years NATO should disappear
different it did expand that immediately
expanded the East violation of verbal
promises to its now being threatened
expansionist threatened to the frame
security threat threat of the official
artificial cognition native official
mission was chained no longer than
Western Europe the official mission is
to control the global energy system
pipelines sea lanes everything in the
world that's native of course US
intervention in will that make sense
video on the world and that we're
finding ourselves in the writings
protect our positions every day so there
is some truth the doctrine of American
exceptionalism significant well mainly
rich and powerful car sonically
threatened everybody that goes back to
the earliest dated
narrowly of course disgraceful passages
and the declaration of independence by a
sleeper teased every July 4th marquis
georgia third dirty with having
unleashed against us the merciless
Indian savages whose known way of
warfare is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages sexes and
conditions Thomas Jefferson and as he
surely who was there the reality was
pretty much the opposite it was the
merciless English adages work their
distinguished construction and that was
understood so the secretary water for
superior war and renounce understood as
he put it that promise were carrying out
the gutter extirpation of all the
Indians in most populous parts of the
union by means more destructive the
indentation native than the conduct of
the conquerors of Mexico and Peru George
Washington
the extirpation your enemy never went
out into loan but nonetheless Thomas
Jefferson was able to write those words
and we repeat the Boston Globe that
brings up another virtual feature of
American exceptionalism American history
of culture the satus country in the
world has always been but it's probably
the most interesting book on it by
literary critic Franklin it's called
worse or the city's seems in popular
there one major theme all the way
through we're just about to be destroyed
by some enormous unimaginable power last
month arrested by super weapon superhero
flexible
this is something the enormous enemy
that's about destroyed is so many weird
destroy the early years be sitting
merciless Indian savages later it's the
black slaves that could be a slave
revolt killa Lynette repo men there's a
lot of the gum culture breezy console /
backstage go back to that later garden
century 19th centuries the Chinese these
Chinese laborers you can think they're
sitting at launderers but actually take
over the country Jack London professor
brother once wrote stories name that we
ought to wipe out everyone in China
bacteriological warfare before they
overhear destroy us all go straight up
the Lyndon Johnson arrest that that goes
right to the present it's a big round
gradient 1983
he made the Nutmeg there was a threat
maybe they might be builded an air base
from which the reference to the package
so therefore 6,000 US Special Forces %
8,000 that benefit overcoming the
resistance over 40 human construction

after the u.s. refused to respond to a
human off of the negotiated settlement
years later 1985 friggin strapped on his
cowboy boots and declared a national
emergency because of the threat to our
national security moves by the
government of Nicaragua real threat big
rapid 14 Bismarck people think that this
is a theme that goes right through
appearances it's part of American folk
credit blood present the u.s. planning
invade Iraq Lisa writes his speech
saying next time we hear from Saddam it
will be mushroom clouds over newer the
media immediately hysterical about the
threat fear Iraq
the US was the only country nor was any
support for the invasion here people
were literally terrified and ran to the
present as a pic BTW bull three people
have been affected in the united states
this totally spirit millions of people
are physical work incentive children's
schools there are powerhouses then we
had better we're living in philly
reporters one of the most influential
people in the United States James Davey
Richards just announced that people as
the is God's punishment excellent
Obama's insistence dividing Jerusalem
there are no that's not it was serious
matters Constantine that American
history of culture very deeply rooted a
real parent robert pickton foreign
policy for old red it's a very valuable
document should receive wat support
effect a little holes and dated their
vision is a high level support for so
for some time polls have indicated that
large majority of population thinks that
the United States should not take the
lead in international fairy the UN
Security Council capably the United
Nation the United States or follow
whatever they decide has actually been a
small majority of the population in
favor abandoning the veto and just
following what the general world opinion
besides you don't like it however that
doesn't mean too much because there's a
major problem
from this these popular attitudes is a
private anguish from the political
leadership they're coming after us
completely quit the picked up from page
in the media the political class on the
tree now a population that is already
frightened out of its width because
that's the concept to tradition just
powers under the umbrella power and that
means that if we're hoping to implement
neighbor change in policy there are a
number of personal jackets not using one
is to change a prevailing consciousness
that really deeply rooted as part of
American culture for oral history and
the second is to establish a functioning
democracy in which popular opinion as
some world in influence and apology very
far that booth tasks are crucial and
both are by no means easy easy
what in my hand so I'm very hard to be
here with you I love you I I do a lot of
things a lot of writing facebook and
website just recently started tweeting
so this morning on my tweet was I'm
sitting next to no chance um this very
little that I can add to the Stockton I
think this is a very important document
I I believe that it's the sort of dr.
that faces a couple of possible futures
one is that it will circulate and vanish
the other is that we use it as an
organizing tool hmm and if we go in the
labyrinth at it actually means engaging
in the discussions and and not simply
giving it to people expecting that
they'll leave it and open it oh forgot
feedback but to go to labor unions to go
to community-based organizations to set
up discussions and religious
institutions and say let's talk about
this let's walk through this let's see
how you would experience this document
and how you experience because for our
policy and also something that I want to
talk about his internationalism a job
distinction from you should foreign
policy so I think that it's really
important that we engage in it and that
that's my first but the major thing I
want to talk about is the issue of a
paradigm shift and the paradigm shift
helping us to understand why things have
become so confusing we're looking at the
world and why it's often difficult for
us
name two people regular people what the
hell is going on Matt took over as
president of transact reform in 2002 I
could sense this particular product fact
that sensitive before and the problem I
thought it was very particular to what
was going on in Africa the African know
that I subsequent realizes it was much
broader than that there was in trans
Africa the organization that plateau but
not only in plateau that we be right we
reach the sort of ctg block blockage in
that up until nineteen ninety-four when
you were dealing with African thing is
seemed fairly clear you know we were a
united against apartheid the end of
apartheid was the real end of European
colonialism in Africa again the white
minority rule and many of our
organizations including but not limited
to trans Africa and focus on what the
hell happens when the part that is and
and there was this sort of strategic
confusion that existed but all the time
I realize that the confusion is much
deeper that actually we've been
undergoing a paradigm shift that i would
suggest team started probably the late
seventies of revised neoliberal
globalization and with that the
emergence over time with the
transnational capitis class that has had
an impact on any number of other things
which I try to toss them about there's
also been the end of the Cold War
China's decision to follow the catalyst
road the Wars of secession in yugoslavia
the rwanda genocide the rise of ethanol
nationalism as in some ways being one of
the if not the main feature of
nationalism in the current era and with
it ethnic cleanser and and genocide you
don't you know classroom to me that's
had that expression Wars policies by the
needs of expiring to feel the genocide
of war means that that what we're
looking at is this the linked with the
issue of ethyl nationalism ethnic
cleansing is the racialization of entire
populations and therefore the ease with
Virginians that people are eliminated
pure and simple not this change in a
situation has brought with it a whole
series of complications because it's not
always easy to figure out friends and
enemies and there's many people under
the progressive movement that I would
argue all back into something they have
fallen back into a sort of knee-jerk and
time periods and the basic idea being
that US is on one side we've got me on
the other and this leads to some really
interesting problems like what is I
stand on president al-bashir in the
Sudan if the United States is attacking
al-bashir condemning him and identifying
a genocide going on in doc for does that
then lead us to the conclusion that we
should support al-bashir let me go even
further something that's become
increasingly controversial it's called
genocide vinod the case of rwanda has
been an increased current within the
left progressive movements for people to
outright deny that genocide took place
in 1994 and this sort of this reverse
engineering almost it begins sort of
like this if Paul Kagame is currently an
ally
the united states and paul kagame is
using a genocide rishabh jen's high as a
way of suppressing anna paul kagame is
leading forces by the interferon
neighboring countries therefore
therefore genocide actually didn't
happen the genocide was provoked by paul
kagame in the Rwandan Patriotic Front
and the Hutus were victims now this may
sound really perverse if you just look
it up right and and it begins with this
very weird situation of saying that he
caused the United States is on one side
therefore the other side must be the
ones that we have to support and so I
apply it on my point here is that in the
absence of real concrete analysis we
fall back into simplistic approaches to
the international situation that dog
match with reality and that regular
people out there know is ludicrous so
when we're rethinking our work on
internationalism there's a few things of
you have to do seems to me that one is
as pointed out in this document and for
those of us that are Star Trek fans its
adherence to the private director the
prime directive is not interference in
the internal affairs of other states but
that directive is a directive one state
to another because she there's another
issue that we have a figure out which is
what is the character of
internationalism in front row center
what is the obligation of social
movements towards other progressive
socialists when we see social ones
progressive social movements being
slaughtered to release a long as nothing
that we really can do
 happens you know it's really
unfortunate we just sit back is that
look internationalism means because
advancement internationalism means what
that is actually call this isolation and
I think we we are esters have to be very
very careful about it now that leads us
into a very difficult area because it
really means that when we're looking at
both fire policy internationalism we
have to understand that part of all
engagement is actually fighting four
walls in u.s. foreign policy this
document is proposing reform it's
proposing that far policy under the
current situation is actually handled
differently now there are many
progressives and left us that actually
don't believe that that's possible I
mean after all we're living in the heart
of an empire the living in the country
which is the oppressive arm of global
capitalism and there were there those
that say well we can't actually carry
out this fight and if that is the case
then we then in a peculiar way the
situation is almost hopeless in terms of
developing a constituency of mass
constituency because in oil if with one
of the bell commands constituency
reaction that consecutive people about
the concrete ways in which yours foreign
policy can be changed now that there are
steps that people can take now that
actually you have a real world impact
and that becomes incredibly important
that means that we have to integrate
this into the work of other social needs
it means that it's not just the peace
movement the answer the piece of justice
movement standing a mama and a cry in
the wilderness it means integrating this
into the world of the Tribunal's it
means integrating this into the work of
the common justice it means integrating
this into the fights about austerity and
their web means that we're taking up the
issue of our
as in fact they reform stroke in America
at hospital environment I want to go on
something a confessor Johnston said
about fear if one of the things that was
characteristic of the midterm elections
was the the Republicans were appealing
to the sense that the world is out of
control and and it's not just fear oh I
often with everything that message on to
be made out on that it's it's this
notion that we somehow can control that
is home but can control of that people
were furious that Obama could not
control the outbreak of Ebola they were
furious that Obama could not stop the
emergence of ISIL and just ab c furious
about us that that that this joke that
Boehner made a few days before the
election about George Bush was still the
president he would punch Putin in mouth
even it states the sort of cowboy
idiotic approach but it's his idea of
actual control people in this country
understand that there is chaos out there
they have fear they are fearing the done
things but they're fearing that the
world is out of our control that there
are things that we can no longer do
their steps then we can no longer take
because we actually thought we at all so
what what should we be thinking about in
implementing this document or false so
I'm an agreement with the issue of the
non-interference but i would say that a
second thing that's not but it's only
generally mentioned is this issue of
international that we need to have a
discussion about what is the character
of
century solid era international press in
solitary so for example it seems to me
that what aspect is certainly fighting
to influence continental policies that
help progressive social movements
gaining the space that they actually
need a very obvious case in point of
that once the work that was done in the
anti-party to assist your hands upon
hands drop what else this is me well
material assistance to progressive
forces that could take various forms I
mean maybe there will be gone but become
a time again when they have to be
International Brigades as it was in case
of the spanish civil war but there are
things that look for example the boycott
divestment sanctions movement which is
concrete material assistance to to a
strong and it's a demonstration of
actual solidarity and it's not just
words the fight for multilateral eight
and intervention we're broke for example
medan rwanda genocide went down in 1994
it was the United States and obstructing
international intervention to stop the
genocide but most of us on the Left were
really silent about what the United
States should do should it have spoken
up should the United States have joined
with and encourage the UN to have done
something I would say yes that that is
actually a form of solidarity it's not
the Coalition of the Willing and the
invasion of Iraq but it is respecting
international law international
institutions and finally they're pushing
the nonviolent and just solutions as all
part of a notion of 21st century its
21st century international the the final
product on makers is this it's somewhat
tangential but I feel
naked which it is that we progressives
have to really keep in mind it's become
very definitely you've looked at
developments for exactly thailand yukon
impression that not only ask movements
are progressive that there are very very
bad people out there and they can often
number in hundreds of thousands if not
millions now we should remember that
because the Nazis work just 5 10 15
people running around you know sheen
guns we're talking about the mass
movement but we've somehow forgotten
that anything part of that has to do
with the phenomena after World War two
where their King would be this general
identification with me vas
anti-imperialist movements are voted
cetera in appearances 1990 certainly
we've seen the rise of something very
odd right one last ones and these rebel
best moments sometimes say things that
sounds like they're left leg may
sometimes implement tactics that make
themselves actually look like they might
be progressive case the point these
reactionaries in Venezuela that we're
trying to house the government and who
carried out these things activities that
were covered in in the US press and
there were many progressives that became
very excited and saw this as some sort
of progressive moon or you look at Tyler
with the rise of something that I think
it'd probably be accurately described as
an eel a schism but it is very mess and
we were looking at moving around the
world we have to understand is that we
have to dig deeper
external appearance we have two more is
call upon of us to dig deeply to
understand what the phenomena is and and
to borrow from a great person wants to
never forget the classroom thank you
very much provocative thoughts some we
may agree with so we may not ah let's
get this gumbo stir it up I want to ask
a question together to get it static all
through US history is always been a
tension between those and the ruling
circles want a republic and those who
want more of an empire and since World
War two it's really it's clear what the
balance has been between those who want
and ruling circles a republic and those
who want an empire what's your estimates
of the balance of forces and the ruling
circles today you know paint a little
bit of a picture what we're up against
and building this movement for a new
foreign policy
well I think if you take a look at the
political class this basically
everything and it's the only opposition
you can detect to write an imperial
system it's right length of appearance
against wall but it's worth remembering
that these are all the people want to
turn power over to unacknowledged
Erinyes no role for the population of
the solder under their rule they may not
put it that way but that's the effect of
allowing of eliminating any of the
constraints Bowser's parameters also
gets into one hand they are Grand Falls
has been pre awfully opposed to
interventionism and the null tourism for
production to military budget but there
are aspects that revolver neither
serious and engineer sentiment
the roughly speaking political nine
years of our cause
my question is how we do it Cochran
Ava's apartment gangland rival who has
suggested that in the case of Isis we
call international law that it appealed
the UN Security Council to declare
threat piece to organize actions to
respond to it releases of monstrous
organization and to create a coalition
of people who can actually participate
so they look at the llamas girlish and
then there's no fantasy and death this
it excludes the band force on the ground
that is fighting against the vessels
they were the PKK a Kurdish resistance
forces turn-based physically based in
northern Iraq so dirty p for the turks
attacked turkish government asking for
the United States there a terrorist or
position yes workmen they seem to be the
ones who saved the Aussie p or the
direct exactly passes back on the arable
the affiliates are doing must fight and
rock kabani but they're our enemy well
you know I'll be full of vision of the
main force
the region that licenses expanding into
this but that could come around but were
not allowed dealing with rent because
they had disobeyed orders through time
with us etic boat a lot wrong did write
those aren't the reason for the
exclusion of your radish well travel but
you can't mount any objection virtually
no objection to this in the political
class number liver my design case after
case there's actually a very remarkable
case just about a week ago there was a
lead article in through York Times the
main on which should at the headline in
the US is officially declares itself to
be the world's leading their estate
that's a content of the article the
article report of HCI a study that has
just come out good
which investigated the US intervention
to try to find which cases succeeded
which cases fail and what factors were
the success and it are blended with the
book from Obama saying the Commission's
that studies unfortunately it soon
succeeded very often which is a problem
take a look at the cases that were
mentioned first there were three Cuban
Angola and interrupting each of those
cases a major terrorist of that major
terrorist atrocity that's what they were
in Gothenburg so we announced that we
have carried out three major errors and
properties and the only question arises
is that they were that it didn't work
why didn't they were we doing that our
next month next look at the reaction see
if you solve one letter one comment by
any commentator saying liniment there's
something I about this we're declaring
ourselves in major terrorist eight the
world and we're proud of it and they'll
be on us whether works unfortunately
to reality to change yeah the sea I
don't think there are contradictions
between a Republican Empire I don't
think there's necessarily prostitution
in US history it'd be one thing that was
said Democratic would call versus empire
but the the US was constructed as a
white power and I think that that's
drink water and because it was
constructed as a buyer public there was
no contribution was received in that
existence of a Republican undermine the
the some of the things that professor
Chomsky was mentioning earlier about the
westward expansion was in his native
americans the season of Mexico etc were
complete insistently if you envision the
United States as a wider public and and
you saw that wet towards it was an
empire at this point in history I
mentioned in my talk that I I would look
at the United States and serving to Iran
sentence the repressive our global
capitalism it's not operating by itself
it's not operating at all these other
loss to discard simply supported to it
we have witnessed with the militant
organizations of very profound changes
and development of this transnational
catalyst class that like that has in
many respects change entire issues of
sovereign the United States is
well-positioned since there is no more
patent estate with you and Amanda saz's
position to operate is the press
apparatus for them and it does it very
effectively and obviously this
contradictions within this catalyst
classes transnational but i think that
the end of the u.s. sees itself that
that's the wall that they're supposed to
play now that in the u.s. ruling room
there are differences about the extent
to which that bowl should be unilateral
versus multi-language this is something
that we saw in the lead-up to the
highrock invasion to what extent should
the u.s. be collaborating with other
forces and making decisions and I don't
be collaborating with eg but I mean
cooperating with other major catalyst
powers in making decisions and that
decision not issued something that
actually tears apart or is it as a
contradiction of the ok questions yes
good did you say your name really from
brief lundberg from Newton Mass i'm
professor Chomsky I have a question for
you um ever since the IP and it concerns
the character of President Barack Obama
ever since some Barack Obama was elected
it's always nice to me that he seems in
a Republican he said he's expanded the
indigent the Asian of Afghanistan
increased amount of drone warfare I'm so
many ways he's so Republican and yet the
Republicans demonized him someone who
really had so much in common given that
wouldn't hear the nominee debated in the
presidential debates their foreign
policies sounded so similar that you
could almost not help apart and so I
guess I'm just curious what your
thoughts are oh and why right now
they're talking about working together
they put work together very well not
that I think it's a good thing ball but
I find it alarming
I could hear about County Brandi see
whatever just the one of the present
rented out the Barack Obama's policies
were pretty much farm policies were
pretty much Republican policies so why
did the Republicans dedicate themselves
to one program that actually publie par
71 policy since the bombs elected ruined
the country and hope the beautiful
blanket on our money is on you that's
been foreign policy in the weather they
just go operated under both balls I
think this goes back to a significant
change that's taking place a whole
American system in the past 50 years
there used to be a quick back in the
1950s think new function see red mills
but the United States of a one-party
state the business part with two
factions remember had some Republican
name that's no longer true the United
States is still a one-party state but it
only has one faction that's not the
immigrants it's moderate Republican
Party the people who are now been a
pratik who didn't rats are basically
what used to be full of moderate
Republicans so often said there are no
more moderate Republicans that's not
true they run the devil
so that they're not political party nail
on the leading conservative political
analyst Norman Ornstein enterprises
threatening panels he describes the
Republicans today as a radical
insurgency who have abandoned the
parliamentary system they are so
dedicated to serving private power
wealth corporate power that they're just
off the spectrum and they can't get
those that way so that didn't help or
something we knew our politics there are
sectors of the population have always
been there but they've never been really
politically localized it's a very
religious country or maybe the most
fundamental in the world did aging that
are never organized as a political force
now they are nativists who are worried
that we're losing our country to them
where they're going they are taking away
they mean everyone but white
anglo-saxons we're all the great wide
angles I said it everyone is we've been
waiting those actions now they are being
away the fear of rapid that's been
organized the popular basis of the party
is now is now a collection of
constituencies that will pointed out
miss constituencies can all be very
frightened these are well that's what
happens we use it so so yes Obama was
following day not Republican policy but
that's not enough they want something
temporary and it is no split apart
between the Republican establishment say
Romney which is kind of old-fashioned
moderate Republican and the base which
is the constituencies it won't laws and
they're stuck at a tight and internal
fight constant internal fight see
whether the establishment
and control the base of the immobilized
and having a problem Maya you see that
so out of the primary elections tickling
paypal vehicles and if you watch the
Republican primaries candidates kept
coming up from the base each one that
meant great that's great people
Republican establishment good luck they
poured money to attack ads to
annunciation to try to destroy these
people have work out from the base so
they could finally get that's an
internal struggle in the restaurant
Georgie that's what you're seeing bills
going to respond as well it'll take I
can give time for two more questions yes
so first part city I'm going to create
this a good sign cousin Charles tourism
we should also remember that the
Republicans did with a good like no
crime number so this is not exactly big
butt but what is and why didn't
recommend me would sort purpose of
Charles be the same but with Obama I
mean he's black do I need to repeat I
mean you have to understand what
happened on election night 2008 yeah to
millions of people in this country and
they won't think that went a bit and
then both off and he said this is a
white Republic how to help do we have a
black man white house this is a wet
republic it goes back to what
for right and and see the thing is when
you had when you are when you're off
approach is based on the assumption this
is a white Republic and the rest of us
are guess then there is no room for
compromise with someone like a college
none it doesn't matter whether you agree
with him he is a guest at best and for
them he's an undaunted guess so there is
no room for a discussion this is not
you're not dealing with rational people
which is part of the problem on the
reverse and that Obama never seemed to
get that they went to cut his legs off
and holy saying legs because he legs off
great and he continued to believe that
there was peace in our time right wait
these forces wanted is annihilation now
the way I would disagree with Professor
Johnson is that I actually think we have
a multi-party country it happens to
exist within two organizations one is
called Republicans and other that's
called Democrats but they are not those
are not parties those are electoral
blocks and the description that
Professor Johnson gable or part of
what's happening in the in the
Republican an absent women the the rise
of right-wing populism which you can
understand is a movement against the
future that's what they are there are
movement against the future there a
woman to hold back the future gara open
to hold back the demographic changes
their movement to hold back the changes
of a multipolar world they're a movement
to deny climate change right I mean
they're a movement against the future
and they are in his constant battle as
you pointed out the Republican
establishment it's also interesting that
the so-called what world wants liberal
Republicans no longer exists people like
the item just because of that
like eight like Nelson Rockefeller yeah
there's no group to them within the
Republican Party and Democrats are
clearly moved desert as a party to write
all those have been the Democrats a
progressive section that operates almost
as if it is another party and that's
where if the strategy tactics become
very complicated so we're going to we're
going to take both those questions at
once and my question is about
whistleblowers and I could setting a
postcard every week to chelsea manning
and I good correspondence with John
Kerry roof and I think a lot of us I not
know about the Nation magazine had a 32
2 issues ago of Obama coming down hard
on whistleblowers and John Kerry who is
what nine that Baba has put away John
period look up at the CIA hundred person
that exposed for us waterboarding and
other torture he got very modest enough
loreto federal prison or on line 25
years for him I want to know what is the
role of whistleblowers and how can we
support the nest I'm interested in the
issue of climate from any angle you want
one of them is that it is a real threat
so therefore the media is not talking
about or apply to justice and in fact
that certain classes of people are going
to stop you much more faster and also
the US military actually talking about
it because of their concerns I think
about vibrations were shortages thank
you
alexia i'm sure you all know on with
blowers obama set new records more
people have been charged robama the
Espionage Act that an old US history the
Act strasse be in first place there's a
major at that one whistleblower because
they are threatening something very
significant they are threatening
security in a real sense award purity
does not mean helical record security
Anglet with through internal documents
most is security does not refer to
protection of the population from actual
threats it refers to the protection
power from the population whistleblowers
are threatening them they're threatening
to expose our disfruten II this is
actually understood by the collector
lately the professor of the science of
Government at Harvard that's the name of
the position science of government it
norm could you come to my closet here
yeah and once point it out power the
power is strong when it remains in the
dark exposed to sunlight it evaporates
there correct how are just to remain
dark supposed son live is in trouble the
whistle blows
so that can't be powering what you we do
is support them yeah energetic pretty
good can't do it as far as the client
issues concerns I think we can't
overlook the fact that this is one
serious problem that the invitation says
ever faced roughly hundred thousand year
history we're facing real serious
prospect with destruction of the
possibility for peace and survival and
it's already happened it's not just the
species instruction now is it the level
of 65 million years ago when an asteroid
hit the earth end of the age of
dinosaurs opened the way for now
speeches instructions at that great
event increasing that's the temple
degenerative change that's affecting us
they've seen our
glow weeks ago the Commission's that
wasn't the deal with the expected rise
in sea level the answer is basically no
way the main suggestion was to turn it
into Venice approach this father that's
rich good upon innovation faced with
destruction I should see the it's an
imminent dangers that climate the right
would they believe it or not is another
question maybe their spare time it kinda
nuts here but in their position as
managers they're dedicated to maximizing
short from provident game and forgetting
what happens your furniture that's the
capitalist ethics which were committed
that's Lisa nothing just quickly um in
terms of whistleblowers I think this is
where it becomes very important to point
out that focusing on the bottom of the
person is irrelevant it's because I on
the administration and that
administration as consistent with the
tendency that we've been seen since the
seventies of the growth of
authoritarianism in the major catalyst
powers that something then because
pelant sauce called I returned and
statism and something in more recent
terms I called me over
karen states that we're seeing this
restriction on basis of deliveries
democratic rights ability to speak
senator sarah seeing that across the
world and so this issue of whistle blows
is entirely consistent with that
tendency i'm not saying that to make
this present an easy solution to it it
is more to say that it's representative
of a systemic problem that we actually
have to take off in terms of climate the
climate justice issue to professor
charm's needs points i would say two
things one is that if the the
environmental threat really raises the
question of genocide on look in a way
that we haven't thought about because
we're talking about the both the
extermination of populations as a result
of change but we're also talking about
it in belize fighting among those that
survive in one to live and what that's
actually going to me you know when did
you looking for example the situation in
the savannah in the Darfur region that
has to great extent driven by the
expansion of the sahara and what that's
meant for the different populations that
now are coming into conflict in a way
that 50 60 years ago them or not and we
will in fact see much more than the
second thing about climate justice is
that i actually think that the right
wing in many ways understand the threat
of climate better than we can leave
because what they understand that very
clearly is that in order to address
climate change yet the you have to deal
with the economy and they're not going
to do become parents em so they hide
behind some of this they hide behind
various religious analyses but
fundamentally drilling
and said it all fits it's really this
question of workshops begin as soon as
you get there we ended hopefully by we
have other than you back here Philip ow
