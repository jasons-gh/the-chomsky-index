port of it actually if you've looked
further in the media there are also our
serious articles on bushes messianic
vision to bring democracy to the Middle
East here's one from The Wall Street
Journal a couple days ago by a very good
correspondent very knowledgeable
correspondent carla and robins and it's
about the mr. negroponte so just to
counter what the amy was saying about
the media they do report things about
him if you go to the right journals like
the wall street journal where they have
a trustworthy audience and they can kind
of tell people things that you might not
read elsewhere the subheading it says
negroponte has tricky mission and then
the sub-heading is modern proconsul okay
and it begins by saying that as the
ambassador to honduras in the 80s
negroponte ii was known as the proconsul
title given to powerful administrators
in colonial times and now he's been
chosen to take up that same role in iraq
assuming there's one problem assuming
that the Pentagon is willing to cede its
control so the big question then is with
the pentagonal control iraq after we
transfer full sovereignty to them or
whether the proconsul the modern
proconsul will run iraq the way he ran
honduras i don't know if it's a
coincidence or not but a day or two
after Negroponte ease the point was
announced the government of Honduras
withdrew its forces from Iraq not many a
couple of dozen i guess but he might
have been a coincidence
or maybe they remember something from
what happened there the kinds of things
that amy was telling you about he did
have a job he had quite a embassy
they're not the size of the one he's
going to be running and react but in
Honduras which as you know is a kind of
centerpiece of world power he had a huge
embassy with a thousand people sorry
that's he had a huge embassy ran one of
the biggest embassies in the country in
the world and he also had the biggest
CIA station in the world in Honduras
obviously terribly important place for
the CIA to concentrate and he had two
jobs there the article explains one was
to ensure that Congress didn't get upset
about the fact that the Honduran
security forces were carrying out
tortures and massacres its famous
battalion 316 that amy was talking about
he had to deny those so that the eight
military aid would keep coming for him
to be able to carry out his major task
which was of course supervising the
Contra camps in Honduras from which the
CIA mercenary army was attacking
Nicaragua not a small affair the death
toll in Nicaragua from the US terrorist
war based in Honduras per capita
relative to population would be the same
as about two and a half million dead in
the United States which turns out to be
higher than the total number of American
deaths in all wars in US history
including the Civil War so from the
Nicaraguan point of view this was not a
small event it did lead to establishing
democracy with a gun at their heads
after bush warned them that this is
going to go on unless they vote for our
candidate this is Bush number one
Nicaraguans voted for the US candidate
were rewarded for that by there was
tremendous applause in the United States
and New York Times at big headlines
saying Americans United enjoy kind of
like North Koreans Americans United
enjoy at the victory for us fair play
yawn it's pretty much what happened
since then since the US took it over
again the garage was declined to the
second chorus country in the hemisphere
after Haiti again by accident Haiti
happens to be the main target of US
military intervention the 20th century
nicaragua's second but that's just
another coincidence about sixty percent
of Nicaraguan children under two are now
suffering from severe anemia from
malnutrition meaning probable permanent
brain damage about half the active labor
forces out of country because there's no
way to survive there but it is regularly
described in The Wall Street Journal to
as an economic miracle or you can buy
anything you want which is true their
24-hour you know malls open for people
can afford it and you can buy computers
and plenty of great great place for
retired americans to go they can live
very cheaply and wonderful mansions and
so on but for children under 2 that
prospects are permanent brain damage and
that's what we call a victory for
democracy so that tells you something
about the bushes messianic vision to
bring democracy to Iraq using the same
experienced official and we can don't
have to go on about the kind of
democracy that he brought to Honduras or
that the present incumbents and their
Reaganite phase brought to the rest of
the Central America but that we're
supposed to forget about actually I
didn't quite tell the truth when I said
I couldn't find any comment
after the president's visionary speech
questioning whether the goal was to
bring democracy to Iraq actually I did
find one there was a column in The
Washington Post by good correspondent
Walter Pincus couple of days after the
president's speech which reported a poll
in Baghdad and the colon Baghdad you
read through the column asked people to
say in their own words why they thought
the United States invaded Iraq and there
were some who agreed with unanimous us
commentary after the president announced
his vision there were some in Baghdad
who said that they thought the goal was
to bring democracy to Iraq 1% so it was
a comment saying not everybody agrees 5%
thought that the goal was to help Iraqis
the rest believed something that we're
not allowed to say here you can't find
it discussed or commented on or anything
but the rest of them say well the goal
was to take control of Iraq's resources
and to reorganize use control of Iraq to
reorganize the Middle East in the
interest in the general interests of the
United States of all the reasons that
have been offered for the war that's 1
i've never seen discussed or if it is
mentioned that said well you know some
lunatics like osama bin laden may
believe this or maybe amy goodman
believes it but nobody any sense of it
except for almost everybody in baghdad
and it's not unusual for people at the
wrong end of the club have a more
accurate vision of the world than those
were wielding the club many situations
actually the iraqi responses if you look
for more sophisticated than I just
indicated one percent said the American
goal was to bring democracy to Iraq but
fifty percent said the US wants
democracy in Iraq
it sounds like a contradiction it isn't
if you read the whole statement they
said half of them said yes the United
States wants Iraq democracy in Iraq but
it will not permit Iraqis to determine
their own future without US influence
that means the proconsul is going to
determine what happens so democracy will
be great as long as you do what we say
it's a condition on democracy again they
understand our us better than we choose
to understand ourselves that is the
history not just the United States but
elsewhere well the Honduras was not the
only country that decided to fill out
troops as you of course know this spain
had a vote in March where the population
voted out the government that had gone
the war over the objection of maybe
ninety percent of the population I was
greatly praised here by those who are
carrying out the messianic mission to
bring democracy was greatly praised for
having demonstrated its democratic
credentials by following orders from
Crawford Texas instead of ninety percent
of the population I was much more
general in fact but Spain did vote them
out of office last March and voted in a
government which announced that its
electoral program was that it would
withdraw the troops from Iraq unless
they were under UN supervision and that
led to a lot of commentary here a lot of
condemnation of the the Spanish as weak
and appeasing terrorism and all sorts of
terrible things one comment that I
didn't notice was that the Spanish
voters voted for what is pretty much the
position of about seventy percent of
Americans last December in the most
in-depth poll had taken seventy percent
of Americans
I said as in fact they've been saying
since April that the UN ought to take
the lead in civil order control in Iraq
in economic reconstruction and in
working with Iraqis to arrange a
transfer of full sovereignty which is
pretty much what the Spanish voters
voted for it so they voted for what
seventy percent of americans believe but
there's a difference between Spain and
America and it's a very important
difference one difference is that in
Spain people know what public opinion is
in the United States very few people
know what public opinion is I mean if
you go to the right websites and you
know you read the studies by the
University of Maryland the polling
institute you can find these things out
but very few people know here the people
who answered that question and said yeah
this is what we think the UN oughta play
the primary role in all these domains in
the US auto be at part of some
multilateral coalition maybe under UN
supervision very few of those people
know that they're expressing majority
view in the United States large majority
view a second distinction is that in
Spain you can vote for your on your
opinions here you can't like that issue
is certainly not going to come up in the
campaign the position that seventy
percent of Americans want and that the
Spanish voters voted for is not an issue
in our campaign and this is true of
issue after issue internationally
domestically all sorts of things so just
take the major domestic issue in the
United States pretty well agreed that
the major domestic problem that the
United States faces and serious one is
exploding health care costs of the US
health care system is far and away the
most inefficient in the industrial world
as costs wavy on any other country and
the outcomes are relatively poor down
the low end of industrial societies and
every health professional knows the
reason for this it's a privatized system
which means
massive administered of costs lots of
filling out paperwork supervision
detailed supervision over what doctors
are allowed to do a huge drug costs up
to maybe ten times as high as say
Australia just to give you some personal
examples we just came back from Greece
where my wife had to get some needed
some drug turned out the drugs she got
caught was the same one she gets uses
here except one third the price and the
pharmacists and friends there told us we
ought to really stock up on drugs
because everything is a fraction of the
price of what it is here same drugs same
company they make huge profits in Greece
but they can make bigger profits here
and for all these reasons the u.s.
system is extremely inefficient also
just the bureaucracy my wife had the
Philip ascription from MIT health care
program today in fact we spent about an
hour on the phone with the insurance
company trying to get them to fill the
prescription as the doctor prescribed it
turned out that he had prescribed I know
I'm kind of making up the facts three
pills a week or something and the only
thing they could do was either two pills
a week or four pills a week that's what
the rule was so they couldn't give her
the prescription she finally got the
doctor to call he spent half an hour
arguing with him over the phone and she
couldn't do it so now she's going to
figure out it I cut the pills and half
person but all of those things add up
they add up to huge expenses and these
are inherent parts of a a mostly
privatized a health care system which is
a highly bureaucratic extremely
inefficient and so on well how do
american people feel about this actually
they're very few polls about it I think
the polling agencies know want to know
the answer but there are some there were
for example one in the washington post a
couple of months ago I were turned out
about eighty percent of the population
are in favor of some form of net
tional healthcare system of the kind
that every other country has even if it
meant kept keeping taxes high which
incidentally wouldn't get with lower
taxes because it would be so much more
efficient well that and that's pretty
consistent that goes back along
