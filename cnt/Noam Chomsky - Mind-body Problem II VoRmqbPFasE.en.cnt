the mind-body problem what happened to
that problem well is that problem still
around well a lot of people seem to
think it's around so there's a big you
know there's what's in fact sometimes
called an orthodoxy in philosophy which
is that things can be reduced to the
orthodoxy is that philosophical
questions about the mind and mental
activity and mental events and so on
should be reducible to the material
world - something about physical world
which is supposed to give you a
resolution of the mind-body problem and
they're big debates about whether you
can do it or you can't do it and so on
these debates are rather curious because
the mind-body problem doesn't exist and
it doesn't exist because it was
demolished by Isaac Newton three
centuries ago Newton didn't have
anything to say about the Cartesians had
a theory of mind and a theory of body in
fact science altogether had a theory of
body it was called the mechanical
worldview and it was very commonsensical
the mechanical it probably is our common
sense picture of the world the common
and that was science you know the top
scientists of the day of Huygens and
others we're trying to develop a
mechanical worldview show that the world
is a machine that was the big job showed
the worlds of machine uh and then the
cart came you know his argument was well
yeah the world's machine in fact
everything's a machine except the
creative aspect of language use and some
other things like that which don't seem
to be duplicate or by automata so there
that's the second substance that's mine
well what happened to that picture what
happened is that Newton showed that
nothing is a machine in fact that's
exactly what it showed if you think
about it what Newton showed much to his
distress I should say and to the
distress of everyone else who thought it
was kind of like a reversion the
traditional mysticism is that the entire
world is immaterial the world is
governed by immaterial forces what we're
in fact called occult forces if anybody
knows anybody as Newton pointed out it's
an utter absurdity which no one with the
slightest scientific he said
philosophical but
scientific understanding could believe
that one object can influence another if
they're not in context that he's a total
absurdity and it certainly is a
common-sense absurdity it just happens
to be true
he showed it was true universal
gravitation showed that in fact what is
an utter absurdity it's true and that
was quite disturbing but the effect of
it was to show that the world isn't a
machine in fact nothing's a machine even
simple terrestrial and planetary motion
aren't mechanical mechanical world
picture was demolished it's commonly
said now you know it's common these days
in philosophy and elsewhere it did the
Ryde theories of the mind as being a
ghost in a machine and we got to
exorcise the ghost
but what's forgotten is that Newton
exorcised the machine so the he didn't
he left the ghost untouched at night
save a theory of mine he in fact assumed
that somehow if we ever figured this
stuff out it would incorporate mind but
it was left as a total mystery and it
remains a total mystery fact it's just
gotten more mysterious since as physics
introduced more and more crazy ideas to
trial and to try to account for what
goes on in the world so there is no
notion of material and there's no notion
physical and there's no notion of body
and so on hence there cannot be a
mind-body bro what there is is just
various aspects of the world and you try
to understand them the best you can and
unify your understanding as best I can
but I don't think that anyone has
formulated a coherent version of the
mind-body problem since since the 17th
century so it's not at all clear to me
at least what people are arguing about
when they say there they think that the
mind can be reduced to the body or they
don't think it can or whatever since
there's no notion of body the debate
doesn't seem to do that any but the
problems remain I mean the problems of
how you of the mental aspects of the
world they remain and they remain to the
most for the most part unsolved
we can pull out little pieces of them
and get insight like the nature of the
mechanisms that underlie infinite
knowledge there we can get a lot of
insight but the main questions about the
mental aspects of the world
like for example the question of
coherent appropriate meaningful action
which is apparently uncaused as far as
anyone can tell that problem remains and
it remains completely mysterious
