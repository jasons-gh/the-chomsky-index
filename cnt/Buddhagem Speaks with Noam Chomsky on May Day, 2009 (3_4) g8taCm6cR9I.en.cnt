yeah and who I mentioned to you the
article by Stephen greenhouses why
Americans why my co-workers stay off the
streets wat Europeans protest and we've
seen occupations and occupation of
factories in Europe and Ireland for
instance the boss kidnappings and France
and our European counterparts seem much
more militant we've seen two general
strikes in france do you think the
silent labor history accounts are some
organized these the success in in the
united states the success in kind of
defanging the labor movement has been
significant and that means first of all
reducing the scale of organizing but
also implementing a culture in which
it's considered the wrong thing to do
select the mohawk valley the methods
again it's breaking Americanism and
harmony and the labor do you know a lot
of working people this working people
think that the unions are just a bunch
of corrupt losses and that's you know
that's very really driven home very
intensively that's nothing new I mean
you go back to select for example round
in the early 50s maybe 1953 there were
two major films that came out about the
labor movement one of them was on the
waterfront Marlon Brando that one became
a huge hit the theme of that was corrupt
union bosses and the brave worker Marlon
Brando stands up to them and ends up
throwing the union boss in the water
everybody cheers that was one
incidentally directed by a guy who's a
target of McCarthy because he was
considered too far left the other one
was salt of the earth which just
disappear far better film that are
really moving any
very well done low-budget film on the
success of a strike were her struggle
and their success and so on said that
one you know i'm not going to show that
major film that also spoke quickly
enough our review it in the press
quickly disappeared and that's the
pattern that's been said it's been
pretty well studied but it's a very
evident pattern and it has led to
attitudes of fear and hatred of unions
and fear and hatred of government so you
know you attack the possibilities of
organization which already undermines
democracy and you attack democracy and
it's just a massive theme schools
newspapers the arts and so on and i
think it has the significant extent
Ock's succeeded and keeping people
passive disorganized and they may not
like what's going on in fact recent
polls should maybe eighty percent of the
population thinks that the words of the
polls that the country is one run by a
few big interests looking after
themselves the government doesn't work
for the people but people aren't feeling
do anything about it okay that's the way
life is governments run by a few big
interests we're just sitting and
watching we try to hang on to what we
can and there's a major effort to build
in a kind of a cult of strange form of
individualism you know you're supposed
to look after yourself but don't care of
anyone else let's i think the prime
reason why there's such a concerted
attack against social security that we
all kind of fabricated claims about it
since solvency and so on and so forth
mostly total fabrication but the big
problem with social security is it runs
counter to the doctrine that you're only
supposed to care about yourself I mean
Social Security is a system in which you
supposed to care
whether you know the elderly widow
across town has a foodie and that's
unamerican you're supposed to just care
whether you have an extra television
suit that's just driven into people
right in the schools like in
Massachusetts liberal massachusetts the
rural suburban communities i discovered
to my amazement that the schools are
running curricula that are given to them
packaged by the Objectivist foundation
the nine Grand foundation so they come
in and they you know with a whole
package now here's the books here's the
tests yours the prizes you know here's
the contest so there's which teaching
class for the school superintendents and
it's great somebody's doing all my work
for me for free why should I object the
teachers can just be mechanical you know
you go through what's doing it and
that's what the kids are learning I mean
it's that's kind of unimaginable in a
free society but it's happening if it's
happening in the suburbs of boston yeah
right now and i just found out of it
because my daughter found that her son
was coming up with this stuff but and if
it's happening right in the suburbs of
boston you can imagine what's going on
elsewhere well i mean for a lot of high
school student american high school
students was required reading a lot
really awesome yea i meant a lot quite a
few people yeah it was just require e
well that could simply we could talk
just briefly according to the bureau of
labor statistics new membership rose
last year i apparently throws the last
two years they're saying last year four
hundred twenty eight thousand new
members a lot of those in the government
sector in the public sector unionization
has stayed pretty high and the reason is
in the public sector the employer the
government can't carry out the illegal
practices that are standard thanks to
the government in the private sector so
the government did effectively tell the
private sector you can just be criminal
destroyed organizing efforts by illegal
means but can't really do that directly
in the government sector so where
workers have a choice yeah they remained
unionized but where they'd only have a
choice in the private sector shore the
union's decline it's not gonna be Z
reverse and also the union culture has
to change so I mean it's worth
remembering that the the culture of the
American unions in a post-war period
adopted some of the anti-labour
anti-democratic conceptions so take say
the health system a candidate in the
united states are pretty similar
societies but and in both countries the
it was the labor movement that was kind
of like at the forefront of pushing for
sort of decent health care but they did
it in different ways in canada the
union's called for health care for
everyone in the united states the
union's called for health care for us so
the UAW had decent health care for its
workers now of course they labor under
the illusion that were friendly society
the bosses and everybody are friends and
so on and they were very surprised to
discover that business is carrying out a
bitter class war without a stop Doug
Fraser the head of the UAW about 30
years ago I guess made a speech this is
amazing businesses acting like there's a
class war going on I thought we were all
kind of friendly neighbors yeah sure
businesses vulgar Marxist they're always
carrying out it they know what they're
doing they're carrying out a bitter
class war and if the union's put their
health plans in corporate hands for one
thing it means other people don't get
them unlike Canada and for another thing
it means they're at the mercy of the
corporations corporations decide to
terminate it you can see what's
happening right now
got to take it and that's a difference
between the as i said canada in the
united states are very similar countries
but the u.s. is more business run and
that plays out in striking ways
including things like health care big
problem for people
