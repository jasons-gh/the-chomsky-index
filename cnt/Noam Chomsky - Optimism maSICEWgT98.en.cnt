in an interview with the BBC you gave a
couple of years ago you the journalists
asked you about how u squared your
pessimism with your optimism and I
believe you remain optimistic about a
social change and all that it can bring
but do you remain optimistic now all
these years later and if so why can you
give some examples so that it alleviates
some of my pessimism about society you
know there's a famous line of Graham
shoes
what wasn't original to him but he made
it famous
we should have pessimism of the
intellect and optimism of the will
and I think that's a good formula with
regard to pessimism we have two choices
we can say look everything's hopeless so
let's quit and will help ensure that the
worst will happen or we'll say look
there are possibilities let's pursue
them maybe things will get a little
better that's not a real choice and
that's all there is to say I mean for
every one of these problem major
problems there are possible solutions
and there's indication you know in many
respects these societies our societies
are considerably more civilized than
they were say fifty years ago many
respect so for example I'm the most
striking example as women's rights
that's just changed enormously in the
last 50 or 60 years and much of the
world in the West in particular all
sorts of cases I mean take the United
States in the United States women go
back to the early days of American
history the company founding fathers
took over British common law of course
under British common law women were not
persons they were property a woman was
the property of her father transmitted
to her husband over the years that
changed but slowly it wasn't until 1975
in the United States that women had a
legal guaranteed right to serve as peers
in Fedder
juries peers means equal persons that's
just a few years ago that's one of many
changes that takes a opposition to
aggression it's much higher than it was
back in the early 60s what I described
in the early sixties it could not take
place now so you compare say the
invasion of Vietnam with the invasion of
Iraq the invasion of Iraq was the first
time in the history of Western
imperialism when you had huge protests
before the invasion was officially
declared and it had been going on but
before it was officially declared that
were huge brought this that's totally
different from what happened the
invasion of South Vietnam okay and it
had an effect I mean what happened in
Iraq was bad enough but the bush and
Blair never dreamed of carrying out the
kinds of actions that Kennedy and
Johnson carried out with impunity all
right those are changes take nuclear
weapons there now are is very widespread
popular opposition to the development of
nuclear weapons it's still going on and
the threat of nuclear war I think is
severe much more than people imagine but
it's it's been lessened and there are
this popular opposition which could grow
in the case of the major issue we face
environmental catastrophe that was not
even considered a problem forty years
ago and now it's understood to be a
problem and there's plenty of popular
activism even not enough but plenty
doing something about it these and many
other things are signs of there are
other signs of for reasons for optimism
it takes a Latin America you could for
500 years since the conquistadors the
Latin America was dominated by foreign
powers last century or so the United
States and internally the but each
virtually every Latin American
entry was run by a small wealthy
European eyes often white elite in the
midst of enormous poverty and suffering
in basically potentially pretty rich
societies the last 10 or 15 years that's
changed there's a reason why I Sons is
in the ecuadorian embassy latin america
part latin america has become
significantly free of external control
more so than almost any other part of
the world and it's beginning to face
some of its horrible internal problems
those are all signs of optimism these
are things that can be done
