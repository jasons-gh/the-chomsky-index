take what's happening in education right
now with less recent years there's a
strong tendency to require assessment of
children and teachers so that you have
to teach the tests and the test
determines what happens to the child and
what happens to the teacher that's
guaranteed to destroy any meaningful
educational process it means a teacher
cannot be creative imaginative pay
attention individual students needs the
student can't pursue things that maybe
some kid is interested in something
can't do it because you go to memorize
something for this test tomorrow and the
teachers future depends on it as well as
the students these are all ways of you
know the people are sitting in the
offices the bureaucrats and designing
this like you say they're not evil
people but they're working within a
system of ideology and doctrines which
turns what they're doing into something
extremely harmful I first of all you
don't have to assess people all the time
I mean if a person is kind of doing
their job kids are getting along the
things that is fun and go ahead I mean
people might be ranked in terms of some
artificial the the assessment itself is
completely artificial it's not ranking
teachers in accordance with their
ability to help develop children who
reach their potential explore their
creative interests and so on those
things can you're not testing so you're
giving some kind of a rank but it's a
rank that's mostly meaningless and the
very ranking itself is harmful it's
turning us into individuals who try to
devote our lives to achieving a rank not
into doing things that are valuable and
important it's it's highly destructive
at the lower you know this is say
elementary education so you're training
kids this way and it's very harmful I
could see with my own children when my
own kids were
Elementary School I don't know what's
called a good school you know good
quality suburban school by the time they
were in third grade they were dividing
up their friends at the dumb and smart
you had dumb if your lower tracked your
smart if your upper tracked I mean you
think but that does to the children
doesn't matter where the track the
children who take it seriously like we
could kind of you know help them not
take it seriously but if you're caught
up in that it's just extremely harmful
and has nothing to do with education
education is developing your own
potential and creativity I mean maybe
you're not going to do well in school
and you'll do great in art that's fine
you know what's wrong with that it's
another way to be a live a fulfilling a
wonderful life and a one that's
significant for other people as well as
yourself people and but so the whole
idea is first a little wrong in itself
and it's harming them it's creating a
kind of it's kind of a system of
creating something that's called
economic man there's a concept of
economic man which is you know economics
literature and so on and economic man is
somebody who rationally calculates how
to improve his own status and status
means basically wealth
so you rationally calculate how what
kinds of choices you should make to
increase your wealth and you don't pay
any attention anything else or maybe
maximize the number of goods you have
because that's what you can measure
those are things you can measure so
those we that and if you do that
properly you know you're a kind of a
rational person making informed
judgments you can improve your what's
called your human capital you know what
you can sell on the market what kind of
a human being is that is that the kind
of human human being you want to create
and the all of these mechanisms that
you're describing like you know testing
assessing evaluating measuring they
force people to have to develop those
characteristics the ones that don't do
it are as a considered maybe behavior
problems or some some other deviants
maybe something goes wrong then they
drop out and maybe try to survive on
drugs or something that's or take if
it's in Mexico they become it but are
called illegal immigrants because you've
driven them off the land
that's the these things have these ideas
and concepts have consequences and it's
not just that they're ideas there are
huge industries devoted to trying to
instill them the public relations
industry advertising and marketing and
so on it's a huge industry it's maybe a
sixth of gross domestic product and it's
a propaganda industry it's a propaganda
industry designed to create a certain
type of human being the one who can
maximize consumption and can disregard
the as actions on others
its massive it starts with infants yeah
in fact it was a number of study
recently which made some publicity about
the advertisers discovered realized that
there's a segment of the population that
they're not reaching you have to reach
everyone but there was a segment they
weren't reaching children because
children don't have incomes so the
advertisers had sort of not targeted
them but some smart guy realized that
you can get the children to be consumers
by inducing them to nag their parents so
a branch of psychology developed
literally in the universities in Applied
Psychology
psychology of nagging how you can nag
this way if you want that thing and you
can act the other way if you don't want
the other and so on and you take a look
at remember watching television with my
little of my grandchildren and there
little they're deluge with propaganda
that tells them you've got to have this
you know $400 mechanical something or
other
so make your get your parents do it you
know get them to understand that you're
just not going to you're going to be
miserable and your friends will hate you
and your life won't be worthwhile unless
you get this thing that's what our
culture is designed to do and it's a
huge industry actually in the early days
back in the 1920s it was called
propaganda the major text of the PR
industry by one of its gurus Edward
Bernays back in the 20s was called
propaganda and that's what it was we
don't call it that anymore the word
propaganda has a kind of a bad
connotation so it's called know what but
but it's exactly the same thing
