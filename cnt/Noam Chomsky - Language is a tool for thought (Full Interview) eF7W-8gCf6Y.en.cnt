okay so I'm getting the question I know
the question about in case I
I don't remember some of them if I talk
like this
so if you see is it loud enough like
this
we should talk louder louder you know
they're like this is okay okay so first
question will be how you doing like a
little good okay so we for me further
studying before I started the interview
what do you get the energy if you would
last work what do you get the energy
yeah so many things to do just keep
going okay well where the energy comes
from the same place is coming from my
teachers okay okay you didn't mention
any minutes we would have like half an
hour has another appointment okay so I'm
gonna be watching the time so I know we
don't exceed the time limit okay
all right so let's talk about language
okay okay yeah and I guess the right
person to talk about okay so my question
is you are studying language in a
scientific way to voice the reason
no if you do that if if you so do you
pay attention to stuff that the
cognitive system is killing me when you
think of something the cognitive system
the mind is feeling in stones were
filling in filling in like adding a stop
of course so you study language in a
sensitive way you pay attention to that
anyhow well when you studied some topic
in a scientific way I say you're a
physicist and you're interested in the
laws of motion
what you do is abstract away from the
complexity of the world
you don't take videotapes of leaves
flying in the wind
what you do is set up abstract
experiments so for example you think
about a ball rolling down a frictionless
plane and so on that's science every
experiment is an abstraction from the
complexity of the world of getting to
your question if you studied language in
a scientific way the way all the
sciences worked you do exactly the same
thing there are many factors entering
into what you and I are now saying but
you want to study a particular elements
of them and see who can understand which
means you discard many implement you
tried to focus on core essential ones so
yes there was all kind of things going
on
but if you want to study language you
want to ask exactly what is language
contributing to this that's distinct
from in over other things that's the
scientific way like very important is
that feeling that is important more than
the others as you said that the - is
doing all kinds of things but if that's
what you're studying if you're
interested in studying language you try
to abstract away from other things that
are not language that are interacting to
determine what you do if you're
interested in say emotional attitudes
towards what's happening in the world
yeah abstract away from language so
there's nothing more or less important
you study different things whatever
you're interested in learning about you
try to abstract that away from the
complex environment that just the way a
physicist does a chemist does anyone of
the sciences then the sciences this is
just taken for granted and then the
social sciences people don't seem to
grasp the point they think you should
study everything at once where you learn
nothing just as if the physicist was
trying to find the laws of motion by
studying please blowing in the wind I
think that there are no dictionaries in
which you look up a more and then you
you will or you see all the complexities
of a concept so you think that is weird
the dictionaries in which you could look
up our water you look over and then
bring all the complexities there are no
teaching that is like that well when you
think of a word or look up a word there
are all sorts of it as exactly as before
there are many different factors
entering into your reaction your past
associations with it the last person you
heard have used somewhere were you've
heard somebody who's in the speech some
experience you had with if you there are
different things you can be concerned
with if you're interested in the meaning
of the word you throw all those things
out you try to discard them and look at
exactly what the meaning of the word
contributes to the mass of reactions
that you have that's the only way to
study anything the same if you're
studying history as suppose you're
studying the origins of the First World
War
well there are lots of things you don't
bother looking at it like what to the
Archduke had for breakfast that morning
millions of things you don't look at you
pick out the things that you think might
be relevant to the topic at hand of
course you might miss things just as in
physics you might miss things maybe
something that you maybe your experiment
threw away too much
that's always a problem but there was no
alternative to high levels of
abstraction from the complexities of the
world
you just can't study everything where
you learn nothing yeah okay so you have
to meet you have to try that's what
inquiry is whether it's physics or
history and it's just the kind of thing
you
okay I forgot to move this okay if I
okay I agree you have to be very
specific highly specific but still if I
really want to know the complexities
concept I know about the complexity of
something what you do is first of all
try to find the fundamental principles
that enter into it then you gradually go
to greater and greater levels of
complexity so for example take physics
again
the physicists will start by studying a
ball rolling down a frictionless plane
something which can't even happen but
you abstract to that situation then you
want to go to something more complex
like what happens if I throw a ball
across the across the room then you
start bringing in other things like air
pressure or no force of gravity the wave
my hands like that's usually engineering
you try to move from the simplest thing
that you started with up and building
slowly to more and more complex things
that are within the range of study but
the full complexity
the world you'll never see it's just too
many things happening so Sophie look so
for example for inspiration I guess you
want to get inspiration maybe
inspiration ideas from philosophers
motivation philosophers did the same
thing is a philosopher studying say
concepts they also abstract away from
numbers or the things like associations
you might have with the concept because
of best experience that's not what the
philosopher looks at they're trying to
find out that what's the notion what is
the actual concept of truth you don't
worry about the fact that yesterday
somebody said something okay so I would
like to focus some definition that you
use which so I was wondering whether
that is an idea an original idea of
yours or rather something that you
borrow from someone or something that
you develop there's a long tradition
goes back to classical times that
regards languages basically thought
there are some leading thinkers like the
villain from Humble great humanist
founder of the modern research
the language for him language and flora
indistinguishable any thought just is
language that's an extreme position in
the modern period there's been a very
different few philosophy psychology the
language has been regarded as an
instrument of communication we've sort
of developed from animal systems so
every animal system has some kind of
communication down to bacteria and the
idea is that language is just a more
complex form of communicative system but
I think makes it pretty clear that
communication with you very ancillary
part of life issues but it's not the
structure and design of language seems
to be articulation traditional so that
yeah y-you work soon as they begin you
know just came out of the empirical
studies to use him at some point out of
the empirical theoretical work the
number of us was we're doing it sort of
became clear that even the physical
articulation of language is secondary
there's things going on the law in these
that don't have the properties of the
spoken language so for example and
speech or writing the words tested
one after another but in the internal
the language that doesn't appear to be
happening
it's just structures no than you order
there's pretty good evidence for that so
multiple dimension doesn't have any
linear or just abstract structures and
that's what seems to feed the thought
system and you can see that in simple
ways it takes a Japanese in English and
linear or they're almost mirror images
so in English you have a very urban
ecology Japanese you have an object in
English you have a preposition and it's
complement Japanese the opposite said
they're almost mirror images but the
thoughts are exactly the same because
what's going on internally doesn't pay
any attention to the neighborhood the
only is why do you have any word at all
it's only because the speech apparatus
requires you can't speak in parallel you
have to and in fact if you look at sine
which is the same as speech that people
use other dimensions so not everything
is linearly ordered and sign you can
form a question by using the songs for
the declarative and raising your
eyebrows that's a question but it's not
linearly order that is multi means
phenomena you use the options that are
available in the sensory motor system
but the sensory motor systems not part
of a language was there
hundreds of thousands of years for
language too though it does have analogs
in the animal world
so apes have about the same perceptual
system that we do but they don't use it
for language they can't because they
don't have the internal operations with
language and goals so what you talk
about speech it's actually a kind of a
combination of the language you've got a
sensory motor system which have nothing
to do with one another when you try to
match them so you get a lot of
complexity that it seems I mean some
others that the complexity and diversity
of the language is mostly in the
externalization system in the matching
at least two unrelated systems which
means oddly enough the most of the study
of the language is not about language
it's about the way language relates to
some other system that's no it's not of
course the books for you know many
linguists agree with this but I think
that is a chain in my view that is a
chain that's a question of what will
turn out to the truth yes okay
defining language which is people or
some people expect like a dictionary
definition
language and if you take the blood sense
you need a whole book to tell me its
properties its functions you need you
need more than a simple living
dictionary definition so what do you
think that people expect this dictionary
recognition subscription dictionary the
dictionary chart and concise first of
all the dictionary doesn't even begin to
tell you about language like it doesn't
explain why we're putting words together
in this way and not some other way so a
dictionary is a very superficial quarter
hand but beyond that dictionaries don't
do what they're claimed to do the
dictionary does not give you the meaning
of a word doesn't even come close if you
begin to really study carefully the
meanings of words you find that they go
way beyond anything to the dictionary
captures the dictionary takes for
granted unconscionable out thinking
about it that the person who's using it
has an internal language faculty of
incredible richness which is in the
dictionaries just giving hints it's
enough hints that a person already knows
language can use them but the idea that
a dictionaries giving of the meanings of
the words is collapses as soon as you
look closely the meaning of any word
okay will you say that that is actually
false that a dictionary gives meanings
the dictionary gives hints hence but the
meanings are internal to our minds so
let's take the simplest word you like
River which happens to be the one those
or take the word that was studied in
classical Greece the word helps studied
by Aristotle yes what's the meaning of
health well he points out right away
that a house has two dimensions
it's the direction which he calls matter
and form the matter of the house is the
the logs is the bricks whatever is built
the form of the house is what was in the
architects mind when they designed it so
something that looks exactly like a
house that was designed to store books
is a library it's not a house
something that was that looks like a
house but was designed as a huge
paperweight it's not a house looks like
else but it isn't now that goes on like
this so for example if you paint a house
Brown you're painting the outside of the
inside that's part of the meaning of
house if he painted a room Brown he's
painting the inside not the outside a
dictionaries tell you nothing about this
that it goes on and on and it's the same
with any word you picked a tree person
river so like this the dictionary gives
you some hints and if you were human be
complex concepts then the hints pick out
one of the constants but the dictionary
doesn't tell you
and it didn't nobody even could write it
an account of this you can write a book
on the meaning of
we're just one more it's also they're
very complex okay
you will need anything and see
convenience for if you tried this like
developing a theory of something in the
organic world can be very complex even
the simplest thing like suppose that
like I have an aunt growing along here I
want to understand the aunt I have a
huge complex theory about it because
what the ad is doing is amazingly
complex an scanned for example count the
number of steps they've taken how do
they do that they can an ant can wander
around and go straight back to where it
came from how do they do that humans
can't do them it becomes that's what
science is you look at the simplest
thing in terms of the extremely complex
ok let's go back to this idea of
language being an instrument of the mind
so he historically used I mean using it
for opposing that language language was
a tool for communication that was the
reason there is a long tradition that
relates getting language to thought it
changed in the 20th century and probably
under the influence of behaviorism and
misunderstood Derwin
in theory and so on but anyway because
of the complex of phenomena that
developed the 20th century it became
Orthodox to regard languages just a
system of communication but I think when
we study it scientifically we find that
the tradition was correct and that the
modern approach is just misleading wrong
so you went in yo so Boston these people
saying that language was what's an
instrumental computation so it's very
like you went in like fighting these
people will strong evidence against them
just what I said
for example even the linear order of
words is not part of language and you
don't have communication unless you have
the linear order of words so it's um
it's one of the uses of language
certainly it's a major use of language
but it's like saying that a major use of
fingers is typing but that doesn't mean
that like fingers evolved for tightening
just one of the things we do okay so we
say that you where you're doing you your
scientific work rather than fighting
concepts or fighting no concept learning
concept is so Aristotle's study is the
word house though it was very
superficial was the beginning of a
scientific work on the meaning of elves
if we want to go beyond we do what you
and I were just talking about we think
of the various ways in which something
might or might not
colder house and with special properties
it does like house has a special
exterior social painting in your
painting the exterior not the interior
that's part of the meaning of house
there million other things okay then
stop MOOC call IDs and ID ideals and
ideas in this book distinction between
language and thought very basic
definition one of them is the system
that worked at with producer sentences
according to me to the to the needs
according to the needs and what that is
like
the Lexus that is a like a very basic
definition it is not that simple but not
really too much about the thought
because we have no definition of it what
so Alan Turing the great mathematician
who created or official intelligence is
famous for asking about whether machines
can think they started off his famous
article by saying the question whether
machines think is too ridiculous tis too
meaningless to deserve discussion
because we have no clear idea what
thought is he says it's just some
buzzing in the head
it is so you cannot say much about it
okay so what if I say that we got the
system and Lexus just use for for
scientific purposes let's say that these
two entities the Lexus and and the
system that produces sentences okay we
can we say that these two are different
well what we can say is that we can
study linguistically articulated thought
we can study the thought that's
expressed by the sentence it's raining
outside that kind of thought we can
study because we have an entry point
into it namely the way it's it's
captured in language but there are a lot
of other things that loosely are thought
of as thought like my dog decided to
thinks about the fact that it wants food
we have no way of capturing what's going
on okay so and so what what is what is
the main motivation for stating that
these two are different then the C so
you say that language and info are
different we don't know what for we
don't know because we don't know what
thought is other than those aspects of
thought that are captured in language
it's probably the reason why fun home
boat simply said that thought just is
language okay I mean there may be that
might look suppose my daughter I see my
dog looking at the place where food
usually is I say to myself oh she's
thinking about food is she I have no
idea what's going on
is it thinking it looks to be like
thinking doesn't mean anything
okay what about if I say that I
understand the problem but what about if
I say that the computational system is
different from the rest from the rest
from the other processes because we got
a computational system well we can study
other processes insofar as they reduce
their captured by the computational
system what goes on beyond we just don't
know much disabled but even even in that
case it is not possible to say that
these two are different you can say is
what my dog is doing different from
what's captured in language doesn't mean
anything
because we have no concept thought clear
enough to determine to study we just
when you can study all kinds of things
like what's what are the stimuli that
she's reacting to how does he react to
these what kind of associations
but is it thought we don't clear enough
to answer okay so when you say that this
concept about language mean an
instrument is like an ultimate comment
it is it an ultimate ultimate conclusion
or its scientific thesis in which you
try to there is evidence like for
example simple evidence I mentioned okay
so these pieces as you call it it has
like two centuries no to mean it's mm
that is parrot two thousand years ago
absolutely discussed for thousands of
years now for various reasons including
the modern development of the theory of
computation we can study it much more
carefully than was done in the past
