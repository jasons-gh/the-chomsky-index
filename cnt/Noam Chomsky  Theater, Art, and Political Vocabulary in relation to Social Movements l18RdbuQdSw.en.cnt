lots of ways to do in fact
yeah ninety-nine percent 1% wasn't in
the media year ago now it's a routine
discussion that people are thinking
about things in a different way than
they did before just in a very few
months of the Occupy movement actually
there's some polls on it which maybe
you've seen there was a like a pupil
which asked people that has been asking
people at various times what do you
think about inequality and concern over
inequality shut up very fast after
September just from the effect of I
assume it's the effect of the Occupy
movement which has just permeated a lot
of mainstream discourse now that can be
co-opting too you know so sure powerful
systems will try to incorporate what
they see is working and turn it to their
own needs whether it's human rights or
you name it of course that's what
they'll try to do so for example after
the two thousand eight election which
generated a lot of enthusiasm there was
a right after the election there was a
annual conference of the advertisers
Association whatever they call
themselves and every year they give a
prize for the best marketing campaign of
the year and that year they gave it to
Obama he beat out Apple computers and if
you take a look at the business press
right afterwards which is interesting
are they quoting executive of CEOs and
so on they're very excited about it they
said this is a new model for how we can
behave in the to the public in the
middle room and so are we can use this
model that worked so well at deluding
people in via two thousand eight
election so sure no they don't i ran it
but they learn lessons from it the use
of human rights is quite an interesting
case but it's truth just like takes a
bud there was a huge anti-nuclear
movement in the early 1980s it was you
know like 80 huge demonstrations
millions of people try to get rid of
nuclear
weapons and the Reagan administration
cleverly co-opted it they came out and
said yeah great idea we're all with you
against nuclear weapons let's have Star
Wars that's how they got the Star Wars
thing through and they diffuse the
movement made it sound as if it was the
first nuclear weapons of course we know
it was but better of course they're
going to do in and can you change the
discourse sure I mean I don't know what
I mentioned about the meeting with Lulu
but monthly were quoting from it it was
kind of interesting so for example this
was before he was elected and he was
quite popular his she looked at opinion
polls he was highest in the opinion
polls but he never won an election
mostly was because they were both
corruption you know the election was
bought off the last minute is a huge
flood of propaganda you know advertising
and so on but I asked at one point did
he think he ever would be able to win
the election if there wasn't corruption
and so on he said he didn't think would
be possible and the reason was he said
what he said is I know the mentality of
the peasant that's what I come from and
when they go into the voting booth and
they ask themselves it could somebody
like me run a country they'll say no it
has to be one of those rich white guys
so even if they want me they're gonna
vote for those other people couple years
later he won the mentality changed and
it's changed all over Latin America
indigenous people you know for people
it's just a radical change so of course
it can be done and I the kind of thing
with it he took me to see in the suburb
which you mentioned this is one of the
ways in which could be done and there
plenty of I'm in the in Bolivia the
around the same time about ten years ago
the mobilization on the effort to
privatize water are led to a real
revolution in the country the first time
you know hundreds of years that the
indigenous popular
has been able to enter the political
arena and take over political power
that's it's kind of interesting the way
that governments are reacting the
government's in the corporation still
want to privatize water but they learn
that the Bolivian method that is
dangerous because it led to a
practically a revolution they threw out
a big corporation to insulin so what
there was in southern Colombia recently
visiting villages and there they what
the government of Colombia is apparently
trying to do is to pick four villages
off for the region's off one at a time
so if you come into some for remote
danger villages and you give them a line
about how great the water will be if we
just don't buy your land up there where
the virgin forest is we can maybe get
them to accept it or a strikingly
they're resisting organizing and
resisting but these things have you know
that classful so the point of view the
rich and powerful class were never stops
it's permanent they're involved in a
constant bitter class war very
self-conscious they want everybody else
not the practice of it but they're
always taking brooke carrying it out
that's why we're rich and powerful
