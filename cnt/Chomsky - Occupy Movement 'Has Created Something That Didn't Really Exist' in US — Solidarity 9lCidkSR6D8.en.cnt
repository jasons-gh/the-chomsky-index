now democracynow.org the war and peace
report I'm Amy Goodman is to return to
my conversation with the activist
scholar author Noam Chomsky professor of
linguistics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology I asked for his
assessment of President Obama's
presidency in many ways it's a little
worse than what I expected but it
expecting anything actually I wrote
about Obama before the primaries just
looking at his webpage so take the
Middle East take a look at his web page
before the primary small stuff that
Middle East most of it is how his
undying love for Israel which just you
know becomes everything else he also no
mention of the Palestinians and fries
this was done at the time this is the
right after the last last of the israeli
invasion of lebanon after the fifth in
2006 and he one of the things he's proud
of about the Middle East posted that is
that he says in the fact he did very
little in the Senate but one of the
things that he did was co-sponsor a
resolution in the midst of the war
insisting that the United States do
nothing that might impede the Israel
attack on Lebanon until it reaches its
objectives and centering Syria and Iran
because they're allegedly supporting the
resistance to this really attract that
is one great achievement with regard to
the Middle East so nothing that's
happened there is any surprise with
regard to other issues he was as himself
put it sometimes a kind of a blank slate
in saying that was vague talk about kind
of nice things I don't usually admire
Sarah Palin but when she was making fun
of this hopey changey stuff she was
right there was nothing there and it was
understood by the people who run the
political system so it's a great secret
that the u.s. electoral system is mainly
public relations extravaganzas they keep
away from issues it's a sort of a
marketing affair the people who run out
of the advertisers and they had their
national convention right after the two
thousand eight election and revealed
that they understood perfectly what was
going on so they gave Obama the award
for the best mac marketing campaign of
the year if you go to the business press
they were reporting how executives were
really excited and we have this new
model as to how to you know
do people of Macedon we just used the
Reagan novel now use the about model for
delusional systems that we construct
which is pretty much what the pr
industry's about so they captured it
properly I mean he's there a couple of
things that he did that I think he had a
couple good appointments to the NLRB
National Labor Relations Board he a few
actions here and there that anything
kind of Club he just announced his
support of same-sex marriage first u.s.
president to do that all not quite yes
he did but he said have to go to the
state so states right version that kind
of means state to do it they like
talking 30 states have constitutional
amendments against same-sex just a
couple of days ago yeah i'm glad he said
it but it's a pretty safe labor he was
there was a huge effort by the labor
movement to get him into office first
thing he did was click on the face no
car jack in fact what happened the
health program was quite interesting
has no of course it was a very important
senatorial election january two thousand
ten after that uh senator kennedy died
in massachusetts liberal state and what
was at stake was not just his position
but the filibuster-proof majority
critical the democrats lost that
election pretty dramatic and it was
carefully analyzed the make of it was
first a little what kind of money
pouring in to support the Republican
hand today this was a kind of a vacuum
she followed it i'm scott brown here's
my truck you know that was the campaign
but was quite interesting was the and in
the suburbs more less affluent suburbs
voting was pretty high in the downtown
areas the urban areas were working class
and for people that voting is quite low
that was quite interesting as the union
vote which was analyzed union members
the majority of them voted against a
foot for the republican me against obama
that was investigated to her furious
they had worked really hard to put obama
into office he broke Louis promises to
them but furthermore the health plan
that one of the promises was the sub guy
national health care and because I think
he could have achieved it for example
squirt for the public option was about
three to two made any effort that was
rude but not only did he not put that
through but the one thing that he
insisted on was cutting back what we're
called Cadillac health plans that should
be called Chevrolet health plans and
those are the health plans that union
workers had fought for four years look
at the history of the American labor
movement it's I've abandoned all sorts
of things all along the way no rights of
workers in the workplace all kinds of
things but insisted it didn't make one
game made a compact with management
contract that they get good benefits
health benefits for themselves not for
the country of course the compact like
that lasts only as long as business
decides to keep it
it's over that they did have reasonable
health plans for themselves those are
the Cadillac health plan so the one
thing Obama wanted to do was to kill the
health plans that they had sacrificed
for and fought for for 50 years giving
up plenty of other things in the
struggle and they were very angry but
and understandable and I think if you
look at other constituencies it's
approximately the same it takes the
environmental issues
how much his attitude for the tar sands
and the fracking the XL pipeline is
characteristic so in his State of the
Union address last State of the Union
address he emphasized the fact that
we're in a great sedition we have maybe
a hundred years of energy independence
ahead of us using these methods which
are going to destroy the environment so
those what things would be like an odd
reviewers may be unlivable but that's
that's the but it sounded nice I'll put
off the decision for a couple months I
just have the southern part of the
pipeline bill not the park across the
border that will come next way you're
not looking but it's been that way on
issue after version and yet it's under
President Obama or you might say because
of President Obama that the occupy
movement has blossomed in this country
talk about the significance of occupied
well the occupy movement is it was a big
surprise know if anybody asked me a year
ago this is as possible as it's crazy
but I'm try but it like it litter spar
took off there now occupy movement
sit-ins
thousands of our city's Fred overseas I
was in Australia recently went to the
Occupy movements in Melbourne is one of
Hong Kong you know everywhere and
they're parallel movements in Europe
it's it's the first that man it's very
significant actually already and it's
only been around for months so
achievement that the two kinds of
achievement such I think her have her in
a dapper in effect that probably is
permanent but anyway significant one is
they just changed the national discourse
so issues that had been marginalized dip
familiar but he didn't talk about like
inequality shredding of the credit
process financial corruption
environmental issues all these things
they became they moved to the center of
the discussion in fact you can't even
see it from the imagery that's used you
read about the ninety nine percent in
the one-percent the fresh from the
business breath that's just changed the
way lots people looking at things in
fact the polls show that concern over
inequality among the general public Rose
pretty sharply after the Occupy movement
started very probably as a consequence
and there are other policy issues that
came to the fore which are significant
the other aspect which my estimation may
be more significant is that the Occupy
movement
taneously created something that doesn't
really exist in the country communities
of mutual support cooperation open
spaces for discussion
that it just developed them
system library common kitchen just
people doing things and helping each
other that's very much missing there's a
massive propaganda good going on for
this entry but picking up for enormously
that you really shouldn't care about
anyone else you just care about yourself
you pay attention yourself we don't want
anything else you take a look at the
attitudes among young people that's it's
cold it's studied it's remarkably high
so it was just a study that came out
from the Harvard Public Policy Institute
found that scary results if it less than
this is what people kids 18 to 24
college students faces less than half of
them I think that the government has a
responsibility to deal with things like
health care food and so on when they say
the government doesn't have a
responsibility it's kind of an
interesting concept if people thought
they were living in a democracy they
would say they would ask the question
whether it's a public responsibility
but again the propaganda system is
designed to make you feel that the
government is some alien force that's
against you you want to keep it out keep
it away from your affairs in a
democratic society would be quite
different like you can see it on april
fifteenth in a good measure of the
extent to which a democratic system is
functioning is how people feel about
taxes if you had a functioning
democratic society april fifteenth would
be a day of celebration it's the day in
which we get together and fund the
policies that we've decided on and that
we've gotten our representatives to
approve of it's not what it is here that
they it's a day of mourning justice egg
enforce is going to steal things from
you well that's the kind of thing that
the occupied moon began to break it's a
yeah we're in it together that's what
the old labor movement used to be
as a kid in 30 the situation was object
is much worse but then my family is
mostly unemployed working class your new
york but the business of hopefulness
largely because of the labor organizer
which amount provided benefits to people
involved but also made them part of
something which we can work together the
term solidarity's wasn't just the
vacuous term to rebuild that kind of
thing so even if it's some small pieces
of the society can become very important
change the conception of how society or
the front there's this whole issue of
the Posse Comitatus which most people
agree with the fact that US soldier
should not not be marching in the
streets of the United States but do you
think authorities are getting around
this now by militarizing the police the
kind of response were seeing to the
Occupy encampments all over this country
and well we'll see what happens is the
protest build around the Democratic and
Republican conventions NATO that's
happening in Chicago and beyond the
power systems don't say thank you and
disappear of course they don't respond
and respondent various ways I mean
what's happening now is long but we
ought to bear in mind that it's nothing
like what happened in the recent past so
for example we don't have COINTELPRO
remember not many years ago the national
political police FBI was organizing stop
of style assassinations of organizers
for Hampton totally undermined left
tried to sway the women's movement or
all over the place that's mostly the
black movements are just pulverized by
the repression well what's happening as
bad but it's not that and that's sure
but it's going to be responses and
that's not the only case after all I
mean it went part of the you look at
Obama's programs the part that really
did surprise me and I don't frankly
understand it this is attacking civil
liberties which is extreme he's gone
beyond Bush it's some of the worst cases
aren't even discussed like one I think
one of the worst cases is the supreme
court case holder the humanitarian law
project which was initiated by the Obama
administration brought to the court by
the administration argued for the
government by Elena Kagan
is for court of my team if you look at
the decision it was kind of welcomed by
there were even the right-wing justices
didn't accept all of it but they
accepted part of it the person but that
issue was with was whether this group
humanitarian law project was criminally
liable for giving material support to a
terrorist group the material support in
question was legal advice to the PKK
giving them legal advice that was
material support you read the wording
you and I many people we know are liable
under this if we've met people who the
government calls are claims are
terrorists they don't give any reason
for things of your terrorist like
Mandela for example if you meet with
them and you talk to them and you advise
them in fact if you advise them to carry
out nonviolent tactics you're giving
material support under the Obama
interpretation of material support
materials for it used to mean beginning
in arms that's it but it extended by
this to your speech to them that's a
very wide ranging in
ominous stand and it was it i should add
on the side that the whole concept of on
the terrorist list are being accused of
a terrorist is something that should not
be tolerated in a free society I mean
kind of Mandel is a good example if the
government says you're a terrorist that
ends no recourse no argument needed no
justification for anybody like on the
terrorist list isn't the idea that they
decide who's a terrorist is granting to
state power something we've never had a
free society so not only is that should
that be intolerable and not of course
not Obama goes with that I buttocks and
extending the notion material support to
discussions with advice to them
that's it should be beyond discussion
it's a fairly discussed there are others
that are pretty bad too like the attack
on whistleblowers you know is more
whistleblowers have been under attack by
this administration in all of our
history put together this is an attempt
to strengthen executive power and
executive privilege keep secret from the
population because India is not a case I
mean it's not it's an issue should be
good I think that all these extensions
of state power and violations of civil
rights are significant that we should
bear in mind that we're a lot freer than
people here have been in the past and
certainly a lot freer than in other
countries so it's bad but you shouldn't
there's plenty of opportunities to do
things MIT professor Noam Chomsky if
you'd like a DVD of today's show you can
go to our website at democracynow.org
coming up he speaks about WikiLeaks the
assassination of bin Laden occupy Latin
America and what gives him hope
