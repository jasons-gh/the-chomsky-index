well listen we want to just say us to
start off I'm going to do a little intro
for you and what are you doing what's
the general store we're going to talk
about your whole life in about 20
seconds but no I'm just joking of course
but what was your framework where we're
attempting to find out about the great
one of the greatest minds in America and
we're looking at him right here and one
of the things that we're just so proud
of as we've been following you little
did we know of what a mark you would
make on our country but back in the 80s
or 70s we came up with thistle that they
had a magazine called covert action
which I also was along with my soldier
of fortune magazine I also subscribe to
your magazine to find out what was going
on in the world and from that point of
view hit any rate well first of all I'm
going to say a few things and then if
there's anything that's not exactly but
bigger yeah we have a bigger the bigger
project jerusalem's that I say it is
we're going to just talk about well
variety of issues on Vietnam and no no I
mean it's error interview for a bigger
project no this is it's a one-of-a-kind
it's 01 only it's not going to be
anything that's going to step step in
the way there but it going to do it
it'll be on the web 24-7 there's no
money involved i'm sorry to say we we
were not we don't have distribution yes
so this is going to be another liquor of
love for us to the people of the world
and doing things like this for we've
been doing things like this for about
seven years and cutting edges is
designed to reach the be a part of media
that no one covers then no one finds out
about a gnome Chomsky is written up and
seen on television but you get a 20
second sound bite you never get the
context of what you're
or you know you're any specific
auditorium giving a specific speech
about a specific item for hours we don't
do any of that what we attempt to do is
to focus it and to try to reach down and
say here's a man who's got a 30 degrees
30 rnf therefore a medium we're not
correct now and what we're saying here
you have 30 honorary degrees from all
over the world for your for your work in
linguistics you have over a hundred we
don't even know how many books that
you've written since nineteen what 67 or
was it before that so so your new jersey
yours and you're the most well thought
up a man i don't think i don't think if
you want to nobel prize for anything you
got the cotto price which is the
japanese counterpart same thing yeah
sort of sort of it's not famous it's the
Japanese effort pendants bro this with
spaces and now you're talking about
you're talking about linguistics and I'd
like to just follow that a little
further how many languages do you speak
one sort of but you bet you've done this
incredible study and set groundbreaking
will stir for linguistic philosophy and
for computer science and old raft of
other dishes right that was theoretical
work not about but I don't press a his
material Picard language is that the
last guy who was here to the desert
that should Gary right Jessie and Gary
enter but you know it's kind of like
theoretical physicist using material
from experimental businesses well you
know you got started a couple of things
that never know we couldn't find out
about just so I'm going to ask you the
first one is did you ever serve any time
in the service of our country in the
Armed Forces no and I have no idea why I
was 18 but that overcoat you seem to be
at the right age for Korea I was Korea
and went through you know call it no was
the draft yeah it was classified money
actually what I think happened is I I
asked I didn't have a PhD really had
intend to get one but I asked the draft
word for a six-week extension it was
april first so that I just finish up PhD
and they granted me the six-week
extension and I applied it wasn't even
registered and sort of quickly faked my
way through PhD we're coming in of
course of course not no let me ask you
this you know you started being on the
radar screen of America in a big way
back in the Vietnam era which is about
67 what was the name of the first book
you're up you remember the first book
publisher was
power endurance which was mostly a
collection of art it was a collection of
articles almost entirely from from
sections from the 60s yeah now you you
know we're one of the big voices now
modern days that I need to jump that far
that's a huge jump but no you're
considered the darling of the of the the
left in one regard you considered I mean
the people have calls you everything
good I mean from the very best to the
very worst but there's no doubt that
they everyone has an opinion about Noam
Chomsky they really do and we had in our
study of you we found a couple of people
that have particular really appointed
areas about you and one of them was a
guy by the name of David Horowitz who
wrote about the 101 most dangerous
professors in America and I don't know
which number of you were I couldn't find
that very good you were pretty high up
in the list of evil it was dangerous and
and then there was a guy also by the
name of Condor Dorota I have that
somewhere that took a co hn Warner Khan
or something like that rare yes and he's
a famous guy that wrote about how you
were such a anti-semitic and a naysayer
to the you know and and all these other
things so we got all these great
anything you do a Google search you'll
get a sample of the letter good but
question I get every night every night
and I'm sure to get at least letters
from at least for industries that one of
them claims I want
the second claims of a Mossad agent the
third came claimed on an American the
fourth claims MCI age and they're
guaranteed arena no that's that's the
part of the story of a bit let's let's
do it let's do a little fallback
position a couple of things to clear up
because you got involved in and I and I
think we need to this is an area no
one's ever really I don't think they've
asked you but we're trying to be
innovative here in dr. junkie we don't
want to be the same old step for you
back in the Vietnam era when this was
started they had of course we had the
Watergate situation that came later but
there was there was always he's doubt
you've never doubted picking on the
Republicans and Democrats whoever was in
office it seems like you're always you
know really saying something not too
positive even about JFK or about Lyndon
Baines Johnson or about Nixon there were
some positive things in fact it'll more
than mainly LBJ who pushed through some
significant domestic measures but not
even not in foreign policy and foreign
policy the differences are pretty sight
the johnson didn't really initiate much
of the way a foreign policy he was in
Vietnam had tracked but was happening
I think he had that pursuit they did but
it was already underway I'm the invasion
it's not that's not the way it's
discussed here the fact of the matter is
that the invasion of south vietnam which
was the main part of the war was in 1962
Kennedy and contrary to Allah
mythologies Kennedy remained walk to the
day of the assassination he was his as
well he was afraid of those dominoes
falling up see that the domino theory
has two versions one of them is intended
for the public and it's ridiculous that
keeps being refuted and people say about
it was terrible state the other version
is very sensible and it keeps being
presumed all the time the version for
the public is pick your poaching in
let's say is going to get into a new
land in California rape your
grandmother's or something that's
caricature of the version for the public
and the main can change right now it's
charges it's about some videos that
continually gets refuted and people say
I guess we
steak but this is sensible personal
development of theory which never gets
refuted because it's correct and that's
the one that actually applies an
intervention after intervention would it
it claims is with some possibility that
if there is successful independent
development in some corner of the world
and the poor countries are more
dangerous than the rich countries in
this respect but if it succeeds
somewhere it's a grenade Laos or any
great place to think of others who have
similar problems nearby are going to
raise questions of why not us and then
to use Henry Kissinger's terminology the
virus spreads spreads contagion
elsewhere would you say that that was
related to something like Mozambique
because it were they were supposed to be
mozambique was supposed to be this great
that was a socialist you know an
independent nation that was going to
turn everything around and make it
beautiful for everyone and say in case
after case and we don't know because
every one of them almost I think it bear
it it gets attacked and destroyed now is
this related also to IND and an
Argentine was at the similar situation
where Kissinger used the phrase virus
that will spread contagion elsewhere and
he was afraid it was red contagion as
far as southern Europe not because
Chilean armies were going to
Rome you know but because the prospect
of a democratic social democratic
government operating through
parliamentary means and carrying out
independent programs contrary to the
wishes of the United States might
influence southern Europe at that point
the danger but their gardens the danger
was what welding duro con is that was
the former communist parties which were
becoming sort of social democratic and
it's kind of interesting that Kissinger
was Krishna it's just as worried about
this Disney let me decidi we're certain
that in other words these are countries
that are operating independently without
any help from either in the united
states are either USSR that's the only
you know how do they will you can drive
them into support from the USSR muslim
don't want but in case after case the US
has driven the country's at one of the
states that wanted undermine into the
hands of the Russians and then use that
as a pretext for invincibility attack
keep cutting and this is the thought
that I've been wondering about that I
know that you might be alien our concept
is to get cheap labor you don't only
have any environmental concerns and
build products out of our country that's
the way we make the products that are in
a sheepish thing we can find a walmart
is because we can do this that's the
current version that's the courier for
mlk's that that's not unique to the
United States every substantial great
power as that similar views the United
States happens to work dominant powers
so our day is to have an international
vertor which is open to penetration
control by domestic sources of power
it's not a secret who the domestic
sources of power are in the United
States us-based international
corporations they should have access to
the resources and markets and investment
opportunities and so on okay let's stop
there Justin help me after you mentioned
several times energy companies you
mentioned as I think there's four groups
that you have identified in the United
States and consider the power brokers of
these international corporations can't
somebody difficult a sudden sister it's
mostly most of them r us babies okay but
those of you sucking can you call them
the seven sisters and what would help
but I cool that's how they holdin by
everyone in polluters oh okays of the
big concentrations but now they're kind
of diversified but like X and buy
another a lot of become conglomerates
right those here to see energy companies
what about ADM and some of these that
are those are those time to companies
you
