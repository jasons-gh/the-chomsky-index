the war and peace report
I'm Amy Goodman as we continue a
conversation with MIT professor Noam
Chomsky world renowned political
dissident and linguist who's written
over a hundred books including Gaza in
crisis I spoke with him on Thursday in
the midst of the initial 72-hour
ceasefire I asked professor Chomsky
about Congress unanimously passing
resolutions last month in support of
Israel that's right because and that's
exactly what we have to combat by
organization and action take South
Africa again it wasn't until the 1980s
that Congress began to pass sanctions as
I said Reagan vetoed them and then
violated them the never passed over his
veto but at least they were passing them
but that's you know decades after
massive protests were developing around
the world it in fact you know BDS style
tactics that was never be deus movement
the BDS style tactics began to be
carried out on a popular level in the
United States beginning in the late
seventies but really picking up in the
80s
that's decades after a large-scale
actions of that kind were being taken
elsewhere and ultimately that had an
effect well we're not there yet
you have to recall it's important to
recall that by the time Congress was
passing sanctions against South Africa
the American business community which
really is decisive and determining
policy had pretty much turned against
apartheid just wasn't worth it for them
and as I said the agreement that was
finally reached was acceptable to them
difference from the Israeli case we're
not there now right now Israel is one of
the top
recipients of the US investment that
Warren Buffett for example recently
bought a couple of billion dollars spent
put some factory in Israel installment
and said that this is the best place for
investment outside the United States
Intel is setting up its major a new
generation chip factory their military
industry is closely linked to Israel
although this is quite different from
the South Africa case we have to work as
it'll take a lot of work to get and you
know I'm you say that the analogy
between Israel's occupation of the
territories and apartheid South Africa
is a dubious one why many reasons for
take say the term apartheid in the
occupied territories what Israel is
doing is much worse than apartheid to
call it apartheid is a gifted Israel at
least if by apartheid you mean South
african-style apartheid what's happening
they occupied territories is much worse
there's a crucial difference
the South African nationalists needed
the black population that was their
workforce with 85 percent of the
workforce of the population and that was
basically their workforce they needed
them they had to sustain them the
bathtub stands were horrifying but South
Africa didn't try to sustain them they
didn't put them on a diet
they tried to keep them strong enough to
do the work they needed for the country
they tried to get international support
for the better stance the Israeli
relationship to the Palestinians and the
occupied territories is totally
different they just don't want them they
want them out or at least in prison
that's a rat under acting that way
that's a very striking difference which
means that the apartheid analogy South
African apartheid to the West back to
the occupied territories is just a gift
Israeli violence it's much worse than
that if you look inside Israel there's
plenty of repression and discrimination
of written about it extensively for
decades but it's not apartheid it's bad
but it's not apartheid so the term I
just don't think is applicable I wanted
to get your response to gear alone
former Israeli national security adviser
speaking to the New York Times
Alon said quote you cannot win against
an effective guerrilla organization when
on the one hand you're fighting them and
on the other hand you continue to supply
them with water and food and gas and
electricity Israel should have declared
a war against the de facto state of Gaza
and if there's misery and starvation in
Gaza it might lead the other side to
make such hard decisions Noam Chomsky if
you could respond to this that's that's
basically the debate within the Israeli
political echelon should we follow the
vice glosses position of maintaining
them on a diet of bare survival so you
make sure children don't get chocolate
bars but you allow them to have safe
Cheerios in the morning can you explain
that because when you've talked about it
before it sort of sounds more but this
diet sounds like a metaphor but can you
explain what you meant when you said
actual diet like you're talking number
of calories you're actually talking
about whether kids can have chocolate
Israel has Israeli experts have
calculated in detail exactly how many
calories literally gazans need to
survive and if you look at the sanctions
that they impose their grotesque I mean
even John Kerry condemned them bitterly
their sadistic just enough calories to
survive and of course it is partly
metaphoric because it means just enough
material coming in through the tunnels
so that they don't totally die Israel
restricts medicines but you have to
allow a little trickle in when I was
there right before the November 2012
assault visited the onions Hospital and
the director showed us that there's they
don't even have us they don't even have
simple medicines but they have something
so the dye and the same is true with all
aspects of keep on a diet literally and
the reason is very simple and they
pretty much said it if they die
something look good for Israel a we may
claim that we're not the occupying power
but the rest of the world doesn't agree
even the United States doesn't agree
we are the occupying power and if we
kill off the population under occupation
not going to look good it's not the 19th
century when as the u.s. expanded over
its territory territory it pretty much
exterminated the indigenous population
well by 19th centuries Imperial
standards that was unproblematic this is
a little different today
you can't exterminate the population in
the territories that you occupy that's
the dovish position vice Clause the
hawkish position is islands which you
quoted let's just kill them off and who
do you think is going to prevail as I
speak to you in the midst of this
ceasefire the Vice Glaus position will
prevail because Israel just you know
it's it's already becoming an
international pariah and internationally
hated if it went on to pursue Highlands
recommendations even the United States
wouldn't be able to support it you know
interestingly while the Arab countries
most of them have not spoken out
strongly against what Israel has done in
Gaza Latin American countries one after
another from Brazil to Venezuela
Bolivia have a number of them have
recalled their ambassadors to Israel I
believe Bolivian President Evo Morales
called Israel a terrorist state can you
talk about Latin America and its
relationship with Israel just remember
the Arab countries means the Arab
dictators our friends it doesn't mean
the Arab populations
our enemies but what you said about
Latin America is very significant not
long ago
Latin America was what was called the
backyard they did whatever we said we
did strategic planning and very little
was said about Latin America because
they were under our domination if you
don't like something that happens we
install a military dictatorship or
carrier back huge massacres and so on
but basically they do what we say last
10 or 15 years that's changed and it's a
historic change it's for the first time
in five hundred years since the
conquistadors Latin America is moving
towards degree of Independence of
imperial domination and also a degree of
integration which is critically
important and what you just described is
one striking example of it in the entire
world as far as I know only a few Latin
American countries have taken a
Honorable position on this issue Brazil
Chile Peru Ecuador El Salvador have
withdrawn ambassadors and protests they
joined Bolivian Venezuela which had done
it even earlier in reaction to other
atrocities that's unique and it's not
the only example it was a very striking
example I guess maybe a year or so ago
the open society forum did a study of
support for rendition the rendition of
course is the most extreme form
of torture what you do is take people
you assess people you don't like and you
send them to your favorite dictatorship
so they'll be tortured Cortez
that was the CIA program of
extraordinary renditions of the study
was who support who took part in it well
of course the Middle East dictatorships
did you know Syria Assad the Mubarak and
others because that's where he sent them
to be tortured Gadhafi they took part
Europe almost all of it
participating England Sweden other
countries permitted abetted the transfer
of the prisoners to the torture chambers
for to be grotesquely tortured in fact
if you look over the world there was
only really one exception the Latin
American countries refused to
participate now that is pretty
remarkable for one thing because it
shows their independence but for another
while they were under US control they
were the torture torture center of the
world
not long ago a couple of decades ago
that's a real change and by now if you
look at hemispheric conferences the
United States and Canada are isolated
the last major hemispheric conference
couldn't come to a consensus decision on
the major issues because the US and
Canada didn't agree with the rest of the
hemisphere the major issues were
admission of Cuba into the hemispheric
system and steps towards
decriminalization of of drugs that's a
terrible burden on the Latin Americans
the problem is lies in the United States
in the Latin American countries even the
right-wing ones I want to free
themselves of that US and Canada
wouldn't go along
these are very significant changes in
world affairs I wanted to turn to
Charlie Rose interviewing the Hamas
leader holla'd Michelle this was in July
Michelle called for an end to Israel's
occupation of Gaza
this is not a prerequisite life is not
political that life is a right for our
people in Palestine since 2006 when the
world refused the outcomes of the
elections our people actually lived
under the siege of eight years this is a
collective punishment we need to lift
the siege we have to have a port we have
to have an airport this is the first
message the second message in order to
stop the bleeding
we need to look at the underlying causes
we need to look at the occupation we to
stop the occupation Netanyahu doesn't
take heed of our rights mr. Kerry months
ago tried to find a window through the
negotiations in order to meet our target
to live without the occupation to reach
our state Netanyahu has killed killed
our dream and he killed the American
initiative that is the Hamas leader
Khaled Mashal in his last few minutes we
have left Noam Chomsky talk about the
demands of Hamas and what harlot
Michelle just said well he was basically
reiterating what he and it's Melanie and
other Hamas spokespersons have been
saying for a long time in fact if you go
back to 1988 when Hamas was formed even
before there that became a functioning
organization they their leadership
chef Sen who was assassinated by Israel
others offered settlement proposals
which were turned down and it remains
pretty much the same by now it's quite
overt takes effort to failed to see it
you can read it in the Washington
what they propose is they accept the
international consensus on a two-state
settlement they say yes let's have a
two-state settlement on the
international border they do not they
say they don't go on to say we'll
recognize Israel but they say yes let's
have a two-state settlement in a very
long purse maybe 50 years and then we'll
see what happens
that's been their proposal all along
that's far more forthcoming than any
proposal in Israel but that's not the
way it's presented here what you read is
all they're interested in is destruction
of Israel really which here is Bob
Schieffer stipe of repetition of the
most vulgar Israeli propaganda but that
has been their position it's it's not
that they're nice people like I wouldn't
vote for them but that is their position
six billion dollars of damage and Gaza
right now about 1,900 Palestinians are
dead not clear actually how many as the
ruble hasn't all been dug out at this
point half a million refugees you've got
something like 180,000 in the schools
the shelters and what does that mean for
schools because they're supposed to be
starting in a few weeks when when the
Palestinians are living in these schools
makeshift shelters so what is the
reality on the ground that happens now
as these negotiations take place in
Egypt well there is a kind of a slogan
that's been used for years Israel
destroys Gazans rebuild Europe pays
it'll probably be something like that
until the next episode of mowing the
lawn and what will happen unless US
policy changes what very likely to
happen is that
we'll continue with the policies it has
been executing no reason for them to
stop from their point of view and it's
what I said take what you want in the
West Bank integrated into Israel leave
the Palestinians there and unviable
Canton's separated from Gaza keep guys
on that diet under siege of course
control keeps away Golan Heights and try
to develop a greater Israel this is not
for security reasons incidentally if
that's been understood by the Israeli
leadership for decades back around 1970
I suppose observe i'ts months later the
president here at General Air Force
general later president pointed out
correctly that taking over the
territories does not improve our
security situation in fact probably
makes it worse but he said it allows
Israel to live at the scale of at the
scale and with the quality that we now
enjoy in other ways we can be a rich
powerful expansion but you hear
repeatedly Hamas has in its charter a
call for the destruction of Israel and
how do you guarantee that these
thousands of rockets that threaten the
people of Israel I don't continue very
first of all if you Tomas charter means
practically nothing the only people to
pay attention to it are Israeli
propagandists and love it it was a
charter put together by a small group of
people under siege under attack in 1988
and it's essentially meaningless
there are charters that mean something
but they're not talked about so for
example the electoral program of
Israel's governing party Likud States
explicitly that there can never be a
Palestinian state west of the Jordan
River and they not only state it in
their charter that's a call for the
destruction of Palestine explicit call
for it and they don't only have it there
Charter you know their electoral program
but they implement it that's quite
different from the Hamas charter MIT
professor Noam Chomsky world-renowned
linguist political dissident he's
written more than a hundred books among
his latest Gaza in crisis I interviewed
him on Thursday and it's the initial
72-hour ceasefire in Gaza this hour was
part two of our conversation if you
