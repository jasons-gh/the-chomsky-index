that doesn't really matter it's again
the similarity of the third world is
very close back in nineteen this is
what's called economic health and when
you win this Carrie Ghose happens you
call it an economic miracle another
technical term so for example Brazil was
a terrific economic miracle under the
neo-nazi generals that we installed with
great self adulation back in the 60s and
by 1971 it had become the Latin American
darling of the business community and
the president general ran place pointed
out that the economy is doing fine it's
just that the people aren't well we just
we have a Nobel Prize winner who just
won the Nobel Prize last year's last
time Robert Lucas of Chicago and he was
interviewed by The Wall Street Journal
and said we've been doing great and have
been for a long time he didn't even
bother to add what the Brazilian general
did it's only the people who aren't
doing well what he means by we is the
top 5% or maybe top 10% and that's right
we've been doing great we're doing fine
the economy is fine by now we don't even
worry about the fact that the people
aren't doing so well like bother
repeating the statistics which you know
and he knows perfectly well okay that's
economic miracles we're now beginning to
get one ourselves what about
privatization well again the effects
that are obvious so say in the latest
economic miracle and Mexico
privatization meant as usual handing
over public assets to friends of the
President or you know other rich people
or international investors at a fraction
of the cost and in fact in Mexico the
number of billionaires during the
economic miracle went up even faster
than the percentage of people on the
poverty line as some were doing well and
the people didn't happen to be doing so
well in fact it was a catastrophe for
them even before the collapse so that's
privatization what about property rights
increase of property rights that's very
important in fact
critical aspect of the what are called
misleadingly the free trade agreements
which actually have strong protectionist
elements in them uruguay round the nafta
and so on and one of them is increase of
intellectual property rights go into the
details but what it amounts to is
guaranteeing that major corporations
have a monopoly on the technology and
knowledge of the future and they
extended those to the various devices so
that it's about 50 years before you can
interfere with owned property which
comes from public subsidy usually
through research and then is handed over
to some private corporation and the
wheels allowed to touch it so increasing
property rights has a big effect highly
protectionist measure which is central
to the new trade agreements and has a
long-lasting effect way down the road on
organizing the international economy and
who gains who loses a last element of
the Washington Consensus is reducing
trade barriers and here there's another
scam that you ought to keep your eyes on
the what's called trade in economics is
a very odd notion so for example if ford
motor company moves parts from indiana
at the illinois for assembly and then
moves them back to indiana that's not
called trade but if ford motor company
takes parts inmate in indiana and moves
them across the border to mexico we can
get much cheaper labor and you have to
worry about the you know pollution and
so on and they get reassembled in mexico
and then sent back to say illinois for
value-added that's called exports and
imports never I didn't do with Mexican
economy or in fact any economy it was
all internal to the ford motor company
but its exports and imports so how big
an element is that well about fifty
percent of us trade so about fifty
percent of what's called us trade is
actually internal to individual
corporations meaning controlled by a
very visible hand with all sorts of
methods around for distortion of markets
and you know robbery and so on and so
forth is about the same for Japan and
for the world you know it's hard to get
numbers but what's estimated for the
world is around forty percent of trade
agreements like say
around you know yeah if that increases
what's called trade what it actually
does is increase investor rights that as
it increases the power of transnational
corporations we have to really look
pretty closely to figure out what the
effect is on trade in any meaningful
sense for example it may it may increase
cross-border operations but decreased
rate and a meaningful sense of trade
meaning something that's not under the
control of kind of corporate
mercantilism going on with this it's
perhaps worth noticing that the very
concept of capitalism and markets has
virtually disappeared so for example if
you take the current issue of foreign
affairs there's an article by Joseph Nye
of the Kennedy School and maybe it's
dean of the Kennedy School who explains
that there's a big new weapon in the
hands of American diplomat American
diplomats he says has a diplomacy has a
force multiplier and the reason is
because of the attraction of democracy
and free market enthusiasms of the
United States that's given those things
have given the u.s. real force
multiplier then he spells it out it
comes from Cold War investments in high
technology electronics aviation
telecommunications and so on that's our
free market enthusiasms and democracy
well where did electronics and you know
aviation and telecommunications come
from well from public funds they not
having to it free market they came from
public funds which were transferred to
high technology industry under the
conscious guys deceit of security and it
was conscious so Truman's first
secretary of the Air Force back in
nineteen forty eight pointed out to
Congress that the word to use is not
subsidy the word that uses security and
in fact the whole system was designed
that way and stays that way so that's
the tribute to democracy and the free
markets tribute the democracy and free
markets is you rob the public by deceit
to pay put to enrich the rich that's
free markets and democracy
and it's published without comment
another article in and probably nobody
notices because the concept of
capitalism just like the concept of
democracy is just gone nobody knows what
is democracy means deceive people into
doing what the rich people want and
markets means making sure that make sure
the public subsidize the rich or to take
another example take say the wall street
journal which think the last holdout
with somebody remembers what capitalism
is well they had a front lead article a
couple of weeks ago on various
strategies that states meaning like
states of the union we're using to try
to be more business friendly and the
they pick two examples Virginia and
Maryland who are sort of competing and
to see who can most sponsor
entrepreneurial values of being most
business-friendly and so on and they
said well for a while it looked like
they have somewhat different strategies
that's why they were describing turned
for a while Maryland was doing better
than it turned out Virginia's doing
better now at Virginia is doing better
they're more business-friendly more
gung-ho about business and so on all
right you read the article turns out
it's not Virginia and Maryland what it
is is the suburbs of Washington some of
which are in Virginia and the others of
which are in Maryland and what are the
two business strategies entrepreneurial
strategies well the suburbs of
Washington figured they could rip off by
the National Institute of Health and the
others developed biology based
industries they were looking for
biotechnology and so on a figure that's
going to be the big cash cow and
Virginia which is more business-friendly
decided that the old cash cow the
Pentagon would probably be the best way
to rip off public funds so they were
concentrating on electronics and
telecommunications and so on and it
turned out that virginia had the better
strategy the better business strategy
they made a better guess about which
public funds to rob and that's what it
means to have entrepreneurial values and
it's again reported without comment this
just continues virtually without a break
you know the new york i'll give you one
last example the new yorker had a rather
good article actually you know they by
now the the story about what's happening
to the economy into the population which
used to be what
you know Crazy's on the Left talked
about it's now sort of hit the public
you know so you read it in the
newspapers New Yorker had an article in
which they reviewed the figures on
decline of real wages and you know
increase in profits and the story are
familiar with by a guy named Thomas
Cassidy wasn't a bad article actually
sort of repeated the familiar facts and
then he ended up by saying look no one's
to blame for this it's just the market
in its infinite and mysterious wisdom
just has these effects and there's
nothing you can do about it they get
three examples exactly three examples in
the article of the market in its
infinite and mysterious wisdom namely
grumman mcdonnell douglas and hughes
aircraft you know maybe this is some
kind of subtle irony that I'm missing
but these are three prototypes of
publicly subsidized corporations grumman
hughes mcdonnell douglas they would
exist for two minutes if it wasn't for a
huge public subsidy so that's the market
and it's infinite and mysterious wisdom
when Clinton was announcing his grand
vision of the free market future at the
APEC conference in Seattle II did the
same thing it was in the Boeing terminal
that's where he announced it and he gave
Boeing Boeing as the example of the
grand vision of the free market future
and they're big headlines and all the
newspapers a lot of applause about our
love of the free market and so on it's
unnecessary to come in but it is kind of
interesting what it means is that the
concept of capitalism and markets has
disappeared as fully as the concept of
democracy which is an interesting fact
about the modern period and a kind of a
natural effect of you know of applying
the Washington Consensus at home because
you really have to drive out any
understanding of what's going on namely
that it's really existing free markets
that are being imposed well all of these
current measures share one fundamental
principle and I think it's really part
of it ferc well to two related
fundamental principles one is they
transfer wealth to the wealthy and the
second is they transfer decision-making
power to the wealthy so all of them have
the effect just think of through what
all
every one of them has the effect of
putting more power to make decisions
into the hands of unaccountable private
tyranny what we call corporations
basically totalitarian institutions but
they're on it mostly unaccountable and
that's the effect you think through the
examples every case of the Washington
Consensus applied at home has exactly
this effect and good part of the
propaganda system has the same goal in
this case surely conscious so the
propaganda system is design has been for
years to demonize unions which makes a
lot of sense unions are a democratizing
force in which the mass one of the few
ways in which the large mass of the
population can poop pool limited
resources and work together for some
common good so that's that bad thing
democracy so naturally you want to
demonize and destroy unions and that's
been going on forever and the other
leading propaganda theme and I don't
mean by that you know like just would
hear in the newspaper reading the
newspaper and so on like the
entertainment industry and television
everything else that is anti-politics
meaning setting up a picture it's called
any politics the picture of a very
specific kind of anti politics you have
to establish the image you know get into
people's heads that the government is
the enemy federal government state
governments are okay because they can be
sort of controlled by business anyway so
it doesn't matter but the federal
government's sometimes a little too big
to be pushed around so it's the enemy
and it cannot be nobody can dream of the
possibility that the government is of By
and For the People that's impossible
it's an enemy to be hated and feared not
there are a lot of things wrong with it
but that's not what's wrong with it from
their point of view is that has a big
defect it's potentially influence Allah
population and big enough to stand up
against private power and that's the
defect so you have to regard it as the
enemy it cannot be off by and for the
people it's kind of a them versus us
business this is a
is the government which is the enemy us
is all of us nice people silver working
man loyal wife making extra job these
days the hard-working executive toiling
20 hours a day for the benefit of all
the friendly banker that they're trying
to find give you money that's us you
know and then there's them them as the
outsiders beyond Americans you know the
agitators union organizers big
government and so on and sort of us
versus them that's the picture that has
been rammed into people's heads for at
least 50 or 60 years by intensive
propaganda everywhere movies television
text books just constant and not by
accident this is this part is all
extremely conscious we have a huge
public relations industry which spends
billions of dollars a year on exactly
this sort of thing unconsciously they
didn't tell you about well why is it
happening now not say 30 years ago one
proposal is it's the market and it's
mysterious wisdom we can put that aside
this is perfectly conscious social
policy and also hints under social
control second is we live in lean and
mean times we gotta tighten their belts
complete nonsense I know if you look at
the business press they're just ecstatic
you know I have been for years
businessweek just came out a couple of
days ago with the annual issue on the
top 1000 corporations the headline is
1995 was one for the books America's
most NASA blonde America's most valuable
companies grew even more valuable by a
record 35% that's these lean and mean
times were in another headline in
Business Week reads the problem now what
to do with all that cash as the coppers
of Corporate America are overflowing
with surging profits another one talks
about the government really great
government it says the Gingrich Congress
represents a milestone for
business never before have so many
goodies been showered so
enthusiastically on America's
entrepreneurs the headline of that one
incidentally is returned to the trenches
no like we gotta ask more feeding frenzy
has to go on from the nanny state
fortune magazine you know the other big
business journal I mean they can't even
find the adjectives in the last couple
of years to describe what's going on one
year it's dazzling you know the next
year stupendous I mean I'm waiting for
the fortune 500 issue see what
adjectives they come out with next week
what they've been double-digit profit
growth for unheralded for years with
pretty stagnant sales and the
fortunately wages going down CEO
salaries are going through the roof and
it's uncorrelated with performance it's
another interesting aspect of it they've
been now studies of it so just some
other thing as nothing to with markets
or anything else the i meanwhile wages
continue to decline as this family
income and so on well you know nobody
who even looks at the business press can
believe that there are lean and mean
times as i said the country is just
awash with capital their problem is in
order to do with it so therefore get
more another theme that's around now is
you have to have what's called
downsizing in order to be competitive
well the bureau of labor statistics came
out with its figures up to last year
they have him forward 1993 from 80 from
nineteen eighty-three to 1993 the
category of executives managers and
administrative personnel grew thirty
percent okay that's bound sizing the
fastest-growing white-collar population
happens to be security guard well yeah
that's connected with turning it into a
third world country you take a walk down
son salvador you know you'll see plenty
of security guard you know rich people i
protected and furthermore all these
prisons you're throwing people into they
need security guards so yeah there's
their administrative personnel and
that's increasing but so are the same in
corporations there's no downsizing going
on except for working people that's
quite different why is it happening now
anyway those are let's go back to why
it's happening
no well affected it's always going on
just depending on the weapons at hand
business american business particularly
is highly class conscious and very open
about it incidentally and it's always
fighting a bitter class war you go back
a century ago into what were called the
gay 90's when incidentally the
international economy was about as inner
testicle the international economy was
pretty much as like it is now in terms
of capital flows and so on hasn't become
more globalized in terms of trade and
capital flow and so on than it was then
may even be less so the about a century
ago it looked as if the game was over
you know they were talking about the end
of history perfection had been reached
in the devil take the hindmost society
where everybody's for themselves enrich
ourselves and so on it was monstrous for
working people very brutal in fact here
that was a century ago well yeah didn't
and no and europe particularly the
social contract was slowly imposed not
easily it didn't happen here by the
roaring 20s as they were called labor
had no voice this is the you know the
age of mass production automobiles and
so on labor was out of it it was a
business run society almost completely
and it looked permanent again you know
utopia the masters and of history or
let's talk the 1930s it proved to be
wrong there was a lot of popular
organizing popular protest it rammed
through elements of the social contract
that had been achieved in europe decades
earlier and that just caused hysteria in
the business community you read the
business press it was talking about you
know the hazard facing manufacturers and
the rising political power of the masses
and how we're going to face disaster
unless we figure out some way to reverse
this and control their minds and control
them and so on a huge propaganda
campaign began right after the Wagner
Act was packed past 1935 in those in the
next two years the National
manufacturers its public relations
budget multiplied by a factor of 20 as
they recognize the force alone is not
going to be enough US has a very violent
labor history and plenty of people
workers were getting killed but it was
clear that this wasn't going to be
enough they had to have huge propaganda
it was sort of put on that's when all
this harmony business that I was talking
about got designed you know it was a
specific design as to how to carry out
what they called scientific methods of
strike breaking by controlling
communities and so on well I was put on
hold during the war and then it picked
up right after the second world war was
over and with an enormous propaganda
campaign I mean you can't believe the
scale until you look at it and the
purpose was very explicit the purpose
was to win the everlasting battle for
the minds of men which have to be
indoctrinated with the capitalist story
as we sell our preferred way of life and
on and on these are all those quotes
from mainstream PR literature and it was
very substantial and aimed precisely at
what I described and they described what
they're doing and you can see it in the
propaganda schools entertainment
industry everything else well what
happened in the 1970s but what happened
is there were some changes in the
international economy and in technology
and so on which just put new weapons
into the hands of the Masters one
crucial factor which everyone points to
is an enormous growth in a financial
capital financial transactions it just
boomed short range financial
transactions that came about partly
because of the dismantling of the
post-war Bretton Woods system of
regulated currencies which kind of made
currencies free-floating the Nixon
administration just dismantled it partly
it came about for technical reasons I
mean the telecommunications revolution
which was of course publicly subsidized
at that point made it possible to
transfer funds very rapidly so like you
can about it by now it's estimated
around trillion dollars a day just shift
up and back from one market to another
very short term transactions all and at
a
and aimed it something they're all aimed
at low growth and high profits and low
wages and that's a that is a factor
that's driving policy in that direction
I don't think it's many means an
uncontrollable factor but it is a it's
definitely a factor and let's just put a
lot and the changes are in the in the
composition of capital transactions are
very striking around from about maybe
the time when you have data like late
19th century up till about 1970 rough
estimate was that about ninety percent
of capital transfers had to do with the
real economy you know with investment
and trade 10% speculation by 1990 the
figures it reversed by 1995 the latest
on Ted you know UN Economic Commission
estimate was about five percent real
economy ninety-five percent speculation
short-term speculation like against
currencies which is essentially aimed at
driving down growth and increasing
profits and lowering wages this was
understood very quickly by the late 70s
and there were proposals made for
example by James Tobin Yale economist
Nobel Prize winner at an American
Economic Association presidential
address 1978 simply suggested a simple
reform low-tax very low tax on
short-term financial transactions just
to slow it down you know throw a little
sand in the gears probably work it's
been called the Tobin tax but it's not
getting anywhere because the weapon is a
very important one that weapon has been
used very efficiently for all the
purposes that have been described and
there are other things I is it out of
control is there nothing we can do well
there's no reason to believe that I mean
elementary reforms like say the Tobin
tax could have maybe a big effect
furthermore more globally all of these
interchanges as I mentioned the
International economy is not more
integrated by most measures than it was
a hundred years ago
fact less in many respects and the
transactions that are going on are
mostly within the big three regions
United States Japan and Europe now
that's under political control no that's
not out of political control democratic
societies in the these three areas could
control this the idea that it's somehow
you know kind of impossible to control
the world this is not true look at the
flows their internal to the highly
developed rich societies where
theoretically there are democratic
governments and could impose all sorts
of restrictions for them were all talk
about corporate greed and everything is
really crucially beside the point in my
point of view I think and should be
recognized as a very big regression from
what working people and a lot of others
understood very well a century ago
talked about corporate greed is nonsense
corporations are greedy by their nature
there's nothing nothing else there are
instruments for interfering with markets
to maximize profit and wealth and keep
market control you can't make them more
or less green I mean maybe you can sort
of force them it's like taking a
totalitarian state and saying be less
brutal well yeah maybe you can get the
totalitarian state to be less brutal but
that's not the point the point is not to
get a tyranny to be less brutal but the
orig of it now like 150 years ago that
was understood I mean if we read the
labor press there was a very lively
labor press right around here you know
Lowell Lawrence in places like that
around the mid 19th century run by
artisans and what they call factory
girls young women from farms who were
working there and they weren't asking
the autocracy to be less brutal they
were saying get rid of it you know they
found in fact that makes perfect sense
these are not these are human
institutions you know there's nothing
graven and stone about them they're
created early in this century with their
present powers they come from the same
intellectual roots as the other modern
forms of totalitarianism name
stalinism and fascism and they have no
more legitimacy than they do so it's not
a I mean yeah let's try and make them
make the autocracy less brutal if that's
the short term possibility but we should
have the sophistication of say factory
girls and Lola 150 years ago and
recognize that this is just degrading
and intolerable and that as they put it
those who work in the mills to donor and
on everything else and that's democracy
you know that you don't have the
mattress
you
