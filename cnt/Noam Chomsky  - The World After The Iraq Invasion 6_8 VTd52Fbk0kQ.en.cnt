the mechanisms of what the world calls
neoliberalism financial markets the
international financial markets can
strangle capital can flow out of the
country what's called by economists
virtual Parliament of investors and
lenders can make the actual decisions
over what happens in a country its own
voters are irrelevant the virtual
Parliament does it now that's thanks to
the what's called globalization the
measures that have been introduced in
the last 30 years primarily Oh many of
it under much of it under Clinton which
means that so like when Lula went to
Davos at the World Economic Forum and
made a good speech about how we have to
you know work on overcoming poverty and
all kind of nice things they cheered
them they thought that nice you know
because they know he can't do a damn
thing because the minute he makes a move
the virtual Parliament will strangle
them okay a lot of that is thanks to
Clinton those are other ways of
controlling people I mean you know they
might have alternatives but they'd have
to be almost revolutionary by now that's
what the global justice movements are
about trying to prevent the virtual
Parliament from destroying what's left
of democracy by transferring power into
the hands of the virtual Parliament okay
we had to know about those things too
and plenty of people do that's why
there's a big global justice movement
that's Clinton too and there's more
going back your question it's really
hard to say you know it depends what the
alternatives actually are that's why I
was quoting Dean Acheson Kennedy
administration and Franklin Delano
Roosevelt the Planning Commission's in
1940 okay the spectrum is pretty narrow
it's not to say that it doesn't exist
and sometimes choices within it or
important but far more important than
that is changing the spectrum and the
way you do that
is by the kinds of activism that have
changed the country that changes the
spectrum with within which choices are
going to be made ultimately you want to
go beyond that but for the short term
that I think what has to be done given
that our government is the most powerful
government in the world right now how
could we best utilize that power to
affect change both in terms of like
pertinent issues like nuclear
proliferation and in terms of changing
human rights and I guess most
immediately I'm thinking about where do
we go from where we are now with North
Korea given that we've already made the
mistakes that we have in the past well
first of all I think the way to deal
with the overwhelming military power of
the United States is to dismantle it not
to use it it's a threat
so takes a nuclear proliferation okay
that's dangerous in fact nuclear weapons
are among the most likely things that
will do us in you know it's pretty close
came very close in 62 and that's not the
only time what do you do about nuclear
proliferation well there is a treaty
it's called a non-proliferation treaty
which obligates the nuclear states that
includes us to carry out good faith
efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons
okay and nobody follows that nobody's
gonna follow it unless the United States
takes the lead United States is one of
the main violators of the treaty it's
right through Clinton incidentally and
one way to reduce the threat of nuclear
weapons is to observe the provisions of
the non-proliferation treaty another way
to do it is to pay attention to the
Security Council declarations that are
selectively used to justify the war on
Iraq they don't only call for
disarmament of Iraq they call for
there's a paragraph which is very rarely
quoted which calls for disarmament of
Iraq as a step towards elimination of
weapons of mass destruction and delivery
systems in the region okay that's
specifically referring to the u.s.
offshore military base in Israel which
has overwhelming has hundreds of nuclear
weapons and totally overwhelms anyone in
the region and military force that's
what they're talking about that's
another step another way to do it is to
follow the recommendations of the
high-level congressional and other
committees which have pointed out that
the major threat of nuclear weapons
right now at least is what they call
loose nukes you know Russia or Pakistan
or somebody with nuclear weapons tens of
thousands of them in fact that are kind
of getting out of control well you know
there are small programs to try to do
something about that and their work but
they ought to be huge programs
so there are many problems about the
nuclear weapons and another thing to do
is to stop encouraging countries to
develop a power which is what they're
going to do all right let's get to North
Korea I know it going mistakes exactly
but the right the the countries of the
region have an approach that they want
to follow they want and we should be
following their lead I think South Korea
in the lead and Japan and China
basically agree with them that this is a
serious problem very serious problem and
has to be dealt with through diplomacy
and through moves to somehow integrate
North Korea back into the system which
is not a trivial matter and the
framework agreement this is one thing
that Clinton did which was right of 1994
if it had been implemented would have
taken steps to it was taking steps
towards that well it's been reversed I'm
going to go back and we will follow the
lead of the South Koreans on this it's
dangerous but right now the danger of
North Korea is not nuclear weapons the
danger is the reason why the US isn't
attacking North Korea is because they
have a deterrent the deterrent is
conventional weapons massed artillery
which can destroy soul in five minutes
you know i'm sure that at the pentagon
they're working on techniques for you
know precision guided the weapons that
can somehow maybe tactical nuclear
weapons that can somehow take out that
artillery but until they can do that
they can't attack North Korea because
has a deterrent and in fact the u.s. is
teaching the world a very ugly lesson
now it's telling the world if you want
to prevent us from attacking you you
better have a deterrent if you're
defenseless like Iraq will go after you
if you're North Korea which is a much
worse terror in a in a much greater
threat but you have a deterrent we're
not going to go after you you know may
not be the headlines here but everyone
in the world understands it it's very
evident that's really bad behind that
there are other things going on so the
you take a look at that region Siberia
China Japan Korea it's it's it's an
integrated region it has tremendous
resources mostly in Siberia like energy
resources it has countries that need
those resources Japan China South Korea
the natural development and one that's
beginning to take place is some kind of
integration in which the energy reasor
and other material resources of Siberia
are going to be used by the surrounding
countries which are carrying out
industrial development the u.s. is very
much opposed to that does not want an
integrated region to develop that will
be out of control of us global power
that's part of the background for what's
going on in the Gulf and thing so yeah
that's in the works there's a lot to be
concerned about if you're really
thinking about the future North Korea is
a threat and the way to deal with it is
by following the lead of the people who
are right there like South Korea and the
circlet countries and we can do a lot to
reduce the threat of nuclear weapons by
following our own treaty obligations
that be a good story
even radical extreme status such as
bushing company must share a basic sense
of self-preservation along with the rest
of us but it seems to me that they too
at a very personal level will suffer the
likely consequences of their own actions
a dangerous course that they've
initiated do these people believe that
they'll escape by magic or by divine
intervention or does their extreme
devotion to ideology prevent ordinary
logical thinking and it's logical and
finally is it important for us or not to
understand what's going on in their
minds if we want to change the world no
I don't think it's minor importance the
reason it's of minor importance is that
this is close to a historical universal
now it happens that by now the stakes
are much greater because the means of
violence are so much greater you take a
look at history it's been like this
forever they take a look at the history
of war I mean very often maybe like half
the time wars were started by countries
who got destroyed they're willing that
the leadership was willing to take the
chance no I mean it's not just recent
you know people talk about the 20th
century is the most horrible century
ever and in some ways it was but you
look at the wars in Europe the thirty
years war in the 17th century wiped out
about forty percent of the population in
Germany they kept at it the leader for
the leadership was just more important
or take a look at take more recent times
it go back to nineteen fifty okay there
was one potential threat to us security
known near but I'm the US had enormous
security controlled the Western
Hemisphere controlled both oceans
control the other sides of both oceans
that never been a secure country but
there was a potential threat the
potential threat was was the only
potential then was intercontinental
missiles with Thurmond
were his okay if anybody had been
concerned with the security of the
United States they would have tried to
avert the development of those of that
technology and very likely the Russians
would have agreed and not because
they're nice guys because they were so
far behind they didn't want the
technology developed McGeorge Bundy who
was Kennedy's national security advisor
who wrote the authoritative history of
all of this and had access to all the
internal documents and so on he points
out in his history that he cannot find
any document which suggests that anybody
even thought about it you know that they
even had a plant or a thought about
trying to avert the threat that the only
serious threat to the survival of the
United States and the reason is you just
don't think about that you're interested
in short-term power profit and gain and
the fact that it might destroy your
country is kind of secondary and that
goes right through history you know
except the only the main difference now
is that the stakes are much higher much
higher but the reasoning is pretty
constant so is it important to think
what's in the minds of these particular
guys yeah maybe at some level but it's
more important to recognize that you
know within a lunatic framework
decisions are made which are pretty
rational it's the framework that's
lunatic I'm you could say the same about
environmental destruction you know it's
a it's you don't know how far off it is
and nobody knows exactly what will
happen but I know it's universally
recognized that it's extremely dangerous
and that the system in fact is kind of
nonlinear that is a small change might
lead to a huge effect so on it could
happen any time that's known as any by
doing anything about it no because it's
much more important to have short-term
profit well within us and in fact if you
think about what you're taught in your
economics courses that's right you know
it's rational within a framework of
thinking that's pretty much accepted
people are supposed to be
rational wealth maximizers right you're
trying to maximize your own wealth okay
that's what you're supposed to be if
you're rational well and the market if
it works perfectly in theory is supposed
to respond to the inputs from the
participants so your votes are your
dollars and your goal is maximizing your
wealth okay here's a simple question how
many votes do your grandchildren have in
the market none you know they don't vote
in the market now therefore their
interests are valued at zero in what's
called rational behavior so therefore
it's entirely rational to destroy the
possibility that bill of a world in
which they can survive if you can have
more shoes it's essentially what it
comes down to it it's a kind of a
rational decision with it a framework of
complete lunacy you know and there's a
lot in history that's likely we should
be concerned with those lunatic
frameworks much more than what's in the
mind of some person who's making
decisions within them it may be pretty
rational within a accepted framework
that's really important i think mr.
Chomsky is there somebody up there I
can't see thank you if you had to run to
rec excuse me well Phoebe could you wave
an arm or something I can't see
if you had to recommend four or five
publications that you think provide
unbiased and accurate reporting what
would you
