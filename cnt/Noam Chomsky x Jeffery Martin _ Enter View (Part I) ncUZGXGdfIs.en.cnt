first of all thank you for um meeting
with me i really
delight i'm appreciative i have some
questions i'm going to try to stump you
i'm going to try to
give you questions that you really have
to think about that everybody hasn't
asked
um but in this speak it slowly because
oh well okay okay
um first one is how do we get to the
truth
how how do we with all the media and
manipulation
how do you think we get to the truth we
work hard
it's not quantum physics it's not really
that hard
i mean there's a lot of noise out there
right
but if you think about it and you
evaluate what's being said and you
look at the sources and you consider the
the credibility of the people you can
work through it
it's uh you know some effort but there
are many harder tasks in life
in fact almost everybody's own job is a
harder task in
oh life okay um is there anything that
you haven't been asked
that you would hope that somebody would
ask that you want to expound on
i know they ask you a lot of things but
you hear the same questions was there
any question
you say well wow i wish somebody would
ask me this so i can expound on it and
well i have a lot of questions at which
i knew the answer to
like i find it
i wish what somebody could explain to me
the mentality
of decent honest
human beings i'm not asking about henry
kissinger
i'm not asking about donald trump just
the uh
a manager normal decent person
in a bank or an energy corporation
who's uh devoting or a newspaper for
that matter who's writing about
it uh who describe or either either
carry out
or describe the
inquiry new programs to
increase fossil fuels the people who do
it
the bankers who fund it the energy
corporations that do it
the newspaper reporters who report it
all happily with a sense of euphoria
economic growth it's catapulting the
united states into the lead and
producing energy around the world every
single one of them
knows perfectly well exactly what you
and i know
that they are driving the world towards
imminent disaster
how do they put this together in their
heads
how can you say take
jamie dimon head of jp morgan too
i don't know him but i assume he's a
perfectly nice guy
pouring money into
fossil fuel extraction including the
most dangerous like canadian car sands
tarzans and when he goes home he
probably sends a check to the sierra
club
what's going on in people's heads when
they do this
what's going on the heads of a reporter
a very good reporter for
major newspapers new york times
financial times when they
describe all this write about it
long articles occasionally maybe there
may be a word about
the fact that the effect of
fracking in wyoming will harm cattle
ranchers and
something like that not a word about the
fact
which they know very well that if we
that what they're doing is uh
calling for a death knell for the
species
it's it's not just some harm that people
have to end right right what goes on in
people's heads maybe you can answer
i don't know i don't know how they sleep
at night it was a
interesting statement about it recently
not exactly this by
william perry who was the uh
former secretary the defense secretary a
guy who spent all his life on
nuclear issues very conservative guy not
given the exaggeration
he said he was doubly terrified
terrified by the growing threat of
nuclear war
secondly by the fact that nobody's
paying attention to it
but he should have added something else
so he should be triply terrified
the people who are racing towards
nuclear war
know exactly what they're doing that's
just like the climate issue
when trump's advisors who tell him to
destroy the inf treaty
a couple of weeks ago and to launch
immediately test missiles that violate
the treaty
they know exactly what they're doing
they're telling
the russians and the chinese and anybody
else who may be listening
please go ahead and develop more
advanced
destructive missiles which will destroy
us
okay when they say we're not going to
sign the new start
treaty which the last of the regime of
arms control they know they're telling
the word
find let's produce anything we like that
can destroy all of us
hypersonic missiles against which
there's no defense let's blow up the
world destroy
ourselves they know it what's going on
in their heads
they're not crazy people and they have
children
so i would think that they would it
reminds me i once this friend he
died recently he's an atomic physicist
to visit
nuclear physicists to visit los alamos
you know with the uh scientists who were
setting up the atom bomb right it was
the most brilliant people in the world
not just
technically they were people steeped in
a humanistic tradition the european
scientist is
very educated know read poetry all sorts
of things
right they were stuck together separated
from the rest of the world
talking to each other knew everything
that was going on you couldn't find a
more wonderful group of people
i i asked him in a discussion he was
it was right he was actually the guy who
put the bomb together
uh what were they discussing about the
effect
of building an automobile germany was
out of the war
no war against germany anymore didn't
have to worry about that right
japan was being wiped out by just a
massive fire bombing tokyo is
one of the bomb bombings that killed
about a hundred thousand people wiped it
out
what do they think what were they
talking about what's going to happen
here
he said they never discussed it they
were much more
involved in the technical issue of how
we get this thing to work
i mean at one point it was july
1945 they
wanted to carry out a test to see if
something was going to work
they knew that there was a possibility
very small possibility that it might set
the earth's atmosphere on fire
and destroy everything on earth but they
you know huntston
gave it to hans bay to one of the top
scientists he calculated that the
probability was extremely low
and others verified the calculation and
it's extremely low
and they went ahead and did it right i
mean
i can't you can't find words to discuss
it i mean
you know it's not that they had to do it
then they could have waited until
technology was better and had far less
risk or no risk and not do it at all for
them
but we'll take a chance and maybe the
whole world will go on fire
