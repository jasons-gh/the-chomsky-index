first of all the phrase war on terrorism
should always be used in quotes because
there can't possibly be a war on
terrorism it's impossible the reason is
it's led by one of the worst terrorist
states in the world that gets led by the
only state in the world which has been
condemned by the highest international
authorities for international terrorism
namely the World Court the Security
Council except that the u.s. vetoed the
resolution so we cannot even talk about
a war on terrorism without self ridicule
whatever is going on you can like it or
you can hate it whatever but it's not a
war on terrorism it's some other thing
there's been what's called a global war
on terror when it began there's been one
device to deal with a sledgehammer smash
him up don't find out what's going on
smash him up what's happened 15 years
ago it was come look it was confined to
a tiny tribal area in Afghanistan now
it's all over the world every time you
hit it with a sledgehammer you expand it
every single time Afghanistan Iraq Libya
everywhere can you learn something from
that
shall we say okay let's smash them up
again because they all want to kill us
yeah that's one reaction another
reaction is the same reaction what you
do hear from people like who knows
something about the topic like Scott
apron or like William Pope will know a
Middle East expert long experience in
the US government has pretty much the
same proposals you have to deal with
situation rationally if you want to be
first of all humane but even concerned
with your own security
