hi I'm Neil hirland with the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation over the
weekend a lot of people are aware there
was a sweeping terror arrest a series of
arrests in Canada more than a dozen
suspects were arrested the Canadian
government says it's the first major
terror cell in years that they've
discovered the first Islamic terror cell
that they found within Canada to such a
large degree the White House is
congratulating Canada for being so
vigilant meanwhile you have Muslim
groups in Canada who are deploring the
arrest saying that it's just racism and
it this case is sort of rather flimsy
I'm wondering what's your take on on
these arrests and what advice do you
give to Western democracies in terms of
dealing with the threat of terror mm-hmm
well first of all when we use the term
terror we have to recognize that like
most terms of political discourse has
two meanings there's a literal meaning
and there's the doctrinal meaning now in
the literal meaning terror is what's
described in u.s. code of laws it's the
threat or use of violence to intimidate
typically against civilians to
intimidate populations for political
ideological and other ends well nobody
can use that definition because if you
use that definition it follows instantly
that the United States is a leading
terror state that Britons and other
leading to our state and so on so the
literal definition the one that's in the
u.s. code of laws is unusable the then
we go to the doctrinal definition the
one that's used in the media and
scholarship and so on that's the same as
the official definition but with a
condition qualification it only applies
to what they do to us not what we do to
them ok that's the doctrinal meaning
I'll now use it in the doctrinal sense
that's totally dishonest of course so in
the particular case of the Canadian case
I have no judgment I don't know what the
evidence is against the people they
picked up so I can't say nothing's been
published so I've no judgment as to what
to do about the threat of terror in the
doctrinal sentence meaning that there
by them against us there are a lot of
things to do one thing is to not
increase the thread that's a simple step
don't act in order to increase the
thread now the u.s. consistently and
Britain act in order to contribute
increase the threat of terror not
because they want terror but because
just not a high priority so take the
invasion of Iraq as I mentioned that was
undertaken with the expectation since
amply confirmed that it would increase
the threat of terror they expected it it
happened well one of the ways not to
increase the threat of terror is not to
take steps like that that will increase
it another and ever just as bad
unanimity on this in the among
specialists and intelligence agencies
second step is to try to ask what its
reasons or what are the causes of it and
where the causes our grievances that are
legitimate grievances something should
be done about those grievances quite
apart from the threat of terror it's
another way to reduce it we have but
well there's let me get let me get to
Canada first of all in the case of
Canada it may turn out that the
motivation for the terror was Canadian
troops in Afghanistan you might look
into that but whatever it is if there
are grievances then something should be
done beyond that terror is a police
problem so if you find a terrorist cell
of its legitimate in Canada yeah then
you should arrest the perpetrators and
they should be subjected to trial just
as the leading terrorists should be like
the ones in the White House but of
course we're doing it on you keeping to
the doctrinal sense so it's only them
against us but there's more to do what
should the United States do about this
well actually there is advice given
recommendations in the 911 Commission
report them as you recall there was an
official government commission set up
over the strong objections of the Bush
administration but they finally had to
agree there was commissioned set up that
made recommendations on how to decrease
the threat of terror in the United
States well
how to do with Canada they concluded
that the major threat of terror in the
United States is the Canadian border
it's a very long border practically
unprotected very easy to cross and they
recommended that there be a sharp
increase in border patrols on the
Canadian border that's their
recommendation well had the Bush
administration respond it responded by
reducing the growth of the Border Patrol
altogether after nine eleven increase in
the Border Patrol reduced and shifting
it from the Canadian border
overwhelmingly to the Mexican border
okay so I remember the numbers but i
think it's about 10 to 1 by now you know
per mile of surveillance of the mexican
border and the Canadian border well
that's so they're reducing the efforts
to defend the United States from the
potential threat of terror from Canada
reducing that again another illustration
of the fact that protection of the
population from terror is just not a
high priority okay so for the United
States something else that could be done
would be to say follow the
recommendations of the 911 Commission
and there's a lot more terror is not
coming from nowhere and what you want to
do is I mean it's easy to stand up on a
pedestal and scream aslam o of fascism
and so on and so forth maybe that makes
you feel good but if you want to deal
with the threat of terror you'll ask
what its sources are and ask how those
sources can be dealt with I mean
terribly what we call terrorists or see
themselves as kind of a vanguard who are
trying to organize a constituency to
support their long-term demands now
their long-term demands in the case of
sale jihadi style terror are pretty
clear and again there's pretty near
unanimity about this in the you know
specialist community there as they put
it their goals are to defend Muslim
lands from attack and they list specific
grievances and the grievances are real
they're trying to mobilize a
constituency to join them well the way
to do this two ways
dealing with it the one is to ally
yourself with Osama bin Laden that's the
way Bush picked that's why the leading
terrorist specialist in the united
states like michael Scheuer described
bush as sama bin Laden's leading a lie
because what he's done as if you is to
do exactly what Osama wants to help the
Vanguard mobilize the constituency in
support of a terrorist act what is
recommended across the board is pay some
attention to those reasons which are
real you can read that in the defense
Science Board recommendations in
academic scholarship and intelligence
reports pay attention to the grievances
and many of them are real and they
should be dealt with quite apart from
the threat of terror that can reduce the
threat of terror and we know that it
works I mean takes a northern ireland
okay for a long time the British
reaction to terror in Northern Ireland
which was pretty serious probably blew
up the British Cabinet all sorts of
things their reaction was just to
increase the violence ok that's the bush
line you join with the terrorists and
you're there a lie it's exactly what the
more militant sectors of the IRA wanted
so you get an escalating terror and
repression cycle finally the British got
into their heads that they should pay
some attention to the grievances that
are the source of it and in fact they
began to do so because the grievances
were real the constituency was being
mobilised around real grievances when
they began to do that the threat of
terror decline Belfast is not utopia but
it's a very different place from say
when my wife and I visited in 1993 which
was pretty scary place it's not that
anymore it's much improved and in fact
the threat of IRA terror has now been
very much marginalized by doing the
sensible thing paying attention to the
source out of which it grows and the
same is true in this case
