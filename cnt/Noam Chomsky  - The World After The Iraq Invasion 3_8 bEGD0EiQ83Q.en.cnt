shudders around the world and the
foreign policy a lead here in September
last September well as a reason Atchison
was describing policy and it's true that
is policy has been so for a long time
but the national security strategy last
September proclaimed it as official
policy and that's quite a difference an
important one actually you want to think
about this it goes back beyond that you
can find the policy described in the
early stages of the Second World War
actually before the u.s. even entered it
that's the there you can find a clear
announced discussion of what's now
called the imperial grand strategy so
even before the u.s. entered the war
there were study groups of high-level
planners from the Council on Foreign
Relations kind of the foreign policy
elite and the State Department trying to
decide what to do in the postwar world
and they concluded that in the postwar
world the United States must hold I'm
quoting it now must hold unquestioned
power and must act to ensure limitation
of any exercise of sovereignty by states
that interfere with us global designs
that's the September national security
strategy and they also recognized that
the foremost requirement to secure these
ends is rapid fulfillment of a program
of complete rearmament that's a central
component of an integrated policy to
achieve military and economic supremacy
for the United States that's 1940 at
that time those ambitions were limited
to what they called the non-german world
they expected that Germany might win win
the European war at least and the non
German world was going to be organized
under
the United States rule as what they
called a grand area that included the
Western Hemisphere the former british
empire in the Far East well shortly
after that Russia had beat back the Nazi
army is at Stalingrad and became fairly
clear that Germany would ultimately be
defeated and these plans were then
extended to include as much of Eurasia
as possible and they were implemented
after the Second World War they've been
described since as in Dean Acheson ska
mint and now their official policy well
that's all important than though in a
society that really valued its freedom I
wouldn't have to be saying this
everybody would have learned it in high
school these are really important things
to know about ourselves it's plenty more
like it well let's go back to last
September one important development
which did cause plenty of concern around
the world foreign policy a lead here was
the proclamation of the national
security strategy as something else
happened in September September was the
opening of the political campaign for
the midterm elections and that was
combined with an enormous propaganda
campaign which began to present Iraq's
that I'm saying as an imminent threat to
the survival of the united states with
insinuations that Iraq was responsible
for the September 11th attacks actually
if you look at this morning's New York
Times Karl Rove who's George Bush's
minder as they call him in Iraq he was
he describes it this morning he says the
purple that goal is that in order to
pursue the domestic agenda of the
administration it's necessary to
frighten the population you have
to make the population feel that they
have to shelter under you know behind
the under the behind the powerful leader
is going to save them from destruction
you can do that you can pursue your
domestic agenda otherwise not he's
talking about what we have to do and
what they're going to have to do in the
future but he also says yeah that's what
they did in the past and that's correct
in September Condoleezza Rice showed up
with her prediction that the next thing
we're going to hear about Saddam Hussein
is a mushroom cloud they're planning to
destroy us and then that came as a
series of outlandish lies it repeated
passionately by Bush and others
distributed quite uncritically by the
media and it had an immediate effect you
take a look at polls by September after
this campaign began roughly sixty
percent of the population believed and
continue to believe it sixty percent of
population plus or minus believes that
Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat
they got to keep repeating it to keep
that level up about half the population
by a couple of about a month ago it's
probably higher and how believe that the
your act was responsible for the
September 11th attack that Iraqis were
on the planes those beliefs turn out to
be highly correlated with support for
the war and it's understandable if you
think that Saddam Hussein's an imminent
threat already destroyed the World Trade
Center planning something new maybe a
nuclear bomb and then it's
understandable that you'd want to do
something to get rid of them that's a
remarkable achievement of government
media propaganda they have to bear in
mind that this is unique to the United
States nowhere else where anyone
believes anything like this nor is it
believed here by anybody who knows
anything like CIA foreign policy animals
but it has been in
it's on the population and that's
impressive it's not the first time but
it's impressive whew and as far as it
was aimed at the election and for the
election it just barely worked and they
barely managed to maintain control tens
of thousands of votes not much and
something similar is going to be four
but needed for the next election that's
what Rove says this morning this is for
the next election we've got to create an
image of George Bush as a powerful
leader Savior who by then I'll be
marching off to slay some new dragons so
it's going to be something to do next
year well for the guys in power the
current administration all of this is
kind of reflexive it's just second
nature that remember that these is
almost the same people who ran the
country in the reagan-bush one
administration's that 12 years to do it
it's a sort of astonishing when you look
at put yourself in the position of the
Martian observer again and recognize
that it's just elementary sanity if you
want to figure out what these guys are
up to to ask what they did during their
first tenure in power it's 12 years not
ancient history 1981 292 what they do
well it's interesting thats almost never
investigated through a search and see
how often people bring up what they did
the first time around well if you do it
you'll find that right now they're
following almost exactly the same script
in detail the first thing the reagan
i'ts did when they came into office 1981
first thing they did was drive the
country into a deep deficit bush
administration did exactly the same
thing this time the way they did it was
by a huge tax cut benefiting very tiny
top percentage of the population and by
the biggest increase in federal spending
in 20 years quoting The Wall Street
Journal but it's a fact biggest increase
in federal spending in 20 years
goes to the rich huge tax cut for the
rich well that causes a problem just as
it did in the Reagan years got a deficit
you have to have what's called fiscal
responsibility you know long Leumi faces
from the economic czars about fiscal
responsibility fiscal responsibility
means you got to cut services for the
population you got to cut benefits that
help people you keep the benefits to the
rich that's what the federal spending
and a tax cutter about well during the
Reagan years that's exactly what was
done and it was harmful it was it was
harmful even the economic growth
although there was some but it was very
harmful to the general population that
was 10 years of either stagnation or
declined for most people us working
hours went to the highest in the
industrial world for incomes either
stagnated or declined the working
conditions decline this was called a
welcome development of transcendent
importance by the wall street journal
which tells you exactly what was going
on well it was highly unpopular as you
can imagine there's a lot of Mythology
about Reagan's popularity simply untrue
in fact at the end when 1992 he was
ranked as the most unpopular living
ex-president right next to Richard Nixon
well below Carter and the fort well you
know how'd they stay in power pressing
the panic button every year just what
they're doing now so they started right
off with it was recognized right away
that Libya is a very convenient punching
bag it's completely defenseless
everybody hates it you can do what you
want so they started attacking Libya
right away
and presenting libya's a threat 1981
Reagan was hiding in the White House
because he had to be protected from
Libyan hit men who were wandering around
the streets of Washington nobody could
do anything about him they're going to
kill our leader well somehow he escaped
Libya was going to was trying to expel
us from the world he said nothing less
than that two years later came that
airbase in Grenada which the Russians
were going to use to bama's then there
was Nicaragua two days driving time from
Harling in Texas remember that really
close on waving copies of mine Kumpf
according to the Secretary of State real
threat a Reagan called a national
emergency in 1985 to defend the country
from the threat to the security of the
United States posed by the government of
Nicaragua the Martian would be dying of
laughter I guess but people here didn't
laugh the in fact if you look at that
that was renewed annually right through
the 80s they take a look at it it's
almost the same wording as the
congressional resolution in October 19
2002 about the threat of Saddam Hussein
imminent threat to the security of the
United States you've got to do something
in the 1980s it meant a terrorist war
against Nicaragua ended up with a the US
had to defy the World Court the Security
Council continued destroyed the country
practically the other countries even
worse in 1988 George Bush was able to
get elected George Bush number one but
only by invoking the threat of black
criminal rapists Willie Horton remember
that that's how he got elected terrified
everyone there were crime frenzies drug
frenzy
just on and on the international
policies then were the same as now the
Reagan administration came into office
1981 declaring that a war on terror
would be the focus of u.s. foreign
policy a war against depraved opponents
of civilization itself in return the
barbarism and our time on and on and it
ended up it very quickly turned into a
terrorist war the devastated Central
America the Middle East was all over the
world us supported South Africa right
through the 1980's the Reagan
administration had to find ways to get
around congressional legislation calling
sanctions they were able to increase
trade and support for South Africa right
to the end just in the Reagan years
alone South African depredations in the
surrounding countries and Angola and
Mozambique killed about a million and a
half people it's not small that's when
ends up with Colin Powell the moderate
this national security adviser in 1988
the US declared Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress to be one of the more
notorious terrorist organizations in the
world as part of the reason for
supporting the South African apartheid
regime in 1987 December 1987 the u.s.
blocked voted against that means
essentially vetoed a general the
strongest UN resolution General Assembly
resolution condemning terror in all its
forms strongest resolution the UN has
passed us voted against it u.s. in
Israel alone voted against it the reason
was it had a paragraph in it which said
that though they can them terrorism and
have to do everything to stop it nothing
in this resolution prevents the people
from struggling against racist and
colonialist regimes or foreign military
patient and the US doesn't accept that
we don't think people have a right to
struggle against racist and colonialist
regimes and foreign military occupation
racist and colonialist regimes referred
to South Africa military occupation
referred to Israel
