gentlemen you're all very welcome to the
hist and the GMB and many of you in the
audience are familiar with our Wednesday
night debates but for those of you who
aren't I just like to put some context
on the event and the gold medal and what
this means the society spanning for
centuries now the his tried to
facilitate discourse through the medium
of debate and it holds that it's very
core the ideals of free speech and
intellectualism and a commitment to the
serious and respectful engagement with
all ideas that are brought to the table
and it was at the meetings of this
society that wolf down the revolutionary
Wolf's home articulated his vision for
for a free Ireland where Douglas ID
addressed his pride in the Irish
language as an undergraduate and with
the like Connor Cruz O'Brien developed
his skills in oratory and there's a
fundamental acknowledgement in this
society to us that enlightens discussion
can only be brought about through
discussion engagement with all ideas to
like the broadest spectrum of ideas in
society and public discourse takes what
the hist does and it brings it to a mass
audience but and although this heightens
the capacity to see like to change minds
through discussion it also can in some
ways undermine at the true the process
and compromise the integrity of that
spectrum of debate not only has no
chance to be intrusive in bringing about
argues arguments and crucial dissent
against against the mainstream narrative
through his analysis of things such as
American foreign policy perhaps more
importantly what he's done is he's
brought a bright and a fundamental
awareness of hostile a bit after
spectrum of discussion and transformed
people's awareness of what political and
public discourse in society really is
today what seems to drive professor
Thompson's work is the belief under
fencing that rudimental democratic value
often maintaining a check on power and
its capacity for abuse in a will focused
on the demerit of democracy
professor Chomsky is perhaps one of the
most important intellectuals alive alive
he ranks with Marx granted Shakespeare
and the Bible is the most quoted sources
in the humanities and it is a great
privilege that I welcome the College
Historical Society and to Trinity
College - and it is with honor that I
presented with his gold medal for
outstanding contribution to public
discourse
yes times there was an article one of
thousands of articles on the critically
important event that we're commemorating
celebrating in November in fact next
week and the liberating Eastern Europe
from its Russian master the Irish Times
article was about a very important
meeting with the place in Berlin of the
three presidents who were critical
critically involved with time George
Bush number one Helmut Kohl Gorbachev
met and discussed with the newspaper
calls the burning issue now the question
who was Texas who gets the credit for
breaking down the Berlin Wall
to the west and they debated which
people of East Berlin Eastern Europe who
should get the credit they finally
achieved the rights that their their
god-given rights and Gorbachev said the
United States should have a period of
perestroika it was the topic and cold
ended up by saying only yes III it's
really the people not us that I read it
and this is there's a raft of such
articles open competition for people
where they were when it fell which is ok
this is critically important event we
should remember the first thing that
came to mind and I read it was the Grand
Inquisitor
since Seville of the height of the
Inquisition and there's come on the
streets
turns out Jesus Christ appeared he was
immediately picked up by the security
forces brought to the grand inquisitor
and the Grand Inquisitor explains to him
the whites might have executed because
he has to put an end to the evil works
of Christ
who's just bringing misery to the masses
by trying to bring them freedom and the
massive Authority more closely to
anonymous and importantly not event that
took place at the same time on November
16th what happened is that the
anyone comes with crisis message bitches
in the early 60s there was an effort to
revive the Christianity of the Gospels
especially in South America del Sur two
of the bishops on what was called the
preferential option for the poor they
bishops and laypeople part of this was
the laypeople sure to participate
directly and went out
the nearest thing to the grand
inquisitor around so actually there to
US government on the Vatican and they
combined put an end to the Harris the
Vatican and in this case we don't have
to ask whether heaven because we know
take a look at the the waiter side the
School of the Americas will be America's
changing
they changing the name but it's the same
school of the Americas which drains
Latin American killers one of their
talking points advertisements point is
the US Army helped defeat the bravery
field which is quite true the Vatican
taking out the dangerous radicals who
were daring to preach the gospel and the
US Army is killing that episode from the
early 1689 that's when the judgment of
the Grand Inquisitor was November 16th
I have a painting
Jesuit priest which is
who knows what it is well it turns out
from the United States America
a few weeks after this talk to a joint
session of Congress and standing
ovations relevant when he praised the
United States as the defenders of
freedom right after they murdered six of
his counterpart finishing between well
just imagine that situation minute
bursts and that gives you a sharp
indication of what's an event and what's
a non-event colleagues have been
murdered by train and at the scene
after this supposed to he had gone to
Moscow calling
two historic events breakdown Russian
control over Eastern Europe and the
destruction
in the United States as far as I know
there's only one caller
we're one of them surviving it's not
just the media just one illustration
voice it's also perhaps leading
story what universities and he starts
off the review by saying he interesting
one of the things you learn is that
Columbus Columbus he found what Emma
sphere that was essentially from the
steaming tropics of the north
maybe people stragglers
this is the major major I waited to see
if there'd be a letter
first of all one of the diseases
city on Massachusetts in 1630 crazy
mission of the year before the
Massachusetts Bay Colony had gotten its
charter from the King of England and the
Charter was given so that they could
carry out the mission of saving the
pagans miserable shows an Indian
and so that's what they were doing there
Thank You noon now I'm gonna ask none to
tell you a very good story which I
stopped interning at lunch today he
thinks it might be true and it's about
George W Bush and the prophet Ezekiel
and I stopped him telling it because I
was sure it would be worthy of a wider
audience I haven't heard it the article
was learning dissertation on a very
obscure passage in Ezekiel which nobody
understands it's the passage about but
it enters into evangelical Christian
theology whoever your current enemies so
when Reagan at that time this is January
2003 the first scene
somebody coming down Israel they start
getting souls that have been saved rise
to heaven everyone else the Christian
evangelical tradition in which this is
required is very strongly pro-israel
one of the main pro-israel blocks but
they are also the most anti-semitic
element in the world their history their
picture is all the Jews will be killed I
mean unless they happen to convert can't
get better than that
anyhow Bush was meeting with Jacques
Chirac the president flew France he was
trying to convince your act to join in
on the war against Iraq which
fortunately didn't have that problem 10
Downing Street didn't have to quote
physique you but the course of the
discussion with Chirac he started going
on explain with this maniac who's raving
about so they approached this Belgian
theologian who explained what we
survived it's kind of amazing we
survived a world in which finger on the
button that can destroy us all
in five seconds
some world in fact the same for the last
50 years and for years the larger part
of the fate of the world that's been in
the hands of one lunatic who's waiting
for the second coming
human serve somebody was watching this
on Mars they would think that human
survival was a miracle since we're
talking about God we must move to down
in the street Tony Blair obviously has a
special relationship with Bobby the
piers does not give him any advice and
he didn't say you know Tony this Iraq
thing may not be such a good idea I
wonder if you could tell us know why
statesmen either want to be close to God
or why they want to be Winston Churchill
and Roosevelt there seems to be a world
war two fascination with these people
you don't have to explain
the Irish did too for example just given
one example he was sometimes
refreshingly honest
so in fact right before the First World
War he gave the speech and in the
Parliament which he later published but
editing out all the parts and it
explains why we have to rule the world
he says we've gained control of vast
amounts of territory by violence and
robbery and now it's ours and we've got
us to maintain it and we have a right
tech he went on later in history the
Second World War to say that we are like
rich men living in their ample
habitations we just want to be left in
peace he then went on in 1934 to order
the army to the army command to develop
a plan which he called on them to
implement in May 1944 they wouldn't do
it it was called operation unthinkable
operation unthinkable it was
to you he wanted him not to destroy too
much of Germany because we need them to
employ the German and the Aria the
American forces to attack and destroy
Russia
this is 1944 when the Russians are
fighting the overwhelming planning an
operation to destroy them using the
German army that's been pretty well
hidden it was finally be classified a
couple of years ago I don't know if it's
been reported anywhere we find it in
histories of British intelligence so
he's an interesting character so why do
people either want to be close to God or
close to Churchill Churchill they want
and you want to be that's a
british-american perversion goes back
very far it goes back to England which
was a providential culture in the United
States that the colonists came over from
England we're mostly religious fanatics
they were kind of extremist religious
elements and they carried with them the
providential street the present like
George Bush same thing we're fulfilling
God's will God has strange ways
sometimes it turns out put the the
native population fades way before its
we're still fulfilling God's will and
since we're the shining city on the hill
even for the occasional make mistakes so
it's really good to be close of God it
justifies everything you do this was
combined in the United States with
another British lunacy the anglo-saxon
racism revival money in which he
describes how the Aryan race developed
and they were a new species pull along
the grains courageous intelligent
totally new species they migrated that
they migrated to the German forests
there they became two tons
they then migrated farther west and they
British Isles and then they in the later
version they became the Americans Thomas
Jefferson for example is a great
believer in this some of them made a
mistake some of the Aryans intermarried
with the population
they conquered and that led to racial
degeneration so you get the
Mediterranean cultures which is sort of
very dependent efficient and so on and
so forth but the pure areas never get
her married this exterminated every
breath so they they kept anglo-saxon
purity
that's why Britain was so such a
fantastic place and then right through
the 19th century in the United States
the anglo-saxon mythology was very
widespread when the u.s. conquered the
Philippines general in charge of
Congress this is about a century early
20th century he explained to Congress
this was a Philippine people that was
again in order to civilize them and he
explained the Congress that we had to do
this because we're following the will of
God and because we're we are the
anglo-saxon race the pure anglo-saxon
race and we have to follow the tradition
from the German forests
our selves to benefit the rest of the
people of the world by exterminating
they'll be happier when they're
exterminated and the anglo-saxon race
takes over and this is all God's will
because we're following the will of
Providence democracy in 2006 the
Palestinians have a fair election then
in June which I had Ahmadinejad was
elected by a impossibly high vote as
president of Iran when I was asked to
ask him the question immediately
afterwards
mr. Ahmadinejad sir which was my slimy
way of avoiding calling him president
but nonetheless after lots of saw
something we kind of accepted it then we
have the elections in Afghanistan of
which were obviously for jables
and the Americans insisted on Iraq
because they didn't believe Karzai was
necessary a legitimate president then
his opponent refused to participate in
the runoff which would of course cost a
lot of Western lives we don't care about
the Afghan ones and then yesterday we
learned that the election tribunal which
is run by one of Karzai's apparatchiks
said that he is now the president that
won't be a runoff and he got the
congratulations of Gordon Brown and your
President Obama who had earlier said
that this was a complete fraud so
they're now congratulating utterly
fraudulently elected president and
presumably were to send 40,000 can you
rather this for me and for us
like clearly he's a stuntman Alicia
effectively recognized by scholarship so
democracy promotion is one of those
slogans that everyone's in favor of
actually we have now a lot of Russian
archives when the communism apparatchik
decided to become a third world elite
back in 1990 one of the things they did
is to tell everything along including
the archives so there's now a lot of
archives so there's a whole scholarly
industry called Cold War history which
is pouring over the archives to see if
they can find something that little
justify but the US did during the Cold
War's so easy but some of the stuff in
the archives is interesting that's about
this I mean you had these gangsters
talking to each other
internally not any public use
and they're talking very sincerely about
the need to protect democracy in Eastern
Europe from the fascist attack led by
the United States which is trying to
undermine and I'm sure perfectly sincere
no indication that the KGB is listening
that's what they believe and it's the
same you hear Western diplomats talk
about their dedication the democracy
promoting now this has been studied the
best scholarly study of this by Thomas
for others who incidentally is a neo
Reaganite he's very much in favor of
democracy promotion because it's a
wonderful thing
he writes both from the inside he was in
the Reagan State Department and as a
scholar he's a careful scholar was head
of the Carnegie Endowment on democracy
or something was writing this these
things he read several books on the
history of democracy promotion they're
going way back right through the Reagan
years during the Reagan years what he
knew from the inside serveth commitment
the democracy promotion he points out
that democrata was in fact progress
towards democracy is a platinum erika is
progress towards democracy in Latin
America namely in the South where the US
had very little influence and he said
the Reagan administration tried to
prevent it but they couldn't and
nevertheless there was progress with
democracy in the surrounding region
where the US
much more power than influence they said
there was no progress toward democracy
in fact the opposite because he says
because the US would support only
particular forms of democracy that left
in power traditionally least that would
be act in conformity with US interests
so that's kind of a paradox about the
Reagan administration but then he
extends it
he said the paradox experienced all
administration's he said in every
administration the United States
supports democracy if and only if it
conforms to strategic and economic
objectives and he says all leaders are
somehow schizophrenic you know they need
psychiatric care they don't see that
there's something strange about their
puzzle they're supporting democracy
think of another reason but that's his
conclusion but he does record the facts
correctly it goes right through the
second Bush administration and and it's
a great surprise to anybody who is
purposely blind about history and policy
like the fading away of the indigenous
populations and we came to say history
is full of such puzzles
last question - no I'm preceded by a
memory of mine when I first went to
Israel in 1976 I thought it was a very
European for the country good phone
system nice food democracy Parliament
everything when I go there now and see
the settlements on the wall lot of
security fence please
wall I wonder if it will survive and it
was a Jewish friend of mine in
California when I was about to give a
talk some months ago who were looking at
the wall of the to speak Jewish
philanthropists are extremely generous
in the United States and of course most
of the names on the wall were Jewish and
I said to Jeffrey my friend I said you
know do you think what do you think if
you were in his rating would you prefer
would you live here and he said I think
Robert this might be Israel and that
place to the south of Lebanon where you
live is a small colonial project which
may or may not work and I recall how I
used to think when I first went to
Yugoslavia long before the war I
believed in your discovery the Yugoslavs
did not just relate to discovered will
survive the United States for some
reason
and it changed I mean there was a dark
side very dark side I'm it's a settler
colonial society a settler colonialism
is the absolute worst form of
imperialism because you have to act like
the Aryans of the two times in the in
the middle it's our anglo-saxon origin
you have to exterminate the native
that's true that the part of the society
that we would run into that I would see
that you would see was a very civilized
Western artists society in the best
sense it was like a Scandinavian social
democracy and that's changed now it's
very much like the United States it says
very high inequality this social system
is collapsed a lot of very advanced
high-tech economy with tremendous
amounts of poverty and that's even
excluding the settlers of the wall just
an annexation
we the earth there so will it survive
my feeling actually wrote about this
shortly after the occupation of the West
Bank in Gaza that the worst enemies of
Israel were those who were supporting it
what they're in fact supporting is
Israel's moral degeneration and ultimate
destruction and I increasingly think
that that's true in fact you could see
it very quickly so in 1971 President
Sadat of Egypt offered Israel a full
history in return for withdrawal from
occupied territory what he cared about
was Egyptian territory so in return for
withdrawal from Egyptian territory they
could had full peace well you know peace
with Egypt means major security problems
are over
that's the only meaningful military
Palestinians weren't an issue so nothing
for the Palestinians Kofi's in return
for withdrawal from the Sinai well at
the time Israel was carrying out
substantial there were just planning
substantial settlement programs in the
Northeast assignor which they were
driving out tens of thousands with
veteran farmers driving through the
desert this joint town
as everything they're putting up a lot
of settlements in one big city they were
planning a city me million people on the
Seacoast that was the civilized superior
an added choice at that time very clear
choice do we choose security or
expansion they chose an expansion they
rejected the offer now the critical
question as always is what's the boss
wants it was in the US government there
was a conflict between the Secretary of
State William Rogers and the National
Security Advisor Henry Kissinger
Kissinger had his primary enemy in the
world was William Rogers
because the second way down somewhere
was the Russians the reason was he
wanted to become Secretary of State in
which case he would run everything
so if Rogers said it's raining Kissinger
would tell Nixon the Sun is right well
Rogers was in favor of accepting so
that's proposal in fact was pretty close
to his own opposes so if Kissinger had
to be against and Kissinger had a policy
which he called stalemate no
negotiations just force so he he
succeeded in winning with bureaucratic
battle
here's a bat Israel's rejection of
Saddam's offer that led directly to the
1973 Brewer said I kept saying
repeatedly 1973 war came home it was a
very close thing for Israel they were in
the verge of destruction nuclear alert
it off at the end and it's one thing to
injure understands its force maybe
that's why so he recognized we can't
just write off Egypt is a verification
then comes the reconstruction of history
that academics in the media are
responsible for what followed after that
was what was called shuttle diplomacy
Kissinger they've granted diplomat is
flying up and back everywhere each other
mission finally in 1978
now they Israel the United States and
Egypt made an agreement Camp David
agreement which which essentially
accepted so that's 1971 eleven now that
goes down in history as a great
diplomatic triumph Kissinger gets the
Nobel Prize harder it gets the motel
in fact it was a diplomatic catastrophe
I mean what happened is that they
rejected in 1971 the offer which could
have ended the conflict and in 1978 in
79 they were forced to accept it and
since then it's just didn't downhill you
cannot carry out military occupiers
maintain your elementary moral values
you can't be rapping people killing them
stealing their land stealing their
resources without being becoming racist
I mean if you're crushing somebody
you've got to have a justification and
the only justification can be their evil
nature the universal right through the
history of their evil nature
I do like after the pirate panic British
historian the figures were coming here
and that's the evil nature of the Irish
I remember one English historian named
let's describe how awful it was here
after the famine of course the Irish
were responsible they said when you get
to Ireland what you see is human
chimpanzees but of course we see that
all of the world Africa and Southeast
Asia but what's particularly awful about
it in Ireland is that the human
chimpanzees have white faces that's
black faces brown faces or something but
it's their fault and everything we do is
therefore it's another historical
Universal and another one is that
there's a category of people those
intellectuals they're supposed to make
make this
I think we better have some serious
questions now just a few but anyone want
to ask a question of professor Chomsky
there's a gentleman over speak up
I'm telling you it's okay
political debate in the United States
seems to be very detached from reality
especially things like Fox News why do
you think that is same reason it is
everywhere
do you know the place where political
debate isn't detached from reality and
in fact there's a correlation the more
powerful that country is the more
attached the more crimes in reality
there's manufacturing consent to in fact
that plagiarized and he says the wrong
notion it should be manufacturing deceit
I should add that the column began with
the words professor Chomsky is right and
it ended with the words professor
Chomsky was wrong which is why he's
bringing it up now
anybody else lady over here to speak up
now
so the activism of the sixties began in
part is a reaction to disillusionment
with Jonathan tentatively the candidate
came in with the same kind of charisma
and instead of it giving out they became
civil rights movement which of course
has been there
sixties was mostly students it began
with black students and black colleges
in the south bay leaf black qualities in
Atlantic sitting in a much half counters
later writing freedom buses they were
joined by North
percenters a mass movement it compelled
Kennedy to back off and support
legislation legislation reflects at
least the formal right to participate in
society that was okay that was a major
factor that led to the
and for five years after the Kennedy
started the war there was a that's one
reason why Bush couldn't use the tactics
in Iraq could not use the tactics that
were freely Littlejohn intended no
saturation bombing chemical warfare
there's a constraint in the seventies
again it was always there the activism
of the sixties including quite
interesting things if you look at the
internal dynamics so the the leading
edge of the anti-war movement in the
sixties was the resistance these were
young men mostly we're taking risks it's
not they're doing and they wanted to
feel morally upgraded but if you look at
the inner workings of the resistance I
was right at the moment so to see you it
had the standard sexist assumptions of
the time the women young women
one of the strange that led to the youth
element in the feminist movement six 70s
we just expanded all over the place so
like say my own University MIT if you
walk down the hall 1960 wait a minute
well-dressed ties and jackets
differentially polite you walk down the
halls today and that's a big change
it's a change that it reflects the
society more civil and later you did
things like
they're unique in the history of
imperialism never gonna like it why
should it start just one more question
gentlemen of spectacles yeah you that's
it
where can you come to the questionable
time is there any chance of humanitarian
intervention which doesn't have an
ulterior motive I think that's basically
the question scholar series scholar
found three examples of humanitarian
intervention miscellanies invasion of
Ethiopia Japan's invasion of Manchuria
he didn't mean that they were real
they're ready to venture what he meant
is those are the three cases where a
strong case was made but it's
humanitarian that's there are other
studies that go way back sometimes they
find one example of the French
intervention in Syria
in 1860 or something but then if you
look at the details it was just part of
France trying to establish its about
maybe the British intervention in Sierra
Leone the ads conceived Gandhi's alleged
answer to the question what do you think
about Western civilization if I caught
what you were saying you mentioned the
Congo yeah it's kind of interesting case
the Congo is absolutely the worst
catastrophe going on anywhere that's
pretty awful
yeah but it isn't a fraction of what's
going on in the Congo so why nobody
talks about doing anything just let's
just figure it out in Darfur you can
blame it on enemies
harder for one thing the worst
atrocities are carrying out by Rwanda
which is Washington's closest ally so
that report the other thing is that the
multinational corporations are all over
the eastern Congo for the fighting is
going on and they're using the militias
who are slaughtering everybody at the
gain control over the rich resources of
the eastern Congo and you should all be
applauded at least all of you who have
cell phones and the same with much else
so you know talking making a big fuss
about the eastern Congo is kind of like
this January 2006 election in the free
election in Palestine
it's the only free election in the Arab
world it's not nice to talk about that
while we're creating about democracy
promotion since we u.s. instantly move
in to punish the population harshly for
voting the wrong way and I think I'll
end with a tiny historical anecdote that
Professor Chomsky may not know he
referred to as a French involvement in
Syria which of course was the civil war
between Christians and Druze in Lebanon
was called the anti Lebanon and then
in Federation but in fact the French
went in to protect Christians the
British arrived on warships which they
moored in Sidon and went to defend the
Druze and they said that if the Druze
would intercept British protection they
would have a particularly unique offer
for drew the tribal leader legals and
that is that the British would arrange
for their sons to go to English public
schools
I just like to wrap up I am once again
at thanking the guests for coming baby
professor Chomsky and Robert Pearson
have taken the time out of their
schedule free of charge they don't
charge anyone for doing this and that's
why we were able to do what we do and so
just on behalf of the committee and the
college to start but I just like to once
again thank you
and I don't think we really have time
thing and I just want to give a rundown
of what the a few what events been
happening over the next few days and
tomorrow as always their history having
it's Wednesday night debate and it was
touched on today in the Indian terview
and that this ace would negotiate with
Hamas so we don't address the legitimacy
of Hamas as a political organization on
Thursday night Robert Fisk who is
another gold medalist of society and
gave an address last year which is
phenomenal if you want to get another
taste of that that will be on Thursday
at half seven he'll be here being
interviewed by John Bowman and if you
want to get tickets they're available on
the seminars that are easy for us I
think you can get them at the National
Concert Hall when you go there I'm I'm
not sure but I'm pretty certain from
having woman Brad their website that
there is a student price available so
it's quite affordable and if you'd like
to get involved
there are plenty ways to get involved
with the hist first of all there's the
or now maybe so if you want to kind of
do the things that we do and get some
dinner guests and some of us just email
sensor at the his calm and always check
out our Facebook page you don't need to
be on Facebook to check up and Zoe's got
information about the events that we're
doing and and then finally our next
week's debate and the week after that
will be a student show debate on the
motion to share to forum s pro patria
mori so with that I just like it thank
everyone for coming
you
you
