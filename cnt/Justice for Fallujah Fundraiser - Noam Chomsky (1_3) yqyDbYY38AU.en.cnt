well Ross and dire were on the scene and
good report from there I'm not going to
try to duplicate that I was on the scene
here so I'd like to talk about the way
things look to me from here and still do
a couple of days ago I happened to read
a article in a Pakistani newspaper dawn
for those of you who don't know it it's
not a Taliban newspaper it's the
newspaper of the educated privileged
westernized elite the author mahali was
ruminating on the kind of a reflective
article he was kind of ruminating on the
incapacity of Americans to recognize us
crimes or even to know that they
occurred one example it gives is Vietnam
then it's good example it's been quite a
few years if anything the interpretation
of what happened there has veered
towards support for atrocities as time
went by not towards questioning
ourselves about what happened in fact it
took place pretty fast as you all know
that was a pretty substantial and active
anti-war movement which was involved in
resistance and other actions and had
some effect finally American troops
withdrew two years after American forces
withdrew from Vietnam Jimmy Carter was
then President may be the most no the
least warlike of recent presidents he
was asked in a news conference whether
we owed some debt to the Viet
me and that were about in indochina
maybe four million people killed we
don't as the general who invaded iraq
tommy franks said we don't do body
counts so we don't know how many people
were killed but maybe roughly that that
neighborhood they're still dying there's
still people dying from chemical warfare
kind of like what you saw their children
deformed children so on so what the
numbers are nobody knows who is huge
three countries were devastated may
never recover so Carter was asked to we
owe anything to them and he said that we
we owe no debt but because the
destruction was mutual okay there was no
comment literally at least I couldn't
find any might accept you know people on
the fringes well that was Jimmy Carter a
couple years later came Ronald Reagan
and it wasn't that we oh no dead it was
that it was a noble cause we should be
proud of ourselves then comes George
Bush number one and he said that there
is a problem of debt but they owe it to
us I said we will never forgive the
Vietnamese for what they did to us but
we are generous people so will allow
them into the world the civilized world
if they agree to face the one moral
issue that remains from the Vietnam War
namely dedicating themselves to finding
the bones of American pilots who they
brutally shot down while they were
flying over central Iowa or something
like that that elicited no comment by
now if you take a look at the scholar
for example she expect to be a little
more willing to face the facts a
diplomatic history there is a debate on
Vietnam that it's bounded by two
positions what are called the doves who
say it was a lost cause there was
nothing we could have done to win the
war and the Hawks who said if we fought
harder or we could have won and in
between those two positions you can
locate yourself same is true of
commentary in the press and elsewhere so
my rally was quite right to use the
vietnam example however his main focus
was on President Obama's speech
declaring the end of the mission in Iraq
and if you looked at the speech you'll
see there's nothing certainly nothing
about this in fact nothing about what
happened in Iraq altogether to the the
population but Holly doesn't focus on
that he's more interested on the
critique of Carter speech and
particularly critique from what he calls
the critics of the left quoting he said
he quotes Frank Rich in the New York
Times who said what was so grievously
missing from obama's address was any
feeling for what has happened to our
country during the seven and a half year
war war end that he was marking and ali
says no Frank a far more Grievous
omission was any sense of what the
people of Iraq have suffered it is no
doubt a tragedy that 4,400 American
lives have been wasted in Iraq to say
nothing of the thousands more casualties
in terms of permanent disability and
mental trauma but the cost on the Iraqi
side and every department has been
infinitely larger and it is in that
respect that the absence of remorse is
all the more painful and the absence of
more
is almost total within mainstream
commentary you can try to find it select
Carter we owe them no debt the
destruction was mutual well of course
these attitudes are not a u.s. invention
those urban as far as I know Universal
characteristics of Imperial culture of
the British the French Germans it's hard
to find an exception but we're here and
it should concern us that should concern
us not only because it's us but because
of the significance and import and we're
the most powerful state in the world by
far we spend as much on the military as
the rest of the world combined
technologically far more advanced and
means of destruction 800 bases all over
the world the forward deployment
planning further Wars and their imminent
we can pick them out of the front pages
right now so it's pretty serious if we
can't feel remorse or can't even
acknowledge the facts of what we've done
very recently a little farther back then
the world is in real trouble serious
trouble well Fallujah is a a partial
illustration of this lack of remorse
only partial really I think we were all
here when it took place it was reported
in fact was accurately reported but it
was celebrated so it wasn't lack of
remorse it was celebration of ongoing
war crimes actually I happened to be in
New York during the second attack on
Fallujah the November one I was giving
talks but I dropped all the folks that
was giving and I just used the front
page of the New York Times and talked
about that it was a very interesting
experience urge you to go back and pick
it up in the internet
the could pick any other newspaper but
New York nods most important considered
sort of liberal so I just geared my
talks around what was on the front pages
that day well the attack was preceded by
several weeks of bombing the city the
idea of the bombing was what are
described her boss described I guess to
drive the women and children out so then
you could say there's no civilians so
they were bombed out except for the fact
that the city was cordon off so a lot of
them couldn't get out and they were
killed you could find that out from the
Iraqi reporters who were there like
their men almost a very courageous
reporter who was published say in Egypt
but not here describes families families
murdered and their houses children so on
and so forth kind of thing that rose
talked about the after a couple of weeks
of bombing to sort of clear out these
so-called civilians I should say that
this is this event has resonances it's
similar to other things we know about
for example it's similar to what the
Serbs did inch revered eat you that's
not forgotten that's a major atrocity
and you know we're very irate about it
the reason is somebody else did were
very courageous in condemning the
actions of others especially enemies but
it was pretty similar the Serb attack on
Trevor Nietzsche which was not like this
I mean Trevor Nietzsche had been a base
for attacks on the surroundings serve
villages and it was under UN protection
it was pretty obvious that was going
affiliations doesn't have an analog the
forever neat you but the planning for
the attack was pretty similar with one
difference the women and children
weren't bombed out they were trucked out
so the Serbs scented trucks who took out
the women and children the men were not
allowed out and then came the famous
massacre we tried the bomb amount
instead partially succeeding then came
the masker maybe 5,000 people was the
doctors estimate roughly in that
neighborhood the first after a couple of
weeks of bombing to clear the ground the
marine assault took place and if you
look at the new york times on the first
day of the assault you'll see a picture
of a kind that I've never seen in others
paper before not seen worse atrocities
what you saw is a picture of Marines the
first target that they took was the
Fallujah General Hospital and what you
see take a look at the front page you
see a picture of the ward in the
Fallujah general hospital with the
doctors and the patients torn out of the
patients torn out of their beds thrown
on the floor the manacled the doctors
lined down manacled and an American
soldier standing over and that was
celebrated it was a great thing they
press explained why because conquering
the hospital and treating the patients
and doctors this way eliminated find it
eliminated I'm quoting a propaganda
weapon for the militants the hospital
was was a center for a stream of reports
about civilian casualties which he
inflamed Iraqi public opinion and drove
up the political costs of the conflict
drove up the cost
to us notice it's a conflict throughout
all the recording it's just some natural
event kind of like a hurricane there's
no agents this is the conflict but
somehow it took place no agents and this
is driving up the political costs by the
stream of reports about civilian
casualties so therefore it made good
sense according to the liberal thinkers
of the New York Times and that reflects
the mentality of the places where we
live that's Cambridge that's Harvard and
so on it's legitimate to destroy a
propaganda center which is in flaming
opinion and driving up the cost to us by
reporting civilian casualties well there
were a couple of things that weren't
mentioned in the reports and the
celebration of this achievement but one
of them was the Geneva Conventions the
geneva conventions which are the core of
international humanitarian law is
everyone technically agrees and they are
applied to others with great passion but
the geneva conventions are very firm
explicit unambiguous and forceful that
competence on any side must protect
medical facilities protect them from any
harm well this was not only not
protecting them it was occupying
throwing the patients on the floor
manacle England meddling the doctors
under guard so I said it's a major war
crime in fact it's a workaround that
probably would bring the death penalty
if it ever came to an international
court extremely serious work run well
that was unmentioned least I couldn't
find a mention of it which makes a lot
of sense because the lack of mention
reflects a general understanding in the
culture which we're a part namely that
international law is in
clickable to the United States so
there's no point in mentioning force
irrelevant anyway
