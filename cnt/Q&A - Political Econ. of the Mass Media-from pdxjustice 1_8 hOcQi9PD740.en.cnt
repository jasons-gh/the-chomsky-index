but uh I is there somebody standing at
the mine but why don't we let's just
make it mechanicals start over there
then go over there and then go up there
okay and then we'll go around okay I
can't see yeah I have listened with
great interest to many of your theories
considering political systems and the
ideologies behind them however a number
of statements which you have made in the
past are a great concern to me first and
foremost among them is your claim that
the Soviet Union is in fact a dungeon
and to my way of thinking such a blanket
condemnation of an entire society can
only be regarded to say the least is
inappropriate and moreover I believe
that these kinds of statements can
become quite destructive in serving to
propagate inadequate and outdated
notions of the Communist enemy and I I
just wonder if you're if these ideas
I've been waiting three years to respond
to that statement of yours and I wanted
to be in the light of the the changes
that have that have come about with
glasnost and perestroika openness and
restructuring argue it's arguable what
how significant they are but if you've I
don't know if you still maintain that
strict view on the subject yeah well
first of all I didn't say that the
society is I said the the state is the
government then the you know maybe
people living in their homes or not but
I said it because I think it's true i
mean i think that the soviet union's a
dungeon I don't also don't think it is
anything do with communist or anything
to do with socialism as to the changes i
think you know there one hopes that
they'll work what's happened is that the
jailers have decided to relax it a
little bit notice that those changes are
coming from the top which is good you
know better than having no changes but
in fact Gorbachev has concentrated more
power into his hands than the leadership
had in the past and he's using that
power in something like the manner of
Peter the Great to try to liberalize the
society from above which means to cut
back the restrictions to open it up a
bit and I think that's all to the good I
mean I have a feeling that those chain
will that I have already set forth lots
of you know that when when you produce
changes like that lots of things begin
to happen popular forces do begin to
develop and you get all kind of
conflicts and interesting things happen
and it remains to be seen where it'll
lead so I'm glad to see that the what I
as I see it if you want to continue with
a metaphor that the jailers have decided
to open the cells a little bit and to
allow a little more freedom in the
society I think that's very good and I
hope that other forces get them to
continue to do it but as to I mean we
could just discuss whether this is an
accurate perception of the society or
not I guess you think it isn't I think
it is and I'll explain why if you like
but to get to your to the point you've
raised suppose it it suppose I think
that it is i think i should say it i
don't see any reason not to say it if i
think it's true i guess my only real
question is there's political repression
the United States 22 sure the United
States dungeon no because the United
States a much freer it's affecting I've
what I've said about the United States
and I'll say it again is in many ways to
free a society in the world sure there's
repression here but it's also by
comparative standards very free society
fact I think that's one of the reasons
it has such sophisticated thought
control as I tried to explain the
capacity of the the capacity of the
state to coerce in the United States is
relatively limited you're quite right
that there's plenty of oppression I
mentioned the FBI which is the national
political police which is dedicated to
oppression that's its job it's been
doing it ever since it was founded well
you know that's inconsistent with the
free society but again by comparative
standards remember i'm talking about
comparative standards the United States
is quite a free society the capacity of
the state to coerce i think is limited
probably more so than any other society
I know at least so I don't think that it
would be correct to call it a dungeon
well thank you
violence fall is the school of
communications the comm arts building
school of journalism I imagine there a
number of journalism students in the
audience tonight I imagine they're in a
good number of people who well they
filter in the middle echelon apparatchik
II for the media empire that you've
discussed they come out imbued with the
ideology of value free objective
reporting it's the major ideological
offensive against the kind of model that
you want to pose as an alternative I
wonder if you could talk to the audience
here about the ideology of objectivity
and value free reporting within this
system well there is such an ideology
and it's interesting to see how its
interpreted objectivity means you take
what people in power say and you
reported accurately without distorting
their quotes and then sort of down at
the bottom of the column you know down
at the bottom of the column you may say
things like what I quoted if you're
really an intrepid reporter you say well
this may seem to be inconsistent with
the spirit of the peace agreement that's
you know that's objective reporting if
the state department announces that
Nicaragua has called for revolution
without borders then even if you know it
happens to be a lie an objective
reporter just reports it because they
said it after all it's true that they
said it and wouldn't be objective would
be introducing opinions to say it's a
lie I suppose so there is an object
ideology of objectivity and I wouldn't
just scoff at it incidentally the fact
that matter is that by and large
American reporters if you had to you
know a bunch of reporters describing
something they saw I would tend by and
large to trust the American reporter at
least as much maybe more than those who
come out of other traditions because
this predictive ities not completely to
be scoffed at the effort to try to keep
your reporting to the facts and not the
introduced opinion is a worthy effort
and sometimes it shows up in actor
description and there are some reporters
I should say who do it extremely well
and have a very good record of it and in
fact this even includes reporters who
work for the journals that in my view
are right at the core of the propaganda
system so takes a John Kiffin ER of the
New York Times I think he can tell when
the new york times editors want some
story to be reported accurately for
their own purposes that's when they send
John Kiffin ER to report it because he's
going to report it accurately and when
they don't want to report it accurately
anymore they take him off and put them
back at the Metro desk that's one test
as to what the editors have in mind and
there there and there are times when
they want report as stories reported
accurately and there are some
journalists who really do it on the
other hand when they send Tom Friedman
out their current chief diplomatic
correspondent you know what they want
his propaganda you want somebody who's
going to say as he just said after he
was advanced to this August post that
the United States is now you know sort
of on the Bush administration planning
to support the Central American peace
accords which were introduced and
proposed and advanced by costa rica
guatemala honduras and el salvador
mission there but that's part of the
game that's what happens when you send
Thomas Friedman to record a story and I
presume that the editors understand
these things that's incidentally I
presume why Thomas Friedman is chief
diplomatic correspondent and John Kiffin
arisen but you'd have to ask the editors
about that the so that the get back to
your point the objectivity it's a good
thing it's a good value to be objective
and reporting and the people who do it
honestly do very good journalism but as
you're implying that ideology can be
used to be a distorting mechanism and
quite commonly is
is George Bush's hands-off policy just a
cover and all the action of the
executive branch will be handled
covertly or is it an opportunity for the
legislative branch and the American
people to take back the reins of power
oh I don't first of all what makes you
think George Bush has a hands-off policy
that's how it's reported that's what I
yeah okay but such a break but that's
that's not very good evidence in fact
the fact of the matter is Ronald Reagan
had a hands-off policy in fact Ronald
Reagan didn't presume probably didn't
know what the policies work this isn't
it's an interesting fact about the last
eight years which again should not be
left at the fact of the matter is for
the last I mean they media had to put on
a big pretense about this but everybody
knew you know everybody with our eyes
open new and most of the population knew
that for the last eight years the
country hasn't had a chief executive now
that's an important fact in fact I think
that's a step forward in manufacturers
consent and in fact it's maybe a sign of
the future of political democracy I
think the United States made a leap into
the future in the last eight years if
you they've sort of retract a little but
I think they'll go on and I think other
industrial democracies will follow us if
you could get to the point where voting
is simply
