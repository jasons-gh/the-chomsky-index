it's a pleasure to be here with you
today
it is International Workers day and I
tell me what most international workers
that everywhere outside the night heads
cracked the United States the one
country where nobody knows what it is
yeah in fact the Ronald Reagan
designated May 1st as what he called law
Day a day of jingoist fanaticism like an
extra twisting an extra knife into the
labor movement before that wasn't it
that's our loyalty loyalty to ya
today of loyalty I mean there is a day
in celebration of workers but that's
Labor Day when you go back to work yeah
but I don't think 100,000 Americans
would know that May Day was a day of N
is in most places a day of support for
American workers and their struggle for
an eight-hour day yeah
and it's ironic can say that it all
started here in Chicago started here but
then became an International Day in
support of the American workers who were
being brutally subjected to brutal
violence and judicial punishment they
were fighting for the eight-hour workday
and anarchists at that time or the
driving force of the unions in Chicago
and I thought maybe you could talk a
little bit about that dichotomy that
scene between reform and revolution and
anarchist certainly and during the
Haymarket affair realized the importance
of fighting for something like the
eight-hour workday with a grander vision
and it's always been true yeah I mean if
you take a look at I suppose the most
venerable anarchist journal in the world
at least in English speaking world is
freedom which comes out of London but if
you look at its pages a large percentage
of it is dealing with reformist programs
supporting for workers rights for human
rights for decent pay benefits and so on
I mean there's no contradiction there I
mean you want to
if you're a serious revolutionary and
you really are looking for a not an
autocratic revolution but a popular one
which will move towards freedom and
democracy that you want to have the mass
of the population who are implementing
it and carrying out and solving problems
and so on and they're not going to do it
unless you they have discovered for
themselves that there are limits to
reform so sensible revolutionary will
try to push reform to the limits first
of all because it's helpful to people so
it's better to have an eight-hour day
than a 12-hour day and you want to do
things that are just an ordinary ethical
grounds sure you'll support them but
secondly on strategic grounds you have
to show that the system if it's true
maybe the system will collapse to reform
ok that's fine but if it won't you have
to reach the point where it resists and
there's nothing left but to take things
over maybe by force that's basically
self-defense but unless people recognize
coercion as a form of self-defense then
I'm going to take part in it at least
they shouldn't learn that through there
you learn a3 or yeah I mean you know if
you get to a point where the existing
institution simply will not end to the
popular will will eliminate the
institution's
