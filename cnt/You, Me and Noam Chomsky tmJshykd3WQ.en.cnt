greetings I'm Ken hildebrandt your and
we're here with professor Noam Chomsky
the most quoted living author and this
is really about all of us humans who
live here on planet Earth at the height
of the information age and the media are
hiding things from all of us this
includes you every bit as much whether
you consider yourself conservative or
liberal or right left whatever what
we're going to talk about today concerns
you I mean how come if noms the most
quoted living author how come with all
these political shows we have on TV is
he not on I think we can break the
media's back I want you to look at this
from well we'll start off with a
galactic perspective I mean here we are
in spiral galaxy known as the Milky Way
that takes over a hundred thousand years
for light to travel from one end of it
to the other now light travels at over
186,000 miles per second that's over
seven laps around the earth per second
yet it takes a hundred thousand years to
get across and so here we are out here
are one of these spiral arms on this
rock and we're all in this together at
the height of the information age and
the media are hiding things from us and
it's just astonishing it's it's also
depressing but it could be turned around
if we all get involved so i guess i'm
going to open that up to you know them
and say that you know what do you think
of me so many people talk to you and
others and they think well you know i
hope you have success or good luck to
you and I think what we need to do is we
only get more people involved so what do
you think about that well there
certainly are major problems that people
ought to be involved in in fact we're
kind of like if any of the people
listening feel that maybe where you're
in a group of
lemmings being led across a cliff to
fall down you're not wrong we're being
led across the cliff and we might fall
down two thumbs I wouldn't say species
destruction but the destruction of the
possibility of a decent human life and
anything like the form we have to accept
we have it and or anticipate and there
are two major crisis looming dark clouds
hanging over everything one of them is
nuclear war and it's kind of a miracle
that the species has survived without
severe damage since 1945 there have been
case after case where the threat of
nuclear war came honestly close
sometimes under conscious control often
just by accident sooner or later that's
not you can't engage in a high-risk
enterprise for a long time without the
risk coming in the past we have case
after case which is at a recent case in
fact which is even more ominous because
there was no discussion of when this is
a minor example but it's happening all
the time but it's nevertheless kind of
vivid so when President Obama sent an
assassination team to assassinate to
Osama bin Laden's but not pretty clear
it was a planned assassination could
have apprehended and brought him to some
kind of court or whatever they were
under orders to fight their way out if
necessary if they tried to fight their
way out
confronting the Pakistani army they
would almost certainly have had air
support probably ground support it could
have ended up with a major confrontation
with the Pakistani army that's a major
will organized army and as every
specialist on Pakistani army can tell
you and in fact right there are a
disciplined army dedicated to the South
defending the sovereignty of Pakistan
and if called upon they will fight
furthermore the one of the legacies of
Ronald Reagan is that and his successors
primarily him the Pakistan is one of the
may be the most rapidly growing nuclear
weapons state in the world and also
though jihadi elements are nor near
majority of the population that
nevertheless the society is kind of
interlaced with them there's
overwhelming opposition for the United
States in Pakistan for understandable
reasons that Pakistanis deeply resent
the way in which they're being treated
being bombed invaded pressure to enter
into what they see as an american war in
afghanistan to defeat and indigenous a
surge insurgency Pakistanis don't
particularly like the Afghan Taliban but
they treat them the way they did the
Afghan mujahideen they were fighting the
Russians didn't like them either but
they thought they had a right to defend
their country from foreign attack so
they're being drawn into an American war
which they don't like and they're
suffering from it
well that agonism it increased
enormously with the Obama drone attacks
and the intrusions into Pakistani
territory pressures on the Pakistani
army they go into tribal areas well in
any event this assassination plan if it
hadn't gone smoothly commandos would
have had fight their way out of a
confrontation with the Pakistani army
society and the nuclear facilities are
not only laced with people who are
strongly opposed to the United States
policies that's throughout the society
but also with jihadis it was opening the
opti likelihood that fissile materials
would leak into jihadi hands which means
maybe a dirty bomb going off in New York
and London or something like that and so
thing as far as I'm as far as that
operation is here they have chance to
question the leader of al hey and now
that it seems kind of suspicious to me
that they wouldn't want to have some of
that material or some of that
information worse than I on yeah you're
right i mean they would have apprehended
him they could have brought him to truck
in a decent society you'd bring him to
trial like we did with Nazi war
criminals right we're much worse than of
summin comparably worse than bin Laden
but they were brought to trial the
Nuremberg trials I know what came out
right was educational in fact it helped
establish the basis for modern
international law but not in this case
they wanted him killed and no autopsy
and what well you just you go to
speculate about that yeah you have to
speculate but the fact is that he was
murdered when he easily could have been
apprehended he was defenseless on our
nobody with him but his wife and it may
storm as an Aston was it she for his
daughter it was an ass too I know his
wife was with it oh and these are 79
command Rios yeah the original reports
were all withdrawn rather they were
completely for their recognized to be
falsified it was simply an assassination
lead the White House claim was the wife
his wife was shot and it was claimed
that she the commanders had defend
themselves he lunged at like yeah i buy
food that's the word you want to buy
that story okay yeah but anyway he was
unarmed he was defenseless they could
have brought him out instead they
murdered him they dumped his body at sea
without an autopsy so you don't know how
he was killed right and yes that does
raise all kind of questions he was a
suspect remember right it wasn't tonight
any audible at the mountain if didn't
hear what he said yeah unless a person
is in at least in what used to be our
system of justice right until a person
is convicted he's a suspect right with
the matter if you're certain he's guilty
so Timothy McVeigh was a suspect you
know son Charles Manson was a suspect
yeah that's what it means in law so they
murdered a suspect and dumped his body
in the ocean without an autopsy which is
in violation of forethought Pakistani
law but also international human rights
law well that's what happened but the
there was a threat of nuclear war if you
there other interesting aspects to this
assassination attempt which should make
us think also outside the United States
people not only think but are very angry
about it in many people in the US just
don't care it seems to me they may in
fact in both so-called sighs which we
just
just about last time discussed last time
the liberal media doing a survey they
were all lies and again this was the
choice but miscellaneous dang but yeah
but not outside no outside the country
exactly cross the border in Mexico New
Mexico that was fury about didn't like
the operation but about the name of the
operation opera and Geronimo hi I'm
Geronimo was a hero who are offending is
people from what amounted to
extermination is that food was taking
place in Mexican Mexican territory that
we conquered so the idea that we would
call this operation operation Geronimo
just did it's amazed people in Mexico
infuriated them and there was plenty of
anger elsewhere as well but my point was
that it didn't take carry the understood
perfectly understood risk of a potential
nuclear disaster but it was done anyway
and that goes on all the time so that's
one pending catastrophe the other one is
environmental but that's getting worse
the International Energy Association
just which monitors greenhouse gas
emissions and so on they just published
a report a couple of weeks ago which
reported that greenhouse gas emissions
last year hit record despite the
recession which comes back usage and
furthermore they warned that the world
may be reaching or may have passed the
what has been taken by the scientific
consensus as a kind of a watershed after
which we're in real trouble that's a
right probability of a two percent to
death isn't the deniers I'm sorry I rot
deniers of the global warming
there were some falsified papers and
something to help emails you know that
was all dismissed that was investigated
there was nothing to it but you know
some people wrote emails they should
have written okay the bride there's no
effect on anything well what the thing
it one of the things it gets to me to
the whole and we've got environmental
issues in it and then it can't be have
nuclear power nuclear war and nuclear
power these plants are popping up all
over the place and alternative fuels and
I haven't had the chance of looking as
much into habit and I have but there are
I mean campus called a billion-dollar
crop back in in 1938 februari to popular
mechanics I brought the issue of the
ralph nader he said he called it a
multi-million dollar prob I mean here
how under whether it can support all of
our energy needs or even just some of
them the fact that we're making a legal
something that would help our our
country not only ever logical a
technologically but also the economy I
mean the economy needs a shot in the arm
right now and have would certainly at
least they're getting something and some
are in quite a bit so I don't know that
video it's like these both sides are
just are keeping his stuff promise and
remember seeing it of extra bit of movie
a network that was put out 1976 with
this dies and the anchor was ready to
even see big code it's going to die in a
short time of something like that and
you just don't really tell it like it is
setting you know run a lot of trouble
you know because you people on 65
million others just like we're watching
me right now you know and then less than
I forget the percentage of you read
books and this and that and you know you
probably attest that people have it
you see through the deceit which there
are snare and I just hope that that we
get both right and left people to
realize that we're all being scammed by
the sense of you aren't giving us all
the facts well I I as you mentioned i
don't really know enough about hemp to
comment on it so but read what you sent
me an interesting things but haven't
researched it and can't make a judgment
but there are certainly very clear
things that it could be done we are in
an economic crisis the crisis
joblessness primarily that's the crisis
it's not enough jobs that means not
enough demand that means not enough
production so you end up with a deficit
and so on so there is a crisis we should
be increasing demand so that people can
go back to work there's one way to
increase demand only consumers aren't
going to do it because they're in
trouble partly because the joblessness
business has the corporations are loaded
with cash but they're not investing
because either because they're
interested more in financial
manipulations or overseas production or
or simply because there's no domestic
demand anyway they're not doing it that
leaves government that's the one source
of demand and if you want to get out of
this crisis that's what ought to be done
there ought to be massive programs kind
of like WPA in the 1930s there's plenty
of things that have to be done in the
society none of the infrastructure is
collapsing you come back from Europe to
hear as I did recently you feel you're
coming to a third world country well
nothing's working you know and plenty of
work to be done plenty of hands ready to
do it can't get them together that's a
you know an indictment of the economic
political economy which is just shocking
and it's also known how to do it through
government stimulation well there's been
so much corporate run propaganda against
government against government of course
corporations they don't want to get rid
of government because they rely on
market system so they rely on but they
don't want it to interfere with their
rights so therefore what they'd like is
more corporate control of the society
that means reducing the government role
keep it there for the military to bail
them out when they get in trouble and so
on and so forth but not for meeting
human needs and that propaganda has in
fact successfully convinced people that
the government can't do things and I can
I would like to say of what's called the
Obama stimulus the standard belief is it
didn't do anything actually saved
millions of jobs in fact there was no
stimme there was much too small fact if
you estimated there was no stimulus at
all the federal government stimulus just
about compensated for the decline in
spending at the state and local
government levels so effectively flat no
stimulus you get that from the you know
national economic analyses it was too
small but it did something saved a
couple days job if he had a significant
one of it do a lot that's one way of
turning to a growth economy which could
overcome the major crisis joblessness
and incidentally would do mean more
revenue and hence cut at the deficit but
there's another issue about the deficit
but there are ways even if you put this
aside there are ways to deal with it and
what's more the public is pretty much
aware of them so for example one way to
deal to cut the deficit which is as
enormous public overwhelming public
support is it tax the super-rich exactly
so that's not on the agenda well this
notice cuz apparently now there are some
people I think even in the household
bringing up there are few people are on
the fringe of the dentist percentage of
others yeah it's not on the air not and
they're not
the mains Obama and the mainstream
Democrats given it up of course the
Republicans womp was it and a half and
that's one thing it isn't a lot more
what about military spending he said
Wizards hust barely touched but you know
our military spending is approximately
the same as the rest of the world
combined it's not for defense it's not
for security now when you look at public
there are some studies of what the
public would like to do to cut back the
deficit one aspect correctly is cut back
military spending a hundreds of bases
abroad and so I'm not touched there's a
third thing which is not barely
discussed at all that's the most
important of all of them and that's the
dysfunctional health care system and we
have a it's an international scandal as
about twice the per capita costs of
comparable countries some of the worst
outcomes it's the only privatized
virtually unregulated system and that's
why if Medicare say was extended the
whole population it's sort of like other
countries leave the chances are they'd
be no deficit and I probably be a
surplus actually the details of this
have been worked out by very good
economist dean baker at the Center for
Economic and Policy Research In read
well that's also a shot because you eat
but that's that's not that's not even on
the agenda and the reason is that's what
the people he i think the chanting part
of it yeah i mean the the United drug
prices in the united states are way
beyond comprehension reasons
straightforward it's the only country
where ever the government is banned by
law from negotiating drug prices with
pharmaceutical companies of course it's
at aside the population is
overwhelmingly opposed to this these
things are not even being discussed and
that's simple reason for it it's because
of the enormous power of the financial
institutions and the pharmaceutical
corporate
the financial institutions that the
right before the crisis hit hard 2007
they were actually getting forty percent
of corporate profits their activities
it's very doubtful that their activities
have a positive effect on the economic
system they may affect be harmful under
the role for banks and back in that it's
a the 50s and 60s when so-called golden
age of modern capitalism that banks were
banks though they would take a banquet
takes a your bank account you're not
using that capital and transfer it to
somebody who's using it for some
productive purpose then maybe start a
small answer send a kid to college or
buy a house or whatever it may be that's
what banks are supposed to do in a
capitalist system it was pretty much
what they were doing up until nineteen
seventy early 70s they were in that
right at that point there's a huge
change in the general financial system
that's moved towards financialization of
the economy and offshoring of production
and that's had huge effects one effect
is a massive concentration of wealth and
a tiny percentage of the population
actually a fraction of one private
fraction wonder said that has that one
percent knees and that's high and then
you know economic power translates into
political power so you get policies
which exaggerate this and it's a vicious
cycle it's been going on particularly
since Reagan combined with deregulation
with the massive funding of elections
with the breakdown of the political
parties so both parties now Democrats
and Republicans have pretty much given
up the traditional system for assigning
committee chairs in Congress that's a
position of authority and power used to
be seniority now if you want a committee
chair you gotta pay the party huge sum
of money which means that none are the
elections being bought and with Citizens
United it's probably going to go out
right but it means that every person in
Congress if they want any position of
authority you're going to have to pay
off the party pay off the party means
you know run to the corporation so this
is a this really is a vicious cycles
just and the population is kind of aware
of it so you know approvals are aware of
the memory of the details but approval
rate for Congress has declined to
historic well they can't stand them but
yet when it comes time election funders
you know most of my research has been
involved with elections since 2000 and
many times the Democrats hog the
corporate money and there was just an
unfortunately back in two thousand on
the whole concept of a spoiler really
took root and weeds a very challenging
his system when really to me the media
or the spoilers never want to work on
keeping this we can tell me if you
looked at it Ralph Nader competitive Al
Gore who was vice president of the
prison population United States doubled
and he's against this other guy who was
would scarcely could speak the English
language um you know he really had
somebody who's responsible for seat
belts and airbags and I'm you know like
her or not and as far as what he had
done I think it would have been like you
debated that a former Dutch minister of
defense of Franz a boardslide everyone
you know I mean he ended up just looking
at his watch and excusing himself and
walking off the stage I mean they'll
want to have people in there who are
talking about willful if it's up it is
what the color of South Dakota has
banking system entirely only ones who
want to read I found this out through
interviewing governor candidate for
California and she was just you know
eliminated and arrested for why did
we're trying to just even sit in the
audience and watch a debate that she
should have been a part of I mean I
think that people at the election level
this is where you're really getting
shafted the most I don't know what it
would take it doesn't seem like neither
wants to my cat if he did it would she
pick a running-mate who who was well
known to it has to be more than a
running mate if you want to play the
game in the political system maybe you
don't want to do that but if you if you
do want to do it if do it the right way
it's supposed by by some miracle say
Nader could be elected president he
could do a thing he doesn't have a
single representative in Congress and
may not essential not a single senator
not a single house representative not a
single governor yeah not a single local
school board I mean you know the whole
system it seems that people tobacco
that's my sanity participate in the
system unless if you want to participate
in this system you're going to have to
become a political party our political
party means representatives at every
level it means grassroots organizing it
means participation that means proposing
programs you just can't say look on the
candidate here's my program if it's
going to be a serious I mean yeah that's
I thought about starting a political
parties that what you're talking about I
mean you know I'm put that qualification
and if you want to play the game in this
system may be honest I'm system or maybe
should be a different system fact I
think there should but right in this
system that's what we're talking about
you've got to do something like the
greens but within the confines of this
system we
actually over Hong if we think we had
enough effort if we could it would take
its not its work or an organization
education everything we're talking about
i would have to be on the in the public
agenda it's not going to come from you
know the corporate system not gonna have
from the course of you put all this sexy
but it's going to be well you know it's
just choice choices more than century
like tech for example what i just said
about the vine of committee of committee
at a chair positions that's very
important now you can read that in the
media in fact yesterday there was a very
good article about it by a fine
political economist best one in the
country in my view come Ferguson but the
article was in the London Financial
Times it's an amazing that's what we can
find out what's happening again London
now that's that that's the difference I
mean I foresaw manufacturing and sent
Noam Chomsky in the media so that you
were talking about how lolli these
issues were broad I mean just a few
minutes ago you're talking about in
Mexico yet people want even with the
internet we want to be able to find out
what they're saying Mexico or Canada and
the Internet has a great thing and I use
it all the time but you know it's not it
it's not really a substitute for a
political organization I mean using the
internet to learn things is like some
you know some person who's never had a
science course walking into the Harvard
biology library and saying okay I want
to be a biologist yeah all the
information is there right but you're
kind of you don't know what to look for
you don't know what makes sense what
doesn't make sense you can pick a piece
out and say okay that's important and go
off on some crazy tangent it's it's not
going to work you could use the internet
or any source of information if you come
to it with a framework of understanding
you know what to look for you know what
makes sense what doesn't make sense no
you know these these are not axioms like
if you're sensible you're willing to
question
your prior assumptions but you got to
have some framework of assumptions you
had nowhere so they can look up as far
as on the distribution of wealth you can
hook it up but what is a mission where
is it summer fling for and why is it
there you know we have to look through a
wide variety because it's not enough to
look through a wide variety you have to
know what you're looking for like the
guy who wins the Nobel Prize and biology
is not the person who read the most
journals not it's the person who knew
what to look for that's what it takes
that's what it and that's what education
and organization are about like the tech
say unions the the Norris attack against
unions business hates them you know
business dominate government hates them
they're practically destroyed part of
the reason is just they defend workers
right and of course doesn't like that
but another reason is there a
democratizing force there are way for
people working people to get together to
exchange ideas to interact to learn from
each other to sharpen their own thinking
to formulate policies at their best I
mean all always work like this but if
their best that's what they do and it
that's why you know with all their flaws
the historically the unions have been at
the forefront of just about every
progressive cause i can remember say
from the 1930s when as a kid my family
is mostly unemployed working clips about
what sort of gave them hope and was a
much more hopeful period and was the
fact that they were involved in union
organizing and the union's provided
something so like for my tia seamstress
aunts unemployed ill gu you know ladies
garment workers union provided
educational opportunities a week in the
country social social contacts
educational programs opportunities to
interact with others
the work to try to get welcome thing on
the obvious that we needed help save
unions to but that's what we need to do
is kind of try to ticket after what
they're doing I mean as far as I think
on a community level people just need to
start interacting and say okay well
let's look at it up some of the things
that you what I try to put out their
time to time again you know talking
about the illegality of Canada's we
don't need that kind of waste right now
that's just such a waste of resources
not to mention it makes your society
more dangerous from what we do in the I
mean thinking focus on a few thing I
mean that's to me such a simple concept
and even people like Sarah Palin and pat
robertson to say no probably should be
decriminalized anyone call the face they
forgave Obama for doing okay if you had
said it well convenience store they
wouldn't have forgiven once a crime what
is real that simple I think and the
president of Columbia has recently
called for decriminalization of
marijuana yeah I think it's a big part
of of what's going on and also there's
other things like you talk about I'm
trying to get it throw a lot of active
that they can really a short out of time
but you talked about this time again
about how pleased we could have pieces
and the leads that there's a reason why
they don't show these maps of what how
they want to have their Tuesday
settlement and that the rest of the
world is in agreement as to what we
could do let me get the source of the
grievances as far as well I were in
Afghanistan while we're all the bottle
hated throughout the world I mean a lot
of this has to do with the US and Israel
and in fact that's a big bone of
contention the US was quite isolated on
that and has been for a long time and it
got worse last februari when about
reached the point where Obama vetoed a
Security Council resolution that
basically called for implement
official US policy and of course it was
along doing so it's going to come up
again in a couple of weeks if the
Palestinians go through with their plan
announced plan to go for some sort of
recognition of Palestinian statehood
they're going to get a lot of support
they already are recognized by well over
100 countries Carly majority of the
population of the world big Latin
American countries Brazil Argentina
others and the Europe is kind of
fascinating that's the US but certainly
veto it at the Security Council but the
can't be to it at the General Assembly
and the press can not report it which
often happens with General Assembly
resolutions but it's going to be more us
isolation and pretty much against the
world well nobody actually called for he
was the first he said bors on it no post
say he said if it's due to that would
limit people made a big fuss about that
but that's traditional American policy
the traditional American policy is goes
back to 67 is that a settlement has to
be on the 67 borders and the early
wording was rewire pre-war borders
treatment of the internationally
recognized borders with maybe minor and
mutual modifications that was official
US policy from 67 to the early 70s when
the US was still part of the world on
this issue and that's essentially the
global positions almost unanimous now a
lot Christie notice about Obama said he
said yeah he repeated that but he added
something else right away at his talk to
a pack rat right after that he said we
have to recognize the changes in
demographic realities well that's code
words which everyone understands it
means the Israeli settlements we have to
recognize the Israeli settlements yeah
it's true
but if you do that and you take a look
at the map of the settlements actually
and show it to you that essentially
leaves nothing too late for a little it
leaves isolated Canton's all separate
from a separate from those pretty much
with you so of course the world isn't
going to go along with that and nobody
will the and this business it will
actually been going on for 35 years but
getting more extreme because of the more
extreme the growing support for a
diplomatic resolution of the conflict
and it's understood what it ought to be
and the same is true on other issues
like what's considered say the major
issue I don't think it's the majors or
boards talked about that's the major
threat to world order is Iraq potential
Iranian nuclear weapons yesterday okay
you can think about it what you like but
there is a solution and it's a solution
which is overwhelmingly supported the
solution is a nuclear weapons-free zone
in the Middle East combined with
extensive verification they would know
you do that they only made mad look that
the support for that is so strong
including the American population that
at the there there are regular review
sessions of the nuclear proliferation
treaty last one was last May you pay a
year ago a support was so strong that
Obama had to go along with the Clinton
Hillary Clinton actually was the
representative but they go bomb and
Clinton said yachts fine idea but not
now and furthermore any solute any such
arrangement must exclude Israeli nuclear
weapons before and furthermore they went
beyond they said Israeli nuclear weapons
cannot be placed under the supervision
of the International Economic Atomic
Energy Agency and further more
information about new Israeli nuclear
weapons and information about the
countries that are supporting them
cannot be addressed that was the u.s.
qualification to the call for a nuclear
weapons-free zone well of course that
kills it but that would be a significant
no no not a solution to everything but a
significant step towards mitigating
whatever crisis there might be and of
course the world knows this the it's not
I don't think she reported here but sure
that's that's again go back to the
original point another way in which the
threat of nuclear war is being an end
and well you know I think a lot of the
plot here is that the Christian Right
it's like what we want Israel to exist
but it's real in Israel what exists
right although babies really still
exists is good but nobody wants the
destruction in fact this would be
improve their security a political
settlement would improve their security
but states don't set security is a high
priority now Israel has it had a choice
for the last almost 40 years between
security and expansion and they've
systematically preferred expansion while
undermining security which is not
unusual that's the way States behave and
the US is back them which is why they're
doing so would improve their security
but that's not the issue but the
Christian Right has something else in
mind they want it's a huge block of
voters and they're passionate about it
the art form not a lot right as they are
informed well not out there at the
salary could be well as reap so I think
they may even know that but they got
something else in mind yeah they are
looking forward to arm again exactly
because that you want to have visas and
then so there's a whole belief system
actually probably
push in order to sully believed in this
if you have Armageddon then the souls
that are saved rise to heaven makes a
sort you know Christ comes for a
thousand years of these whole story have
so fine that's they're the most these
pro-israel christian right are the most
anti-semitic people in the world they
want koala Jude's to eat it to be
exterminated or except for 144,000 we're
somehow converted by 12 x 12 but you
know something like that yeah i mean
what but and and there are big important
voting block and a pressure group and
incidentally christian zionism goes back
way before Jewish Zionism and has always
been very powerful the more
fundamentalist countries Britain and
essentially the United States so it's
that there's other interests there's
plenty of other interests which is
preventing the moving forward on this
issue exactly that it's ice it's harming
Israel it's isolating mandates they
don't I think we try to go for peace how
can that emit their supposed to the
followers of the Prince of Peace
shouldn't that be the wake up maybe they
don't want to get if they think that's
true maybe it's not for another 10,000
years you know why should they make it
happen well I said oh no I'm just their
own doc the whole Christian evangelical
movement wrong about but its history
shop it's one segment of the revival
segment but if you look at this movement
the end times movement it actually took
off with the founding of Israel my high
48 is when it took off and that was
taking read James hated these guys
that's when or this you know these
bestsellers and
which men men's of people read and
believe 1948 was supposed to be the
beginning of the end of times right the
1967 was another step towards where I
think about a third of the population in
the United States expect the second
coming in their lifetime if they only
knew it was going off this house didn't
let her I'm the Palestinian they saw the
pictures of the day they're either more
or keeping shot my associate elevator
let's just go back to operation Geronimo
remember this country has completely
suppressed not totally but largely
suppress the what was done to the
indigenous population sure now the
people who were doing it understood it
very well so you read say John Quincy
Adams you know the great strategist is
the father of manifest destiny I mean he
said he described what he called the
fate of that to something like that
hapless race of native americans who
were exterminating with such perfidy and
cruelties it's a heinous sin for which
God will someday bring us to account
they knew what they were doing but it's
so suppressed that you can name an
operation operation Geronimo after one
of the people trying to have something a
good lot of that that's reasonable sum
that we made some headway on some on the
end yeah loving what I far you have to
go yeah the I think that relates to
Israel a lot of the population regards
what Israel is doing is pretty similar
what we were doing I mean we drove away
the indigenous population kind of
exterminated them it's always the right
thing to do because we did it and is
was kind of free revived if you're doing
that I'd like to wrap this up such a
mile at a time being talking but just
the whole separation whether its
attention its population here and those
who took over order at cities the
Israelis and everybody else or even you
know the blacks and the wife we won't
have a comp ancestor on Africa not very
far back for 50,000 years ago I it's not
a long time enough evolutionary history
so all as Jimmy Harris said we're all
families apart in a song machine what's
har if you actually bothered looking at
people's genes it's everybody knows
everybody is completely mixed right
Henry Louis Gates edit e effort American
study program at Harvard did a big study
on this and he discovered that he
himself is fifty percent European fifty
percent to wild African but you know
almost everybody's kind of mixed up so
we're all families apart well with that
moment yeah thanks again I always okay
great
