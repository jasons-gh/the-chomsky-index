I presumed your presence here tonight
means that Noam Chomsky needs no
introduction you know who he is and
that's why you're here all the same I
think I need to comment briefly on the
unique person that he is there is no
other internationally renowned linguist
in the u.s. who has been such an
outspoken critic of the u.s. state and
particularly its foreign policy over the
last thirty years at the same time there
is no one other internationally famous
critic of the u.s. state who is at the
same time such an internationally
respected linguist it is a measure of
the man's uniqueness that he can draw
500 people to a linguistics lecture at
the University of Ulster on Tuesday
night and what 350 400 here to a
political meeting on West Belfast
tonight however there are some who would
point to this combination of interests
as a way of disparaging Noam Chomsky
they hint that he would be a much better
academic if he would only stay away from
such extremist politics that somehow he
is less acceptable as a linguist because
of his outspoken and independent
criticisms to hint that is the first
step in marginalizing Chomsky pushing
him beyond the pale of respectability
unacceptability I'm not exaggerating
here the man who can draw large crowds
to his political meetings and numerous
parts of the world who has probably
directly addressed more students in the
u.s. than any other living person is
usually ignored by mainstream television
networks in the US and his books are
usually not reviewed in the major US
newspapers not even the more liberal
ones ladies and gentlemen
Noam Chomsky
there's a standard view of the current
moment of world history it's so familiar
that it doesn't need elaborate citations
the major idea is that history is
converging towards an ideal of liberal
democracy and classic classical free
markets which are sometimes even called
the end of history this will be the
triumph of the principles of Adam Smith
and Thomas Jefferson and other
libertarian heroes a second related
thought is that we have just emerged
from a cosmic struggle called war in
which these ideals have been triumphant
and vindicated and we are now therefore
entering a new world order in which what
we say goes as George Bush put it
proudly during the Gulf War and what we
say he added is that the nations of the
world are drawn together under American
leadership to achieve the universal
aspirations of mankind peace and
security freedom and the rule of law
well these recall that these impressive
words were proclaimed well yet another
third-world country was being smashed to
bits for the crime of disobedience that
was precisely the crime of Saddam
Hussein who remained a great friend and
Ally of Douglas Hurd George Bush and all
the rest as long as he was just
torturing dissidents and gassing Kurds
I won't illustrate these standard views
at length but just to select a few
typical examples almost at random
the New York Times proclaims that
America's victory in the Cold War was a
victory for a set of principles
democracy and FreeMarkets the world has
learned that these are the wave of the
future a future for which America is
both the gatekeeper and the model in the
Gulf War George Bush was guided by a
solemn principle namely the sanctity of
international borders educated opinion
quite generally agrees so take for
example a highly respected study
scholarly study of the Gulf War by two
University of London professors just
appeared Lawrence Freedman and frien
Karsch
they opened by praising I'm quoting them
praising the scope and originality of
our analysis and its high level of
scholarship and from this august
pinnacle they explained that the United
States in the United Kingdom fought in
the Gulf to uphold the rule of law in
international relations George Bush was
a crusader for the cause of
international norms of Dien of decency
there is in fact a huge clamor in the
West
chanting similar ODEs to our
magnificence self adulation is not a
commodity that's in short supply
among the powerful and the privileged
but there are peaks and we're at the
moment at one of the triumphalist Peaks
well the reality that we see around us
looks a bit different from all of this
first as far as democracy and
FreeMarkets are concerned they're
considered a threat by the rich and the
powerful they're considered a danger to
be overcome the Cold War was real enough
but it should be understood in quite
different terms I think and as for the
rule of law the guiding principle of the
famous new world order it requires a
certain amount of audacity to take its
Guardian to be the only head of state in
the world who stands condemned before
the International Court of Justice for
conducting international terrorism this
meaning on a VAT
scale wholesale international terrorism
not the retail kind that makes the front
pages namely his terrorist attack
against Nicaragua the judgment of the
World Court was of course rejected with
utter contempt by the United States and
its allies this same crusader for
international law opened the post Cold
War era by invading Panama vetoing two
Security Council resolutions with the
help of Britain installing a client
regime that can only be maintained in
power with American guns as Washington
fully realizes and who then reacted to
Iraq's invasion of quite a few months
later in fear that his old friend Saddam
Hussein might mimic what Bush had just
achieved in Panama unless the United
States and the United Kingdom moved
quickly to block the threat of
negotiated withdrawal effects which are
incidentally conceded even by the most
extreme apologists professors Friedman
and Karsh for example the actual reality
was expressed a bit more accurately by
Winston Churchill with his customary
lucidity when he was describing the new
world order of the day in 1945 and he
wrote as follows the government of the
world must be entrusted to the satisfied
nations who wish nothing more for
themselves than what they have not to
the hungry nations who only cause
trouble it must mean the governor of the
world must be entrusted to Richmond
dwelling at peace within their
habitations our power placed us above
the rest and it is our right to rule a
right demanded by the rich men at home
as well
well that was in 1945 Churchill was
outlining a vision to be attained
now it's hope it's a reality to be
enjoyed by the rich men dwelling at
peace within their more than ample
habitations busily pursuing what Adam
Smith
called the vile Maxim of the Masters of
mankind all for ourselves nothing for
anyone else that being the real motto of
the New World Order actually it's it's
valuable to pay some attention to the
heroes that we're taught to revere say
Adam Smith and Thomas Jefferson paying
attention to the reality that is not to
the character caricature that's created
by ideologists they actually had a lot
to say a lot that applies today with
considerable accuracy in my opinion so
for Adam Smith the framework of world
order writing in 1776 the framework of
world order was Europe's conquest of the
world what today is called the
north-south confrontation and
euphemistically and Europe's conquest of
the world as he described it did not
provide a very pretty picture
as he wrote the savage injustice of the
Europeans primarily the English and
their monopoly of violence brought
dreadful misfortunes to those whom they
conquered and the lands that they
ravaged the results he said were highly
beneficial to the conquerors they laid
the basis for England's emergence as a
world leader of Industry and Empire but
even in the home countries Smith
continues only some benefited primarily
I'm quoting him now primarily the
merchants and the financiers who were
the principal architects of policy and
whose interests were peculiarly attended
to as he put it but not the farmers of
the work the urban workers the poor of
the great mass of the population they
did not suffer the dreadful misfortunes
of the third world but any benefits they
gained were incidental or the results of
their own struggles at home Smith in
1776 presented what we would nowadays
call a class analysis of Empire and it
doesn't make take much imagination to
apply the same analysis elsewhere and
leading Ireland well as his remarks on
the vile Maxim of the Masters indicate
Adam Smith was no admirer a free-market
capitalism if the vile Maxim is allowed
free reign he wrote the resulting
subordination of labor will turn working
people voting him into creatures as
stupid and ignorant as it is possible
for a human being to be therefore he
continued in any civilized society the
government must intervene to control the
grim workings of the invisible hand in
fact the architects of policy didn't
need his advice about the dangers of
capitalism they have always from early
England up till today they have always
called upon state power to protect them
from the destructive effects of the free
market just as Adam Smith described as
for Thomas Jefferson and other 18th
century libertarians they were opposed
to absolute power power which is not
accountable to the general public now in
their day the absolute power that they
saw around them and therefore confronted
are called for confronting was the
absolutist State the church the feudal
system slavery with some ambiguity they
did not observe a later development
namely industrial capital at capitalism
with its unprecedented centralized and
unaccountable power over investment
decisions production consumption
Commerce every aspect of life over
resources and so on that's a new form of
illegitimate power far beyond anything
that was contemplated by the classical
libertarians and anyone who takes their
thinking seriously will be a dedicated
opponent of this new form later form of
unaccountable absolute power namely
modern centrally managed state
capitalism
in particular it's newer transnational
forms which are even more absolutist in
character well let me put these crucial
matters to the side for for a moment I
want to come back to them and let's take
a look at the Cold War the origins of
the Cold War give a rather good insight
into what it was all about which in my
opinion is quite different from the
standard story and I think it's
revealing to think it through let's take
the analysis by George Kennan Kenan as
you know was one of the leading
architects of the world order that was
constructed right after the Second World
War but he also happens to be respected
diplomatic historian his leading his
major work is a multi-volume study of
Soviet American relations kind of a
standard work and in it fine my notes
really lost in it
Kenan describes the the origins of the
Cold War which he traces to 1918 January
1918 when the Bolsheviks disbanded the
Constituent Assembly he writes that that
shocking act created the breach with the
West with an element of finality the
British ambassador to Russia
Sir George Buchanan was deeply shocked
Kanin right and therefore called for
armed intervention to punish the crime
well that followed shortly after and it
was taken quite seriously for example
the British the British Army used poison
gas against the Bolsheviks which was no
small matter immediately after the
Second World War the first world war
that was regarded then as the ultimate
atrocity and Britain the British
historians have yet to come to terms
with these facts which were released in
the British archives about 15 years ago
the the Woodrow Wilson you know
idealist was particularly distraught by
the disbanding of the Constituent
Assembly can write his strong attachment
to constitutionality was deeply offended
by the sight of a government with no
mandate beyond the bayonets of the Red
Guard well that's at that point the Cold
War was under way and unstoppable
January 1918 actually history was kind
enough in this case to construct a
controlled experiment for us to be able
to evaluate just how seriously to take
all of this impressive rhetoric a few
months after the Bolsheviks committed
this great crime that started the cold
war has been raging for seventy years a
few months after that Woodrow Wilson's
army disbanded the National Assembly in
occupied Haiti using what the Marine
Corps Colonel in charge
Smedley Butler called genuinely marine
corps methods the reason was that Haiti
the Haitian National Assembly had
refused to ratify a constitution written
by the invaders which would have allowed
US corporations to buy up Haiti's lands
and turn the country into a US own
plantation well I was a problem but a
marine run plebiscite remedied the
problem shortly after under Washington's
guns the US written constitution was
indeed ratified by 99.9 percent of the
votes with five percent of the
population at participating Franklin
Delano Roosevelt later took credit for
this but falsely it appears gone from
what is called history is the
restoration of slavery by the Marines
Marine Corps massacres and terror
dismantling of the constitutional system
the takeover by US corporations which
did turn it into a u.s. own plantation
with consequences that lasts to today
pretty much as in the Dominican Republic
next door where Wilson
armies were only a shade less
destructive because the racist barbarism
of the old Indian fighters didn't reach
such extreme levels when they were
confronting what they called spics
instead of niggers also gone as the
establishment of the National Guard
state terrorist force of a kind familiar
elsewhere that has kept its iron grip on
the niggers ever since with you as
support as in the Dominican Republic and
many other places I should stress that
official u.s. doctrine now well
documented from the Declassified record
from about 1945 official US doctrine for
latin america is that the security
forces must be under the control of the
United States doesn't matter much what
the government is doing if the security
forces are under control they'll take
care of any untoward actions on the part
of the civilian authorities that was
reiterated strongly during the Kennedy
administration and by the Kennedy
liberals I should say well as the record
since 1918 makes perfectly clear
beginning with this utter deceit as the
origins as the record throughout makes
entirely clear the Cold War had
absolutely nothing to do with Soviet
crimes or with any Soviet military
threat the story the real reasons are
quite different and in fact quite
familiar
apart from scale the whole Cold War
falls into place
quite naturally as a typical example of
the so-called north-south confrontation
and to see that it's only necessary to
think through the logic of the of the
north-south confluent eight front ation
the contemporary stage of Europe's world
conquest the leader of the conquest now
being one of the European settled
colonies think through the logic of it
and it applies quite quite quite
accurately to be to the whole history of
the Cold War from its origins
there's a basic principle of world order
the basic principle is that what's
called the third world that is the
conquered conquered regions the art to
provide a servant they they they have a
role that's a service role their role is
to provide resources raw materials cheap
labor markets investment opportunities
nowadays opportunities for export of
pollution that's their job
this is all entirely explicit in
high-level planning documents no nothing
covered now sometimes something happens
which interferes with with the service
role a government or a movement popular
movement will develop or a government
will take over which doesn't understand
that its primary responsibility is to
foreign investors and gets the funny
idea that it has a responsibility to its
own population that there's a name for
that it's called radical nationalism or
sometimes ultra nationalism and again in
high-level planning documents we have a
very rich Declassified record on this in
the highest level planning documents we
read that the greatest threat to US
interests is nationalist regimes which
are responsive to pressures from the
masses of the population for improvement
in low living standards and
diversification of production for
domestic needs its quoting the reason
why that's the greatest threat to US
interests is entirely obvious it
interferes with the business climate
with the climate for repatriation of
profits with provision with with serving
the needs of the primary constituents of
any third world government namely the
rich men who were supposed to rule the
world as Churchill but it now it doesn't
matter what the political coloration of
such ultra-nationalist regimes may be be
anything they can be run by mass
murderers they can be run they can be
influenced by Liberation Theology spy
you know priests organizing
by democratic capitalists Islamic
fundamentalist you pick it whatever they
they maybe makes not the slightest
difference the problem is that they
pursue these completely unacceptable
policies of responding to pressures from
the masses of the of their own
population and to their concerns which
means they're obviously not responding
to the needs of of the conquerors the
rich men who ruled the world by right
and need these regions to serve them
they're the servants quarters and they
sometimes get uppity and they have to be
put back into place now sometimes
they're even worse than
ultra-nationalist though they become
worse if they appear to be successful if
they appear to be successful in terms
which which provide a suggestive model
to others who are suffering from the
same conditions then there they graduate
a step higher from ultra-nationalist
to rotten apple a rotten apple that's
going to spoil the barrel or to a virus
that's going to infect the region the
now then comes a divergence there's a
version of this that's presented to the
public and there's a version that's in
the internal planning record to the
public the rotten apple is going to
conquer the world
so Grenada under Maurice Bishop was a
rotten apple which was going to threaten
literally it was going to threaten us
sea lanes in case the Russians invaded
Western Europe Grenada was going to
block sea lanes and the Caribbean so
that the US wouldn't be able to come to
the support of its the League Western
European allies and the US would just
stand there in total hopelessness well
at the mercy of Grenada
well that's the that's the public I'm
not exaggerating incidentally this is
exactly true I don't forget listening to
Rear Admiral were the chief of staff
kind of in toning sombrely about this on
the radio at the time of the invasion
and leading academics repeated it and so
on that's the public version you know Ho
Chi Minh is going to
get into a canoe and land in San
Francisco and so on the more rational
version is sometimes clearly expressed
so for example when Kissinger and Nixon
were about to overthrow the government
of chile i end this government Nixa
Kissinger pointed out internally that
they were a virus which were going to
infect others all the way to Italy
Kissinger was not a great genius between
us but he didn't think that in days
hordes were going to descend upon Rome
what he thought was not implausibly that
the successes of democratic socialism in
Chile would just send the wrong message
to the Italian voters this was a time
when there was a lot of concern about
euro communism about social democracy in
Europe and this virus couldn't be
couldn't be accepted Nicaragua was a
virus for the same reasons there was a
an Oxfam pamphlet that described the
problem with Nicaragua as what they call
the threat of a good example which is
exactly right
there was a threat that others might
might might try to do to duplicate it
now if you have a rotten apple that's
going to spoil the barrel or a virus
that's going to it's going to infect
others it's necessary you can't waste
any time I mean an ultra-nationalist
threat is bad enough but a virus is even
worse and there's a standard way of
treating a virus
first you exterminate the virus and
secondly you inoculate those who might
be susceptible to it so the standard
response is to try to crush the criminal
and to impose brutal military regimes in
the surrounding regions to ensure that
nobody gets funny ideas that's a pattern
that's happened over and over again so
say when Cuba was a virus back in 1960
the US
first of all invaded and then launched
the world's greatest campaign of
international terrorism
there's just nothing remotely to compare
with it unless maybe he was exceeded by
the
in the garage when terror in order to
crush the virus along with an economic
embargo and strangulation and so on and
it also moved very quickly to inoculate
the region so the Kennedy administration
in a historic decision shifted the
mission of the Latin American military
notice that if you can control the
military as is required then you can
shift its mission shifted the mission of
the Latin American military from
hemispheric defense which was a hangover
from World War two to internal security
and internal security is just one of
those euphemisms that means war against
your own population that was followed by
the establishment of neo-nazi style
national security states all over Latin
America the big one in Brazil and then
spreading affect elsewhere one of the
cases of the domino theory that really
worked to try to inoculate the region
from the spread of the the virus the
threat from Cuba and other techniques
are used as well well that's the basic
structure of the of the Cold War of the
north-south conflict if you look at the
Cold War you find it fits into that
pattern very very naturally scale aside
it's unique in scale of course but has
the same same same structure the
Bolshevik the Eastern Europe Russia and
Eastern Europe are the original third
world even in pre-columbian times back
in the 15th century Eastern and Western
Europe were dividing in fact on a fault
line that runs right through Germany the
the West just beginning to develop the
East under developing and becoming its
it's service area and that split
continued continued right into the early
20th century Eastern Europe stagnated
even continued to decline it was deeply
impoverished third world most of it
especially Russia right into the early
20th century the Bolshevik Revolution
extracted from the third world
a very big sector not Grenada you know
but a big part a major a major service
area for Western Europe therefore what
came under the control of an
ultra-nationalist regime which therefore
had to be crushed and worse this ultra
nationalist regime was a rotten apple
it was influencing others there were
others who got the idea that especially
in the colonial world that they might do
the same thing and this was well
understood well understood and it was
the fundamental reason why the
intervention was necessary actually
that's even recognized today by the
better diplomatic historians of the
leading diplomatic historian in the
United States John Lewis Gaddis is kind
of on the liberal side in a recent book
in which he reviews that history the
Cold War says that the intervention the
Western intervention meaning invasion of
Russia in nineteen eighteen and nineteen
was justified as he puts it in defense
against the revolutions challenge to the
very survival of the capitalist order in
other words by carrying out internal
changes within Russia they were
threatening the survival of the world
capitalist order of the world of uriel
system how were they doing it well again
not because nobody thought at that time
that the Russian was opposed in any
military threat to anyone
simply by the demonstration effect and
that was well understood furthermore the
threat extended to the home countries as
well Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State
Robert Lansing wrote said at the time
secretly we don't know about it said
that the Bolsheviks seek to make the
ignorant and incapable mass of humanity
dominant in the earth they're appealing
to the proletariat of all countries to
the ignorant and mentally deficient who
by their numbers are urged to become
masters a very real danger in view of
the process of social unrest throughout
the world
Woodrow Wilson was particularly upset
that as he put at American Negro
soldiers returning from Europe might be
infected infected by soldiers and
workers councils in Germany in 1919 he
said that he had heard that Negro
laundresses were demanding more money
saying from their mistresses saying that
the money is as much mine as yours
things were you know really beginning to
fall apart right over the Irish Sea
lloyd-george established the commission
about Welsh miners which feared which
concluded that the Bolshevik Revolution
was I'm quoting it in flaming the
hostility to capitalism that has become
part of their political Creed grave
danger that hadn't to be contained so it
was necessary to impose pretty harsh
repression in the home countries as well
as in fact was done and also to somehow
crush the virus now the worst problem of
course was in the third world there you
really had to tighten up the first place
where the United States and the West had
to were able to act on this policy was
in Italy in 1922 Italy was regarded as
about half third-world at the time the
in in 1922 Mussolini marched on Rome and
established the rule of the Blackshirts
destroyed the union's
dismantled the parliamentary system
imposed the terrorists fascist rule that
was welcomed with great enthusiasm in
the West publicly by the governments by
by business which poured money in there
to invest in Italy and this continued
right until the 1930s the reason was
explicit the reason was that this was
the only way to bar the spread of
Bolshevism the choice was between
Mussolini's fascism and a
workers revolution or some other you
know these we call them the ignorant and
incapable mass of humanity taking over
and given those choices naturally we had
to support fascism under the rule of
that admirable Italian gentleman as
Franklin Delano Roosevelt called him in
the mid-30s Hitler Hitler was supported
for exactly the same reason until the
late 1930s the State Department was
advocating u.s. state department was
advocating support for Hitler as a
moderate a moderate who was standing
between the extremes of left and right
that's one we've heard a lot of lately
Hitler was standing between the extremes
of left and right he was a moderate I'm
quoting the State Department in 1937
fascism is a natural reaction of the
rich in self-defense when the
dissatisfied masses with the example of
the Russian Revolution before them swing
to the left
fascism must succeed or the masses this
time reinforced by the disillusioned
middle classes will again turn to the
left this is all State Department 1937
you'll notice the kind of vulgar Marxist
rhetoric which is very standard in
internal government documents and in the
business press because they all see
themselves as fighting a vicious class
war other people aren't supposed to you
know know these things but they're
fighting a class war and they therefore
they kind of read like malice a pamphlet
with you know the values reversed but
the policies that were adopted namely
containment and if possible rollback
that is getting rid of them are exactly
the policies that were picked up after
1945 under different pre-tests and again
business agree there was a u.s. business
decline investment declined in the 1930s
throughout continental europe stagnated
in england but it rose very rapidly in
fact increased by about 50 percent in
germany where the investment climate was
improved and the moderate was in control
and labour was crushed
and you know the threat of the ignorant
masses was was contained
well--that's and that these policies
were picked up instantly right after the
Second World War actually while the
Second World War was going on in 1943 in
Italy the United States moved in and
basically reinstated the the fascist
structure that happened all over the
world a big story which I don't have
time to go through now well as it could
then continues in following years I
should stress that as serious historians
recognize Gatiss Kenan and others
the Cold War began in 1917 1918 not in
1945 and whatever one believes about the
later period there was no military
threat whatsoever up till the Second
World War
but the virus had to be contained and if
possible destroyed and the region had to
be inoculated by support of fascism for
example in Europe exactly the policies
that were picked up as the Second World
War came to an end now by that time the
rotten apple had grown a good bit larger
had included large parts of included
east and some parts of Central Europe
that lopped off another traditional
service region for the west cutting off
access to resources and investment
opportunities and so on other
traditional part of the third world and
what's more the ability to spoil the
barrel and also increased as President
Eisenhower put it the Communists are
able to appeal directly to the masses
his secretary John Foster Dulles
deplored the communists ability to get
control of mass movements something we
have no capacity to duplicate the poor
people are the ones they appeal to and
they have always wanted to plunder the
rich Dulles said this is all internal
discussion that's the main problem of
world history the problem is that
they're trying to plunder those rich men
dwelling at peace within their
habitations
who were supposed to run things and the
Communists somehow can appeal to them we
find it hard to counter that appeal with
our slogan that the rich bought a
plunder the poor which for some reason
doesn't seem to have a lot of Appeal
because you know we haven't we haven't
found the right PR jingle or something
