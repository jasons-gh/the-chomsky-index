I don't actually agree with that I think
a lot of things have changed I mean what
I've been talking about today you
couldn't have talked about not many
years ago but now you can talk about it
everywhere so it's true for example that
I mean say take last November there's a
really horrifying month I mean the fact
that we would sell it was momentous
events that happened in Eastern Europe
no denying it but the fact that we could
celebrate the triumph of you know love
non-violence and so on when at the very
same period we were carrying out
monstrous terrorism and in fact
destroying Christianity a battle against
Christianity in large measure passed
without comment well actually you can
talk about it now
not among intellectuals like you won't
find any writing about it but at the
beginning of the month I happen to be in
Ireland and I not that it was a deep
insight but I just predicted it I said
this is what's going to happen in the
coming month November 30th at the end of
the month I was one of the speakers at
the Boston College Memorial it's the
only one I know of and there's a huge
audience and they could understand and
others can understand well let's change
didn't happen before and there are many
other things like it I'm the country has
become a lot more civilized than it was
that's substantially the result of the
activism of the 1960s and it's aftermath
and it's the main reason why the 60s are
so despised if you read the intellectual
culture that's the Time of Troubles
you know kids going wild
adieu and so on well yeah they were
going while they were civilizing the
country that's when I was a real move
forward in a democratization a lot of
things came out of it you know civil
rights women's rights concerned about
the environment at opposition of the
opposition to aggression right up to the
present I'm gonna say things like the
International Solidarity movement and
all kinds of things they're part of the
activism of the 60s and it's aftermath
and that's it was an immediate response
to that - it's not discussed much but
cross the board across the spectrum it
was real horror at the 60s and a lot of
sin print because they didn't know
enough to sort of in figuring I was
gonna read these things it was published
yeah but for example the one book you
should certainly read and if you haven't
done so yet came out in early 70s by the
trilateral commission that's liberal
internationalists that's Carter that's
where his administration came from
Europe Japan and the United States the
book is called the crisis of democracy
as soon as it came out I figured this
book isn't gonna be in print very long
so I got about 20 copies of it and put
him in the MIT Library and an indeed it
went out of print pretty soon but I
think it came out later when people had
forgotten but with the books the book
was very frank it said
the sixties this is the liberal side of
the spectrum I said the 60s were
dangerous period it was a period in
which people who are usually passive and
apathetic and obedient became kind of
engaged and started pressing their
interests and concerns and the political
arena and this led to an excess of
democracy which is unacceptable and we
have to have more moderation and
democracy and it proposed various
methods to do that some of them involve
the universities right now in fact one
of the things they were concerned about
was the institution's I'm quoting now
the institution's responsible for the
indoctrination of the young the school
the universities the churches they
weren't doing their job these kids were
look what they're doing so we have to be
stricter in indoctrination of the young
and if you look at what happened after
that and we're now seeing it a number of
things were done that one of them was to
try to ensure that students would come
out of college with a heavy debt that is
a disciplinary effect so you know
tuitions started shooting up and all
sorts of other things and in fact you
now have what the press is denouncing is
riots in say California and other places
because people can't afford to go to
school in fact California you know may
be the richest place in the world is
destroying its the best public education
system anywhere I mean they're they've
raised the tuition so high that you know
it's practically like private
universities and it's very likely that
the jewels in the crown Berkeley and
UCLA I'll probably be privatized they're
virtually private now and they'll become
kind of Ivy League colleges and the rest
of the system will decline you know low
level the state college as well you know
students are protesting so they're
rioting they're terrible more of this
terror and many other methods have been
used and incidentally they haven't
succeeded the activism is continued and
it's grown I mentioned the International
Solidarity movement but remember that
that's a movement from the 80s and
incidentally mostly Church based it came
from not from the elite universities
that came from the Midwest you know
South West a lot of it from evangelical
churches and it spread it's there's now
an international solidarity movement all
over the world it was never anything
like that before
and many other things so I just don't
agree with the premises I think a lots
happened
and not enough you know it's never
enough but it means that protest and
activism today can start from a much
higher plane we've got a legacy that we
can use I mean you know propaganda will
try to tell you nothing's happened
but anyone who was alive in the 50s say
knows quite a lot has happened now it
takes a Princeton I mean I was here 50
years ago there were no women you know
nor at MIT for that matter okay
technically but MIT had when I got there
in the 50s and this like you know maybe
ten women around he said yet technically
it was co-ed but now it's 50% women 1/3
minorities you know in formal relations
dress a lot of activism that happened
everywhere okay these things civilize
the country not enough you know but a
lot and they're bitterly opposed
naturally they don't like to lose power
and authority they don't like the
decline and the ability of the
institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young to do their
work properly but that's all to the good
so I I think we don't have to you know
what you can ask whether what's
happening is fast enough to deal with
the problems that are arising and maybe
not know and after all there are real
crises coming and maybe the trajectory
of change is too slow well if that's
true it will be the beetles and the
bacteria whole you talk about it in
their way but we don't have to assume
that and as to how to go ahead we know
exactly how to do it there aren't a lot
of ways just the ways that have always
been used
so is is what's happening putting them
on the path to development well you know
the what's called counter insurgency
which is as old as the hills and talked
about some new story it's better than
just massacring people will it do
anything well just take a look at the
small print sometimes not so small in
the current reports about Marja okay
that was the first big experiment
experiment in the grand new theories
Marines went in cleared the place out
brought in a couple of Afghan officials
the first one they brought in was the
vice president this is a Pashtun an area
whose house are I don't even speak the
language so I mean nobody was talking
about then they brought in Karzai
yesterday it's in this morning's paper
and just take a look at the comments of
the people what they say is the way it's
put is they you know that past Afghan
government was terrible but notice that
they refer to it as the government of
the Warlord's that's the us-backed
government that's the current Parliament
the Parliament of the Warlord's that's
what they're complaining about and they
say we don't like the Taliban but at
least was peaceful and you know there
was some kind of justice and so on you
guys just terrorized and tortured us why
should we put any faith in you and the
reporters say well you know it's and the
Marine commanders well look how much
progress there is at least cars that can
come here and get yelled at but will it
change anything you know I wouldn't lay
bets on it and besides it's none of our
business this is what Afghans should
decide
and it's not Obama had this there's a
lot of discussion about the long period
of deliberation he went through to
decide how to change policy and that
shows how great he is and so on there
were some voices missing and that those
deliberations pretty notably wasn't a
single Afghan they just don't have a
voice in deciding what our policy should
be for their country and interestingly I
don't think we noticed it why should
they have a voice you know they're like
this nation niggers we decide that what
we're going to do for them well they
have voices in fact they're pretty
eloquent maybe you've read I don't you
Fred Milo I Joey F just to take one
example
it's a Afghan woman who's a very
courageous woman she's lived through the
Russian invasion the us-backed warlords
who were so horrible that the population
welcomed the Taliban who lived them to
the Taliban lived under the return of
the Warlord's survived somehow doing
really good things you know educational
programs in the rural areas for women
and so on and so forth she was like the
department too kicked out because she
was criticizing the Warlord's and she
still she writes she speaks even towards
the United States
and I think she probably speaks for a
lot of Afghans
done anyway of testing it but surely
does and she says yeah we need an
invasion
we need an invasion of schools hospitals
roads not an invasion of tanks and guns
well there is an Afghan peace movement
and you can't measure how significant it
is but they've had you know big
conferences they get backing in
Germany not here and you know they have
similar proposals there are also
proposal ideas from leading specialist
mainstream specialists like the Barnett
Rubin and others say we're going about
everything totally the wrong way if you
if you really want to achieve anything
you're gonna have to leave it to the
Afghans and bring in the countries that
have a stake and what happens they're
not run it yourself now the countries
that have a stake in what happens there
are Iran India Pakistan China Russia
they have to be brought in and they
don't like the idea of most of them of
NATO bases their major NATO bases there
so you know they had to be brought in if
you're going to be an international
approach so there are there are things
you could do you know in fact the same
is true of packing us all tied in with
Pakistan Pakistan is a horror show again
another one of Reagan's achievements in
large measure that Pakistan has pretty
ugly history but also good things you
know strong democracy was noticed and so
on the word that Pakistan's has series
of dictators the worst of them was in
the 1980s seahawk it was Reagan's
special darling the Reagan
administration was pouring in aid to
help him it carry out radical Islam is a
ssin of the country with Saudi funding
and swiveling madrasas come from and so
on the Reagan administration was also
pretending that they didn't know that he
was developing nuclear weapons because
they wanted if he'd done that you have
to Congress would have restrictions on
it so now thankfully we have another
nuclear weapons state with a radical
Islamist sector this was being done
theoretically to defend Afghanistan but
if you look back
what was going on was pretty straight
the the CIA station chief in Islamabad
in the 1980s just explained what we're
doing he said our goal here is to kill
Russians it's not going to help with the
liberation of Afghanistan and that's
none of our business and you could see
that when the Russians were through and
they left it to the Warlord's but we're
going to be able to kill Russians this
way
so if Afghanistan goes down the tube and
Pakistan goes down the tube who cares
well okay we're kind of left with that
you know the two states in the world
that are the most extreme centres of
radical Islamism and jihadism are Saudi
Arabia and Pakistan
you know our long-standing allies I mean
that's not the way and Britain as well
as them cultivating radical Islamists
