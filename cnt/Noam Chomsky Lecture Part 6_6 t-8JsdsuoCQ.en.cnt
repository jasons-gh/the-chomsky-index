but that had the wrong lesson so that
one tanked in fact maybe you can get it
in netflix or something if you can it's
worth it but that's what was going on
and continues to go on now in the reagan
years it got much more extreme because
the reagan administration basically
pretty much told employers that it's not
going to enforce labor laws and in fact
illegal firing of union organizers
tripled i think during the reagan years
because once you tell the employers look
where i'm going to force the rules fine
let's break up unions illegally that
increased further in the Clinton years
partly this way but partly by a little
device called NAFTA one of the specific
goals of NAFTA surely was to undermine
us labor unions NAFTA made it possible
for where say some organizing effort was
going on for employers to put up big
signs saying things like transfer job
Mexico meaning if you try to organize
we're going to shift this to Mexico and
in our system you could ask why but the
fact of the matter is owners are allowed
to make those decisions not the working
people maybe I don't see why but anyway
that's the way it is which was a
terrific way of breaking strikes
actually there was a study done under
NAFTA rules by a very good labor
economist at Cornell who estimated that
the number of breaking of strikes by
this method increased by about fifty
percent under Clinton now it's illegal
of course corporation Allah do that but
when you have a criminal state it
doesn't matter you can carry out illegal
acts so as another attack on unions of
course under Bush got worse now there's
one residue left public service unions
they've been protected that's why they
still exist and what we're seeing right
now is a major effort to destroy public
service unions
that's why you have this propaganda
about how you know it's the teachers and
the police and the firefighters that
were tanking the economy that's because
of these unions which are giving them
such fat pensions and stuff again all
total lies but that doesn't matter it's
repeated in the media and people and to
believe it you know in fact a lot of the
polls show that people increasingly
believe it and you can demonize working
people this way just as Obama is doing
and being praised by the Liberals that
was the great achievement of the lame
duck Congress and you'll see the
reaction i presume to the state of the
union where he announces a supposed to
announce a five-year freeze i presume
that's going to include a freeze on pay
for federal workers which means the
reduction of course and it'll undermine
unions more thank you i think since
there are a lot of people better try to
keep questions short okay
thanks for coming it's it's great to
have you here what I want to know is
with so much of your life spent towards
examining you know political systems and
government policy if you ever yourself
considered running for political office
or creating a political party because
I'd vote for you like that the worst
person who could pick and in most
academic departments like mine at MIT
graduate department there are certain
jobs which are painting and actually did
administrative leave writing the
department so there circulated among the
faculty usually given to the most junior
person and then everybody has to do it
over the last 50 years I'm the one
person has never been selected because
they know I'll make such a mess of it
that's that one I couldn't do it you
know furthermore it's totally impossible
the only person who can win an election
is somebody who can in our current
system is somebody who can amass
hundreds of millions of dollars from the
major core components of the economy
like the financial institutions so it is
just not even an option the way things
stand now
I'm sorry this will be the last question
though we don't have time for any more
oh so this is the last question okay
sorry can you hear me fun woman in there
so why don't you ask me two questions 2
questions yeah oh you're starting the
line okay Oh guarding all right okay go
ahead you can hear me no I can't but she
won't say I have a I have a short quote
from bacon on seditions and troubles i'd
like to read quote from who it says it
is a certain sign of a wise government
and proceeding when it can hold men's
hearts by hopes when it cannot buy
satisfaction when it can handle things
in such manner as no evil shall appear
so peremptory but that it had some
outlet of hope and what I'm food
ok this is bacon not begging which I
thought it wasn't first it is a certain
sign of a wise government and proceeding
when it can hold men's hearts by hopes
when it cannot buy satisfaction and when
it can handle things in such manner as
no evil shall appear so peremptory but
that it hath some outlet of hope which
is the less hard to do because both
particular person's and factions are apt
enough to flatter themselves or at least
two brave that which they believe not
they used to have nice long sentences in
the 17th I think the thrust of it is
that if you offer hope rather than and
don't worry about satisfaction you may
make it you'll be a wise government it
sounds like a prescription for the Obama
campaign I mean I don't usually agree
with sarah palin but when sarah palin
makes jokes about what happened to that
hopey changey stuff it's hard to
disagree if you take a look back at the
you look back at the rhetoric of the
campaign it was hope and change actually
if you look back that was the same for
mccain he also talked about hope and
change but he didn't do it as
effectively and financial institutions
didn't like him as much and no and so on
but hope and change for what you know
what was it what's it supposed to be
well we could see what it is right away
first act of the administration was to
pick an economic team of course we're in
the midst of a big financial crisis
financial crisis had been created by
deregulation by criminal activities of
the big banks by fraud and so on and so
forth so who's your economic team people
are perpetrated so for example rubin
robert rubin who was the
guru and the one Obama listen to that he
was Treasury secretary under Clinton his
greater cheat one of his great
achievements was to push through the
retraction of the glass-steagall Act the
depression-era Act which separated
commercial banks from investment firms
so that commercial banks would be pretty
safe investment firms can make wild you
know actions was not going to harm the
savings of people so Reuben helped break
that down along with phil gramm
Republican and Senator the first thing
he did after he broke that down was
leave the Treasury Department become a
director of Citigroup which immediately
benefited from that act by picking up a
major insurance company leading the way
to its tanking at which point the public
had bailed him out and he walked away
with tens of millions of dollars so
that's the guy you picked to be the head
the next advisers Larry Summers who
fought really hard to break down
regulation of derivatives exotic
financial instruments there are another
major contribution of the crisis and so
on down the line in fact the Bloomberg
News which one of the major business
journals did it had an article right
after Obama picked his economic team and
they ran through each one of them and
their background and said conclusion was
these guys shouldn't be making economic
decisions they should be in court facing
subpoenas I mean they're the ones who
created a disaster right and from then
on it goes on from there I mean take the
health reform big exciting thing first
of all the health reform was welcomed by
the insurance companies you go back and
read the business press in august two
thousand nine Businessweek
had a front-page story insurance
companies you know hailing health reform
then after that they continued the fight
against it because it wasn't good enough
for them but what they liked was they
were getting a a lot of new customers
paid for by the government but the
running the program was going to be in
their hands they'll make the money from
it I mean some regulations they didn't
like and now they're trying to get rid
of the regulations but not very good for
them the public for decades you look at
polls either a considerable majority or
big plurality and so the questions asked
have been in favor of a national health
system like every other industrial
country which would be much more
efficient much lower administer of costs
much more effective but that's been
considered politically impossible in
fact that's the word that's used well
Obama was talking about it before he got
into office but that quickly disappeared
there was a little residue of it the
public option but business the financial
system didn't like that the public did
by about two to one the public favor the
public option that was given away
without even a an effort kind of like
the tax cut for the rich 221 opposed but
you know who cares about them the one of
the crazy things in the American
healthcare system different from any
other country is that by law the
government is not permitted to negotiate
drug prices so of course they go out of
sight drug prices are much higher than
other countries there's one exception
the Veterans Administration the
government is allowed to negotiate so of
course they're much lower the public
supposed to that by about eighty-five
percent Obama gave it away without even
a war
you know and so it goes down the line
and yes if you can give people hope you
don't have to give them satisfaction
except it breaks down pretty fast broke
down by the last election here we see it
breaking down and Egypt though they
didn't try to give them hope just for us
let's all thank professor Chomsky for
coming one more time
