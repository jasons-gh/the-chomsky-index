Bob Marley real situation here on
democracy now democracynow.org the war
and peace report we're on the road we're
in Watertown Massachusetts I'm Amy
Goodman President Obama and European
leaders arrived in France today ahead of
a key NATO summit to commemorate the
60th anniversary of the alliance Obama
will visit Germany today as well which
is also playing host to the summit the
French city of Strasbourg is under
security lockdown with 25,000 police on
patrol following a day of clashes
between protesters and riot police three
hundred people were arrested and a
German press photographer was
hospitalized after being hit in the
stomach by a police rubber bullet tens
of thousands of demonstrators have
descended on Strasbourg and the German
towns of Kel and Baden Baden to protest
the summit France has temporarily
reinstated border controls with Germany
to restrict access to protesters the
focus of the summit will be Afghanistan
where 70,000 troops mostly under NATO
command are at war
President Obama will use the talks to
enlist support for his escalation of the
war Obama sent 21 thousand extra US
troops to Afghanistan is considering
deploying 10,000 more meanwhile Taliban
militants in Pakistan marked the start
of the two-day summit by destroying a
fleet of nine part NATO vehicles in
transit for Afghanistan last week
President Obama defended his decision to
send more troops to Afghanistan the
world cannot afford the price that will
come due if Afghanistan slides back into
chaos or Al Qaeda operates unchecked we
have a shared responsibility to act
not because we seek to project power for
its own sake but because our own peace
and security depends on it and what's at
stake at this time is not just our own
security it's the very idea that free
nations can come together on behalf of
our common security to talk about
Afghanistan NATO and the state of US
economic and military power in the world
today we're joined by one of the world's
most astute thinkers and most important
intellectuals of our time linguist
philosopher social critic
political dissident Noam Chomsky Noam
Chomsky's a prolific author and
Institute professor emeritus at MIT the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
just down the road from here where he
taught for over half a century among his
many dozens of books our rogue states
the rule of force and world affairs the
new military humanism lessons from
Kosovo fateful triangle the United
States Israel and the Palestinians
manufacturing consent necessary
illusions thought control and democratic
societies and failed States the abuse of
power and the assault on democracy it's
a great collection of his work just out
now edited by Anthony Aronov called the
essential Chomsky Noam Chomsky welcome
to Democracy Now it's great to be with
you here in Massachusetts in the studio
instead of talking to you on the phone
at home so let's start with what's
happening with this NATO summit
celebrating 60 years France rejoining
after more than four decades your
analysis the obvious question is why
bother celebrating NATO at all in fact
why does it exist it's 20 years now
almost since the Berlin Wall fell NATO
was constructed on the with the reason
whether one believes it or not that I
was going to defend Western Europe from
Russian assault that once the Berlin
Wall fell and the Soviet Union was
getting to collapse that reason was born
so first question why doesn't it exist
well in fact the answers are interesting
gorbachev made agree remarkable
concession at that to the united states
native essentially run by the united
states
he offered i'm gonna interrupt you for a
minute known because there's a lot of
static on your mic and we want to fix
that so we're gonna go to a music break
and then we're going to come back to you
we're talking to Noam Chomsky stay with
us Noam you were just saying at MIT they
have these technological problems to the
master is a sensitive technology right
the leading technological institute in
world commencement the system briefly
summarize what you were just saying if
people are having trouble here anything
static well I think the first question
to ask about NATO is why it exists we're
now approaching the 20th anniversary of
the fall of the Berlin Wall unification
of Germany first steps and the collapse
of the Soviet Union
now the alleged reason for NATO's
existence was to protect the West
against a Russian assault you can
believe what you like about the reason
but that was the reason that by 1989
that reason was gone so why is there
NATO well that question did arise
gorbachev offered at that time to the
united states which runs nato that he
would permit a unified germany to join
nato a hostile military alliance aimed
at the Soviet Union now that's a
remarkable concession if you look back
at the history of the 20th century
Germany alone had practically destroyed
Russia several times and now he was
offering to let a reunited militarized
Germany join a hostile military alliance
back by the most awesome military power
in history well there was a quid pro quo
George Bush the first was then President
James Baker the Secretary of State and
they agreed in their words that NATO
would not expand one inch to the east
which would at least give Russia some
breathing room now Gorbachev also
proposed a nuclear weapons free zone
from the Arctic to the to the
Mediterranean which would have again
given some protection that in fact the
security for peace well that was just
rejected I don't even think it was
answered well that's where things stood
in 1989-90 then Bill Clinton was elected
one of his first acts was to break the
promise that expand NATO to the east
which of course is a threat to Russian
security now the pretext given for
example by his stroke Talbot who was the
Under Secretary of State for Eastern
Europe is that that was necessary to
bring the former satellites into the
European Union but that can't be there
are states inside the European Union
that are not part of NATO in Austria and
you know Finland Sweden so that's your
irrelevant but it was a threat and
Russia of course reacted to the hostile
threat increased attention well going up
to the present President Obama's
national security adviser James Jones
has been a strong advocate of the view
that NATO should expand further to the
east and to the south and that in fact
it should to the east of the South means
to control the energy producing regions
the head of NATO Dutch secretary-general
Schaffer has proposed advocates that
NATO should take the responsibility for
protecting energy supplies to the west
the pipeline's sea lanes and so on
well now we're getting to Afghanistan
which is right and has always been of
great geostrategic importance because of
its location now more than ever because
of its location relative to the energy
producing regions in the Gulf region and
in Central Asia so yes that's what we're
seeing actually there's more to say
about NATO about why it exists so we
might look back say ten years to the
50th anniversary
well the 50th anniversary of NATO was a
gloomy affair there was right at that
time NATO was bombing Serbia illegally
as everyone admitted claiming it was
necessary for humanitarian reasons there
was the at the NATO summit that was much
agonizing about how we cannot we cannot
tolerate atrocities so near Europe was
an interesting comment since at that
time NATO was supporting atrocities
right inside NATO Turkey for example was
carrying out with massive us a huge
atrocities against its Kurdish
population far worse than anything
reported in Kosovo right at that time in
East Timor
you're not going to praise yourself so
if you don't mind I will at the time of
the daily massacre which you and Alan
heroically exposed atrocities continued
and in fact in early 1999 they were
picking off again with strong us support
again far beyond anything reported in
Kosovo that's the US and Britain the
core of NATO right at the same time in
fact Dennis Blair President Obama inside
President Obama's national security
circle he was sent to Indonesia
theoretically to try to get the
Indonesian army to stop carrying out the
mounting atrocities but he supported
them he met with
the top indonesian general general
Wiranto and essentially said you know go
ahead and they did and in fact those
atrocities could have been stopped at
any moment
