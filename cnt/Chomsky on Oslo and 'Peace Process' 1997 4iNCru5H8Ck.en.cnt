well the title as you heard is has to do
with the peace process in the Middle
East peace process is in quotes as if
it's a technical term I
I'll start by in fact spend most of my
time talking about the latest stage in
the so called peace process what's
called a load to the agreement that was
signed on September 28 at the White
House I want to talk about two aspects
of it one just what the bare facts are
so at least we know we're talking about
and to the way it's been portrayed this
part isn't really about my ideas about
the story this is I'll try to keep as
close to simple fact as I can without
you can censor if I go beyond after that
I'll make a couple of remarks about the
background and again I want to talk
about those two aspects what the bare
facts are and the way it's portrayed
which is also the comparison between the
two is there some significance I think
and then a few remarks as time allows on
some prospects and more general
significance closes well since this is a
classroom I might as well use it the
bare facts of these the Oslo two does
not deal with the Gaza Strip that
remains as in Oslo one which was Israel
took about 30% of it
and I'll talk about the status of it
later and that remains the same so this
has to do with the West Bank the areas
conquered in 1967 and the West Bank
areas connected in 1967 these are
divided into four zones zone
a is the zone of Palestinian
administration there's to be a
Palestinian council elected which will
run zone a zone B is what's called a
zone of autonomy autonomy means local
control local administration by
Palestinian authorities over under over
under over all Israel a security control
the zone B zone C it's the part that is
totally controlled by Israel and that is
a fourth zone which held ism these are
official names oh this is a non official
name that's mine
zone D which is a greater Jerusalem
that's an indefinite and expanding area
around East Jerusalem to the north and
the East that's also part of the West
Bank officially but that's known D and
nothing is said about done B in the
agreements just zones a B and C well
let's begin with zone D the my name
again the Israeli the Jerusalem and the
area around it that if you look at the
map say the big should say incidentally
I'll talk about the cap D size and
character of these zones this is all in
a sense unofficial that as there aren't
official documents aren't really
available in great detail but there are
plenty of maps and plenty commentary and
speeches by high Israeli officials and
in fact I'm relying mostly on the
Israeli press now although its period in
New York Times and other places here too
if you look at the New York Times map
for the Israeli maps or in fact any of
the others you'll notice that zones D is
just assigned to Israel period it's not
even part of the West Bank anymore it's
assigned the West the same color as
Israel on the on the New York Times map
if you look and the reason is that the
Israel simply announced that while back
but
that Greater Jerusalem I'll talk about
its scope in a moment it will remain the
eternal and undivided capital of Israel
and there's no comment on that you may
recall a while back arafat made some
comments about how the Palestinians were
going to continue their struggle for
Jerusalem as in accord with the official
wording of the Oslo agreements that
caused a huge uproar in the West about
how the old terrorist hadn't abandoned
his ways and so on but that was me this
is yaara thoughts gia had when prentice
era being announced a while back that
Israel's jihad was over they had already
completed it and that this would remain
the eternal and undivided capital with
whatever borders they decide on that
aroused no comment at all no comments
about the old terrorists and so on and
so forth and as I say the maps simply
assign it to Israel period without
comment and that makes sense this is an
accord with US policy so therefore it's
correct by definition and requires no
comment
it's not a US official policy I should
say officially the u.s. opposes this but
it's us actual policy so that judges on
me
well let's look at the other three zones
the ones that are still under discussion
don't see Israel's that's roughly
seventy percent of the West Bank
seventy-two percent according to Prime
Minister I being around that
neighborhood around seventy percent
that's total Israeli control no
Palestinian Authority whatsoever the
autonomy zone the zone of Palestinian
local autonomy under Israeli control
that's on the order of you'll notice
these aren't going to add up exactly to
one
because they're approximate that's on
the order of 30% 29 31 % something in
that area and that's divided if you look
at the Israeli maps and you bother to
count that's divided into roughly a
hundred separates scattered sectors so
there's about a hundred sector here
roughly these are rough numbers which
are scattered areas around within the
70% that Israel controls and those
scattered areas are the autonomy that's
where there's local Palestinian control
and the area that's under Palestinian
Authority is something on the order of
two percent plus or minus that's that's
the NSP areas basically downtown areas
of half a dozen towns in the zone see
this one has a hundred and forty
thousand according to the Israeli
sources one hundred forty thousand
Jewish settlers a couple hundred Arabs
zone B has his own spean a and together
have 1.1 million Arabs
that's the those are the sort of bare
facts of the towns one was contested
thee these this area has no Jewish
settlers the one town Hebron has Jewish
settlers so that was contested there are
about 450 Jewish settlers and around a
hundred thousand Arabs so there is real
keep substantial control
that's heparin one town with people in
it
well of the areas conquered in 1967 to
the West there are about 300,000 Jewish
settlers now according to Israeli
sources about half in an Arab formerly
Arab East Jerusalem which now has Jewish
majority which has been annexed to
Israel and is has indeed been growing
and is continuing to grow pretty rapidly
since Oslo one
well that's those are the bear
facts now let's take a look at some of
the background provisions which go along
with this since Israel made compromises
that insists on compromises from the
other side and the compromises from the
other side are some provisions first of
all Oslo 2 reaffirms the provisions of
earlier agreements like the Cairo
Accords of May 1994 which stipulate I'm
quoting it now that Palestinian any
legislation by Palestinians and their
one or two percent or whatever it will
be any Palestinian legislation I'm
quoting cannot deal with the security
issue that falls under Israel's
responsibility and cannot seriously
threaten other significant Israeli
interests protected by this agreement
the Israeli administration which covers
the whole hundred percent everything
retains exclusive Authority in
legislation adjudication policy
execution and responsibility for the
exercise of these powers in conformity
with international law international law
is another rather flexible concept which
means whatever the United States decides
that's by definition international I'm
sure they teach you that in the
political finance courses here the the
so that means the whole intricate system
which is quite complex of military
ordinances remains intact
apart from quoting such legislative
regulatory and other powers as Israel
may expressly grant to the Palestinians
while Israeli judges retain veto power
over any palestinian legislation that
might be putting again that might
jeopardize major Israeli interests which
have overriding power those are all
quotes from the may 1994 Cairo agreement
which remains now Oslo 2 adds more to
vet it
to it that any future Palestinian
Authority that's returning to the
Palestinian Council that's to be elected
as much fanfare now about elections in
the zone of Palestinian administration
and there is to be a Palestinian council
and any such council must recognize
quoting the legal rights of Israelis
related to government and absentee land
located in areas under the territorial
jurisdiction of the council so that's
referring in these areas let's get at
hundred scattered sections here 90%
there in that area they've got to
recognize and of course the rest you
don't talk about there they have to
recognize the legal rights of Israelis
related to government an absentee land
which means in effect that the any
Palestinian authorities won't have to
accept the legality does accept has
accepted the legality of existing Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories
already existing ones than any future
ones that Israel may choose to construct
including the ones now being initiated
and it also recognizes Israeli
sovereignty over whatever parts of the
West Bank Israel will decide ultimately
to control it we'll call them state
lands or absentee lands which are these
are unilateral decisions so you decide
them any way you like
now how much is that well we don't
really know in detail but there is a the
main kind of careful scholarly sources
the report on Israeli settlements of the
foundation Middle East peace in
Washington very reputable journalists
they've had they've assessed it as being
probably about ninety percent of area B
that's that falls under this that's
where these conditions apply that's only
an estimate because the ruling
authorities don't release specific data
since they want to keep it flexible
well those provisions are kind of
important it's always so important that
they're not repeated he recorded here at
all as far as I know
the there have been a whole series of UN
resolutions on the occupied territories
for years starting and starting
immediately after the occupation in
November 1967 UN 242 the fundamental
document drafted by the United States
incidentally all this all such
resolutions are rescinded that's what
but that's what this legislation means
all pronouncements of government service
ended including the US government there
had been a series of such Security
Council and other resolutions unanimous
statements by governments including the
United States which rejected flatly the
annexation of Jerusalem declared the
settlements illegal called upon Israel
to observe the Geneva Conventions
rejected the right of acquisition of
territory by force called on Israel to
withdraw and so on all over all
rescinded by the agreements of Oslo to
crucially UN 242 which doesn't even
follow this no is the sort of basic
diplomatic framework for discussion UN
242 is completely dead and buried along
with everything else in the whole
diplomatic history that have whole
diplomatic process which has been going
on since since then in which since 1971
the United States has flatly opposed and
totally opposed and utterly prevented
from proceeding that's what's called the
peace process 25 years of refusal to
allow any diplomatic process to proceed
I'll come back to that but anyway it's
all over because it's all rescinded by
the by the specific providers of slow to
one can see the importance of not
reporting it in brief what it comes down
to is that the United States does where
wants and its client where they want and
how they want
in fact total capitulation to the most
extreme US demands from 1971 which have
been hell
in virtual isolation and that's a matter
of much significance if you want a sort
of an analogy to get a sense of what
happened it's kind of as if the state of
New York let's say I decided to withdraw
its police forces from the slums and
South Bronx and Buffalo and let them
sort of run their own affairs while
keeping all of the the urban areas where
it's worthwhile living the commercial
and financial centers the industrial
areas the suburban regions the entire
resources and so on and so forth
meanwhile allowing the turning the
area's put aside let's say South Bronx
over to mercenary forces run by the New
York the police or State Police but from
the outside that's the standard pattern
of colonial control it's the pattern of
the u.s. say to the British in India
about 90 percent of India was controlled
by Indian soldiers under the British
Empire the whites of South Africa and
Rhodesia used mostly black forces in
fact they're the ones who carried out
the worst atrocities the United States
and Central America we don't call it
colonies but that's just cosmetic US
colonies in Central America are run by
local terrorist forces called the army
or something like that and that's in
fact the standard style of colonial
control it's stupid for any colonial
power to try to run you know the local
people with its own forces much get
better to get local mercenaries usually
brought from with a region or something
like that and Israel's finally
recognizing that the only thing that
makes any sense is to revert to the
classic colonial pattern the South
African Indian you know British in India
type pattern in the areas that it's
handing over to some degree of cost
Indian authority again the this
percentage roughly in these roughly
hundred scattering sectors in there
well the another standard of comparison
which gives you a sense of what's just
happened in Oslo to is to compare to use
the standard of comparison the position
taken by the United States and Israel
couple years earlier that is let's take
the period of the peak the peak moment
of rejection flat projection of any
dealing with the Palestinians and any
Palestinian rights was in 1988 at that
time the US and Israel insisted that of
course they were posed in a Palestinian
state as they were now but they insisted
that Israel keep forty percent of the
occupied territories 40 percent of Gaza
and the West Bank that was explained by
defense then Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabine of the Labour government said
Israel's going to keep permanently about
40 percent of the territories they want
the rest is a waste of time
in 1995 we've just seen what the press
calls a historic compromise painful
peace great sacrifice namely they take
twice as much along with with
resolutions with with agreement side
provides us which rescind the whole
record with all resolutions bearing on
the legality Geneva Conventions and
everything else that's the historic
compromise well there has indeed been
another change and that's to be
mentioned Israel has recognized the PLO
as the representative of the Palestinian
people of course not in any official
declaration but in a side letter that
was handed that was submitted alongside
of Oslo one and that change has called
forth a huge amount of commentary here
great acclaim for
especially forget Sakura bean and his
ability as they put it to overcome his
revulsion for his old enemy I mean it
was hard he finally agreed the those who
Herald this fantastic transformation
prefer not to pay attention to what's
being said by the objects of their
admiration for example Shimon Peres
who's now Prime Minister and the person
who is doing us the dealing with the
Palestinians and is considered the Dove
the sort of extreme dove in the cabinet
he said right after Oslo one that yes we
are recognizing the PLO but there has
been he said on Israeli television but
there has been a change in them
not us we are not negotiating with the
PLO but only with a shadow of its former
self namely a shadow that is willing to
abandon all of its demands and those
demands had been over certainly in
nineteen since about the mid seventies
explicitly in 1988 the demands had been
for negotiations leading to mutual
recognition in a two-state settlement
along the lines of the international
consensus held by essentially everyone
outside the United States they banded
that so now we're willing to negotiate
with them instantly it was that position
that branded the PLO a terrorist
organization unfit to enter negotiations
according to u.s. doctrine in the and
commentary virtually unanimous well
there have been another change since
Oslo Ottawa one the September 93 just
the bait straight that was the first of
the two consummation of the first stage
of the peace process
there's been another change since then
mainly the ratio of killings of the
Palestinians and Israelis has changed it
used to be virtually all popularity
mostly Palestinians killed since I was
low one that's for Mozilla from
September 93 up to a mid 95 I don't have
subsequent figures
from September 93 up till mid 94 there
were 255 Palestinians killed at 137
Israelis killed so that is a substantial
change the term for that is an upsurge
in Palestinian terror which is not false
but plainly not quite the whole story
so that's change meanwhile about since
from October 94 to January 95 so many
play time figures are available 2400
Palestinians were arrested for alleged
Islamic tendencies meanwhile Israeli
terrorist actions in south Lebanon in
fact all of living in much as they want
go on freely and they're perfectly well
known when Shimon Peres took over as
foreign minister right after the
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin there was
a front-page headline that said Paris
set stone of post ravine era and if you
bothered reading the article you notice
that in it it mentioned that Israeli
planes were bombing south of Beirut
well north of what they call their
securities on the security zone as a
zone that Israel holds in south Lebanon
from which it was ordered to lead to
withdraw immediately and unconditionally
by a Security Council unanimously
Council resolution in the March 1978 but
since the US didn't mean it and the u.s.
runs these things they're still holding
their security zone and with the aid of
a terrorist mercenary army but they also
accept the right to bomb anywhere else
and
that was announced once again the date
of the on the day that she mon Paris
took over and like November the adjacent
column that day was about what the
column called what the US government
called a desperate act a horrible act
the world at work of cowards namely the
bombing of a US military training center
in Riyadh Saudi Arabia which also is not
false but again quite the whole story in
the Israeli terrorism in something
Lebanon in the first half of 1995 killed
about a hundred people mostly civilians
for example two children killed in July
north of security zone by anti-personnel
weapons more since in our Jersey often
know anything about then but anyhow that
keeps happening and is still happening
two days ago
Israeli tanks wounded
apparently seriously wounded three
Norwegian UN soldiers in the security
zone with any personnel weapons that did
get a couple of lines but we know
anything more about it
these are peacekeeping forces these are
UN peacekeeping forces but they're from
Norway they're not let there
u.s. soldiers US soldiers don't go to
take part in peacekeeping operations
which is a wise thing because the shot
at and wounded or others who face
threats
that's only other countries in our case
the White House announced we're going to
have robust rules of engagement National
Security Council are not like these
wishy-washy Europeans it's going to be
like the National Security Advisor
announced that if they fool if anyone
fools around with our forces we're going
to the the status of the situation is
kind of is illustrated rather well by a
high court decision last May Supreme
Court decision last May not recorded
here it was there's an Israeli human
rights group table of aid which is a
group it works for workers rights it's a
real Israeli group with you know
professor from Hebrew University and
that sort of thing and they had appealed
to the High Court for restitution to our
workers of about a billion dollars that
had been taken off their salaries and
for social benefits denied pensions that
kind of thing but had never been given
to them that had gone into the state
treasury and this this is over the last
of during years the occupation and the
appeal was for restitution of it well
the appeal was turned down by Justice
bussaco the High Court because he said
that the robbery of the billion dollars
was retroactive Lee legalized by the
legislation the Knesset legislation that
authorized the Oslo Warren agreement
furthermore he accepted the legitimacy
of the government's argument which as he
said was the following the government
had argued that the goal was never to
keep Arab wages up the goal was to keep
Arab wages up only on paper while
keeping them low in practice and the
point of keeping them high on paper
meaning they didn't get them but
somebody paid the wages into the
Treasury was to prevent
Jewish workers from having low wage
competition get the logic if you okay
that's not explained and then he went on
to say that this is just the same as
instituting protective tariffs so of
course it's perfectly legitimate sort of
thing that government does to protect
its own workers so therefore it was a
legitimate in the first place in any way
it's retroactive Lee legalized by Oslo
one well Israel's ban on development was
well known that Israel had they're very
good reporters in Israel have been
covering the West Bank very well for
years one of them spanning Rubenstein no
particular dove incidentally extremely
good reporter he said he brought a
reason are to the Jerusalem the Jordan
peace treaty there was a you know people
went up and back and they could sort of
see what things were like in Jordan and
he wrote a long article after having
covered the West Bank for years in which
he said that yeah we all knew that every
effort had been made to impoverish the
people of the West Bank but he said he
was still surprised to see what it
amounted to when he went to Jordan any
rate quite an elegant article I actually
have it here pretty quote song if you
like but the basic gist of it is that he
said look this is a reasonable
comparison the West Bank and Jordan
there's about the same number of
Palestinians pre-1967 the West Bank was
somewhat more developed in advanced
Jordan is of course a poorer third-world
country Israel's a rich first world
country which gets huge amounts of aid
way beyond any country in history and
therefore the comparison II said is
pretty striking in Jordan poor
third-world Jordan the situation for the
population has improved enormously since
67 in the West Bank it's either stayed
the same are gotten worse in Jordan
there's roads and electricity and what
health services and schools and you know
factories and so on and so forth in the
West Bank
nothing just destruction in in Jordan
you said arid Jordan see more much more
air than Israel there big water projects
and as flourish
agriculture all around the East Bank in
the West Bank nothing the there there is
for Jewish settlers but not for the
Palestinians in fact 5/6 of the water in
the West Bank is used either by Israel
itself or by Jewish sets a couple of
hundred thousand Jewish settlers there
that's the with regard to the resources
another part of Oslo too is that Israel
continues to keep control of that's not
changing Israel did there was a an
agreement about West Bank water with
Israel's waters not under discussion
there's a there was an agreement about
West Bank water between Israel and
Jordan it was interesting that had no
mention of the Palestinians they were
not even considered a party to that
agreement and that's traditional since
the two states were founded in 1948 and
even before in the Free State period
Israel and Jordan have been united in
their opposition to Palestinian
nationalism in fact they colluded during
the 1948 war and repeatedly said they
after in the 1948 war the designated
Palestinian state was essentially was
partitioned in half in fact between
Israel and Jordan more or less by
prearrangement you know like they're in
a document which they signed it but that
was the agreement
and that it was partitioned the part
that was taken over by Israel is not
even discussed that's just part of
Israel the part that was taken over by
Jordan that's what we call the West Bank
and is now mostly being taken over to
finish it i Israel as I said takes about
5/6 of West Bank water and apparently
will continue to and also most of the
water of Gaza which really is extremely
per capita that is arid the that's why
reporters point out and travelers and
human rights workers and so on that when
you travel around these areas like say
Gush Katif and Gaza or the West Bank you
find swimming pools and fish ponds for
which you now get extra subsidies
artificial lakes and tourists
tells green lawns of water intensive
agriculture and so on meanwhile to nape
at the arid villages you may not have
water at all like how drinking water
perhaps certainly nothing like that in
the southern part of Gaza for 20 days
last summer the Israeli Water Company
Marut that supplies water just turned it
off because the people didn't have
enough money to pay their bills you go
to the West Bank you find towns like
Dubai di which is without water for 18
months eight thousand people the nearby
Jewish settlements as I say have green
lawns and swimming pools so on in Hebron
last summer pretty hot summer the
thousands of people without drinking
water for a long time and those
arrangements are presumably to continue
Israel claims the right of historic use
of West Bank water which they claim
gives it the right to continue to use it
under international law that's the
historic use since 1967
but the real right is just the rule of
force what rules International Affairs
generally and that means approval of the
superpower that pays the bill and makes
the rules that so that's international
law so they're right about that another
aspect of the agreements not mentioned
but implicitly taken care of is the
Palestinian refugees they are finished
there is nothing there about the
Palestinian refugees the millions of
refugees who are elsewhere are gone
fabric 10th what was that two days ago
that was human rights day celebrated as
always by exalted editorials about the
sanctity of the UN Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and the terrible
relativists out there I don't you know
don't understand like us that you should
you have to honor it incidentally on the
side the US is in the lead in violating
the International Universal Declaration
of Human Rights about half of that we
don't even recognize that even
recognizes applying mainly all the
provisions on social and economic rights
but let's just keep to the part that the
u.s. considers valid under its
relativist principles that
the civil and economic and political
rights the in that part the best-known
article of the UN declaration on Human
Rights is article 13 and that the reason
that's very well-known especially in
places like Boston is that on human
rights day every year it was big
demonstration you know led by Harvard
professors calling on Russia to observe
article 13 of the UN Declaration of
Human Rights which says that everyone
has the right to leave their country
which it does and then there's another
phrase which was never mentioned
everyone has the right to leave their
country or to return to their own
country that part somehow people forgot
about and the reason was that the
advocates of the passionate advocates of
the article 13 we're calling on Russia
to let the Jews leave were the most
extreme opponents of article 13 so
therefore was necessary for them and the
loyal press and everyone else to refrain
from saying that there was another
phrase there and to return to their own
country and the reason for refraining
from that was well-known that phrase was
put in in specific reference to
Palestinian refugees that who had just
been driven out and that was made very
clear the next day December 11th 1948 in
UN resolution 194 which correct which
declared that the Palestinian refugees
have under article 13 have the absolute
unconditional right to return to their
homes
and if we had to keep quiet about that
half of article 13 well the hypocrisy is
finished at least thankfully the first
half is now irrelevant and the second
half has been rescinded they don't have
a right anymore but unilateral us
decision so that part of article 13 is
gone
Clinton has been the most extreme in
this regard
Clinton has cut US aid to Unruh which is
was the major the refugee organization
that was set up to take care of these
refugees until they receive their
guaranteed right under the UN
declaration of human rights to return to
their homes
he cut the u.s. contribution they were
the biggest employer in Gaza in fact the
center has been shifted from Lebanon to
Gaza to make it clear that they're
finished as far as the refugees are
concerned UN sources say that the u.s.
is planning to eliminate Unruh
altogether in 1993 and 94 for the first
time the US government under Clinton
voted against the UN resolutions on
Palestinian refugees before the u.s.
used to vote for them but it first
didn't mean it now it's at least honest
it's just straight voting against them
again alone in the world on this the
well let me turn next though there's
more to say about what's going on but
let me turn to the reaction which
there's been kind of interesting here's
a sort of a sample from the world press
I'll just start some headlines Israel
agrees to quit West Bank
that's the Guardian in London starting
from the far left okay Israel agrees to
quit West Bank big headline front-page
story
Israel and PLO sign agreement extending
Palestinian rule to most of West Bank
that's a Reuters chronology reprinted in
The Boston Globe and the Financial Times
biggest business press in London all
over the place
Rabia negotiated the accord to
essentially ceded to eventually cede
Israeli control of the West Bank to the
Palestinians that's New York Times
Israel Robin proposed walling off the
West Bank in Gaza from Israel
that's the Washington Post Robbins
thinking underwent a remarkable
transformation from 1992 it was
astonishing because
he agreed to peace with the Palestinians
that's the big think piece in the new
york times after his assassination the
plans inevitably lead to an authentic
palestinian state not a banter stand as
some critics claim that's the London New
Statesman you know now we're really on
the left
in an article denouncing Edward Sayid
for having pointed out correctly that
it's leading to a van to stand as the
Israeli press points well it's a
historic compromise a painful peace
Christmas Dennis monitor you know Boston
Globe and so on there was a day of all
that September 28th the day in which
Israel agreed to quit the West Bank was
a day of aw big Boston Globe headlines
said that's pretty fair sample in fact
and a very fair sample if we have to
look hard to find any deviation from
that I haven't found any in fact has
some interesting features the press
coverage one interesting feature has to
do with factual claims which are not
just false as one expects but ultd early
observe they're not even close to true
so it is really greet acquit the West
Bank well you know have a look at the
figures did Israel and the PLO sign an
agreement extending Palestinian rule to
most of the West Bank take a look
did Rabine negotiate an accord to
eventually cede Israeli control of the
West Bank to the Palestinians as New
York Times says hint certainly nothing
in the Accords or any other records and
in fact he said the opposite very
explicitly I read you his account of
what the ultimate solution will be the
permanent long-term one did his thinking
undergo a remarkable transformation from
1992 with
yeah it's true actually in 1992 he was
still calling for about 40% of the West
Bank
this time he settled for about twice
that much so that's the kind of
remarkable transformation maybe but not
exactly what was intended art does the
plan inevitably lead to a real
Palestinian state not a ban Thurston as
the New Statesman claims out on the left
well you know the lefties can believe
what they want on the basis of doctrinal
fanaticism but if you turn to the facts
there's certainly nothing of the kind
these really commentators are quite
accurate and just to make clear a Shimon
terrace writer who's now foreign
minister and remember that's the dub
right after the signing of the agreement
he had a meeting of ambassadors in which
he explained it to them and he said what
you're thinking about a Palestinian
state he said that will never happen you
can be certain of that
so whatever the New Statesman they
prefer to believe she want Paris the
negotiator the dovish negotiator like
Grameen has a different idea shortly
after Paris had a meeting with Newsweek
editors Iran quoting from the Israeli
journalists who accompanied him he was
asked in took by the Newsweek editors
wouldn't this lead to a Palestinian
state and the answer was a resounding no
and he then started I'm quoting on a
learning explanation of why but he
wasn't able to finish because right then
the OJ Simpson verdict was announced
so everybody raced off to the television
set to watch that and afterwards the
Newsweek editors were so excited by the
OJ Simpson verdict that they couldn't go
back to this kind of minor question
about you know why there would never be
a Palestinian state so we really don't
know the rest of what he intended to say
well of all of these headlines the one
that this one that's accurate namely the
Boston Globe when we should be cheer our
local talent the headline that
referred to a day of awe it was quite
correct the true dimensions of the it
was a very impressive achievement with
the US carried off and its true
dimensions only become clear if you look
a little bit at the background how long
hadn't fair you know came close to a
conference and confrontation between the
US and Russia we damn near had war as
Robert McNamara secretary defence put it
and nobody wanted fool around anymore it
was too dangerous so a diplomatic
process was set in motion and its major
step was UN 242 Security Council
resolution 242 in November 1967 which
rejected the right of acquisition of
territory by force and went on to call
for full peace in return for a full
Israeli withdrawal those were the terms
full peace and return for full
withdrawal now for withdrawal had a
qualification there could be minor
border adjustments minor and mutual
border adjustments now that remember was
there's been a lot of lying about this
so it's worth remembering that that was
US policy official US policy Arthur
Goldberg u.s. mediator sort of sold the
thing to the Arab states by insisting on
this full withdrawal minor and mutual
mutual adjustments if necessary and that
remained you in Sofia Israel wouldn't
accept the full withdrawal and in 67 the
Arab states would accept for peace so of
course everybody signed it but he had
people that's diplomacy but nobody meant
it you know at that point well that
remained official US policy it was in
fact made even more official and open by
the official US government plan
announced by Secretary of State Rogers
Rogers plan in 1969 endorsed by
President Nixon and so on that there's
just no question about this I mean we
haven't done of all the documents but
enough to know that this was the
position the that so it went until
February 1971
and then things change crucially in
February 1971
Egypt became the first Arab state to
accept completely the u.s. position
president Sadat of Egypt in negotiations
led there was a mediator UN mediator in
our yarn who made made a proposal which
is approximately this and Egypt agree
instantly it didn't deal with the West
Bank just with the Sinai so it was like
part of it he's a guy in return for
Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai forget
the West Bank Egypt would accept full
peace all arrangements you know wording
of UN 242 and so on Israel recognized
that as a genuine peace offer as their
words rejected it saying they would not
withdraw from to the 67 borders in
Yitzhak Rabin's memoirs he describes
this as a famous milestone on the road
to peace well that's his factor remains
memoirs in US history it is gone
try to find it the even scholarship as I
say lies about it just flatly lies about
it or suppresses if not entirely but for
the most part the reason is pretty
straight for at that time the US had to
make a decision was it going to keep to
its own policy the policy it had crafted
or was it going to shift and join its
Israeli client at that point in
rejecting US policy and there was a
struggle internally and it was won by
our visionary Henry Kissinger who
insisted on what he called stalemate
meaning no negotiations just forced and
everybody thought at that time that
force was in the hands of Israel in the
US so it wasn't an issue so no
negotiation stalemate u.s. rejected its
own policy and since by definition the
u.s. is pursuing the peace process that
is a definition incidentally the peace
process is by definition whatever the
United States is doing so since and so
therefore this had to be erased from
history
and in fact it has been erased from
history but it's there you can find it
if you look the well since that time the
US has been alone in the world aside
from Israel virtually alone in rejecting
withdrawal so half of UN 242 was thrown
out the window the withdrawal head and
that's instituted in Oslo - that's part
of the u.s. victory no withdrawal except
as the u.s. decides that's one risk
that's the main respect in which UN 242
has been eliminated now in enough the UN
242 is completely rejectionist said
nothing about Palestinians they're
referred to as refugees Sadat's offers
said nothing about the Palestinians they
exist about the world world attitudes on
this changed in the 70s and by the mid
70s there was a recognition of
Palestinian national rights the rights
of the in the indigenous population and
that reached the UN Security Council in
January 1976 in a resolution put forth
by the three confrontation States Syria
Jordan and Egypt and backed by actually
by the whole world Russia and Eastern
Europe Europe Western Europe the
non-aligned countries most of the I
think or most of the Arab world the PLO
openly everyone in fact except Israel
which rejected it in the United States
which vetoed it this was a resolution
calling for a settlement along the law
exactly like UN 242 all its wording and
everything except that in the areas that
Israel would leave there would be a
Palestinian state that was the one
change from 242 so that was a
recognition of Palestinian rights which
the US has opposed so the u.s. vetoed
the resolution so that's at a history to
again try to find it even in scholarly
literature and that continued off the
rest of the story but that continued
from then right through till 1990 the
United States simply blocked every
effort to achieve to carry through a
diplomatic settlement whether it was
coming from Europe or the non-aligned
countries are the Arabs or the PLO or
from the early 80s it was getting tricky
because as the PLO was insistently
calling for negotiations leading to
mutual recognition and that had to be
suppressed in the United States the New
York Times totally suppressed it in fact
refused even have a reference to it
refused even to print the letters
referring to it as the foreign editor
once actually wrote someone wrote a
Palestinian professor in the Midwest
said we will not allow letters referring
to this other newspapers like you know
San Francisco Herald Tribune and so on
whether it's called herald-examiner
sometimes you know I had stories about
it but it was getting a little hard to
suppress but still the u.s. continued to
do so right through the 80s until it got
totally impossible at that point in
December 1988 the United States was
literally becoming an international
laughingstock act literally because of
its flat refusal to recognize - its
insistence that are about to say that
word has role to put it which he'd been
seeing insistently over and over again
it was becoming kind of a joke
so the u.s. agreed to try to shut them
up and put this danger of negotiations
aside the u.s. agreed to what he called
a dialogue the purpose of the dialogue
was explained by the visionary of
structure of beam to a delegation of
peace now leaders who were a little
worried about the dialogue in February
1989 he said don't worry about it
doesn't mean a thing he said the purpose
of the dialogue is to give us a year or
more to suppress the Intifada the
uprising that was in going on to
suppress it by violence and harsh
measures and then the whole business
will be over and everybody was happy
with that and that's indeed what oh and
it's still happening
two days ago Israeli tanks wounded
apparently seriously wounded three
norwegian un soldiers in the security
zone with any personnel weapons that did
get a couple of lines but we know
anything more about it
these are peacekeeping forces these are
UN peacekeeping forces but they're from
Norway they're not let
they're not US soldiers US soldiers
don't go to take part in peacekeeping
operations which is a wise thing because
the shot at and wounded or others who
face threats that's on the other
countries in our case the White House
announced we're going to have robust
rules of engagement national security
counselor not like these wishy-washy
Europeans it's going to be like the
National Security Advisor announced that
if they fool if anyone fools around with
our forces we're going to hit them and
hit them hard and then more some the
president added with deadly force but
there's an implication there from what
wasn't said the implication is you guys
can commit as many atrocities as you
like but don't fool around with our
forces because if you do you'll really
get smashed
that's our military doctrine and that's
why the United States never takes place
takes part in peacekeeping operations
operations where civilians are involved
sometimes it's willing to move in when
it looks sort of easy like in Somalia it
looked as though the famine was sort of
more or less over in the fighting it
died down so it looked like you could
kind of move in and get some good photo
ops but it turned out that you know some
teenagers struck their fists and that
sort of thing and the thing ended up
with according to Washington sources of
somewhere between seventy five hundred
and ten thousand Somalis murdered a
couple of dozen American soldiers and
that's why the US does not take part in
peacekeeping forces and until we can
civilize our own society to some extent
that's a wise decision anyway the the
the the the Norwegian troops were they
did the fact that they were attacked by
Israeli tanks did get a couple of lines
we have to be honest about that well
that's so the terror and that goes on I
mean there's no comment about Israeli
terrorism in Lebanon it goes on as they
feel like
and it's sort of right in a way they
inherit the right of terrorism from the
master who has universal right of
terrorism and if you're a client you
just kind of get it by inheritance
there's no point in saying anything
about that well what about these
Palestinian forces that are being
brought in to run the remaining areas
under the standard colonial pattern they
are extremely brutal very brutal there's
been extensive discussion about this in
the Israeli press and Palestinians who
Palestinian human rights activists and
lawyers and others have tried to say
something about it and take quite a
beating the that shouldn't really come
as any particular surprise first of all
this historical precedent I mean that is
the historical precedent so it's not
surprising that it's being applied here
to under this new colonial regime and
also it was announced in advance right
immediately after the Oslo one agreement
Prime Minister Rabin explained to the
Knesset Israeli Parliament that the
Palestinian forces who were being
brought in mostly from the outside
incidentally on the classic pattern the
Palestinian forces who were being
brought in to deal with the Arabs he
said will be able to do it on quoting
him without problems caused by appeals
to the High Court of Justice without
problems caused by the Israeli human
rights group B'Tselem without problems
from all sorts of bleeding hearts and
mothers and fathers they'll be able to
just handle it right Henry Kissinger
recently described it sucker beam as a
visionary he said when you sit where I
do and where I have the number of
world-class thinkers among statesmen is
very limited and he was one of them the
visionary Kissinger that may not
understand very much but he recognizes
as a fellow visionary when he sees one
he was dawdling oppressed by God was
impressed by that kind of comment of
which there are many incidentally the
visionary Rabine had also outlined the
permanent settlement the outlines of the
permanent settlement remember this is
just a stage the permanence of the
permanent settlement he told the Israeli
Parliament the Israel will maintain
control of United Jerusalem which will
extend he said it will go as far it will
go as far as my LED to mean to the east
and give up Dave and the north those are
outside suburbs Mali the meme is quite
far to the east its borders reached
about eight miles from Jericho and it
goes almost to the Jordan Valley which
Israel will also keep and in addition it
will keep he said blocks of settlements
on desert designated blocks of
settlements in Judea and Samaria as in
Gaza referring to what's called the
Gousha Qatif block the fact that these
are blocks of settlements are important
that was one of the big things that were
fought about in the Cairo agreements of
the Palestinian Authority was willing to
initially willing to grant the Israeli
settlements all sorts of rights but
Israel insisted on blocks that means
being region surrounding the settlements
and those will be whatever they'll be
but those blocks according to roving
will remain along with Jordan Valley
Jerusalem extending virtually to the
Jordan Valley now notice that that
bisects any potential Palestinian area
there are other breaks if you look that
cut it up further into what are called
Canton's in the Israeli press very much
is in Gaza well that's the final
settlement that's looked forward to
which is essentially the what is act is
it that Israel will keep all the
territory it now has that would be
completely crazy in fact probably
they'll go back to something like the
most extreme demands that have been put
forth in the past the current agreement
is in fact way out at the extreme in
fact what it looks like now is the show
run
of 1981 the arielle share on the extreme
right wing of Israeli politics put forth
a plan in 1981 was a little different
than the Labour Party plans not all that
different but somewhat different and
this one kind of looks like that I as
has been pointed out in these really
press I should say and Arielle sharone
himself is reported by the American
press to be pretty pleased with the
whole business also not surprisingly
because it's the most extreme proposal
that's ever been made also pretty
pleased Israel Harel who was the founder
of the yes shot Council that's the
council of settlers and tour settlers in
Judea and Samaria and the editor of its
ultra-right journal mokuba he said yeah
we can live with this it's fine
Yossi Beilin who's the right-hand man of
Shimon Paris and considered a really
far-out dove he informed these really he
repressed that all settlements remain
intact he said that the negotiations
were delayed for some months so that we
could carat because of the immense
financial investment involved in
ensuring that the blocks around the
settlements remain completely intact and
building them and then he added that the
situation for the settlements was never
better the settlements in the West Bank
and that's pretty well accurate in
Israel it's been pointed out in the
press and the mainstream press that the
arrangement that's now being made is
rather like the instance it's not like
the end of apartheid in South Africa
it's like the institution of apartheid
it's like the moment when a part the
apartheid system was instituted with
Bantu stands and the you know past rules
and all that kind of business and that's
pretty much what's happening now that's
an accurate description well turning the
facts on the ground which now which sort
of work this out as you know implement
it
there's been a considerable expansion of
settlements in the occupied territory
since the Oslo one agreement was was
signed and that's continuing there's
been an increase of 40% in building
starts since 1993 though instead hasn't
yet reached the peak periods of before
also being built there a very elaborate
network of bypass roads in fact the
military budget the budget was just
announced a couple days ago and the
military budget goes up largely because
of the construction of this tremendous
array of bypass roads which are big
highways designed to make sure that
those hundred or so sectors of local
Palestinian autonomy will be invisible
and separated from one another which
means you already can but when this is
finished it will be even easier to drive
around the West Bank from Israel to
Jordan and through the West Bank and so
on without ever seeing any Arabs except
maybe you could see some huts up in the
hill you know behind a dirt road that
doesn't go anywhere it's nothing like
that and that's continuing at a very
substantial rate the new budget just
announced a couple days ago
which was supported by the right-wing
incidentally it was supported
unconditionally by the coude right-wing
part of the government has about 30 over
30 million dollars for new settlements
starting new settlement activity in the
territories and it spelled out so that
it it incorporates busca the--the
southern part of the gaza strip into the
Negev into the Israeli negative in the
Agriculture Department budget and it
gives special inducements to settlers in
the southern part of Gaza for building
things like fish tanks this is an arid
desert area incidentally where almost
all the water is most of the water is
used by a couple thousand Jewish
settlers so you go there any build
things like fish tanks you get more
there are also inducements continuing
inducements to settlers to go to the
West Bank they have a consider
a higher standard of life than the ones
who remain in Israel because they get
special subsidies to try to get them to
go there and those are going to continue
including new inducements to go to my
lad to mean this big region to the east
of Jerusalem to be ultimately unified
into it where there have recently been
veteran lands expropriated for new
Jewish settlement and there's a new
bypass road that was just opened on
October 23rd the new plans are to add
six thousand dwelling units there in
twenty-four hotel rooms they're aiming
at a population of 50,000 there which
will ultimately be assimilated into
Greater Jerusalem and as I said more or
less bisects the West Bank that's one of
the many several Canton's Gaza treated
same way it's been sliced into kind of
enclaves the roads they're roads that
cut it all over the place one of the
roads cuts is at the most strategic area
it separates Gaza City which indeed is
handed over to the Palestinians because
Israel just want to get out of there
it's hands over Gaza City that separates
Gaza City from the big refugee camps and
the rest of the network of roads cuts
the strip up in all sorts of other ways
it's also the Palestinian areas are
separated from Egypt as well and that
means that the population can freely be
imprisoned either all or in part
selectively at any time that anyone
wants that Israel wants and the same is
true now in the West Bank the
imprisonment is done by simply road
control or which is closures or even
worse by curfews these are done for
various reasons sometimes for punishment
but more often for deterrence so after
there's a big Israeli atrocity the you
have to punish the Palestinians and that
happens routinely so for example after
the massacre at the Ibrahim eat at the
mosque in Hebron the Palestinian
population was put under long and heavy
a few to deter them from any reaction I
and sometimes it's done for us common
sometimes done for other reasons like
around this time of side signing of
asthma passe l'eau - for several weeks
the population was just imprisoned you
know make sure that nothing went wrong
and sometimes it's done for other
reasons so for example to kind of to
just deliberate Jewish citizens from the
annoying presence of the locals example
is a couple of months ago during the
Passover holidays in 1995 I'll just
quote from the Hebrew press on this the
Arab population of Hebron was locked up
under 24-hour curfew for four days
reason quoting now so that settlers
that's the 450 Jews Jewish settlers and
live there so that settlers and
thirty-five thousand Jewish visitors
brought their and chartered buses could
have picnics and travel around the city
freely dancing in the streets with
public prayers to bring down the
government of the left laying the
cornerstone for a new residential
building and indulging and other
pleasures this is under the protective
gaze of extra military forces that were
brought in they used the opportunity on
continuing to quote use the opportunity
to insult the Palestinians imprisoned in
their houses and to throw stones at them
if they dared to peek out of the windows
at the Jews celebrating in their city
and then they brought the celebration to
the closed still quoting by settlers
rampaging through the old city
destroying property and smashing car
windows in a city magically cleansed of
Palestinians children parents and old
people are effectively jailed for days
in their homes which in most cases are
seriously overcrowded though they are
able to turn on a TV set to watch a
female settler saying happily there is a
curfew thank God and to hear the merry
dances of settlers and festive
processions some of them to the
patriarchs cave which is open only to
Jews meanwhile still quoting Commerce a
career studies the family love all are
immediately disrupted the medical system
was paralyzed
and many sick persons in Hebron were
unable to reach hospitals during the
curfew and women giving birth could not
arrive in time at the clinics
well that's description from the press
very bitterly critical incidentally but
not here here you just praised it as
great step and democracy and pay for it
and that the opportunities for that now
extend with the increase with the new
arrangements that are put in place under
the historic compromise well in East
Jerusalem Israel can now continue to
carry out the programs that the u.s.
pays for and approves of as well tell
you what those are the programs been
going on for some years these are
programs to reduce Arab citizens to
second-class status in formerly Arab
East Jerusalem the park conquered in 67
these were devised and implemented by a
holic former mayor who's very much
revered here is a great Democrat and you
know humanitarian and so on they're now
extended under a dome where the new
mayors from the right the purpose was
explained by colics advisor on Arab
Affairs
he said the purpose is to place
difficulties within the way of planning
in the Arab sector
Kollek himself put as he put it I don't
want to give the Arabs a feeling of
equality though he said it would be
worthwhile doing so here and there where
it doesn't cost us so much otherwise we
will suffer his Planning Commission in
fact advised development for Arabs under
certain conditions namely if it would
have a picture window effect which will
be seen by a large number of people
residents and tourists and so on
Kollek himself while he was being
praised here informed the Israeli media
that for the Arabs he said I have
nurtured nothing and built nothing apart
from a sewage system which he quickly
added was not intended for their good
for their welfare they being the Arabs
of East Jerusalem rather there were some
cases of cholera and Arab sectors and
the Jews were afraid that they would
catch it so we installed sewage and
system against cholera those are the
good old days under alert the numerix
apparently getting considerably harsher
according to reports from there
these colic programs were analyzed by an
Israeli city planner Sarah commentor she
was a city council member and a city
planner and collects administration this
is in a recent report that was submitted
to the High Court sir like the Supreme
Court on behalf of Arab plaintiffs by
the Catholic Legal Resource Center for
Human Rights in Jerusalem the reports
her report says in Jerusalem Jewish West
the West Jerusalem Jewish that's been
part of Israel and Jewish West Jerusalem
she said the report concluded there is a
detailed report there's large-scale
illegal construction which the
municipality does not prevent and retro
actively approve in Arab East Jerusalem
standards are different there 86% of the
land has been made unavailable for use
by Arabs the remaining 14% is not vacant
land but land that has already been
developed vacant lands are reserved for
development by Jews or kept as what are
called open landscape views which are
often for eventual development for Jews
so it regularly turns out the dearth of
land zoned for Arab housing is a result
of government planning and development
policy in East Jerusalem where the
Kollek Administration conducted a
consistent effort since 1974 to limit
the land area available to Arabs for
licensed construction the goal is what's
called demographic balance partially
achieved in 1993 when collects
municipality was able to announce that
the number of Jews residing in East
Jerusalem that's formerly Arab East
Jerusalem had surpassed the number of
Arabs well report goes on to say that
the government has provided housing in
formerly Arab East Jerusalem 60,000
units for Jews 555 for Arabs Arabs whose
homes have been demolished for Jewish
settlement often come from the lowest
economic strata of the community and now
live in makeshift Hubble's doubled and
tripled up with other
families are in tents and caves some are
willing to build their own homes and may
have resources but they are barred by
law and subject to demolition if they
proceed and that threat is executed
unlike Jewish West Jerusalem where
report goes on the problem of the
illegal construction is as serious if
not more so than in East Jerusalem but
the walls aren't a flood there are other
ways to bring about demographic balance
for example there are discriminatory
regulations on building Heights which
are very low for Arab settlements but
you can build high buildings for Jewish
settlement and all sorts of other zoning
provisions and other legal instruments
to intensify the discrimination between
Jews and Arabs incidentally that's true
in Israel too always using funds
provided by the US taxpayer and either
directly or sometimes through tax-free
donations the only country where you can
give tax-free charitable donations to
implement proposals of that kind and
it's always with the extensive approval
of admiring us commentators from across
the spectrum left to right well that's
now East Jerusalem that can be extended
there since the jihad is officially over
and gotten the official stamp of
legitimacy and now in the West Bank
- under Oslo - during the occupation of
the 67th before the peace process was
implemented and it was under military
occupation the military authorities had
issued a regulation which reads as
follows
no permits will be given for expanding
agriculture or industry which may
compete with the State of Israel that
was the fundamental rule for the
occupied territories they were allowed
what in u.s. traditional parlance is
called complementary development they're
treated the way the u.s. treated say
Latin America which was allowed to have
complementary development but not
development that might compete with US
interest so when the US took over Brazil
in 1945 Brazil was allowed to have say a
steel industry but only if they produce
low-grade steel which the US was
interested in producing not if they got
involved in the kind of steel production
that we wanted and that standard in fact
the British Empire ran that way in the
French Empire and indeed everyone
so again it's not surprising that Israel
would have imposed those regulations to
prevent any development in the India's
the same in the occupied territories for
example blocking a nail making factory
in Hebron because somebody thought it
might interfere with a competing Jewish
one
although the health system was in fact
extended the reason was explained by
Ernie shaked in a recent article in
being journal because they feared that
disease might endanger the residents of
Tel Aviv if they didn't have a health
system there but development note that
was not permitted on a kind of a classic
pattern of pretty-pretty
they be strong but normal perfectly
normal that's in fact a large part of
the reason why the third world in the
first world differ the way they do today
part of the reason a very substantial
court they didn't differ that way couple
hundred years ago well that left the
population in the territories a couple
of options
one was exile the preferred option and
the other was kind what the Israeli
press has regularly described as semi
slave labor in under miserable
conditions within Israel that was the
other option or starvation that second
option the semi slave labor that's
recently been reduced Israel's been
bringing in a real slave type flavor
from traditional beneficiaries of
Western civilization like Philippines
and pylons and so on and also from
Romania another u.s. favor it was the
favorite US state and Eastern Europe
under Nicolae Ceausescu who is
particularly beloved by the Reaganites
and Thatcher and admired button and now
they're coming in too so that's even
more easily exploitable labor because
their you know their families aren't
even close nothing's even close by and
their complete
isolated this is vividly described and
bitterly described in the Israeli press
but you don't to be known here because
we have to pray is the benefit
recipients of our massive donations of
course
