the war and peace report our guest is
noam chomsky he was supposed to be today
in the west bank instead he's in Amman
he and his daughter known Aviva Chomsky
were denied entry at the border coming
from Jordan into the West Bank he was
going to be delivering two lectures Noam
Chomsky professor at MIT author of over
a hundred bucks world renowned linguist
and political thinker and activists
gnome I wanted to ask you about the IAEA
the International Atomic Energy Agency
tentatively announcing plans to discuss
Israel's nuclear weapons program for the
first time ever Israel the only nation
the Middle East with nuclear weapons but
the country has never officially
acknowledged that it has them talk about
the significance of this yeah I'm
created oh that's very brief there's
another interview coming but it's quite
significant the year that must be
blessed timber October the IAEA a passed
a resolution calling on Israel to open
its to doing the non-proliferation
treaty and to open its facilities
nuclear facilities to international
inspection now the United States and
Europe tried to block that resolution
but it passed anyway and immediately
afterwards the Obama administration
informed Israel that it could deny it
this was not reported in the United
States as far as I know within the press
with one exception the Washington Times
and the second is paper in Washington
now that's quite significant these are
if anyone is interested in nuclear
proliferation it's very important to
force its compel countries to join the
non-proliferation treaty there are three
non signers at the moment India Israel
and Pakistan all developing nuclear
weapons with the assistance of the
United States and the US is protecting
them from
inspection those beyond this there are
at their there are a nuclear weapons for
this free zones in several parts of the
world already except that they're not
implemented for work because the US
model our most relevant than one here is
the African Union it called for it
finally agree on nuclear weapons free
zone but that includes an island the
island of david garcia which the US uses
for Crystal for bombing it's one of the
main bombing centers for the Middle East
and Central Asia but also for storing
nuclear weapons and Purdue clear
submarines and in fact it's used for
those purposes is being beefed up by the
Obama administration ascend support
systems for nuclear submarines the
United States is now sending additional
Anu what are called bunker busters huge
bombs in the deep penetration of course
their end that Iran that they've just
been sent to Diego Garcia this is these
are all threats against de Gran and
violation of Security Council
resolutions but I'm afraid I'll have to
staff of another interview coming two
minutes okay well thank you very much
for joining us Noam Chomsky MIT
professor again denied entry into the
West Bank to give his lectures of burrs
eight but the lectures will be given by
