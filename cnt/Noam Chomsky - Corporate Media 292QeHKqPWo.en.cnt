it's particularly harmful to democracy
when media systems are in the hands of
private tyrannies it's bad enough if the
guys who you know she's making shoes is
or cars that's bad enough but when it's
control over the doctrinal system and
information that's much worse that's why
I think the stuff that's going on in
telecommunications now is so should
really have a lot more attention than it
does I mean here's this huge system you
know built that public expense I mean
you guys paid for it you know
and as usual being handed over to
private power now that its profitable
and it's very likely I think most media
analysts with their head screwed on see
and indeed even report that it's going
to end up in the hands of a half a dozen
mega corporations internationally
well that's worse than the oligopolies
that run steel and computers because
here we're talking about a new mode of
information and communication and so on
as always built at public expense and
right now or in the middle of it being
handed over to private power and
certainly not being reported I mean like
it's not that there's no reporting now
like you've heard about the
Telecommunications Act but it wasn't
discussed as a public interest issue it
was discussed as a business issue and in
fact most of the reporting was in the
business pages this is the big
legislative achievement of last Congress
you know talk Communications Act of 1996
I reported in the business pages and not
as a public interest issue like it's not
supposed to be a question of public
interest whether major systems of
information and the interchange are
handed over as gifts to Rupert Murdoch
that's not supposed to be an issue of
Public Interest the only thing that was
discussed was like to give at the six
corporations or 12 you know or do you do
it this way or that way well you know
that's effective indoctrination when
these ideas when these things don't even
occur to people it takes real
indoctrination
but yeah I think you're right these are
this is worse than the handing over of
decision-making power to private
tyrannies because in this case it's also
handing over
you know access to the things that
they're gonna eat us for control of the
public mind these systems could also be
as deliberate people
