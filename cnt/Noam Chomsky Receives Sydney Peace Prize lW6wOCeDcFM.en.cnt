we have before us tonight a unique human
being absolutely unique and I'm totally
privileged as I said at the start to be
even honoured to be able to say a few
words in his presence I'm so totally
honored about that fact a person of
integrity of soundness of judgment who
has been able to put before his own
country and the world criticism about
they're deceitful ways of behaving and
dealing with other nation states or with
other peoples and what a marvelous thing
as human beings we have a fellow human
being amongst us capable of that courage
that integrity and that passion to
ensure that there is a voice for the
voiceless a voice for the downtrodden a
voice for those who are the subject of
the powerful and privileged because they
have power they can therefore rule upon
us and I am so privileged and so pleased
that the Sydney Committee for the Peace
Prize have selected one of the most
worthy recipients of this particular
award and can I just say I feel humbled
to have been considered in any way to be
the recipient in the previous years and
to be in the presence of Professor
Chomsky who has done far more for the
globe for the quality of humanity and
for human beings to find themselves in a
way that is far more based on truth and
on justice and on integrity and about
equality at its highest levels and not
to give credence to the hollowness
of those words when they are spelled by
powerful and particularly influential
nation-states in their relationships to
others so can I please express my thanks
to the City of Sydney Peace Prize
Committee to Professor Chomsky for
accepting this enhances us as
Australians and let's move forward from
this in a way that we can rectify our
own backyard thank you very much
thank you well it's unnecessary to say
how to save much about how grateful I am
for the honor and the wonderful
atmosphere and how gratifying it is to
join a group of people who I greatly
admire and respect some of whom former
recipients are close personal friends
for many years on an occasion like this
this is phrase that resonates and my
mind often does in fact that's a
declaration that was issued by the
Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein in
1955 there was a call to the people of
the world a plea actually to face a
question that's as they put it
stark and desperate and inescapable
either mankind will put an end to war or
we will put an end to the human race
and that's they were seeking of course
with nuclear war primarily and since
that time we have come very close to a
virtually terminal nuclear war a number
of times
the danger continues in fact right today
it's very much alive the area of primary
concern now is West and South Asia that
region and in fact if you've been happen
to have been reading the papers
carefully for the last few days you'll
notice that there have been exercises in
the eastern Mediterranean either
actually intended or psychological
warfare aimed at bombing of Iran Israeli
actions there's been a rash with
newspaper articles in newspaper reports
in the Israeli press about an apparent
decision of the government to proceed
with bombing Iran's nuclear energy
nuclear sites very strikingly there's
been a long series for some months now
of declaration statements by the former
high mister purity officials in Israel
heads of Mossad and so on people who
rarely say anything
speaking strongly at denouncing the plan
saying they'll be disastrous and
horrible effects they wouldn't be coming
out publicly unless they had some
information that these are plans are
actually in the works it's worth
remembering that Israel did strike a
nuclear reactor once before most rock
reactor in Iraq and though it's not too
well-known there was incredible
information right away and it has since
been confirmed even by US intelligence
that that bombing attack actually
initiated some Hussein's nuclear weapons
program the reactor it appears was only
capable of producing a low-grade uranium
for energy purposes but after the attack
a secret nuclear power and nuclear
weapons program was initiated and we
know where that led to and it's
conceivable that that could happen again
along with other very threatening and
dangerous consequences that could follow
from an attack of that sort we'll know
very soon whether it's whether it's
happened but it's too close for comfort
there are things that can be done about
these problems I shouldn't say that for
several years now us analyst
have been arguing that the most
dangerous problem in the world a
security problem is Iran's possible
development of nuclear weapons and it's
interesting to see why they think it's
such a danger the question is rarely
asked but there is an authoritative
answer to it the authoritative answer
comes from the highest sources namely
the the Pentagon and US intelligence
they give annual reports to Congress on
the global security situation and they
have of course discussed this repeatedly
and they do agree that the Iranian
potential for nuclear weapons whether
they're doing it or not they don't know
is extreme an extreme danger and the
reason they say is because it's it's
going to be part of Iran's deterrent
strategy they have a detailed analysis
of the Iranian military they argue that
it's very small it's even expenses are
very low even by the standards of the
region and it's aimed specifically for
defense that's its goal is to deter an
invasion long enough for diplomacy to
set in and they add that if Iran is
developing nuclear weapons that would be
part of their deterrent strategy so why
is a deterrence strategy such a threat
well very simple a deterrence strategy
can deter
it can prevent the United States and its
allies from free unconstrained military
action in the region because it will be
a deterrent and that's a threat if you
of course intend to carry out military
action military attacks it will and
that's the threat and we should
recognize that our own countries are
interpret that the possibility of a
deterrent as a very serious threat it
tells us a lot about ourselves and about
the potential for a very dangerous
consequence as many of which some of
which are in the process right now
others can come is there a way to deal
with these problems well there's this
kind of a narrow way which has enormous
international support and that is to
move towards developing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East now
there are several such initiatives
around the world Africa Pacific Islands
other places they have not really been
implemented and it's important to know
why so take the African nuclear
weapons-free zone there's one impediment
to its being implemented and that's
because Britain and the United States
insist that an African Island Diego
Garcia which was a former British
dependency be available for nuclear
weapon storage nuclear submarines and so
on they use it as one of the main bases
for the bombing in Central Asia
Obama has recently built it up to extend
that it's
it has facilities for nuclear submarines
that meant submarines with
nuclear-tipped missiles well as long as
that is going on the African
nuclear-free zone can't really be
implemented and the same is true in the
Pacific area the Pacific nuclear-free
zone was held up at first by France
which wanted to use its Pacific
dependencies for nuclear weapons testing
I think that was about 20 years
they finally finished their tests but
now it's being held up by the United
States and its British Ally and maybe
Australia is involved which want to use
in effect are using the Pacific
dependencies for a transit of
nuclear-armed naval vessels that in fact
sustaining a nuclear weapons basis there
well what about the Middle East the most
dangerous one there's an impediment
there to support for a Middle East a
nuclear-free zone is so broad that the
United States has been compelled to
formally agree to it at the visit every
five years there's a non-proliferation
treaty review meeting last month was New
York and the overwhelming support for
moving in this direction and the Obama
administration Hillary Clinton was the
spokesperson agreed that yes it's a very
good idea but with a qualification
several qualifications is good idea but
not now and furthermore there's a
condition any nuclear weapons free zone
will have to exclude Israel and in fact
exclude any requirement that other
states provide information
about anything they're doing to support
Israeli nuclear weapons well okay that
kills that idea so yes now we have this
tremendous danger danger of a deterrent
to our actions and it may move on to a
devastating war with all kind of
horrible consequences well there are
other ways more far-reaching ways to
deal with the problem generally a friend
of mine I've actually forgotten who went
astray and friend may be here a couple
of a while back sent me a book of a
collection of Australian writings
writers short essays on nuclear weapons
it was in 1986 the International Year of
peace and there was a comment but there
was an Aboriginal poet hadn't a comment
which is so eloquent that I don't want
to paraphrase it so if I can find it
I'll actually read it we won't be able
the comment was this there will come a
time when our mother whom the invader so
ruthlessly raped by cutting down her
trees by slaughtering her creatures and
mining her minerals will retaliate are
we so imputed as to expect that we can
survive her backlash I speak long before
the white man came to this land he the
dangers of which I speak long before the
white man came to this land in the
Northern Territory there's a green and
dreaming it is a legend about what will
happen if the yellow metal uranium is
taken from the ground a giant ant will
grow and will devour the living Earth
and that's what's happening that's the
point of the comment and that's in fact
what's happening and one way to stop the
proliferation of nuclear weapons is
simply to prevent the materials from
reaching the developers and the fact
that it'll develop the Devourer the
living Earth is all too dangerous all
too threatening that's what Russell and
Einstein were warning about well these
comments open up the contemplation of a
different threat which actually wasn't
evident at the time that Russell 1-9
Stein were issuing their warning which
is very evident today I learned about it
myself about 40 years ago when two
personal friends well-known earth
scientists actually the chairs of the
Harvard and MIT Earth Sciences
Department began to talk about the
recent discoveries that we're emerging
about we no no I was no I was global
warming those were the first indications
that there's a serious problem coming by
now it's a very serious problem that
recognized to be the International
Energy Association just last a couple of
months ago issued its latest report
annual report they conclude that
determined that the last year the
preceding year that greenhouse gas
emissions had reached a record high
which is pretty striking because it was
a year of recession and a manufacturing
decline and they furthermore warned that
the extent of the global warming was
coming very close to reaching what the
main scientific consensus that regards
as a kind of a tipping point a point
beyond which it's irreversible two
degrees and agreed warming they said
that's coming close and if we reach that
point they don't put it this way but
mother earth will be at mother our
mother will be devouring the liver
bleeding earth mother nature will be
devouring the living Earth we can kiss
each other goodbye there won't be a
possibility of the decent human
existence well there are things that can
be done about that now and there isn't a
lot of time the waste and things are
being done most countries are doing at
least something taking at least halting
steps towards addressing the problem
unfortunately that's not true of the
countries where it matters and most the
country where it matters most is of
course the United States richest most
powerful country in history and it not
only is not taking halting steps it's
taking steps backwards the Republican
Congress now is dismantling programs
instituted under Richard Nixon that's an
indication of what's happened in the
past roughly forty years there now
dismantling programs under Nixon who was
in fact the last liberal president if
you actually look at the programs and
that's drawing backwards the pulling
backwards the efforts to do something or
other about global warming there are
much more positive directions they are
in fact coming mostly from the
indigenous communities the in Ecuador
for example with a substantial
indigenous community there's there are
protests serious protest the
government's kind of torn by them at the
moment the indigenous population is
calling for an end to mining for oil
which is substantial there this huge oil
exploration with enormous environmental
disaster associated with apparently much
worse than the Gulf of Mexico disaster
recently actually in the Nigerian Delta
there's no doubt that the pollution and
destruction is far greater than the Gulf
of Mexico but these are poor people
people of color so doesn't matter what
happens to them nobody pays attention
like the Gulf of Mexico
however the Native communities have are
demanding that all of this stops they
don't see any justification for
destroying their lives their culture or
their societies so that people can sit
in traffic jams in New York and their
SUVs they argue that's not a fair
exchange in the most striking case is
actually Bolivia where the indigenous
population is a majority and have in the
past ten years entered the political
arena successfully elected someone from
the wrong ranks as poor peasant as
president and have been carrying that in
fact taking the international lead now
in taking steps towards doing something
about global warming
that's the poorest country in South
America and it's kind of its kind of
striking that the poorest country in
South America is taking the
international lead on this program and
the richest country not only in the
Western Hemisphere but anywhere in the
world and in fact in history is not only
not contributing but is drawing back
eliminating efforts to deal with it
recently one of the recent efforts in
Bolivia was legislation granting rights
to nature so in addition to human rights
there are now rights to nature nature
has rights we have to observe well you
know sophisticated Westerners can mock
this ridiculous idea but the fact of the
matter is that unless we are able to
gain some of the sensibility of the
indigenous populations this is worldwide
the last laugh is almost certainly going
to be on us
