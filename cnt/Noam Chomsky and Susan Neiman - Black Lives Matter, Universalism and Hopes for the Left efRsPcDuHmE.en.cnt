welcome to the Einstein forum my name is
Thomas mean iam a former fellow at the
forum
today our discussion will last about an
hour Noam Chomsky is a philosopher a
linguist and an activist since his early
youth for several decades he has been a
leading critic of American power and
capitalist exploitation
Susan diamond is a philosopher director
of the Einstein forum and author most
recently of learning from the Germans
race and the memory of evil and I can
only share terms welcome and also thanks
to both of our fellows Tom Meany and
Chum wobbler II who's organized this
conversation from his quarantine in
India so you're now connecting with at
least three continents I have a very
long list of questions that I would like
to ask you know I want to start by
noting that you have recently said we
are living at the most dangerous moment
in history and nevertheless I have
perceived and looking at some of the
things you've said in the last month or
so I perceived a strong note of hope I
know that I'm feeling it although one of
the things that I like very much is your
striking a Conte a note about hope hope
is not a feeling it's a moral obligation
if we stop hoping the world will fall
apart if we keep hoping we have a chance
that it won't and as you said this is
not a serious decision appreciate that
very much
I wonder what you think about this take
I am getting my hope right now from this
very extraordinary global anti racism
movement and it's the first time that I
can remember personal is larger than
anything I can remember from the 60s but
it's the first time that I can remember
a combination of genuine
universalism solidarity and cultural
diversity and it has seemed for quite
some time that the clash between
universalism which usually gets
described as fake universalism you know
Eurocentrism disguised as fake
universalism the clash between that and
tribal identities has threatened to
split the left and it seems to me that
that is changing right now I wonder if
you share that few or if you disagree I
think that's a very important point it's
quite remarkable and unprecedented to
see the outpouring of concern and
engagement that was ignited by the
George Floyd murder that was plainly
latent there have been all too many the
killings horrible beatings of blacks by
police case after case and there have
been reactions but nothing remotely like
this the one case that was more or less
like this was almost twenty years ago in
Los Angeles the Rodney King which did
lead to about a week of series
demonstrations about fifty or sixty
people were killed and George Bush the
first who was president called in
federal troops to quiet things down but
it was Los Angeles where it took place
little elsewhere some support
demonstrations but really nothing this
time ends almost instantly all over the
country and it wasn't just police
killing it was probing into the deeper
elements of
structural racism of discrimination of
the background for both police violence
in a very violent society and the
hideous legacy of 400 years of vicious
repression it's actually not the first
case interestingly about a year ago sure
you saw the New York Times ran a series
1619 they called it the year of the
first slaves brought to the United
States and it was a a pretty eloquent
series of exposures of much of what
happened during this 400 years and
nothing like that had ever happened
before that was also a sign of one of
many signs of a kind of a rising
consciousness of awareness
I would this event happened it's as if a
spark it's a Kindle II was all ready to
blow up than it did in remarkable ways
the level of one thing that striking is
not learning the scale but the
Solidarity there's a lot of white black
solidarity just coming straight from the
grassroots it's not from organized
activists of course there are people
organizing the demonstrations but people
are coming from everywhere and it has
remarkable public support the
demonstrations never get big public
support now this is like 2/3 of the
population way beyond what Martin Luther
King achieved at the peak of his
popularity 63 I have a dream speech was
not like this and as he said it so it
started all over the world and also
looking at not just racism in the United
States but the British Empire let's take
a look at that let's tear that apart
looking at their horrors that were
perpetrated French atrocities and
oh no no everywhere so it's somehow a
global reaction to maybe a counter
reaction to the move towards what I
called a liberal democracies is you know
phobia racism that's been happening now
there's a counter develop and it's even
has a chance of becoming
institutionalized hasn't been much
publicity but there's a interesting and
promising development taking place of
the what's called the progressive
International which at its first
announcement public announcement a
couple of weeks ago having its first
general meeting in September in Iceland
the prime minister of Iceland is one of
the members of the directing group
that's an effort was initiated by the
Bernie Sanders movement in the United
States by Yanis varoufakis and his
diem25 movement in Europe which has been
organizing transnationally in Europe
tried to salvage the parts of the
European Union that makes some sense and
to overcome the very serious flaws that
are threatening to tear it apart so it's
been working in Europe Sanders in the
United States know trying to expand
globally bringing in voices from the
global South from India from Africa and
elsewhere to see if a major
international organization can be
created to bring together the kind of
struggles that are clearly international
at this moment of extreme crisis and you
started by mentioning that and it is an
extreme crisis and we're facing a
confluence of crises coming together at
a remarkable moment that one of them is
the racism
as the pandemic that other is the
extraordinary threat of global warming
all of these international another one
is the increasing sharply increasing
threat of nuclear war as the United
States is tearing to shreds the last
remnants of the arms control regime and
another is simply the deterioration of
democracy and it's worth looking back to
January as you all know every January
the bulletin of Atomic Scientists it
brings together group of distinguished
scientists political analysts try to
give an assessment of the world security
situation they encapsulate this you know
in the Doomsday Clock setting the minute
hand a certain number of minutes away
from midnight midnight means termination
of termination finished first set in
1947 right after the atom bombings been
seven minutes to midnight at that time
it's been oscillating since the soonest
Trump was nominated it was moved towards
midnight every year he's been in office
it's moved closer to midnight two years
ago it reached the closest it had ever
been two minutes to midnight this
January the analysts gave up minutes
they moved a second it's a hundred
seconds to midnight they had raised
three issues this before the pandemic
was known the three were the ones
they've brought up before that one was
the dire and growing threat of nuclear
war second is the increasing and equally
dire threat of environmental catastrophe
and the third was deterioration of
democracy sounds a little out of place
and still you start to think about it
it's only true
a vibrant democracy of engaged informed
citizens participating in determining
the fate of the world it's only that way
that the two existential crises can be
dealt with by no means want to ignore
the warnings but what I'd like to focus
on just for a moment longer is the fact
that we seem to be living in a very
vibrant lis democratic moment at which
there is a bigger chance to turn things
around
then you know I had feared for quite a
while I wonder just one point of
information I was reading about the
Progressive International just very
recently can you say a word to those of
us who might be interested in supporting
or joining that movement should we go to
a website what can we do there is a
website which is a method for joining
individuals can join organizations can
join and if it reaches a significant
scale especially by September when the
first meeting will take place put the
powder to the reactionary International
which is being forged quietly before our
eyes and you're right that this is a
moment of hope but we should remember
that there's a major struggle taking
place all over the world as to what will
the outcome be of the pandemic it's
pretty awful it's having a terrible toll
but it will be overcome the terrible
cost and the question is what world will
emerge from it well there's one
organized dedicated force that is
working very hard relentlessly every
moment to ensure that what emerges will
be
essentially what created the crisis but
a harsher and more authoritarian version
of greater surveillance made of control
greater domination by the forces that
have brought this neoliberal catastrophe
that is at the basis of a lot of the
crises that we're seeing they're working
hard
question is will there be a counter
force well the moment of hope that you
describe is one hope for the emergence
of the counter force Progressive
International is another and this is
this is a major conflict kind of
international class war and his nips
which will determine the fate of the
world so here's a question about
neoliberalism one of the things I think
we've learned from since the 60s is the
incredible power of capitalism and its
ability to commodify everything and of
course one of the things that's
happening in these anti-racist movements
is that various companies of course are
coming out with slogans and in some
cases even money and things that are a
little more than symbols although it's
easier to retire Aunt Jemima than it is
to change the police structures what
what are ways in which we can use the
force of this system that we're still
embedded in to make sure to hold their
feet to the fire so this doesn't just
become another excuse for rebranding
I'll give you an example I spent half a
year in Mississippi when I was
researching my book you know what Bob
Moses the great community organizer
called the heart of the iceberg and I
was just a couple of years ago there was
no end of debates about the flag
I knew students had been beaten up by
Klan members when they tried to take the
fly
out of the University of Mississippi it
just seemed it was gonna be the last
state to go last Saturday whenever that
was three days ago
the legislature voted to take down the
flag and it wasn't even a close vote
but what clearly played a role is
Mississippi's second religion after
Christianity is football and when the
sports the college sports industry said
we could take away your hosting
privileges you know suddenly the
legislature felt it was bad for business
you know and my own view and in when I
talked about the Germans as as an
example that other nations have to learn
from it's not that I think the Germans
did everything right on the contrary nor
do I think because I know too much about
the history that they you know fell down
on their knees asking for atonement they
made steps in the right direction for a
mixture of motives may which weren't
particularly good but they got to a
better place and my question that I keep
having is we can't dismantle
neoliberalism all at once
can we use it in ways that it doesn't
use us sure first of all we have to
understand what's happening and not be
tempted to join into the co-optation and
then use whatever measures we have if
they're offered by corporations were
trying to rebrand use it if you can but
understanding exactly what they're up to
in fact if you want to see a very clear
example of this prior to the races any
races and demonstrations was back last
January a very striking example of
what's going on
every January with the people who refer
to themselves as the Masters in the
universe gathered in Davos January
Switzerland
that a fancy Swiss reason that a ski
resort so they can go skiing talk to
each other about a wonderful layer and
so on CEOs of major corporations top
media executives and famous
personalities and so on that's the kind
of dazzling Davis show this last January
was different
strikingly different there was a new
theme the theme was look the peasants
are coming with their pitchforks we've
got to do something we have to recognize
that we've been done things that are
wrong in the past we're gonna we
recognize that we're gonna change
direction we're not gonna just work on
the basis of greed and profit for the
rich and the corporate sector we're
gonna be concerned with the stakeholders
of working people communities all you
people out there so you can put down
your pitchforks we're we've become
humanistic we have a pleasant pretty
face you can trust us to take care of
the world we'll make sure that
everything's fine no they were concerned
with what they called reputational risks
so they're they're causing trouble for
us
they're making banks look bad because
they fuel they fund fossil fuel
industries so we'll give some money to
the Sierra Club and we'll show you how
wonderful we are of course nothing
changes this is an old story those of us
who have some are old enough before the
sixties can remember in the 1950s there
was a campaign to advertise what was
called then the soulful corporation if
the corporations are no longer merely
the aiming at profit and greed they're
gonna be soulful and humane you can
trust us that was the 1950
we say it constantly that's the
rebranding you're talking about there
was a group of about 150 top executives
in the United States who issued a
manifesto about that time it was
essentially the same message we realized
we've done the wrong things we no
understand put your faith in us a very
dramatic moment at the Davos meeting was
the keynote address of course Donald
Trump they had to invite Trump to be of
the keynote address they don't like him
his vulgarity his obscenity as addicts
they conflict with the image they're
trying to project of humanistic concern
so they don't like him at all they gave
him a rousing applause why because he
understands something they understand
which pockets to fill with dollars and
as long as he understands that they'll
tolerate the vulgarity and the addicts
and so on that's the bottom line for the
soulful Corporation for the new
humanistic corporation for the branding
if we understand it then we're not
mislead by it we'd recognize its roots
we see the nature of the system however
it tries to disguise itself we use what
tools it provides to undermine it but
mainly our own which is coming with the
pitchforks that changes things that's
brought about the changes it's bringing
about changes right now I sort of take
say well glad sorry well I just wonder
if you can answer a question that I have
been wondering about for a while I've
never been to Davos but I know some
people
strangely enough who organized you know
involved in the organization and I have
asked them and I know they're worried
about speech books they talk about it
well I've asked them you know there are
not enough mountains in the world for
rich people to build compounds
for their grandchildren on why in the
world are they not taking the climate
crisis seriously sure self-interested
forget about or you know let the rest of
the world die there's not enough room to
save the people that they would like to
save do you understand me it's an
interesting psychological phenomena so
take somebody like Jamie Dimon the CEO
of JPMorgan Chase biggest US bank I've
never met him but I'm sure he knows as
much about global warming as you and I
do
he knows it's a disaster and another
couple of generations human life will
organize human life will be impossible
nobody's gonna live in any compound if
the tens of millions of people are
fleeing from places sea levels rising
tolled going he knows that he's pouring
money into fossil fuel industries no how
do you account for the psychological
phenomena you can sort of see the
reasoning and there is some reasoning
behind it I've never asked him but sure
this is it he has two choices he could
go along with trying to maximize profit
for JPMorgan Chase pouring money into
destroying the world for his
grandchildren that's one choice the
other choice is to refuse to do it to be
thrown out somebody else comes in who
will do the same thing
these are institutional structures the
system is based on maximization of
profit for short-term gain I mean take
the pandemic in we're now facing right
now a situation very much like 2003 2003
there was a SARS epidemic it was
contained it was a corona virus epidemic
scientists told loud clear you got to
prepare for another pandemic a real
pandemic more serious than this one
another coronavirus we know what to do
yes prepare study the the viruses
investigate the range study their genome
be prepared to recreate vaccines set up
a pandemic that's a preparation system
from when it comes do all these things
we'll be able to condemn and do it
nothing happened the main reason is just
capitalist logic the drug companies have
the resources have huge laboratories but
you don't make profit by preparing for a
catastrophe five or six years from now
you make profit by something you can
sell tomorrow pills from depression body
creams and cancer heart remedies and so
on that's what you make money so they're
out what about government I'm in
government actually that has huge
wonderful laboratories endless resources
that government actually does most of
the risky creative work for vaccines and
drugs anyway then they hand it over to
private corporations for adaptation to
the morning profits so what is in
government step in here we have the
neoliberal enamor government is the
problem not the solution Reagan's famous
state meaning we have to turn we have to
get reduce the role of government which
has a very severe flaw it's partially
influenced by the population so we have
to get rid of that transfer decisions
over to completely unaccountable private
tyrannies which are dedicated solely to
greed then everything will be fine so
government is hell
it's just asking for a catastrophe we're
facing the same thing right now
scientists are saying the same thing
sooner or later will emerge some hell
from the pandemic others are coming
they'll be worse so far we've been lucky
the coronaviruses have been some of them
like this one Kovac 19 have been highly
contagious but not terribly lethal
others like Ebola were terribly lethal
but not highly contagious what if one
comes along which is both well there are
ways to prepare for that we have to add
to the logic of capitalism which is
lethal the neoliberal plague which
intensifies it by removing the role of
government we have to add to that the
malevolence of particular groups and
individuals like take just take the
United States most important country
right now it's the epicenter of the
pandemic worst of anywhere and you take
a look at the statistics in late March
Europe and the United States were
virtually identical in the number of
cases and deaths since then if you look
at the graphs europe has sharply
declined United States has stayed stable
it's now about five times the level of
your four percent of the world's
population twenty five percent of the
cases probably undercounted that's
malevolence it's not the logic of
capitalism and that helped bring us to
the situation
although government was pretty much
excluded by the neoliberal plague
nevertheless there were some things that
could be done and in fact in East Asia
they were done they were pretty much
ready for it of the situation
we'll in control he station oceana even
in the United States there was a
presidential scientific advisory board
set up by first George Bush Obama called
it into session first couple of days he
was in office he asked them to prepare a
pandemic preparation program about a
month later they came back with it was
implemented something was in place
quesa benda came four years later
Donald Trump was late first day in first
couple days in office dismantled the
whole thing science doesn't exist his
guru rush limbaugh says science is one
of the four corners is deceit based
totally on deceit let's get rid of it
that was dismantled there were programs
with US scientists working in China with
Chinese scientists on the very dangerous
work of trying to identify to run a
virus observe mostly deep in caves with
bats and so on what they're working on
to try to there's a major Institute of
biology human Institute in China the
main study so they're all working
together trying to prepare for it Trump
canceled them all although in fact
during the pandemic he cancelled an
ongoing program of scientists working
with Chinese scientists because they
were daring to work with the Wuhan
Institute and part of I mean since he is
clearly responsible for the deaths of
tens of thousands of Americans you can't
let that be public so he's flailing
around desperately to find somebody to
blame the World Health Organization
China big yellow peril of campaign and
just the fact that they were working
with the main Institute of biology to
try to understand what's going on
was enough to cancel the program this is
a unique form of malevolence that the
world has not seen in the past really I
have a question I want to ask you about
Trump but before we get to that you've
had a lot to say about the logic of
capitalism I'm wondering if we could
talk for a little bit about socialism
which Bernie Sanders has succeeded and I
agree with you that his movement has not
been a failure he's succeeded in
removing the stigma from the world word
socialism at least for that proportion
of the American population that's under
about 40 but you've also said that you
don't consider him a socialist and I
find myself in many situations trying to
explain buzz to Americans and to Germans
actually Bernie Sanders programs to the
right among other mammals if you look at
actually what he's calling for no
Christian Democrat in this country would
accept the bare minimum of social rights
that you know he's demanding that we
have in the world's fourth largest
economy this is not little Denmark or
Finland it's a serious capitalist
country with income inequality and all
those good things but we basically have
a social democratic conception of Rights
which is very different from benefits
nevertheless what I find so interesting
is that Sanders who I've never met I
don't know what his you know what this
is it it strikes me as a kind of
touching loyalty that he continues to
talk as if he were a socialist and I
would even bet that one of the mistakes
that he made in the campaign when he was
running ahead of Biden was to defend
Cuba which I thought he did beautifully
somebody dug up an old quote he had on
Cuba and he said well I don't support
any authoritarian countries neither
Cuban or Saudi Arabia nor
China but they have a great health care
system and a great literacy system as
well and he dug down on it and that was
too much for an American public that's
my take right now but I wonder what
yours is I wonder if you have an idea of
socialism that you think if not
immediately maybe in neither of our
lifetimes might be a goal that would
take us out of neoliberalism let's take
a look at the United States they're very
curious country it's the only country in
the world outside of ultra-right
dictatorships where the word socialism
is an anthem in every other country in
the world it's like I'm a Democrat the
United States is totally different it's
a curse way let's take Cuba there's a
vote every year in the UN General
Assembly on the u.s. economic
strangulation of Cuba
it's unanimously opposed the only
country that goes along with the United
States is Israel because they have to go
along with the United States if they
don't they're finished they decided
years ago - long story what they decided
to put all their marbles in the same
that will support the United States so
they're stuck but aside from Israel
unanimous vote against Cuba is the
National hideous story they take what's
happening right now
has to do with Germany as well Germany
delayed in dealing with pandemic wasn't
as fast as the East Asian countries or
Oceania but it did finally sort of get
its act together unlike the United
States Germany had not run the health
system totally out of business model
United States
liberal the hospitals are run like a
assembly plant for a normal view you
can't have any spare capacity that we
waste money so no extra beds and no
diagnostic capacity anything goes wrong
total catastrophe the Germany had extra
beds diagnostic capacity he was able to
deal with the matter a miracle took a
pretty reasonable position the Germany
managed to cut the deaths very low
there's a country not far to the south
of Germany and Austria called Italy
which had a terrible pandemic in the
north there's something called the
European Union Union did northern Italy
get any help from Germany in Austria
virtually nothing but they did get help
from Cuba the one genuine
internationalist country in the world
which sent thousands of doctors they've
done it many times before this
occasionally gets reported in the United
States as a denunciation of Cuba because
Cuba uses slave labor to force them to
go to places like Italy and then steals
their wages meaning a portion of the
wages go back into the Cuban health
system so therefore we have to demonize
Cuba as a hideous totalitarian state
what's going on with Cuba the United
States a very free country phrased in
the world many ways we have internal
documents to an extent that no other
country does we know what the planning
was what the reasoning was for 60 years
almost instantly after Cuba gained its
independence the United States has been
attacking Cuba a major terrorist war
under Kennedy economic strangulation
to destroy it and the reasons are very
explicit early sixties read the internal
documents cubed B cannot tolerate Cuba's
successful defiance of US policies going
back to the Monroe Doctrine in the 1820s
which determined that the u.s. is going
to dominate the hemisphere couldn't do
it at that time
Britain was too strong but over time
gradually happened we cannot tolerate
successful defiance of this it may
stimulate others to pursue the same
course so we have to as Henry Kissinger
put it we have to destroy the virus
before it spreads contagion
he was happened to be talking about a
yen DS Chile but the same thing here so
that's the reason for the and very
interestingly this is done even in
opposition to major centers of American
capital which is unusual
they usually determine policy but this
is one of the case cases where state
interest overwhelms even centers of
private power the biotechnology industry
and the medical industry would very much
like to have better relations with Cuba
which has a flourishing biotechnology
industries they would like to be
involved in it no you can't we have to
destroy Cuba agribusiness would like to
get in sorry
great market for them sorry you can't we
have to destroy this virus it's a very
striking example of how foreign policy
actually works a lot of it works that
way but we have to demonize Cuba when it
is the one genuine internationalist
country in the world doing in Italy what
the European Union didn't do has done
many other places I am going to
interrupt you because I'm seeing people
raising hands and I have
couple of quick questions I want to get
in before I turn but Sanders is
socialism yeah you wanted to say
something about that or because I have
another one minute take a look at his
major programs there are two major
programs one is universal health care
can you think of another country that
has okay the other is free higher
education can you think of a country
that has free higher education okay
those are the main programs in the
United States that's called radical too
radical for the American people we can't
show that for well that tells you
something you look at the OECD measures
of social justice the u.s. is down at
the bottom with the turkey in Greece
super liberal business run society very
free a lot of virtues but as far as the
socio-economic order is concerned
overwhelmingly business run what Sanders
is doing is saying let's become a normal
mildly associate social democratic
society that's called radical it has
nothing to do with socialism in any of
its early interpretations like worker
controls production zone I certainly
agree and I agree with you about cube I
had the good fortune to go to Cuba and
it was enlightening I want to ask you
briefly about another socialist lead
place that you've spoken about recently
Kerala and I found it extremely
interesting that first the first report
I read about the fact that Kerala has
done so much better dealing with the
pandemic was of course in New York Times
style it was all about the Minister of
Health has been nicknamed the Corolla
Slayer
I'm sure she's an impressive woman but
it was all about her personally
they looked at The Guardian The Guardian
actually did note that Kerala has for
years been run by a coalition of
left-wing parties led by the Communists
and that their health care and literacy
is higher than anywhere else in India
and that the minister in question was
happy to be interviewed but she wanted
to talk about policy and not not about
her personality can you just say a
little bit about what you know about
that situation because I'm further away
from it probably than you were it's a
very interesting case actually spent
some time there about must have been 15
years ago when you I spent a fair amount
of time in India the poverty is hideous
I mean the combination of extreme
affluence and miserable poverty is just
shattering not in Kerala you drive in
Kerala it's not a rich country it's a
relatively poor state of India but you
see people sitting in front of coffee
houses reading newspapers something
there's a cooperative mutual support
system which is beyond anything India
you go to Tamil Nadu to the next state
right above a radically different this
has been going on for a long time and as
the Guardian reported it's it's been led
for decades by either the Communist
Party or other left oriented parties and
it's created a situation in which when
the pandemic strike strike struck was
possible to deal with it the support
systems were in place and the minister
who is indeed a very impressive person
was able to take command but also with
support it's not enough to pass rules
people have to be ready to accept them
to act with them
have trust to support each other and so
on
takes a Britain 350 years it's democracy
you take a look at the Constitution and
it gets about a dozen workers it's based
on trust and good faith and take that
away the whole system collapses as I
began to happen in England under Boris
Johnson 24 Road the Parliament to ram
through his version of brexit but in and
it's happening in the United States
dramatically but in Kerala it was
sitting there that's it's kind of like
other things that have taken place like
take the the anarchist revolution in
Spain in 1936 it's very impressive it
was crushed by the Communists and the
fascists by force but it was very
successful was going on it didn't spring
up out of nowhere sprung up out of 50
years of Education activism effort
trials successes failures it was in
people's heads when the opportunity came
put it into operation that and I think
coming back to the black lives matter
demonstrations I think this is beginning
to put things into people's heads about
how we can create a different world you
look at the explicit demands they're
mostly about changing the police which
is important but they go much deeper
than that so why is it that say when
Trump recently eliminated regulations on
air pollution so let's have more air
pollution this is in the midst of a
respiratory lung disease which is
amplified by air pollution who suffers
from the people who are so poor that
they have to live near the polluting
plants who are they blacks and Puerto
Ricans every aspect so they'll be the
one so
died from the increased pollution which
as I say exacerbates the effect of
finding every area of the society you
look at diseases and this is coming to
be recognized it's not just race its
class it's structural violence lots of
issues that have to be dealt know maybe
cut consciousness willings freaking
indeed become able and willing to press
on all fronts
so the Davis guys will have to be a
little more frightened about the
reputational risks and maybe they'll be
forced to do things and can take
advantage of that dismantle a
pathological system before I relinquish
the microphone which Tom I promise I'm
about to do I have two brief questions
that will be of interest both to German
and American listeners but presumably
also to everyone else who's on this
conversation you have said that you
think Trump is worse than Hitler this
breaks a major German taboo I wonder if
you could just elaborate briefly let's
take the worst declaration that ever
came out of Germany the Von's a
declaration let's kill all the Jews
which killed three million Slavs
intervention and so on
did it say let's destroy organized human
life on earth well there's a trump
administration document that does say
that to get more publicity one of the
Trump bureaucracy is the National
Transportation administration did an
extensive environmental study a couple
hundred pages of a detailed and
competent they conclude that on the
course that we're advocating by the end
of the century
none of this century temperatures will
have risen four degrees ethically that's
Columbus and then they make a
recommendation let's eliminate the
regulations that restrict emissions from
cars and trucks why
well we're destroying everything in any
way so let's enjoy ourselves I compare
that with Avon's a declaration
furthermore this is not just a
declaration this is policy so let's take
February of this year pandemic is raged
Trump comes out with his budget proposal
February for the next year defund the
Center for Disease Control and every
health related aspect of government as
he's been doing every year so let's do
it more increase funding for fossil fuel
industries and for the military so in
other words let's race the disaster even
faster and furthermore this is happening
encouraging an opening of more fossil
fuel production eliminate regulations
which somewhat mitigate the catastrophe
and offer some time to deal with it
compare this with Hitler maybe the worst
monster in history but did he was he
dedicated to destroying the organized
human life on Earth with his party be my
name incidentally it may sound like
whenever I say this I say this is gonna
sound like an outrageous comment and
then I make the comment and then look
into the evidence I don't find it
outrageous at all I've said similar
things very very last question for those
American voters who like me voted for
Sanders in the primary but unlike me are
considering not voting
in November I know you have some words
for them would you well there is no
choice of not participating on the
election if you decide not to vote for
the Democrats you're giving an extra
vote to Trump that's just arithmetic you
can argue about a lot of things but not
arithmetic if Biden has one less word
that's the same as from having one more
vote so you have a choice you have 15
minutes if you're serious about politics
politics is what's happening on the
streets in the United States
politics is activism it's what's making
the men in Davos cringe
it's the reputational risk or fortune
it's what's forcing the Democratic Party
program farther to the left and it's
been a living memory because of the
young kids who were banging away at the
doors but on the Sanders movement and so
on that's politics
so take 15 minutes away decide if
there's significant difference between
the candidates this time there's a chasm
and then take a few minutes to push a
lever and then go back to politics the
less rarely vote for anyone they vote
against some this time the person to
vote against the obvious it's a real
threat to the survival of organized
human life on earth plus what he's doing
to American democracy but just take a
look at what recently happened the most
reason to act was to fire the attorney
of the Southern District of New York why
because he was investigating the swamp
the Trump created in Washington a couple
of weeks earlier Trump fired all of the
inspectors general the
officials designated by Congress to look
over the department's of the executive
for corruption and malfeasance all fire
because they were looking into Trump's
swamp this is these are the actions of a
tin-pot dictator of a small neo-colonial
country somewhere which has a coup every
three years that's very serious
meanwhile the mcconnell mitch mcconnell
who runs the senate with an iron hand is
has turned the senate used to be a
legislative in the liberty of body
that's gone does not make two things for
the let recent years passes laws to
enrich the very rich in the corporate
sector and staffs the judiciary top to
bottom with ultra-right mostly
incompetent young judges who will be
able to block any progressive
legislation for a generation no matter
what the population wants this is part
of the campaign one part to create a
world post pandemic world which will be
much like the one that creating the
crises but harsher more brutal and more
authoritarian and unless that's
countered by popular activism it's going
to be a very ugly world and one that
won't last long thank you very much I'm
gonna turn this over to Tom and say we
have a rapt audience so as long as you
have energy numb
we could go slightly over our original
plan it's your show you get to say I
know had some very interesting questions
that he wanted to ask as well maybe
Tommy want to begin with one or I can
just have to say I have plenty of energy
but I have another interview coming up
so I can go a little over but not
much okay Tom you wanna well the first
question is is an amalgam from an
anonymous attendee and and and trunk
coaster and the question is how do you
think about the ideology of growth what
is the best stream of counter thought
steady-state economics of Herman Daly
the participatory economics of your
friend Michael Albert does the pandemic
make for new opportunities what do you
think it's the most promising counter
thought to the ideology of economic
growth well with regard to growth we
have to be cautious you can't continue
with the kind of growth that we have
that's suicidal but does that mean you
have to end growth
I suppose we want to move to a renewable
energy which we must and we have to get
rid of co2 emissions within a couple of
decades but that means solar panels that
wind turbines weatherization rebuilding
homes reflecting service surfaces all
sorts of things
masteren efficient mass transportation
all of that is growth it's the right
kind of growth it's the kind of growth
that offers a more livable and
sustainable society so I think the issue
is not growth or D growth the issue is
what kind of development takes place now
actually this kind of growth does lead
the D growth once you have large-scale
vulnerable panels and wind turbines
installed they don't take much servicing
to keep them up so you begin to have
declining growth decline in destruction
of the mineral resources and the hideous
conditions under which students
extracted and so on what kind of society
are we aiming for well I have my own
view I think there's a much the value in
the ideas of participatory economics but
my own view is we're not smart enough at
least I'm not to sketch out the details
of an ideal society I think we can give
general guidelines they should be based
on eliminating illegitimate structures
of authority and domination that one of
the core illegitimate structures is wage
labor the idea that a person in order to
survive has to people have to rent
themselves to a tyranny from so that
most of their waking lives there under
totalitarian control of a kind that
Stalin couldn't dream of like Stalin's
couldn't say here's when you can go to
the bathroom or here's when you can talk
to a friend or here's the path that you
have to take between picking something
up and going back to your desk that's
life for most people for most of their
waking hours in the early Industrial
Revolution workers fought bitterly to
block and prevent that regarded as a
fundamental attack on their dignity and
rights that should be recovered it's
recovered to a limited extent when you
have co-determination
they're working people on management
boards but that's a very limited extent
to go well beyond that there should be
worker control of production community
control of all community institutions
interaction between them you can think
of many free association of voluntary
Association of self governed self-rule
groups of both production consumption
survival of policing everything you can
sketch out that kind of structure how
exactly you could reach it and be
implemented my feeling is a lot of
experimentation since
I don't think anyone is smart enough to
design it in detail I think Karl Marx
went too far and refusing to say
anything about future society they just
said you take a look at all of his works
there's a couple of sentences scattered
around about a post-capitalist society
says we'll leave it to the liberated
working class that goes too far I think
but at the other extreme like my own
feeling is it also goes too far to try
to spell it out and too much detail I
just think there's too much we don't
understand about human beings in society
so let's try try many ways to approach
these goals it's being done and in many
ways even in the midst of the pandemic
so one of the striking things about the
pandemic has been the way in which
mutual support and self-help groups
spontaneously developed all over the
world often in the poorest communities
where the governments are doing nothing
I think one of the most spectacular
examples is in Brazil puts in the hands
of a trump clone maniac is destroying
the society doing nothing in Rio the
favelas the slums are hideous places
I've been there people crammed together
and open the water or no jobs terrorized
by crime gangs the government refuses to
do anything about the pandemic but a
group took over the crime gangs that had
been terrorizing the favelas moved into
organized to try to distribute food and
water to impose some kind of social
distancing in other areas groups of
people in the community just started to
do it there's some elderly guy stuck in
his apartment with no food let's help it
know it's things like this are
developing the
massive demonstrations in the United
States in the world that we started with
or another example of it I think how do
this can come the kinds of institutions
in which people will learn how to live
together in a mutually supportive
fashion where your society is organized
to deal with people's rights and needs
and not with the obscene profit of the
tiny group you can move towards that and
we'll learn how to proceed on the way
our second question is from US firms do
successful protests in America have to
take a specifically identitarian shape
it seems to the Occupy Wall Street
movement which specifically targeted
neoliberalism has not achieved the same
scale as the black lives matters protest
which at least nominally at this early
stage are about black lives and please
well occupy remember was tactic not a
movement you can't carry out a tactic
indefinitely so the tactic of occupying
which has a terminal point was very
successful in its own terms it's kind of
like the standards movement Susan said
before it changed the structure the area
of discourse what's sometimes called the
Overton Window the red V ranked the
arena of discourse and thinking and
consciousness and policy formation
shifted occupy did the same for the
first time put the issue of radical
inequality right at the center of
thought and action which had many
consequences so it was a substantial
success in its own terms
though the occupy activists tried to go
forth to move into community organizing
to some extent that succeeded but it
kind of dissolved the movement it wasn't
quite ready for it then maybe it's ready
for it now
you make progress okay
both occupy made progress the the
Sanders movement did progressive
international money we're not gonna
achieve utopia by snapping our fingers
we can make moves towards a better world
our next question is from Nita Kumar
you were once relatively favored by
America's left liberal intelligentsia
you were a leading writer for the New
York Review of Books and other mainstays
of the less liberal establishment how do
you account for your relative fall from
domestic favor while finding more
favorite Broadway Terr for the New York
Review of Books from 1967 until the
early 1970s that was a few years there
with the New York Review following the
popular feeling of its basic audience
young intellectuals moves to the left
that was an opening for lots of people
not just me lots of writers then their
community shifted back toward the center
all of this ended no more less writers
the New York Review is very important
Journal and read of all the time its
policy is to be a little to the more
dissonant side of the center of
mainstream intellectual life you said
you read that the first thing every day
which sort of comforted me I saw an
interview with you and you said that's
the first thing you read it's best
newspaper in the world you got to read
it with care you have to understand what
they're doing how far they can go
I mean let's take just one example
because it happens to be the headlines
right now
huge Fuhrer now about reports
unconfirmed reports that the Russians
paid Taliban to target American soldiers
what a crime there's no evidence for it
but is it it's a hideous crime let's
nuke them in the 1980's the u.s.
publicly openly right that its support
for radical Islamist Mujahideen was for
the purpose of killing Russians that was
the announcement of the CIA station
chief in Islamabad who was running it
Brzezinski and others were saying we're
giving them their Vietnam a lot of
killing of Russians did anybody complain
about suppose these charges are true
there's no evidence for them but some
maybe they're true
it's that by our standards totally
outrageous I interrupted you were in the
middle of answering another question
when I get excited I said please forgive
me you were you an evolution from you
know a good liberal leftist to something
like a pariah in a lot of circles good
liberal leftist during the brief period
when liberalism was tolerated by the
early seventies a major reaction city
very strikingly you can see it in two
major documents that appears both quite
influential in the early seventies one
is the Powell memorandum
how old was a corporate lawyer later
became just as the Supreme Court issued
a memorandum to the Chamber of Commerce
to the business community it was private
but it surfaced
I was exposed it was a call to the
business community to take up arms to
stop this heresy that was taking over
the world destroying the business world
taking over the media and the
universities we have the resources of
namely the mild reformism of the 60s we
gotta stop that we have the resources we
have the power let's beat it back that
helped created the large part of the
background for the neoliberal assault
there was another one that was more
interesting on what's called the left
the first publication of the trilateral
commission that liberal
internationalists from Europe the United
States and Japan the Carter
Administration was drawn almost
completely from their ranks now that
gives you indication of their politics
liberal internationalists pretty much
the same as a pal memorandum different
rhetoric you know more polite but the
same message it's called the crisis of
democracy there's too much democracy all
kind of people are demanding democratic
rights women blacks young people old
people of working people farmers just
too much pressure on the state I can't
meet all of that we have to have more
moderation and democracy they have to go
back to passivity and moderation so that
democracy can function we know who it's
run but that's the Liberals they were
particularly concerned about the
universities what they called I'm
quoting the institutions responsible for
the indoctrination of the young they're
not doing their job that's why you have
these kids running around on the streets
we have to have better indoctrination of
the young okay
that's the liberal side of the spectrum
that it's that leads to the
shift towards the neoliberal takeover
both in policy and in the intellectual
climate now the left didn't die it just
went off in other directions so for
example during the 80s this doesn't get
reported it's too dangerous but the most
powerful anti-imperialist movement in
history developed in the United States
in the 1980s there were a lot of it in
rural America evangelical churches small
towns the first time in history that a
major popular movement developed which
not only opposed Imperial atrocities but
went to live with the victims to live
with them to help them to try to protect
them from the atrocities their own
government was carried out that's what
happened in Central America tens of
thousands of people right from
mainstream America I would be talking
rural churches in Kansas where people
knew more about Central America than
academic experts because they'd lived
there and work with the people to try to
protect them against the terrorists wars
that the United States was carrying out
well this doesn't get reported for
obvious reasons you don't want people to
understand things like that but it
happened and it's it does it's part of
the general change of consciousness
which we now see erupting on the streets
these things happen stage by stage a
little bit here a little bit there
occupy Central American activism anti
racism lots of things that's the way we
can hope for a better world
unfortunately it's a beautiful ending to
the conversation thank you so much for
joining us okay
can I save one's a small thing before
you leave for us to Chomsky yeah it's
been a wonderful pleasure to have you
and thank you everything for thank you
for everything that you have done for
this world on a lighter remark I know
that apart
your dear wife Valeria you also own a
parrot would you like to say something
about if you have a parrot as a pet yes
right out there
he's a bilingual parrot my wife
hilarious Brazilian so she's teaching
him Portuguese and if we could get him
to perform he could say in Portuguese I
won't try to repeat it sovereignty to
all the people of the world it's perfect
Portuguese you can say down just telling
my dog to get down and stop
beautiful ending thank you for joining
us
okay
