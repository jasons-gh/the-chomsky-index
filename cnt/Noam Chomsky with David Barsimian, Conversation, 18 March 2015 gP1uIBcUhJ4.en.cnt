ligon these lights are super bright well
what's it like being a Sufi sage born
what's it life like being a Sufi sage
and Sufi say just stupid I promised that
I would do something different in
introducing him but you ended that very
cheerful talk did I miss something all
are trapped by an institutional logic
that is deeply pathological and that
must be cured and quickly if we are not
to put an end to the human race how do
we go about doing that it's easy it's
all in our hands in the case of nuclear
weapons actually the answer is known
there are ways to end the threat of
nuclear weapons furthermore as many of
you know it's a an obligation of the
nuclear weapon states to carry out good
faith measure efforts to eliminate
nuclear weapons totally that's article 6
of the non-proliferation treaty of 1970
that's furthermore a legal obligation as
the International Court of Justice ruled
some years later in 1996 and those
efforts could be carried out in
unfortunately we're going in the
opposite direction so President Obama
has recently announced trillion-dollar
program to modernize and upgrade our
nuclear weapons a capacity or attack
capacity other other powers are acting
more or less similarly the there are
policies being conducted right now I
mentioned Ukraine but it's not the only
one
that are bringing the global situation
to the point where it might lead to a
perhaps accidental grax perhaps intended
nuclear strike incidentally it's been
known for many years decades that if a
power launches a nuclear strike first
strike it will be destroyed by the
effects of the nuclear explosions so
there's no escape it's any nuclear war
that between any powers with any
capacity will lead to virtual
extermination we know how to end it but
the steps that are being conducted are
in the opposite direction and there have
been some potential unfortunately
aborted efforts to implement steps that
would reduce the danger so one major
threat right now has to do with Iran in
the United States it's commonly claimed
by high officials commentators and
others that Iran is the greatest threat
to world peace it's kind of interesting
to compare this with global opinion
there are holes of global opinion taken
by US polling agencies galit whole major
one the most recent about a year ago did
ask people around the world which
country is the greatest threat to world
peace the United States won by a huge
margin nobody else was even close a
second was Pakistan which was probably
inflated by the Indian vote but that's
but
fortunately Americans are spared
knowledge of these facts the press
refused to report them but their facts
nevertheless anyway here it's Iran it's
the greatest threat the world peace
there's interesting questions the one
can ask about just what the threat is
but let's say there's a threat whatever
it may be is there a way to end it yeah
there are ways to end it I know if you
want me to go into it but there were
kind of stick to the 55 minute lecture
what I want to tell them tell them what
that with that I dictator over years as
I shouldn't but but there have been
potential steps which have been blocked
by the United States that's unfortunate
anyway in the case of nuclear weapons we
know how to end the problem it's
feasible it's a matter of implementing
policies that are understood and they
could be carried out if there were
sufficient popular pressure to compel
them to be carried out the populations
of the world care about survival their
leaders typically don't they care about
power and we can influence those
decisions particularly in countries like
this more free and open societies with
regard though an environmental
catastrophe it's not so obvious that
there's a solution there are measures
that can be undertaken to mitigate the
threats and maybe to overcome them
that's an open question but again policy
is going in the opposite direction what
I quoted from the wall street journal is
unfortunately pretty typical you read it
in the business presses the business
pages of the press across the spectrum
York Times Financial Times others plenty
of euphoria about how the United States
can become the Saudi Arabia of the 21st
century it can achieve energy
independence we can flood the world with
oil all great and one
full the price of oil is going down
which is great means good for American
consumers who can drive more and all of
these marvelous things are simply very
straightforwardly driving us towards a
precipice which will fall over which
will be extremely harmful may be
devastating for generations not very far
away a generation of our grandchildren
much worse of course for the poorer
countries but also here well senator
cotton of Arkansas is one of the many
intellectual Giants and that esteemed
legislature legislative body recently
announced that we do have a great deal
to fear from Iran because they control
Tehran I know that's pretty soon but you
should add that if you read The
Washington Post this morning you'll
discover that Senator cotton who's got a
real pedigree even graduated from
Harvard is positioning himself to be the
future foreign policy specialist of the
Republican Party taking the mantle of
McCain and Graham he has other
interesting warnings I don't know how
much he followed his career but when he
was running for Senate in Arkansas he
warned the citizens of Arkansas that the
Mexican drug cartels are linked to Isis
and joint together they are working to
send terrorists across the border into
the United States where they can kill
citizens of Arkansas and of course all
of this is the for full of fault of
President Obama with leaving a porous
border and so on if that's true we
should move that clock to two minutes to
midnight via election in Israel
Netanyahu won a third consecutive term
his fourth overall haymarket author and
electronic intifada co-founder Ali
Abunimah says Netanyahu's good for the
Palestinians why because he's very clear
no Palestinian state no compromise
Haaretz correspond amira hass sees only
cosmetic differences between the two
major Israeli parties and she says that
the now moribund two-state solution is
actually a tense state solution a bunch
of Bantu Stan she says inside the West
Bank what's your view on what happened
in Israel well what happened is that one
question is how much difference there is
between the camp between the parties and
they're all pretty much on the right
others the there was a very minor sort
of peace party merits got four seats
barely made past the admissions point
the there is the Arab party which is the
third-largest but that's pretty much
excluded from any coalition just on
racist grounds no coalition will accept
the IRA party as an important
constituent but there are some
differences one differences if you read
Netanyahu's appeal to the electorate
which carried him to victory after
rather tepid polling results it was a
combination of outright racism and
extreme fear mongering so you've
probably read in the papers he warned
the electorate that Arabs Arab citizens
of Israel are being driven to the polls
by leftists with support from foreign
governments all in an effort to
undermine his policy of defending israel
from you know terrorists so on and so
forth and that combination of
fear-mongering and racism does work it
worked in Israel we're
not unfamiliar with it here and it's a
very it's a very dangerous sign about
the nature of Israeli society which has
been drifting very far to the right and
it's a this is a this is a major nuclear
weapons state it's a violent state
that's carried out lots of aggression
it's a direct violation of international
law and the occupied territories that's
accepted essentially by the entire world
with the exception of Israel in the
United States and it can be an extremely
danger it is already a very dangerous
state can be much more so as to the
urban i'm on a mere haath conclusions
but i think they're slightly i don't
think they're analyzing the situation
quite accurately the there's it's widely
argued not just by then across the board
by you know Israeli analysts
Palestinians others that there are two
options either a two-state settlement in
accord with the overwhelming
international consensus which includes
essentially everyone outside the United
States and Israel that's one possibility
and the other possibility is supposed to
be what's called a one-state solution
Israel takes over the whole of former
Palestine Jordan to the sea and then
there will be what in Israel is called a
demographic problem too many Arabs in a
Jewish state that pretty soon in fact
maybe majority from the Palestinian
Palestinians who and Palestinian
supporters like the one used you
mentioned who regard this positively say
well then it will be possible to carry
out an anti-apartheid struggle a civil
rights struggle to call for the rights
of Palestinians within this one state
the problem with that analysis is that
these are not the two options the two
options are quite different one up the
second option one state is not an
there is no possibility reasonable
possibility that Israel will take over
the whole territory and face this
demographic problem they don't want the
second option alternative to two states
is something quite different it is what
is exactly happening before our eyes
there are policies being implemented
daily right before our eyes we can see
them we can see where they're directed
they've been in motion for almost half a
century and their purpose is clear what
they're doing the policies tako first of
all they Israel is taking over as taken
over what it calls Jerusalem that's an
area about five times the size of
historic Jerusalem that includes
substantial areas of the West Bank many
former our villages were supposed to be
an internationalized territory Israel's
taken it over in all the parties except
for the very far out ones are saying yes
this is an indivisible permanent capital
of Israel that's one thing then if you
look at the development programs which
are pretty systematic very obvious a one
of them developed is developing a
corridor extending east of Jerusalem to
include a large town my alumium was
built mostly during the Clinton years
its purpose is to subdivide the West
Bank to part virtually partition it the
borders of mala de meme reach virtually
to Jericho which will be left in
Palestinian hands that's right at the
border so as a corridor extending to the
east pretty much bisecting the West Bank
if you look at the map there are other
corridors to the north including other
new Israeli towns REO whom they break up
the region further in addition Israel is
taking over its committed to taking over
everything that's within the so-called
separation wall it's an annexation wall
declared illegal by the World Court by
international opinion but the US
continues to support the policies so
doesn't matter that's a large part of
the arable land that excludes the
Palestinians from their farms orchards
and so on furthermore Israel is
systematically taking over the Jordan
Valley that's roughly a third of the
West Bank much of its arable land
Palestinians are being steadily expelled
by one or another pretext sometimes
simply thrown out the Jewish settlements
are being established that wells are
sunk and so on the traditional method
for a hundred years now of ultimately
incorporating some region inside Israel
well you look at that pattern and you
can see what's happening the the Israel
is carrying out a perfectly reason and
telogen program intended to integrate
into Israel everything that might be of
any value in the West Bank but to
exclude the Palestinian population the
areas that Israel's taking over don't
have many Palestinians and those were
there being largely expelled that will
leave the Palestinian population in some
kind of limbo not not within Israel no
no demographic problem no one state
Palestinians lose everything that's the
live alternative there is no serious
alternative that anyone has made any
meaningful case for to think that there
could be one state unfortunately this is
the assumption that's made across the
board but if you think it through you
can see that it's extremely unlikely of
the likely alternative to astute state
settlement is why I just described the
policies that are now being implemented
what could stop them actually one thing
it's in the hands of the United States
as long as the you know the United
States officially objects to these
policies so the official US policy says
it's unhelpful to peace but the US
continues to support them it's providing
the military economic diplomatic support
for them even the ideological support
for them by the way the issues are
framed in the United States which is
quite different from the rest of the
world as long as the United States
continues to support the policies there
is no reason to expect Israel to
withdraw from them at whether it's
Netanyahu or Isaac Herzog or anyone else
there are some differences in the
policies the racist and extremely
alarmist rhetoric of Netanyahu's not
shared by others so there's some
differences but amira hass is correct
and saying that they're not fundamental
differences in New Mexico under US law
native american and spanish land grant
heirs have lost common lands and a SE
kiya water rights have been separated
from the land for commercial use what
hope for the future do you see from
traditional peoples continuing to defend
the rights of the commons and the shared
use of natural resources rather than
exploitation for profit well again same
story it's up to you these are decisions
that the American population can make in
the case of the United States and of
course as we all know this has been
going on for five hundred years four
hundred years ever since the first
English settlers came there's been a
steady attack on the indian nations
driving them out of their lands
exterminating them expelling them
sending in the reservations that's been
that's American history there are two
fundamental profound crimes
American history the one is expulsion or
extermination of the indigenous
population the others of course slavery
with its impact still remaining the
United States is as is what's called a
separate alone 'i'll society that's an
unusual form of imperialism it's a form
of imperialism in which the imperial
power originally england settles the
country that is being taken over drives
out or exterminates the population
that's a extreme form of imperialism
it's true of the what's called the
anglosphere the countries that sort of
extend it out of England through the
United States Canada Australia New
Zealand almost they didn't quite
exterminate the indigenous population
that's an unusual form of imperialism
very for the indigenous people a very
dangerous one and yes they're fighting
back and they need support however
there's another point that ought to be
made about preservation of the Commons
that's back to climate change the
Commons are the environment in which we
live if the Commons are privatized if
they're handed over to exxon mobil and
chevron and so on and we're dead for the
reasons that I've just mentioned we were
pretty obvious if the Commons are
preserved for the common good we have a
possibility of surviving if you look
around the world almost everywhere it's
the indigenous populations which are in
the lead in trying to protect the
commons from destruction by the
industrial capitalist powers primarily
China others so in candidates the First
Nations in Australia's the Aboriginal
people in India its tribal people
all around the world the countries that
have substantial indigenous majorities
and populations have actually taken
steps towards trying to preserve the
commons Bolivia for example which
actually has rights of nature written
into its constitution Ecuador made an
interesting effort to keep some of its
oil in the ground where it ought to be
if the rich countries the European
countries would pay Ecuador a fraction
of the profit that it would have
received from us marketing the fossil
fuels the rich countries refused so now
they're doing also destroying valuable
forest it's a pretty striking fact which
ought to really shame us that it's the
indigenous peoples who have been driven
to the margins of survival who are in
the lead in trying to protect us from
the folly that we are now carrying out
which is very likely to destroy the
possibilities of decent survival that's
the most crucial aspect of protecting
the commons the day after the big
climate march in New York and September
the very next day the Rockefeller
Brothers fund the Rockefeller Brothers
fund disinvested from fossil fuels you
can't miss the significance of that
given john d rockefeller background is
is this the start of a major movement in
terms of divestment from fossil fuel
corporations I was in Portland Oregon
recently and an activist told me this is
one of the hottest issues on campuses
have Stanford to Harvard MIT my on
campus it's a hot issue on campuses and
yes it's important it's in a way
symbolic but significant these are some
of the steps that can be made
to impede the race to the precipice how
important it is will like everything
else depends on people like you would
you do something about it I want to talk
to you about two ships one fictional and
one real the Pequod and Moby Dick and
the Titanic I think it was Edward Syed
right on this stage who years ago talked
about the monomaniacal urge of Ahab to
destroy Moby Dick no matter what and to
take the crew down with him it was of no
concern to him and what do you think
about that metaphor that Moby Dick is
nature and that Ahab is out there's an
out-of-control kind of capitalism and
that when it comes to the Titanic the
reforms that are offered up by the
centers of power or merely cosmetic
they're moving deck chairs on the
Titanic recycle your cardboard drive a
Prius and things like that sorry two
previous drivers
well like any kind of models and
metaphors there's some point but some
differences the crucial we are not being
I mean you might say that Hitler was an
Ahab let's say he was especially toward
the end of the war he was dedicated to
continuing the war even if Germany was
totally destroyed and it was the fault
of the Germans if they didn't succeed in
winning the war okay that's Ahab like in
a way but the in our case it's somewhat
different it really is institutional
logic it's not a matter of individuals
those CEOs who voted in the Davos poll
if you ask them personally maybe they
contribute the Sierra Club and maybe
they're in favor of the vestment could
be but in their institutional role as
managers of major corporations they have
a duty in fact a requirement even a
legal requirement to maximize profit and
market share and to ignore what
economists call externalities the impact
of a transaction on others that doesn't
enter into market calculations well in
this case the externality happens to be
the survival of the grandchildren but
they cannot in their institutional role
attend to that problem because their
task is to maximize profit and market
share there's some range of choices of
course and there's some variation among
corporations as to how they operate but
this overwhelming institutional property
happens to be lethal in its nature it
cannot continue if we're going to sort
survive in the case of state power it's
not dissimilar quite typically States
government
regard their own populations as a major
enemy the Snowden revelations for
example reveal the extent to which the
US government regards the US population
as an enemy which has to be monitored
and controlled the pretext of defending
terrorism is very weak as you may recall
when the Snowden revelations came out at
first it was claimed by the government
that 50 / 50 terrorist acts had been
prevented by the NSA surveillance under
inquiry they reduced it to maybe a dozen
or so under further inquiry it was
finally reduced to one one case someone
had sent 8500 dollars to Somalia that
was the net yield of this massive
program which is a program aimed at the
population to ensure their control and
obedience and that's very typical of
governments and understandable the
leadership is committed to power to
state power if you think through the
record of nuclear policy I sampled it if
you look in detail it's much worse but
the record is one of an astonishing
record of disregard for the safety
welfare of the population and steps in
order to enhance state power that's the
way powerful institutions function and
these things have to be to overcome
institutional pathologies is a lot
harder than overcoming an individual
pathology in the case of Ahab you know
you can throw them into the ocean or you
submit them to psychoanalysis or
institutionalize them there are remedies
but in the case of institutional
pathology it's far more serious as for
rearranging the
chairs on the Titanic it's it's not a
bad image but but there are some steps
being taken that are not insignificant
the development of the solar energy for
example is proceeding there are major
efforts to try to block it but it's
proceeding unfortunately this is not the
center of where its preceding the major
production of solar panels is in China
and this means sophisticated ones
they're at the cutting edge of advanced
technology and solar panel production
should be here but some steps are being
taken there are some environmental rules
but by and large the primary thrust of
policy is in the wrong direction years
ago the philosopher John Dewey said
politics is the shadow cast on society
by big business how would you would
evaluate that shadow today in light of
citizens united and McCutchen versus FEC
and other Supreme Court rulings well do
his comment was accurate it extends way
back back in the 1950s and we will
remember there was a equip I think maybe
it came from see right Mills I don't
remember which said that the United
States is a one-party state of the
business party which has two factions
Democrats and Republicans and that was I
was pretty accurate at the time but it's
less accurate today the United States is
still a one-party state the business
party but there's really only one
faction the Republican Party has pretty
much departed from being a functioning
parliamentary organization that's not
just my judgment
the very highly respected conservative
political analyst at Norman Ornstein the
American Enterprise Institute right-wing
think-tank pointed out recently I think
accurately that the Republican Party has
been woody has become what he called a
radical insurgency no longer committed
to parliamentary participation there's a
lot of truth to that we've seen it
pretty dramatically in the last couple
of years we're seeing it right now just
take a look at the today's newspaper the
description of the House Budget
basically the Ryan budget what is the
Ryan budget through an all kind of
sleight of hand which economists just
mocking about balancing the budget but
what it actually does is undermine
Medicare by moving to privatize it which
means to it's the one part of the health
care system that more or less works
because it's not privatized it's
inefficiencies and costs are due to the
fact that it has to work through the in
highly inefficient bureaucratized
privatized system in the United States
so privatizing moving to privatize
Medicare saying let's undermine the one
system the more or less works cutting
back Medicaid under the guise of
federalism repealing the Affordable Care
Act which sends not a wonderful
legislation but nevertheless an
improvement which will send tens of
millions of people into the uninsured
lists cutting back food stamps and so on
in other end enriching the wealthy
that's the one policy of the Republican
radical insurgency do anything you can
to enrich the wealthy and powerful and
attack the general population well you
can't win votes that way so what's
happened
over the last year's the Republican
Party managers have mobilized sectors of
the population which have always been
around but have never been mobilized
into a significant political force one
part is Christian evangelicals major
component of part of the base of the
Republican Party today you see it in the
Iowa primaries coming up but quite
generally another is nativists people
who are afraid that they are taking our
country away from us which has a basis
in fact the white population is people
become a minority pretty soon and for
extreme ultra-nationalists nativists
this is a crime that can't be tolerated
people who are sectors of the population
who are so frightened that they have to
carry guns into Starbucks because who
knows he'll come after them in fact
there's legislation in Nevada right now
being debated to allow guns to be
brought into daycare centers and maybe
some of these three year olds were
trained by is't sonos but these are you
know these are not small parts of the
population it's a very strange country
in many ways that's a large part of the
population people can be mobilized on
those issues and not notice that the
policies that their leaders are pursuing
are attacking them and supporting the
super rich and the corporation's well
that's one
that's one of the former two factions
what's the other faction it's not
Democrats it's what used to be called
moderate Republicans if you take a look
at the Democratic Party programs there
are few exceptions like Bernie Sanders
and others but if you take the the core
of the Democratic Party Democratic
Leadership Council and so on these are
the policies that used to be called
moderate Republicans in fact somebody
like Richard Nixon would be kind of at
the left of American politics today
eisenhower be off the spectrum
eisenhower went so far as to say that
nobody insane could think of dismantling
New Deal programs namely the ones that
are being dismantled right now the
current Republican programs our efforts
to dismantle programs that were
initiated under Nixon the drift to the
right during this whole neoliberal
period roughly since Reagan is pretty
extreme actually see it pretty
strikingly in the public attitudes
towards health towards of the health
programs the United the US health system
is an international scandal it has about
twice the per capita costs of comparable
countries and relatively poor outcomes
furthermore the US government spends
about as much per capita as comparable
countries but that's a small part of the
health costs because it all has to work
through the privatized health system
which is inefficient bureaucratized and
in the hands of tons of bookkeeping
administration and so on and so forth
and in the hands of institutions we have
no interest in health an insurance
company is not dedicated to health it's
dedicated to making money so not
surprisingly they do things try to make
money well this if you look back at the
there's an extensive polling record of
public attitudes on health care and for
a long period since the SEC
World War there have been substantive
sometimes considerable majorities a lot
of the polls depend on exactly how the
question is asked but a large part of
the population off on a majority has
been in favor of national health care
they go back to the late 1980s a
majority of the population thought that
there ought to be a constitutional
guarantee for health care national
health care and in fact i think it was
forty percent of the population thought
it already was in the constitution
that's the late 80s and take a look
today when Obama presented his
affordable health care program you'll
recall that at the very beginning one of
the part of the program was a public
option allowing people to make the
choice of something like Medicare
national health care at the time almost
two-thirds of the population was in
favor of that but it was dropped without
discussion it never entered the
discussion the United States has a very
unusual maybe unique law which bars the
government from negotiating drug prices
you can negotiate other things but not
drug prices so of course drug prices are
way out of sight much higher than in
comparable countries the population is
overwhelmingly opposed to this there
haven't been many polls but the only
ones I've seen show over 80% opposition
there was never even a attempt to deal
with this the power of the
pharmaceutical corporations is so
enormous that there wasn't even an
effort to try to introduce it into the
so-called Obamacare if you look at the
attitudes towards the so-called
Obamacare they've been pretty negative
most of the population has been opposed
even though for years the population has
been strongly in favor of national
health care and this of course isn't
national health care now some of that
opposition
is because it didn't go far enough we
don't know how much because the
questions aren't asking poles but a lot
of it is the kind of thing you see
reflected in this famous Town Hall
comment where somebody got up and said
I'm keep your keep your hands off my
Medicare you know that kind of thing
people don't understand what the
government is doing and what the private
corporations are doing and the effect is
a significant change in expressed
attitudes towards the policies that's a
remarkable triumph of propaganda if you
think about it especially considering
how vital health care is to everyone's
life well those numbers have been at
zero or for quite some time and there's
a light up there that says exit but I'm
going to take a moderators privilege and
just go on for a minute or two more if I
may on this that's okay with me well on
this long journey you've been on did you
ever imagine the kind of crowd you
routinely draw or having your books on
display at airports
well actually started giving public
talks on these issues much too late in
the early 1960s early days of the
Vietnam War I started giving talks about
the Vietnam War and as you know it was
talks to three people as somebody's
living room or a church with three or
four people or something like that and
there was never a none of us who were
involved ever had it could have guessed
at the time that a couple years later
there would be a major anti-war movement
but there was and the same has happened
on other issues with all of the negative
things that have happened over the past
years this neoliberal reaction since the
way Carter primarily the Reagan years
there's also been plenty of progress
audiences are very different than they
were in the past concerns are different
lots of issues that were fighting issues
back in the 60s you could barely discuss
them are now accepted and taken for
granted women's rights gay rights there
was no concern for environmental issues
in the 60s now there's substantial
concern of the years there have been
mown periods of extensive popular
activism to try to terminate the nuclear
weapons lunacy the the general
atmosphere of the public has changed a
lot and you know audiences kind of
reflect that well all of this is
positive there's basically two
trajectories there's one trajectory
which one just been describing which is
a constructive positive offers hope
there's another trajectory which I
talked about which is going in the
opposite direction and the question is
which one will prevail but again as I've
said several times and as you all know
without my saying
that's in your hands you were just in
Argentina and met with some you were
just in Argentina and you met with some
activists from the podemos movement in
Spain what were your impressions well
this was an international conference of
activists from around the world mostly
South America but some from Spain some
from Greece risen others and it reflects
some of the positive developments in the
world one of the major positive
developments internationally in the past
for a long time long what's he like has
been what has taken place in South
America over the past roughly 15 years
South America for 500 years since the
early conquests had been dominated by
foreign powers the South American
countries themselves were the typical
structure was a small Europeanized
mostly white elite extremely wealthy in
the sea of misery and poverty the elites
were oriented towards the outside they
had their second homes in the Riviera
they sent their money to Zurich you know
and so on there was very little
interaction among the South American
countries of the South American
countries were the most religious
students of the neoliberal policy
structural adjustment policies of the
World Bank in the IMF in the Treasury
Department and they were the ones who
suffered most naturally but in the last
10 or 15 years they pulled out of this
for the first time it's a major change
in world affairs South America used to
be regarded here as what was called our
backyard they did whatever we told them
we don't fan
attention to them now South America is
out of control you take a look at the
hemispheric conferences the United
States is isolated in fact the primary
reason why Obama made some steps towards
normalizing relations with Cuba is that
the u.s. was utterly isolated on that
issue in the whole hemisphere they were
trying to get some kind of arrangements
before the summit of America's which is
coming up soon they didn't quite make it
but that's the goal this is a huge
change and that's why the conference was
in South America but there were
participants from particularly podemos
and syriza these are in Greece Europe
has been subjected to a program of the
kind of a savage economic program which
is seriously undermine European
democracy it's been devastating for the
weaker the peripheral countries it's
beginning to dismantle Europe's major
who Second World War achievement the
Social Democratic welfare state programs
and I think that's the purpose of the
policies it's economically destructive
this is these are the policies of
austerity under accession even the
International Monetary Fund's is it
crazy from an economic point of view but
they are they make some sense from the
point of view of class war they are
enriching the big banks they're
dismantling social programs and so on
well there's a reaction the reaction was
first in Greece which has suffered most
and the German banks which are basically
responsible for these crises are
reacting in an absolutely savage way to
try to prevent Greece from taking steps
that might extricate itself from the
disaster that's been imposed Greece's
calling for restructuring of its debt
delaying debt payments
this is particularly ironic because
Germany in 1953 was permitted by the
European countries to about to cancel
its major debts that's the basis for
German recovery that's why it's the
dynamic centre of Europe secondly
Germany practically destroyed Greece
during the Second World War well put all
this together the grease is now asking
for a limited element of what Germany
was granted in 1953 and the German the
powers in Germany the bank the
Bundesbank are just flatly refusing in a
very savage way now they may get away
with it in Greece because Greece is
pretty weak country spain is going to be
harder nut to crack that's a bigger
country a more powerful economy and in
Spain in the last couple of years two or
three years a new political party
developed for them us which by now is
running first in the polls and it is
also a policy prep a party has dedicated
a pretty pragmatic sensible way to
reversing the austerity programs
sustaining rebuilding the the the social
economy the welfare state programs and
moving the country towards in
constructive development in Spain as
well the criminals the ones who caused
the crisis were the banks the Spanish
banks and the German banks but they want
the population to pay notice that none
of them believe in capitalism in a
capitalist society say if I lend money
to you and since I know you I know it's
a risky look and I therefore
and I therefore get a lot of interest
make a lot of money out of it if at a
certain point you can't pay it's my
problem in a capitalist society but not
in the societies in which we live the
problem is your problem and your
neighbors problem your neighbors didn't
take the deck the debt but they got to
pay for it that's the way our system
works radically anti-capitalist makes
sense on class warfare grounds but no
resemblance to markets or capitalism and
that's what's been going on but there is
a struggle against it and podemos I
worth keeping an eye on they have
sensible programs might win the next
election which is coming up soon and
it's not a it's not going to be easy for
the Brussels bureaucrats and the German
banks northern banks to crush Spanish
initiatives one last question you grew
up in the 30s at a time when solidarity
meant something there was mutual support
there was an active labor movement what
is it going to take in 2015 to rekindle
that spirit of solidarity well remember
what happened in the 30s the labor
movement was in fact in the forefront
there was CIO organizing sit-down
strikes so on they had a sympathetic
administration so the Roosevelt
administration was willing to
accommodate to the some extent to the
pressures developing among the public
labor movement spearheading it which did
lead to the New Deal legislations which
were very beneficial to the population
into the economy but go back to the
1920s the labor movement had been
destroyed there was nothing left
practically nothing left of it one of
the leading labor historians David
Montgomery died recently has a book full
of the housing the fall of the house of
labor and it's about the 1920s there had
been a lively vibrant active pretty
radical American labor movement
but it had been crushed by a brutal
attack this is very much a business run
society and the business classes are
highly class conscious constantly
fighting a class war have state power
supporting them and they were able to
crush and destroy the labor movement but
it revived and it can revive again and
other popular movements can as well too
and there's a basis for the basis for it
is the quite positive changes that have
taken place since the 1960s in many ways
it's a much more civilized society than
it was at that time than many issues and
I think that is a basis for recreating
the kind of solidarity mutual aid
working together dedication commitment
that is very necessary today we can't
overlook the fact that we're at a moment
of human history which is entirely
unique for the first time in human
history we are at a position where the
decisions that we will make will
determine whether the species survives
I've been true in the past so we're
definitely true now these are not small
questions it's quite a sobering note and
as we bring this evening to a close in
hindi there's a word called Savea it
means service and I can think of no one
who has performed more save on more
service for humankind than you thank you
very much
you
you
