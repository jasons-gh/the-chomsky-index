the war and peace report
I'm Amy Goodman with democracy now Zarin
mate' as we continue with Noam Chomsky
his latest book 9/11 was there an
alternative has been republished well
with a new essay about the assassination
of Osama bin Laden his original book
9/11 just months published after the
9/11 attacks was the seminal counter
narrative to what was being said after
the attacks of September 11th 2001 as he
spoke out against the attacks on
Afghanistan and Iraq Noam we've talked
about what's going on domestically now
we have talked about what is happening
in Israel and Gaza and the West Bank
what about Libya well the there are
actually two major issues with regard to
Libya the first one was was it
appropriate to initiate and then
implement the UN resolution the UN 1973
which called for a no-fly zone and
protection of civilians
that's first question second question
was it appropriate for the basically the
imperial triumvirate the traditional
Imperial States US Britain and France
was it appropriate for them instantly to
reject the resolution that they had
gotten through the Security Council and
to simply become pretty much the air
force for one of the sides in the Civil
War the rebel side though they're two
quite separate issues and my own feeling
was that you could have made a case for
a no-fly zone and protection of
civilians but I think it's much harder
to make a case for direct participation
in a civil war and undercutting of
possible options
that were supported by almost the entire
world the African country the African
Union the so-called BRICS countries
Brazil Russia India China and South
Africa in the major developing countries
not wine countries almost entirely were
pressing for some kind of negotiated
settlement not just taking part but
participating in a on the rebel side in
the war well was that the right thing to
do or not can a lot of questions to ask
if according to the transitional
National Council the rebel quasi
government about 30,000 people have been
killed and it's not slight right now
there's a major attack going on on
against the the basis of the largest
tribe in it in Libya NATO respond to you
with you know the triumvirate bombing
the rebels are attacking who knows
what's going to happen they're there
already there's a it's a very complex
situation very few people understand it
it's a tribal society the Western tribes
the ones that pretty much conquered
Tripoli although the people in Tripoli
say they did it themselves those tribes
are one group the saranac the eastern
coastal regions have been that's where
the transitional National Council was
centered have been pretty different from
tribal Libya for a long time way back to
the colonial period they were very
Qaddafi there other tribes the loyalty
and commitments and the other tribal
groups is pretty much unknown it could
turn into a I'm in one's hopes are the
best but seeds are therefore pretty ugly
the conflicts and the confrontations I
should say I was kind of struck by the
fact that the energy corporations didn't
skip a beat I mean the day that troops
were the rebel forces were Western
tribes were beginning to approaching
Tripoli that day
the New York Times business section the
lead article had a headline like you
know oil companies scramble for
contracts or something like that and it
just hasn't been hidden that they're
very eager to ensure that they get their
hands on the loop what's important and
if in Libya is if there's a good deal of
oil a lot of the country's unexplored
there may be a lot more and it's very
high quality oil so very valuable there
are some reasons to anticipate that it
might turn out not to badly but it's I
think it would be a very rash person who
would try to make a prediction no no I
wanted to ask you about this the crisis
unfolding with Turkey in Israel
earlier this month turkey expelled
Israel's ambassador and other senior
diplomats after the release of you and
report on Israel's attack on the Gaza
bound aid flotilla in 2010 the report
accused Israel of quote excessive and
unreasonable force in its attacks on the
Mavi Marmara which killed nine people
but also called on Israel to issue a
statement of regret and compensate the
families of the dead as well as the
women passengers the Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to
apologise he wants approval ations with
turkey and this is what he said in the
past few days we have witnessed deepen
intentions with turkey there's a light
up collection it was not a choice and it
is not our choice today I know we
respect the Turkish people and its
heritage and we certainly want to
improve ties and I'm sorry what does
this the spat over the flotilla mean for
Israel and Turkey and for the region
I should say I decide that I didn't
think much of that UN report for all
kind of reasons but skip that turkey is
the has been the closest and in fact
oldest regional ally of Israel the close
Turkish Israeli relations go back to the
late 1950s military intelligence
commercial late more recently tourism
and cultural relations that's their one
significant regional ally and of course
it's the major regional power for them
to have to break for if those relations
significantly deteriorate that
contributes very substantially to
Israel's isolation in the region now at
the same time the same thing is
happening in Egypt one of the reasons
why the US and its allies are so
concerned about and so fact so
antagonistic to democracy in Egypt and
in fact anywhere in the Arab world is
that if you have moves towards democracy
a popular opinion is going to have some
effect on policy in fact that's the
basic measure of whether there's any
functional democracy well public opinion
in Egypt is very antagonistic to the way
the dictatorship of arctic tater ship
interpreted relations with Israel very
antagonistic the there was a peace
treaty in 1979 and it was interpreted in
Israel right away and in the United
States as essentially a licensing Israel
to expand its criminal activities and
the occupied territories and to attack
its northern neighbor Lebanon which is
exactly what it did the reasoning which
was pretty clearly expressed is that
with Egypt neutral
that's the one major deterrent to
Israeli actions and if they're
neutralized if there's a peace treaty
they pull out of it then Israel is free
to go ahead to do it at once in the
occupied territories and attacking
Lebanon those that's exactly what
happened that ever and that it's
continued that way there's plenty of
bitterness in Egypt about this there's
also the Egyptian opinion public opinion
like throughout the Arab world regards
the United States and Israel as the
major threats they face in Italy latest
polls about 90 percent and they don't
regard Iran as a threat maybe 10 percent
in the Arab world major polls about a
year ago regard Iran as a threat in fact
opposition the US policy is so strong
that throughout the Arab world a
majority and Egypt it's 80 percent
I think the region would be more secure
if Iran had nuclear weapons well you
know that's not the kind of policy that
the United States and Israel want to see
implemented needless to say hence a
strong opposition to the rise of any
meaningful democracy but even and there
have been successes in Egypt of the
popular movements the labor movement and
others labor for the first which is a
core part of the uprising goes back many
years as is now organizing freely is
beginning to form independent unions and
so on other parts of the population or
the press is much freer there are some
real achievements despite the fact that
the military regime is still in place
and they show up in policy as public
opinion becomes somewhat more
influential in policy formation you see
the effect the attack on the Israeli
embassy a couple of days ago was a kind
of a dramatic element of it
israeli-egyptian relations now are quite
tense next to Turkey Egypt's the most
important regional country for Israel
but it's beyond that
a couple of months ago the Egyptian
government for the first time in 30
years that permitted Iranian ships to
transit the Suez Canal into the
Mediterranean that may have included
submarines not cleared Israel they're
moving towards exchanging ambassadors
Egypt Iran Egypt somewhat relaxed the
the entry the Gaza Egypt border the
Rafah border limited but something that
undermines to some extent the u.s. fact
Israeli siege on Gaza Egypt moved to
help expedite some degree of
reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah
the - you know the major Palestinian
factions that dominate respectively Gaza
and the West Bank that also carries
forward that kind of unity is essential
if the Palestinians are going to make
significant moves towards some degree of
Independence statehood reform it takes
all these moves by Egypt are regarded
very negatively by the US and Israel and
that relation between well as you know
the Israeli ambassador had to be flown
out in a military jet a couple of days
ago with the whole staff so on the one
hand relations with Turkey are
deteriorating on the other hand the
relations with Egypt are deteriorating
relations in the sense in which they had
existed as a license for Israeli
military action and occupation and that
is leading in Israel to a rather
significant reassessment of where they
should go this is coming even from the
right wing just a couple days ago
the eye
plus closer sharing very right-wing
politician urged Israel to the Israeli
leadership to reassess their policies
towards the Palestinians towards
statehood that was a very important
meeting about four three months ago
knowing we have to end in just two
minutes so we just wanted to wrap it for
a minute by asking you two quick
questions one is about politics in this
country do you see a big difference
between Obama Mitt Romney Rick Perry do
you think there would be a drastic
change in policy if a Republican were to
win in 2012 and if it were Perry or
Romney well I must say that politics in
this country now is in a state that I
think has no analogue in American
history and maybe nowhere in any
parliamentary system it's astonishing I
mean I'm not a great enthusiast for
Obama as you know from way back but at
least he's somewhere in the real world
Perry who's very likely very likely to
get the to win the primary and win the
nomination and maybe to win the election
he's often outerspace
I mean his views are unbelievable
Backman is the same Romney's kind of
more or less toward the center these are
the positions that they're taking our
utter ly outlandish as you mentioned
before I just came back from Europe
where people just can't believe what
they're seeing here with people are
saying I mean take one of the really
crucial issues for the human species
doing something about environmental
catastrophe well every single one of the
Republican candidates maybe not Huntsman
but every major one is a climate change
denier it's kind of ironic in the case
of Perry he says there's no global
warming while Texas is burning up with
the
highest temperatures on record fire all
over the place and so on but it doesn't
matter it's just not happening in fact
the one who has conceded that there may
be global warming has taken place is
Michele Bachmann I heard a statement of
hers in which said well yes maybe it's
happening it's God's punishment for
allowing gay marriage or some comment
like that I mean this what's going on
there is just off the international
spectrum of a sane behavior
