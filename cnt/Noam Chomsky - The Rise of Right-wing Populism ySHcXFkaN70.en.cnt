uh take say austria where
about 50 of the population are
supporting a
kind of a neo-nazi party
austria one has some memories of austria
or take
germany where a right-wing
ultra-nationalist party is now
winning not winning but coming in local
elections ahead of
markelle's party okay uh
i'm old enough to remember listening to
hitler's speeches over the radio i
didn't understand the words but the
meaning
was significant actually my
the first article i wrote was in
february 1939 and it was about barcelona
it was about the fall of barcelona to
fascist forces
and the picture my own fear at the time
ten-year-old not very sophisticated was
that the spread this evil spread of
fascism over the world was unstoppable
what do we hear now in europe echoes of
the same thing
that's pretty serious not suggesting
that we're on the verge of a return
to nazism but it's pretty serious
now let's go back to the united states
it's also
serious though not at this level and i
think if you look at the sources
it's they're pretty similar in both
there are plenty of differences but
they're somewhat similar in the united
states and europe
part of it is simply racism
europe in my opinion has always been
much more racist than the united states
in europe homogeneous societies
could suppress their
fear of any contamination by a small
number of different people
so as long as everybody's blonde and
blue-eyed and denmark
we're not racist but as soon as a small
percentage of others come in it all
blows up
we're seeing this all over europe the
united states has a
history of horrible racism
but nevertheless it is something of a
melting pot familiar term if you stand
on a street corner in new york you see
every imaginable kind of person
race class gender and nobody pays any
attention
it's bad enough in the united states but
possibly even worse in europe
another factor is the neoliberal
programs of the past
generation both in the united states and
europe
in europe it took the severe and
destructive form of
the austerity programs after 2008
the effect of these programs has been to
cast aside
large numbers of people who have
so in the united states for example
wages for male workers
are about what they were in the 1960s i
mean while benefits have declined the
hope for the future has declined
they see themselves ignored suppressed
similar phenomena in europe and one
result
has been contempt for institutions
political institutions financial
institutions
almost all of them and the collapse of
centrist political parties striking in
europe
and the trump phenomenon and
indeed the sanders phenomenon are a more
promising case
our signs are the same thing in the
united states
so i think it's not hard to find the
sources of these developments
which are very serious ones we're facing
imminent crises the migrant crisis in my
opinion
is essentially a moral crisis of the
west
but there could be a really huge migrant
crisis
as the effects of global warming
increase
of course in the case of possible
nuclear war
the other major shadow there's no
migrant crisis
nobody's left to talk about but uh
no time to really go into it deeply but
i think
we can see somewhat similar phenomena
and roots in the united states
where it's on the front pages right now
and in europe where it's constant
