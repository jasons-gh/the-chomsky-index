party oh how did tea party come into
existence exactly one month after Obama
was inaugurated would you address that
please yes sir thank you for your call
Jim thank you very much Noam Chomsky the
right the race factor
they're pretty definitely is a race
factor I tend to agree with former
President Jimmy Carter about that it's
hard to deny the racial element of
course the Tea Party members deny it but
if you look at the tone of what they're
doing I mean the hysteria that has been
aroused about President Obama you know
he the birthers he's leading figures in
the Republican Party like Newt Gingrich
get away with saying that the problem
with Obama is that he's his that Kenyan
roots
he's definitely anti-colonialist because
of his father who I think he met once in
his life or something I mean all of
these fantasies that are developing are
so remote from any kind of reality that
it's hard to doubt that there's a racial
element in it and many other things so I
tend to agree with the caller on that we
need to talk our time is short we could
go a long time but I want to talk about
the president about the economy about
war wars you began to talk about
President Obama and your disappointment
you saw him as a marketing pass a
package I guess but here he's been
president going on two years now what
about his performance and what about his
compass setting for the country I'm not
disappointed because I didn't expect
anything in fact before the primaries I
wrote about him just using his website
in his background and basically urging
people don't succumb to illusions hope
and change sounds nice but no where's
the beef to go back a couple of decades
and it isn't there he's fundamentally
that's no exaggeration to say he's a
creature of the financial institutions
that was the core of his support his
financials is funding support and they
expected to be paid off and
were unfortunately that's how American
politics works so they were paid off
fine but not the population and on issue
after issue people maybe if people are
disappointed they shouldn't be what
would president Chomsky have been doing
the last year and a half two years or
your ideal president in this particular
period in our history well first of all
there was a huge financial crash thanks
to the primarily to the incompetence of
Alan Greenspan Ben Bernanke a lot of the
economics profession which simply was
enthralled by mythology about efficient
markets and how they're just going to
take care of everything if you leave him
alone so is the deregulation craze the
euphoria about economic theories that
basically have no substance it wasn't a
joke that led to this eight trillion
dollar bubble in which people put their
assets and their hopes and it crashed
and it led to a disaster well how do you
react to it I think the way you should
have reacted to it is with first of all
the there was I don't agree that it was
correct to focus on bailing out the AIG
and goldman sachs and so on that
shouldn't have been the focus
yeah we need a functioning financial
system but lots of other ways to do it
it's way beyond any social utility so
your with the Tea Party on that may be
in many ways you know I think that was
the wrong way to spend money Paul
Krugman says if we didn't do that we and
so did the bankers of course we would
have gone into a depression like none
other
it could have been done in quite
different ways for if for example it
could have been done by breaking up the
banks by eliminating the too-big-to-fail
government incentive to create a new
crisis there could have been conditions
that meant that the bankers and the
shareholders had
take you know what's called the haircut
yeah and none of these things were done
yes something had to be done but the
government was in a position to
reconstruct the financial system so that
it's socially functional instead of
destructive and they didn't the other
thing had to do with the stimulus
stimulus was correct there should have
been a stimulus it was much too small
here I think I agree with Kirkman it was
effective contrary to propaganda but it
just chipped away at the problem she'll
been much larger should be much larger
now and there should have been a
dedication to developing industrial
programs that really would lead to
growth I mean take some examples almost
everyone agrees that the big growth
industry for the future is going to be
green technology well where's it being
carried out US investors are putting
more money into China that for green
technology than they are in the US and
Europe combined what do you do about
that China is a command economy in many
respects it's got the Communist Party at
the top and many of its biggest
companies are party owned a certainly
party supported the banking system is
but that doesn't mean that we can't
weave in our history we've carried out
many programs under government
initiative and funding that created
industries of the future
I'm gonna take the IT revolution which
everyone agrees is significant where'd
that come from
well it came from largely from the
Pentagon I mean the development of
computers humor technologies bending
yeah it was research 30 years mostly in
the state sector before it was
essentially privatized
well that in fact I was right in the
middle of it I should say that MIT which
was one of the centers were enduring the
spirit the same thing could be done for
green technology conditions the
government can establish conditions
which make it profitable to invest in
green technology here that not in China
and if we don't what do you see coming
for the American economy the productive
sector of the American economy is has
been collapsing for 30 years and is not
being resurrected
that's the only one component we have
huge infrastructure problems here well
again that require in the 1950s the
government state sector carried out
major programs like the what was called
the defense highway system uncle
interstate system I don't approve of
those programs they were state corporate
programs designed to maximize wasteful
use of fossil fuel and to undermine
efficient transportation was connected
with suburbanization of the population
so on so huge social enjoyed a lot of
raw economic activity that's for sure it
did but of in my opinion not the wrong
kind would have made a lot more sense to
develop an efficient transportation
system high-speed rail and so on if you
compare the United States with actually
I just was in that Taiwan and China I
mean you know even there for I'm Taiwan
I was a rich country no but it you know
in many respects Taiwan makes the United
States look like a third-world country
why yeah that speak specific to notice
Obama essentially took over the auto
industry one of the things that he did
was continued to dismantle plants
General Motors plants and so on at the
very same time his Transportation
Secretary Ray LaHood was in Europe using
stimulus money to get contracts from
Spanish and other firms to build
high-tech rail rail which could have
been built in those same GM factory does
this somehow go back to the
financialization you talked about what's
the core problem why isn't the American
economy you know weren't the Pistons
turning on these fronts why well there
was a huge takeover of the economy by
the financial sector pretty much since
the 1970s if you look at the share of
corporate profits and taken by finance
it's done of the exact figures of Harry
but may have gone from a few percent to
maybe a third or so over 30 years that's
huge
the same time productive industry was
hollowed out sent abroad now that's not
a new phenomenon it moved from that Roy
or the our history it moved from New
England to the south and southwest and
so on but this was a huge change that
was accelerated by hit by the Democrats
and the Republicans didn't have to be
done but you you often written about the
United States this is a broad
characterization but as this kind of
hegemony stick you know hyper power with
a huge military has pocket ready to use
it to pursue its economic interest
anywhere in the world if that view is
true then how could it not be taking
care of business right at home it is
taking care of business right at home
the corporate sector is doing fine the
banks are doing fine just take a look at
the corporate profits they're fine the
top few percentage of the population is
making out like bandits let's go to
Tracy in Clarksville Tennessee Tracy
you're on the air with noam chomsky oh I
actually agree with a lot mr. e mr.
Chomsky saying about the
industrialization and pushing some of
those programs for the economy but I'm a
realist and you know philosophy and
intellectual talk a lot of times sounds
great on paper but when you start trying
to put those things into practical use
