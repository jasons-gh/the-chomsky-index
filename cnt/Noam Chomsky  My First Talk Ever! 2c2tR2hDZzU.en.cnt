this is I guess a proper occasion for me
to remember the first thought I gave in
a church which was about nineteen
sixty-three I was very different from
this occasion there wasn't any band in
fact there weren't any people to be
precise because acura is important
accuracy is important there were four
people the organizer was there the
minister was kind enough to come one
person came in off the streets looked
like a homeless person for a warm-up and
there was one guy there who would kind
of Roger except he looking as if he was
going to try to kill me and that was my
first experience in church actually that
was an improvement over earlier talks
this is about to be it not more earlier
ones had been in living rooms of where
somebody would bring two or three
neighbors around might wanna talk about
it it's important to bear that sort of
thing in mind when we think how far
we've come from then
