what I'd like to know is why the study
of how we acquire language was important
to you and what what is it revealed to
us in a broad sense about how the mind
works well traditionally the capacity
for language has been understood to be
almost a defining property of human
species if you go back and say to the
states they take Cartesian philosophy
the 17th century dominant philosophy
that is a part of which grew the
Enlightenment and so on for Descartes it
literally was the defining property
remember for Descartes it was critical
to distinguish creatures with Minds mind
soul were Minds from those who didn't
have them the ones who didn't have souls
and minds were machines was the
mechanical philosophy that was the basis
for early modern science they were
machines those with souls and minds were
human well how did it how would you
determine whether some creature has a
mind the proposals that come from
Descartes and his followers were by
testing their language abilities you ask
do they have this fundamental a creative
capacity that humans have and that they
exhibit in their normal use of language
what's the creative capacity I think
they captured the essence of it pretty
accurately it's the ability which all
humans share and no according to them no
animal or machine or machine shares to
create and produce freely new
expressions which are appropriate to
situations but not caused by situations
they're not the result of stimuli coming
from the outside or for that matter even
internal stimuli there has a big
difference between being caused and
being appropriate appropriate
it's a crucial difference the hard one
to capture but we recognize it so there
and the this innovative behavior has no
limits it can go on indefinitely
in fact most linguistic performance is
new sentences maybe never produced in
the history of the world or your own
experience at least and they're also
intelligible to others they recognize
you I could have expressed that thought
in that way if it had come to mind
well that capacity sort of a creative
aspect of language use that was regarded
and I think plausibly as a kind of a
core component of human cognition human
morality and moral judgment and in fact
a human activity this was connected
especially in the early days of
classical liberalism and people like
Smith von Humboldt than others this was
connected with the belief that humans
basically have a need of fundamental
need to carry out creative work under
their own control this was put very
nicely by Wilhelm von Humboldt founder
of the modern university system also a
great linguist and one of the founders
of classical liberalism he his point was
the way he put it is that if an artisan
that creates a beautiful piece of work
under on command we may admire what he
did but we despise what he is namely a
tool in the hands of others on the other
hand if that artisan produces the same
beautiful work under his own control and
initiative we admire not only the piece
of work but also the the artisan himself
who it is actually Adam Smith said the
same thing everyone has read the first
paragraph of Wealth of Nations were you
know the talks about the butcher does
this and the Baker does that and
everybody's happy
it comes out in favor of division of
labor the very few people have gone on
a couple hundred pages into this rather
dense book when Smith returns to the
notion of division of labor and says
that division of labor cannot be
tolerated because it will turn people
into creatures as stupid and ignorant as
a human being can possibly be that just
routinely under command performing the
same actions over and over and he says
in any civilized society that the
government's gonna have to step in to do
something about it
education you know other things if you
take a look at the scholarly editions of
wealth of nations say the University of
Chicago Bicentennial scholarly edition
you take a look under division of labor
and you'll notice this passage isn't
even listed in the index most important
passage about division of labor it's not
I'm sure it was not intended to seat I
think they just couldn't understand it
it's just an unintelligible view in the
modern conception so you kind of read
the words but they don't get beyond the
eyes and but but that conception is
really fundamental the collapse of
classical liberalism I think it's
correct and they related it loosely to
the creative aspect of language use well
we're very far from having answers to
any of these questions I should say but
there are steps towards it and the major
steps do happen to be in the study of
language doesn't there are applications
of thoughts about it elsewhere but
that's what the main work is and some
rather surprising things have come out I
think it's sort of useful to compare
what's been done in the last roughly 60
years to the early very early days of
modern science one of the great
breakthroughs in modern science say
Galileo Galilei in period was to be
willing to be puzzled about things that
seemed obvious that's a tremendous step
forward so for example for literally
thousands of years it had been accepted
by important scientists
that we have answers to some very simple
questions like when I hold this thing up
if I let it go the cup is going to drop
if this happened to be boiling water
inside and I lift the lid the steam will
go up so the cup drops and the steam
rises well Aristotle had an answer to
why they're seeking their natural place
and that was taken to be the appropriate
answer for thousands of years when
Galileo and others began to be said
let's let's be puzzled about this let's
just not take it for granted because it
comes from authority and when you start
being puzzled about it modern science
begins you see you don't know the
answers and when you try to find out the
answers they break down all the shows
that all sorts of intuitions are just
wildly off and you finally out of this
slowly comes modern science and I think
that's what's been happening in study of
language since roughly the early 1950s
approximately a lot of things that seem
completely obvious were looked at
carefully and they all turned out to be
extremely puzzling so take a simple
example which is kind of evolved in
industry of analysis take the sentence
small short sentence can Eagles that fly
swim ok we all understand it we know
that the word can is associated with
swim not fly we're asking can they swim
not could they fly similarly we can say
things like our Eagles that fly swimming
but we can't say our Eagles that
swimming that flying swim actually think
about it that's a fine thought it says
are the Eagles that are flying swimming
- so our Eagles that flying swim but you
just can't say it that way that thought
can't be expressed in that form well you
know that's right if you think about it
it was taken for granted for forever
that that was just sort of intuitively
obvious but if you think about it it's
not at all obvious
Aristotle defined language as sound with
meaning
well what the pursuit of this inquiry
tends to show is that that's not correct
that actually language is meaning with
sound and it need not be sound it can be
sine or some other mode of
externalization that's a big difference
it means that the core character of
language is the set of principles that
yield structured expressions and assign
them a meaning and that part of
languages probably can't show it yet but
it looks like it's uniform among humans
it doesn't seem to very much and if we
knew enough maybe at all it's just a
core property of humans that we have
this set of principles that yields an
unbounded array of structural
expressions that have a semantic
interpretation that means something and
when you look into it's pretty strange
what it means but and that just needs to
be shared among humans altogether there
is no known difference among remote
tribes and happily I haven't had other
human contact for tens of thousands of
years and the children who grow up here
and if you interchange them at infancy
they'll grow into their own society
without any problem so that seems to be
a core property of human nature the
externalization that what we call the
sound part is marginal and it also
follows from that that communication is
marginal I mean it's it's kind of a like
a a Dogma among even scientists who
write about these topics that language
is basically a means of communication
and evolved as a means of communication
you look at current publications on
evolution of language that's just taken
for granted it apparently is all false
it turns out that from the closer
analysis of language that it's actually
a tool for thought it's a means of
expressing thought and on the side you
can use it for communication as you can
use anything else for communication
that gives it actually if you just
introspect for a minute that shouldn't
be surprising just ask yourself what is
most of your own use of language
well if introspect it turns out that you
know probably 99% of it is talking to
yourself talking to yourself is not
communicating you can't it takes a
tremendous act of will not to talk to
yourself try it you know very hard
you're walking down the street you're
talking to yourself in fragments of
sentences it goes on all night
unfortunately but and sometimes it's
used for communication but even the
external part is not much well that's a
radically different conception of
fundamental human nature and it does
lead to in other directions like at
least exploring these thoughts about
creative work about moral judgment and
so on and I think you know I wouldn't I
don't exaggerate this is by no means a
universally accepted even among
scientists but I think that's the
direction in which work has been moving
and I think it is a way of finding out
basic things about what kind of
creatures we are
