during the 1980s the Reagan
administration is responsible for
roughly 200,000 people slaughtered and
that doesn't mean just killed you know
that means tortured mutilated and raped
I mean Pol Pot style torture that's
pretty serious business hundreds of
thousands like millions of refugees
large areas of the country destroyed all
of this in an effort to block social
reform the Republicans attacked Dukakis
as a card-carrying member of the ACLU
that's a very interesting phrase that
means an organ card carrying is of
course means real really communist you
know that's what that's supposed to
imply so here's an organization that's
committed to the defense of the
Constitution and according to the
Republicans
that's communist well you know I think
that characterizes modern conservatism
it's really a profoundly reactionary
movement which is deeply opposed to the
values that on which the country was
established I quoted the Trilateral
Commission view of the educational
system namely it's a system of
indoctrination of the young and I think
that's correct it's a system of
indoctrination of the young that was the
way the liberal elites regarded and
they're more or less accurate so the
educational system is supposed to train
people to be obedient conformist not
think too much which told stay passive
don't cause any crisis a democracy don't
raise any questions and so on that's
basically what the what the system is
about Noam Chomsky concludes his
two-part series analyzing the mass media
and American society right now on
alternative views
this will be the concluding section of
our two-part series featuring dr. Noam
Chomsky from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology one of America's foremost
critics of the mass media and American
society Noam Chomsky is co-author of a
very good book on the mass media called
manufacturing consent and this program
he will mainly take questions from the
audience
we also will present some information
from the progressive magazine on mass
media distortions and now here is Noam
Chomsky speaking from eclair Wisconsin
in political discourse every term has
two meanings you got to start by
recognizing that so democracy has an
official meaning which is something like
you know the ability of the public to
take part and running their own affairs
or something but it also has a technical
meaning the one that's actually used
something is democracy if it's run by
the business classes if business runs it
especially business elements they're
supportive of US interests then it's
democracy if not it's not a democracy it
doesn't matter nothing else matters
virtually you'll check you'll notice
that this criterion works quite
perfectly we're identifying democracy
same is true of the term peace process
it has a dictionary meaning in the
dictionary meaning a peace process is
some kind of process that's trying to
lead towards peace but it also has a
technical meaning the technical meaning
in its technical meaning it refers to
whatever the United States happens to be
advocating at a particular moment
wherever diplomatic initiatives the
United States is advocating that's the
peace process notice it follows that
it's a logical impossibility for the
United States to be opposed to the peace
process
that's a nice consequence yet to prove
that the United States is for peace you
don't have to do any laborious inquiry
into the Annoying facts because it's
true by definition since the peace
process is whatever the United States is
up to the United States always
supporting peace and the u.s. enemies
are always opposed to peace because
they're not supporting what the US is up
to and by definition that means
they're opposed to peace you'll never
find in the US media or for that matter
in us scholarship for the most part any
such phrase as the United States is
opposing the peace process the United
States is trying to block the peace
process you can't find such statements
because they'd be logical contradictions
actually I made this statement and a
talk in Seattle a couple of months ago
and there is a media analysis group in
the Graduate School there and a couple
weeks later I got a letter from somebody
saying he was kind of intrigued so he
did a data based study of the New York
Times over ten years and he found that
unlike 900 references the peace process
and checked them all out and in fact
there's not one case where the United
States was opposed to the peace process
pretty remarkable because that was a
period when the United States was trying
to undermine the diplomatic negotiations
and settlement in Central America and in
the Middle East and so on notice that's
pretty remarkable even the most sublime
state you'd expect that it wouldn't
always be in favor of the police peace
process maybe just by error or
misunderstanding but in the case of the
United States its 100th it's 100 percent
you might check and see if you can find
any exception and the reason is it's
just true by definition since the
priests process is whatever we do now
there are two major examples of peace
processes in process now one of them's
in the Middle East and ones in Central
America there's no time to go through
the details but if you look you'll
notice that in the Middle East the
United States has been trying to block a
diplomatic settlement for the path of
the arab-israeli conflict for the past
twenty years and it's still trying to
block it and in this is virtually
isolated in world opinion that's exactly
what's going on now if you like I'll
give you some details I have a detailed
discussion of it in the current issue of
Z magazine if you're interested but I
think it's quite clear nevertheless the
discussion is the United States is
trying to advance the peace process
there's another peace process going on
in Central America which is no less
interesting read you from the front page
of the New York Times today the lead
story in The New York Times today which
I picked up on the airplane says US
envoy urges
to let the contra stay okay let him stay
in Honduras the track you come out the
men comes a long story and you turn to
the second page the continuation page
and it says on its face the
administration proposal to keep the
Contras in place would seem to be
inconsistent with the spirit of the
regional peace agreement which calls for
their relocation but administration
officials say there is no inconsistency
well that's about as close as you can
come you know on its face it seems to be
inconsistent with the spirit of the
peace agreement well the peace agreement
is quite explicit the 1987 peace
agreement which the United States has
succeeded in undermining and destroying
says explicitly that the one
indispensable element in obtaining peace
in the region is the end of any form of
support logistical military
propagandistic etc for irregular forces
like the Contras now it's not it doesn't
seem to be inconsistent with the spirit
but it's flatly inconsistent with the
words to keep the Contras in pray placed
well the same is true of everything else
about that the there was a there's that
was the 1987 peace agreement which the
United States tried to undermine and did
undermine the support of the media but
there others there's a right now there's
the bait going on on so-called
humanitarian aid to the Contras well the
term humanitarian aid has a meaning in
fact the World Court and its decision
defines humanitarian aid it lookup
paragraph 243 of the world Court
decision and it defines humanitarian aid
as aid given for the hallowed purposes
of the Red Cross namely to relieve human
suffering and crucially it says aid that
is given without discrimination to
civilians on all sides of any conflict
only under such conditions that anything
qualifies humanitarian aid
well that means all the stuff given is
called humanitarian aid has nothing to
do with humanitarian aid its military
aid but you'll never find this discussed
in the media I doubt if you find one
friends to this in the media so now
we're talking about humanitarian aid
that's going to be voted Bush
administration hopes to keep the Contras
in place in violation of the 1987
agreement well it was also a central
american president's agreement just last
month and that said something too it
said the Contras have to be relocated
away from honduras so this is flatly
inconsistent with that not the spirit
but the wording furthermore there was a
ceasefire agreement between Nicaragua
and the Contras last March over the deep
objections of the United States last
March 23rd and that ceasefire agreement
has some very specific terms in it it
says that aid can continue to go to the
Contras in ceasefire zones all of which
are in Nicaragua when provided by a
neutral agency that's what the wording
of the agreement says Congress passed
legislation right after that sent to
send what they call humanitarian aid to
the Contras but if you look at the
legislation it says specifically that it
must be in accord with the ceasefire
agreement and it must be an accord to
the Central American Peace Agreement
well that means that the only aid that
Congress could legally send to the
Contras in accordance with its own
legislation is aid given by a neutral
agency like the Red Cross to Contras in
ceasefire zones inside Nicaragua that's
not just my interpretation the ceasefire
agreement also specified an
international official in charge of
monitoring the agreement it's a
Secretary General of the Organization of
American States he wrote a letter to
President Secretary of State George
Shultz stating that the aid that the
United States was sending was
inconsistent with the ceasefire
agreement and he was wanted to call the
attention of the Secretary of State to
this serious violation of the ceasefire
agreement and the Congressional
legislation
I was never reported Congress proceeded
to send the aid the neutral agency that
they selected was US aid State
Department subsidiary that's the u.s.
it's the neutral agency and they're
sending it illegally to Honduras in fact
the aid that they're sending is not only
in can flatly inconsistent with the
American peace agreement it's even
inconsistent with Congress's own
legislation that's pretty tricky
you'll never find one word of discussion
about this this is against the
background of years of the United States
trying to undermine every effort at
political settlement of that of those
conflicts whether they were through the
counted or a group of Latin American
democracies or the United Nations or the
Security Council over the United States
vetoed resolutions calling on all states
to support international law and so on
and it continues but nevertheless
according to the media the press the
United States government is supporting
the peace process well I'm suggesting
that wherever you look if you look
closely you'll find exactly the same
thing you'll find quite a remarkable
degree of civility and subordination to
establish power particularly remarkable
because there's no force behind the
there's no authority that can impose
force this is willing subservience not
compelled subservience and the kind that
in fact flows i think just from the the
logic of the institutions for the
reasons that I mentioned well let me
return finally to a prediction of the
propaganda model that I mentioned
already namely that however well confirm
that is it cannot be part of the
discussion it's going to remain outside
the spectrum of debate and respectable
circles maybe with some very marginal
exceptions the reasons are the ones I
mentioned they're pretty obvious that
conclusion again is quite
well-established empirically and I think
we may assume with fair degree of
confidence that that will continue to be
the case Noam Chomsky we'll take
questions from the audience later but
right now here is some information from
the progressive magazine featuring a
study by martin lee and norman solomon
from the organization fairness and
accuracy in media and it's about the
categories of distortion from
information from the establishment media
one category is loaded language for
instance one person one group that might
be struggling for civil rights will be
just engaged in civil disobedience and
the other end will be
labeled as terrorists another example is
that New York Times said that Moscow was
going to violate the u.s. Soviet treaty
but when it came to the Americans
violating the ABM Treaty they only said
that the Reagan administration was going
to reinterpret the treaty also they use
left wing right wing very interestingly
and with a great deal of of distortion
New York Times correspondent for
instance said in about the municipal
elections in Berlin
both the extreme left and the extreme
right have gained in this action okay
who is the extreme right well it was the
Republican citizen party which was very
racist and very very right-wing but who
was the left-wing party and he was
concerned about the Greens the little
greens you know the ecology pro-peace
people and so this was the this is the
way the New York Times distorts things
you know Suharto is moderate and the
greens are leftist and only a few of the
nuttiest reactionaries are right-wing
whereas one could argue that George Bush
is right-wing that NBC is right-wing in
GE and most of the corporations are
advocating policies that in an earlier
age would be seen as right-wing to the
right of any moderate center that you
can possibly imagine well whoever is in
power only usually designates themselves
at the center and anything to the other
side of it or badasses well there's
another distortion they of course they
throw around the word communist all the
time for people they don't want
communist or leftist or Marxist even
calling the Sandinistas communist in the
New York Times and the network's all the
time although they were so far from it
it is incredible nobody also talked
about the budding democracy in El
Salvador that
the land of death squad they I always
took me to death in Vietnam or they say
well fifty communist troops were killed
and injured today
you never hear him talk about the how
many capitalist troops were killed or
injured and always a communist
how many counter-revolutionary
interventionist imperialist forces were
shot another category of distortion in
this article an aggressive is
unattributed assertions and suspicious
resource sources their references with
Dan Rather had an article in which he
said Burt Quint reports that the
Palestine Liberation Organization
conference in Algiers was orchestrated
by Moscow well where did he get that
information
nobody said when they tried to nail down
Dan Rather on at CBS said well that
might have been a strong word
orchestrated by Moscow might have been
ill chosen well 150 million people or
how many ever saw it and they didn't
make a retraction in point of fact the
network's are constantly conduits for
disinformation it's not just the CIA
that plant stories like Qaddafi was
going to assassinate Reagan remember
that one
but the administration are constantly
feeding lies into the media that then
the media broadcast again using this
cover of unattributed to sources i found
out in the research I'm doing on this
book on US television the john mcwethy
who is the ABC defense and pentagon
reporter has been a constant source of
disinformation for years during the
reagan administration there are so many
leaks from the government so coldly to
you so many of you consider plants
because of just in this information
which the government wants to get into
the regular media or they'll say well US
intelligence experts believe or CIA
people think but they don't say who it
is and so you can know exactly who's
pumping out this disinformation let's
return to Noam Chomsky as he takes
questions from the audience
the first one was about his opinion of
PBS and the ACLU the ACLU is an
important organization of the ACLU in
fact became the ACLU right at the time
of the Red Scare Wilson's Red Scare and
in response to that severe repression
and since then it has a pretty admirable
record of its conservative rec it's a
conservative organization very
conservative the term conservative is
another one of those that's been
distorted out of any relation to its
meaning but in the real sense of the
term conservative the ACLU is a
conservative organization which is
trying to preserve basically
conservative values 18th century values
and it does a pretty good job on it it's
had bad periods I went along with
McCarthyism for example and it doesn't
take the really hard cases those are
taken by more militant civil rights
organizations but it has done very good
things it's very striking fact that
about the political system you recall
what happened with the ACLU in the last
elections the Republicans attacked
Dukakis as a card-carrying member of the
ACLU that's a very interesting phrase
that means an Oregon card-carrying is of
course means real really communist you
know that's what that's supposed to
imply so here's an organization that's
committed to the defense of the
Constitution and according to the
Republicans
that's communist well you know I think
that characterizes modern conservatism
it's really a profoundly reactionary
movement which is deeply opposed to the
values that on which the country was
established and that's why they would
call a an organization calling for the
defense of the Constitution a subversive
organization now what was the Democrats
defense against this charge that they
were that Dukakis supported the
Constitution his defense was to deny
that he supported I mean he didn't say
yeah of course I'm a member of the ACLU
when proud of it
what he said is we gave it they
published a list of cases of the a so us
that he disagreed with that was the
Republic R attic response well that
tells you something about Aelita pinion
I know I don't think the ACLU is an
illusion
important organization I'm proud to be a
card-carrying member and to speak at
their meetings and stuff I also think
there are more courageous organizations
to take harder cases what was the second
question
oh yeah public broadcasting well public
broadcasting is an interesting case in a
lot of countries public broadcasting is
ten how free public broadcasting is
public broadcasting is not subject as
much at least to business and to
corporate and advertiser pressures
however of course it's subject to state
pressures and how free and independent
public broadcasting is depends typically
on how free the state is not like in a
free society public broadcasting will be
free for many years the BBC was very
independent with sure another
anti-democratic reactionary the BBC has
been become much more constrained
because the British government is also
imposing harsh constraints on freedom of
expression under Thatcher another's
mislabeled conservative but turning to
the United States public broadcasting is
very weak as compared with virtually any
other country any other democratic
country you know any of the you look at
the industrial democratic societies they
all have public broadcasting some of
them are only public broadcasting for
example in Israel there's only a state
TV in England until recently there was
only state TV and now there's another
Channel two other channels I think in
Canada they till recently there was only
CBC there may be another one now I've
forgotten but that's common I mean those
are major channels and that's true of
most countries and how free they are
depends on how free the country is in
the United States they're very weak
because here things are run by
corporations this is a business run
Society and things suppose to be under
corporate control so public broadcasting
is very limited and in fact it survives
to a large extent on corporate donations
which is a constraint Gulf and Western
and one famous case forced wnet TV in
New York to cancel a programme on home
simply by saying they remove their
submission and they submit and public
broadcasting is is you know it varies
across the country in the major centers
like Boston and Washington and New York
it's very very narrow it's in fact it's
I think it's more tightly censored in
corporate radio and television in other
parts of the country like you know
Laramie Wyoming and Des Moines Iowa and
maybe here it's more free and that makes
sense the same is true of commercial
media because in the ideological centers
it's much more important to control what
people think what they think out and the
sticks doesn't matter so much because
there's not much they can do about it
and as a result it's more open I mean I
can see that myself if I go to Laramie I
get interviewed on public television on
public television
but that same can see virtually
inconceivable in Boston you know maybe a
minute now and then or something in the
interests of you know fairness version
but that and big and the reason is that
you know for the main centers like say
Boston are subject to what's called a
liberal bias meaning tightly controlled
by ideological managers who know their
business and don't let things get out of
hand I think it's possible to put the
kind of pressures on public broadcasting
that can't be done on corporate media
but to that that requires organization
and real participation there are other
forms I should say one of the most some
of the most interesting and important
things are listener supported radio now
that's usually a small-scale operation
you know fly-by-night operation but
they're very important that's really out
of corporate control or state control
and you can tell you travel around as I
do to communities and the ones that have
listener supported radio are quite
different there's just an independent
culture that can sustain itself there
with people participating and you know
involvement of the community I mean it's
just much more democratic
and that you can see the results but
that's you know very limited resources
because resources lie essentially in the
business community another way they
distort it is to when they'll have a
government source it has credibility
right the Secretary of State or somebody
like that but then when they have
non-government sources or critics
they'll have somebody from a foreign
government that I have a Russian or
they'll help us Ortega from Nicaragua
but they don't show the people in the
United States who are progressive
critics of the US government they always
make it look like it's the dirty
foreigners against the good old Stars
and Stripes so this is one way of
showing presence and when they do have a
point-counterpoint
they get to the absurd stage where a
macneil-lehrer program they had a thing
on nuclear weapons issues and who was
the Dove they had was old Sam Nunn
giving the dovish point of view in fact
Frank fair that same group that puts out
this analysis that you're reading has
recently published a report on the
macneil-lehrer show where over a nine
month period they documented who the
spokespeople were from the different
groups of the society on the program and
they documented that it's almost
primarily conservative groups and
spokespeople as corporate spokespeople
it's these conservative think tanks that
dock to dominate the special guest in
expert segments and there's almost no
labor union people environmentalists
public interest group people and no one
left the center's ever on their
supposedly I think it was their Jim
Lehrer said he doesn't like moaners and
whiners from the left and so he gave his
producers instructions not to bring any
of those types on the program and they
did a case study for instance of the
Exxon Valdez story that during the
period they were monitoring the
macneil-lehrer program was one of the
big stories and they didn't have one
environmentalist
despite many special segments on the
show they would tend to have the
governor of Alaska or Exxon corporation
spokesperson or a Congress person that
they never had environmentalists on who
you would think would be the experts
that could really assess the impact of
the oil spill on the environment
likewise when they have a segment on
Central America they rarely have people
from say Nicaragua or the El Salvador
left they always have these right-wing
conservative types here in the US who
are pontificating about Central America
and so you get a very narrow spectrum of
opinion on our public television program
the first cousin category to what we're
talking about in this progressive
article category is stenography or
journalism I thought it was very
interesting that the there was an
article in The Daily Texan where a woman
who was a journalism major she was
complaining because she said that a
journalism professor told her that her
job is mainly to be a quotation gatherer
well that's apparently what's the was a
news media like because they come up
there and they they take down
word-for-word all the things these
government officials have to say even
when they're lies they don't check them
out see if their lies their statements
are not caught corroborated they just
quote them and put them before you on
the evening news and their little sound
bites but they don't balance this by
getting some of these other people on
that we've been talking about some of
the other progressives or critics from
the American left or progressive point
of view another category is Kissinger
Haig disease it seems that David
Brinkley and Meet the Press faced a
nation hot and Nightline they seem to
have those two Martians we call anyway
there they seem they love the military
and all the bloodshed that they can
cause but they have Kissinger and Haig
on time and time and time again of
course they don't tell you that kissing
has his own business which is involved
in a lot of these activities which
they're talking about on the evening
news
in fact Frank we've given the report
that Mother Jones has about what
Institutes what think tanks in
Washington provide the guest experts for
either Ted Koppel and the public affairs
discussion shows or the PBS shows and
it's almost always the Heritage
Foundation the American Enterprise
Institute or other of these right-wing
organizations and think tanks
occasionally you'll get the Brookings
Institute which is a very moderate
centrist think-tank
giving some of its experts on these
programs but you never have the
Institute for Policy Studies or any of
Nader's think tanks or any of the left
progressive organizations giving their
spokespeople most of whom have academic
credentials who have written books who
have PhDs who are college professors
whereas most of the people that are the
soundbite experts from the American
Enterprise Institute and the Heritage
Foundation have very minimal academic
credentials many of them don't have PhDs
many of them have not published major
books but they're taken as the expert
because they know how to produce the
soundbite the twenty second blurb that
the networks are looking for plus
they're safe if you were the leader of
the country on issues such as Central
America and Israel and you were the one
that was making the decisions how would
you deal with the problem in the Middle
East now if I were the leader of the
country
I wouldn't do anything very much
different from anyone else no matter
what I believe
and the reason is I would be under such
tight constraints from real objective
power that I just wouldn't have any
leeway there's good reasons for but
Salemi instead of going into that I go
into that if you like but instead of
doing that let me answer your first
question what let me take your other way
of formulating what do I think we ought
to do well I think there are some pretty
obvious answers both in the Middle East
and then at least there's a general
framework for obvious answers in the
Middle East and in Central America in
the Middle East there's been a very
broad international consensus on a
political settlement of the arab-israeli
conflict then there has been for many
many years that consensus for example
was expressed in a resolution that came
to the UN Security Council in January
1976 that's 13 years ago it called for a
two-state settlement establishment of a
Palestinian state in the West Bank in
the Gaza Strip a settlement on the
internationally recognized borders
namely the pre June of 1967 borders and
then it just repeated the wording of UN
242 the main UN document with guarantees
for the independence and territorial
integrity and security of every state in
the region and it's right to live in
peace on security within recognized
boundaries and then it went on to
discuss some modalities you know for
achieving this in that's the basic
framework of the international consensus
well that particular resolution was
vetoed by the United States Israel
refused to attend the session the
resolution was initiated by the three
major Arab states Syria Jordan and Egypt
the three confrontation States it was
supported by the PLO in fact it was
openly supported by the PLO according to
the Israeli delegate who's now the
president of Israel it was in fact
prepared by the PLO notice that that is
worth noting this because that means
that already 13 years ago
Arafat had gone exactly as far as he did
in that famous press conference on
December 14th which was alleged by the
media to have changed everything nothing
changed
repeated the same position had been
saying for the last 13 years reasons why
the United States changed its position
but that's different this was supported
by the Soviet Union it was supported by
most of Europe it was supported by most
of the aligned non-aligned countries in
fact virtually by the entire world
that's why the United States had to veto
it alone well that's you could argue
about details but something like that is
a probably the only plausible least
interim settlement if you wanted to
pursue it seriously you'd have to talk
about economic relations of a federal
nature between the two states and all
sorts of other things and modalities to
secure it and so on and so forth but
that general idea has been a very broad
international consensus for years the
United States is alone virtually decide
from Israel and opposing it I mean not
totally alone like it's supposed by
Qaddafi there are rejectionists aside
from the United States part there's
marginal groups around the world like
Khomeini you know the Afghan rebels I
mean a few other groups that oppose it
but primarily it's opposed by the United
States that's why it doesn't get
anywhere now that has disappeared from
history on the assumptions of the
propaganda model that's not part of the
peace process why because the United
States was opposed to it and it's a
logical impossibility that the United
States should be opposed to the peace
process so therefore that's gone from
history when the United when the New
York Times or any scholarly monograph
for that matter reviews the peace
process they don't include this because
this is not part of the peace process
well that's only one example there are
many others and I think that's a general
framework for settlement as far as
Central America is concerned I think
it's pretty obvious what ought to happen
generally speaking I mean the United
States has carried out major crimes in
Central America really major crimes in
the night I mean first of all our whole
history looked Central America's wanted
miserable areas of the world and it's an
area where US influence has been
enormous for a century well at once that
tells you something you know I mean I
have to think very hard to figure out
what that means and it's four reasons
there are reasons for it you look into
the details you can find out reasons for
it even the so-called constructive
programs were actually lethal like take
the alliance for Prague
now most of our of a lot of what
happened in Central America is just
because we impose dictators and
gangsters and terrorists and so on if
they ever try to get independent as in
Guatemala but every once in a while
there's something called a constructive
program the Alliance for Progress is the
famous case well you know the Alliance
for Progress was like a plague part the
worst plague that hit Central America
until the Reagan administration that's
killers in a category by themselves the
Alliance for Progress first of all was a
completely cynical operation I mean the
Alliance for Progress was not instituted
by the Kennedy administration because
they suddenly discovered that there are
poor people in Central America and they
knew that all along it was initiated
because they were afraid that the poor
people in Central America were going to
follow the Cuban model now that means it
began as a purely cynical operation okay
and that showed the Alliance for
Progress was designed to impose on Latin
America altogether in fact an
agro-export model they're supposed to
shift production from subsistence crops
to export for the benefit of us
agribusiness in the American market well
as consequences for example it means
that farmers in Central America are
expected not to produce rice and beans
for them people locally to eat but
asparagus and broccoli and flowers for
yuppie markets in the United States well
for one thing that means not going to
Maine to eat so I got to import food
which they import from us at high costs
which is good for American agriculture
subsidized usually by the American
taxpayer now subsidized by them second
and it also means that and that food is
not going to be equally distributed it's
going to be distributed to the rich
furthermore the production is going to
be by the rich because it takes capital
inputs to produce the fancy fruits for
the American market so there's gonna be
landless peasants furthermore they're
going to produce beef in fact every
latin-american country beef production
moved up rapidly under the Alliance for
Progress while beef consumption reduced
and the reason is that ranchers
moved in often with North American
connections drove peasants off their
land turned it into grazing lands so
they could send beef to North American
markets for hamburgers great for Agri
back for American agribusiness and for
pesticide and fertilizer manufacturers
and for the rich in Central America but
not very good for the people now you
take a look at you look at your favorite
economics book or latin-american studies
book and they'll tell you that the
Alliance for Progress created an
economic miracle well you know from a
certain point of view it did a gross
national product went up all through
Central America
so did malnutrition no and the reason is
obvious you drive people off the land up
in the hills and you take over their
land and you produce beef for export and
fancy crops it's good for the gross
national product just means the people
starve in fact the crisis of the 1980s
is largely caused by that plague well
let's just take the 1980s during the
1980s the Reagan administration is
responsible for roughly 200,000 people
slaughtered and that doesn't mean just
killed you know that means tortured and
mutilated and raped
I mean Pol Pot style torture that's
pretty serious business hundreds of
thousands packed millions of refugees
large areas the country destroyed all of
this in an effort to block social reform
in all three major countries where we
were involved in Honduras and El
Salvador and Nicaragua now that's
serious what should we do well the first
first thing we do is stop torturing them
a second thing we should do is pay
reparations because we own and and after
that maybe there's some hope that they
could reconstruct from the damage we've
done to them I think that's where we
ought to do try to find anybody
suggesting that in the mainstream
however you can't express this view not
because it's false but because it's true
and if you look into it you'll find that
it's true I think now how what should we
do I mean let's go back well we should
do we we are free to act plenty of
things that we can do one thing we can
just provide eight ourselves you don't
the wait
the state to order you to provide aid
they need it badly
I mean Nicaragua was reeling the
hurricane last October was the final
blow they're gonna have mass starvation
there now the government of course is
delighted the US government they won't
send them a penny because they want them
to suffer as much as possible but
American citizens are much more
independent and in fact they've raised a
lot of money for example there's one
small Jesuit center in North Carolina or
Virginia or some worthy quest for peace
it's called the Quixote a center a
little I think they have three staff
members or something they've raised
millions of dollars from people in the
United States who are able to think for
themselves who weren't just slaves of
power and those are things that can be
done you can help people survive then
you can have to all put pressure on on
Congress on the media to do something
about this a lot of ways of doing that
ways all sorts of ways ranging from
civil disobedience to writing letters to
the editor to you know mass popular
organization you know they're not going
to put you in jail for it in that sense
a very free country which means if you
don't do it you have a lot more
responsibility than if you don't do it
in a place where you're afraid that
you're going to be repressed so there's
no shortage of things to do it's just a
matter of willingness to do them and the
willingness to do them begins with a
willingness to recognize reality that's
the hardest part I think once you
recognize reality you won't have any
more questions about what to do because
too obvious so the first thing to do is
to recognize the reality and it takes a
little work but once you recognize it I
think it's obvious what to do another
category in the article in the
progressive is passive phrases glossed
over euphemisms shows how for instance
New York Times said that Salvador
Allende's policies in the 1972-73 era
before the coup in Chile and his
policies caused chaos which brought in
the military kind of obscuring the fact
that as a US government particularly the
CIA and US corporations like AI T & T
which
the chaos in the first place and the
notion of the chaos prompted the
military of the Chilean government to
move in a restore order really was
rather downplays and neutralizes the
American role and also the brutality the
coup in which people later tens of
thousands were jailed tortured
disappeared and just plain killed well
in Turkey Turkey has been an abysmal
record of on civil rights they've
tortured people murdered people
incarcerated trade unionists and it's
it's been horrible in Turkey but the
Washington Post said that they call
these controversial measures and turkeys
military despot pursued a quote
down-to-earth approach as he sought to
deal with the rough and tumble of
everyday politics Ruffin Thompson murder
and torture rough-and-tumble well the
Miami Herald had an article to that they
mentioned this category there was it was
head like chemo phobia may be as bad as
chemicals saying that the people who are
trying to fight the chemicals that are
in our food and in the air are really
bad because being afraid of those good
chemicals is really harmful the woman
who wrote it said that the best
scientific estimates which she didn't
specify say that 99.9% of carcinogens
and the diet come from natural sources
which she didn't identify she said the
synthetic chemicals account for only
0.01 percent of the carcinogens which
the Americans consume none of this none
of this was had any identification or
source for any of these assertions
there's been quite a bit of this talk
about so-called camel phobia really in
yeah this is the corporations are
pushing this big the other thing that
the big polluters are doing who are
producing chemicals and wastes and
different things that are pesticides
that are poison the environment and our
food that are producing these PBS nature
shows for their pedants pen
for their crime and fair in their latest
addition of extra their newsletter has a
list of the biggest chemical polluters
in the world and their crimes and the
penance that is the PBS series that they
fund so be a BASF that's one of Europe's
most energetic toxic dumpers it funds
the PBS program adventure Chevron which
is California's largest petrochemical
polluter funds the PBS program National
Geographic special DuPont the major
chemical polluter the world's largest
producer of ozone eating chemicals
produces discoveries underwater
georgia-pacific
which is a clear-cut timber and paper
mill polluter produces forever wild
about the environment and on and on and
on through the biggest polluters their
crimes and the whole series of PBS
nature programs that they produce that
very rarely talk about pollution and
some of the problems of these
corporations destroying the environment
so this is the way they buy protection
by controlling the PBS programs about
nature and the wilderness and making
sure that their crimes are not
investigated when I graduate I'm going
to be a history teacher history teachers
what do you suggest in high school what
do you suggest I do in that context to
perpetuate well you know that's really
important you know a lot of people I
suspect many of you if you think of your
own experience I know me you can
remember
cases where a teacher really made a
terrific impression on you I mean most
schooling is just trained training for
stupidity and conformity but every once
in a while and that's institutional too
there are reasons for that but
occasionally you know you get a spark
somebody will challenge your mind you
know make you think encourage you to
think and so on that is tremendous
effect you know you just reach all sorts
of people of course if you do it you're
going to be you may very well have
problems you have to tread a narrow line
there are plenty of people who don't
want students to think they don't
they're afraid of the crisis of
democracy you know people start thinking
and you get all these problems I was
quoting at the beginning you know they
want to have humility enough to submit
to a civil rule no all right I'll start
trying to press their demands in the
political arena or they'll you know have
ideas of their own instead of believing
what they're told and privilege and
power typically doesn't want that so
they can react and the high school
teacher who tries to get students to
think may find the repression firing and
so on said a lot about the role of the
media in a so-called down democracy I'm
wondering how you see the role of our
educational system what it's doing right
now what forces are driving it and what
constraints are on it and how should it
operate well I quoted the trilateral
commission view of the educational
system namely it's a system of
indoctrination of the young and I think
that's correct it's a system of
indoctrination of the young that was the
way the liberal elites regarded and
they're more or less accurate so the
educational system is supposed to train
people to be obedient conformist not
think too much which told stay passive
don't cause any crisis a democracy don't
raise any questions and so on that's
basically what the what the system is
about even the fact that the system has
a lot of stupidity in it I think has a
function you know it means that people
are filtered out for obedience if you
can guarantee lots of stupidity in the
educational system you know like stupid
assignments and things like that you
know that the only people who make it
through are people like me and like most
of you I guess who are willing to do it
no matter how stupid it is because we'll
we want to go to the next step you know
so you may know that this assignment is
idiotic and the guy up there couldn't
think his way out of a paper bag but
we'll do it anyway because that's the
way you get to the VIX class and you
want to make it and so on and so forth
well there are people who don't do that
you know there are people who say I'm
not going to do it it's too ridiculous
you know those people are called
behavioral problems or something like
that they end up in the principal's
office or in the streets or selling
drugs or whatever and all of this is a
technique for selection for obedience
and I have I don't have to prove this
but I have a feeling that when you go to
the elite universities you find more
obedience and conformity probably
because you're getting the students who
were better able to do it well all of
that is functional that's the way it
works but it and it works right through
graduate school I mean if you Dierks how
do you get the Graduate School it's
already a little more varied because
some real contradictions develop in the
system the problem is that you can't
have progress this way you know now
especially in the sciences and
engineering that's a problem because the
corporation's need science and
engineering you know if you don't have
innovation you're really in trouble so
they have to encourage creativity and
independence because you can't get
anywhere if you just copy what somebody
told you you have to be challenging
things all the time challenging
everything you know thinking new
thoughts and so on and there you got a
real contradiction it's hard to train
people to be creative and challenging
and so on and yet to ensure that
somewhere else in their lives they're
conformist and obedient and everything
so you have problems that's a serious
problem in Japan's mentally we think of
Japan is this tremendous superpower but
that's very misleading Japan for example
it's very poor in science for example
and they're aware of it and part of the
reason is it's such as part of it it's
part of the same thing that makes them
good workers obedient workers it's a
very obedient society very differential
and conformist Society and one effect of
that is that you know there are real
constraints against independent frees
and thinking and you see it in the
sciences very clearly the but it's a
problem here too so there are those
contradictions when you get to graduate
school
beginning to show up they show up much
less in the ideological subjects because
there it doesn't matter so much if
people have you know there isn't the
profits aren't made by historians having
original ideas about the French
Revolution so they can have conventional
ideas and that means that the the
pressure to try to support innovation
and freedom is much less and the
profession the pressures for conformity
on the other hand are much greater
because in the ideological subjects it
begins to be dangerous if people think
the wrong thoughts it's not so dangerous
if they have new ideas about physics
so you but nevertheless you know you
begin to get a little flux in the system
by the time you get to graduate school
and even at lower levels you find it I
mean there's you know there are teachers
who do stimulate thought and sometimes
they get away with it and all the way
through you know if people are learning
things you just you just can't control
you can't make them just regurgitate
what they heard now there's a lot of
pressure to turn the schools into the
Marine Corps and there's a lot of
support for it for example there's this
bestseller last couple of years by Allan
bloom that was all over the
supermarket's
closing of the American mind yeah
whichever you know huge bestseller
supermarket racks which is where I read
it and things like that well you take a
look at what he's saying and it was
plenty you know a lot of enthusiastic
accolades for it and so on he was saying
that a couple of smart guys will decide
what the great thoughts are and every
student will memorize them and that's
education okay well you know I mean
that's a way to turn people into pure
automata I mean even if they happen to
pick the great thoughts there is no way
less likely to get anybody to think
about those thoughts than to make that
the curriculum that finishes them off no
but and I think that's the purpose
really I mean the purpose is just to
impose Authority you know here's the
great thoughts all this other stuff is
rubbish just learn those in your okay
I'll pick them you memorize them that's
basically the line now of course that's
that's the opposite of Education that's
the way you study
Talmud or something like that but it's
very popular and I think it reflects the
same concern over the crisis of
democracy that gellan was it bloom
himself was extremely the incident that
really got to him was a case in Cornell
where he was a professor where some
black students took over one of the
administer one of the buildings and he
was he said that's just like the knots
you know back to the Nazis his old
business about the Nazis and so on and
so forth well you take a look at what
happened and that isn't tell you what he
thought the and he says the faculty
capitulated you know just like Heidegger
capitulated to the Nazis and so on what
actually happened if he look back is
that there were real grievances
undoubtedly the students shouldn't have
done what they did go into the building
with guns and so on but it was settled
very amicably it was settled amicably
nobody was killed the grievances were to
some extent dealt with and the net
result was better than it was before
well he didn't tell you what he thought
they should have done but it's sort of
implicit I mean I guess they should have
bombed the place or something like that
but that's what really set him off and
in general what set many people off was
the you know the the 60s are now
described in the literature as if it was
a time when students were running around
burning libraries and you know
destroying the foundations of
civilization and so on what was actually
going on is they were asking questions
you know they were raising questions
they were looking into things people had
looked into before they were not just
obediently and from the point of view of
a lot of faculty that's equivalent to
burning the buildings they can't even
that small distinction you can't make
that and this pressure to turn the
schools back to the days when you didn't
have to worry about those things like
disobedient students asking questions
about things that you didn't tell them
to think about and so on the last
category of media con game article in
the progressive by martin lee and norman
solomon is the numbers racket if any of
you have been in demonstrations of
seeing this before where the media will
say only if it's somebody they don't
like then well it'll just be a small
number and the cops will always
underestimate what the organizers and
and other people who participated in
particular thing they really happen for
instance there was a story in New York
Times at 15,000 Jews and Palestinians
join Jerusalem peace rally people who
saw the peace rally and who were there
said there had be at least 35,000 the
organization peace now said this also
another way they distort the during the
mid-80s the State Department always kept
saying and the the media always just do
DeFelice
repeated their quotes that they're
between 2500 and 3500 Cubans in
Nicaragua as military personnel and they
eventually up that up to 30 30 500 to
5,000 Cubans in Nicaragua well when
Rafael del pino Diaz defected to the
United States in 1987 he said now there
are only been 300 to 400 Cubans in
Nicaragua and that was the neighborhood
tsukuba pne's and the Nicaraguans have
been saying all along a more significant
way of media distortion in this numbers
racket category that's when they start
talking about unemployment because the
Bureau of Labor Statistics releases
these figures which you hear repeatedly
all the time on the news but they really
hide the true extent of unemployment for
instance not counted are people without
jobs who haven't looked for a job in
over a month
because the prospects are discouraging
and they're also they don't count in it
people who retire early they don't they
count in the people as being employed
who only worked one day a week you can't
hire them on that but nonetheless that
counts as somebody who's employed but
the Bureau of Labor Statistics actually
puts out another report called the u7
rate which factors in all these other
things we just mentioned the discourage
employment the early retirees so it's a
much much considerably greater more
accurate figure than the one you get on
regular media so in 1986 when the media
reported the average national
unemployment rate was 6.2 percent the u7
rate which the journalist signal
was 14.3%
and that was much more accurate but of
course that would have everybody all up
in the air and excited they don't want
to do that in this country got to keep
the people cool so what's the worth of
all the news you get from the media
particularly on television British
journalist named edy Harriman says
despite the wonders of communications
technology the news often seems little
more than folklore a steady stream and
nursery tales for adults and that's the
end of this alternative views I'd like
to thank Laurie Lachlan Melissa Crowley
and Michael Ferris for their editing
assistance of this program also Paula
Kowski and Jim Dickerson who provided
the tape with a speech of noam chomsky
from Eau Claire Wisconsin
