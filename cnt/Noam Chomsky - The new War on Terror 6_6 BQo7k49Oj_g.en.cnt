brought the trial and sentenced in Haiti
and they're asking the United States to
turn him over well I mean do your own
research see how much discussion there's
been of that actually Haiti renewed the
request a couple of weeks ago wasn't
even mentioned why should we turn over a
convicted killer who was responsible for
killing four or five thousand people a
couple of years ago in fact if we do
turn him over who knows what i'd say
maybe he'll say that he was being funded
by and helped by the CIA which is
probably true we don't want to open that
door and he's not the only one I mean
for the last about 15 years Costa Rica
which is the Democratic prize has been
trying to get the United States to hand
over a John Howe a lengthy and us
landowner in Costa Rica who they charged
with terrorist crimes he was using his
land they claim with good evidence as a
base for the US war against Nicaragua
which is not a controversial conclusion
remember there's the World Court in the
Security Council behind it so they've
been trying to get the United States
hand him over here about that one no
they did actually confiscate the land of
another American landholder John
Hamilton paid compensation offered
compensation the u.s. refused turned his
land over to a national park because his
land was also being used as a base for
the US attack against Nicaragua Costa
Rica was punished for that one they were
punished for by withholding aid we don't
accept that kind of insubordination from
allies and we can go on if you open the
door to questions about extradition it
leads in very unpleasant directions so
that can't be done well what about the
reactions in Afghanistan at the initial
proposal the initial rhetoric was for a
massive assault which would kill many
people visibly and also an attack on
other countries of the region well the
Bush administration wisely backed off
from that they were being told by every
foreign leader
so everyone else every specialist I
suppose their own intelligence agencies
that would be the stupidest thing they
could possibly do it would simply be
like opening recruiting offices for bin
Laden all over the region that's exactly
what he wants and I wouldn't extremely
harmful to their own interest so they
backed off that one and they're turning
to what I described earlier which is a
kind of silent genocide it's a hit well
I already said what I think about it and
I don't think anything has to be said
you can figure it out if you do the
arithmetic and is a sensible proposal
which is kind of on the verge of being
considered but it's been sensible all
along and as being asked called for by
expatriate Afghans and allegedly tribal
leaders internally is for un initiative
which would keep the Russians and the
Americans out of it totally these are
the two countries that have practically
wiped the country out in the last 20
years they should be out of it they
should provide massive reparations but
that's their only role a un initiative
to bring together elements within
Afghanistan that would try to construct
something from the wreckage it's
conceivable that that could work with
plenty of support and no interference if
the u.s. insists on running it might as
well quit we have a historical record on
that one you'll notice that the the name
of this operation remember at first it
was going to be a crusade they backed
off that because PR agents told him that
wouldn't work and then it was going to
be infinite justice but the PR agent
said wait a minute you're sounding like
your divinity so that wouldn't work and
then it was changed to enduring freedom
we know what that means but nobody has
yet pointed out fortunately that there's
an ambiguity there to endure means to
suffer
and there are plenty of other people
around the world who have endured what
we call freedom again fortunately we
have a very well-behaved educated class
so nobody has yet pointed out this
ambiguity and but if it's done there'll
be another problem to deal with but if
we can back off enough so that some more
or less independent agency maybe the UN
may be credible NGOs can take the lead
and trying to reconstruct something from
the wreckage with plenty of assistance
and we owe it through them then maybe
something would come out beyond that
there are other problems we certainly
want to reduce the level of terror
certainly not escalated there's one easy
way to do that and therefore it's never
discussed namely stop participating in
that would automatically reduce the
level of terror enormously but that you
can't discuss well we ought to make it
possible to discuss it so that's one
easy way to reduce the lever of a level
of terror beyond that we should rethink
the kinds of policies and Afghanistan is
not the only one in which we organize
and train terrorist armies that has a
fact we're seeing some of the effects
now September 11th is one rethink it
rethink the policies that are creating a
reservoir of support exactly what the
bankers and lawyers and so on are saying
in places like Saudi Arabia and on the
streets it's much more bitter as you can
imagine that's possible you know those
policies aren't graven in stone and
furthermore there are opportunities it's
hard to find many rays of light in the
last couple of weeks but one of them is
that there is an increased openness lots
of issues are open for discussion even
in a leet circles certainly among the
general public that were not a couple of
weeks ago that's dramatically the case I
mean if a newspaper likes a USA Today
can run a very good article serious
article on life in the Gaza Strip
there's been a change
the things I mentioned in The Wall
Street Journal that's change and among
the general public I think there's much
more openness and willingness to think
about things that were under the rug and
so on these are opportunities and they
should be used at least by people who
accept the goal of trying to reduce the
level of violence and terror including
potential threats that are extremely
severe and could make even September
11th pale into insignificance
