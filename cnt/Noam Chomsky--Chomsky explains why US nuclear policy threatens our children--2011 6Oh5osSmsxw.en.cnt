we have before us tonight a unique human
being absolutely unique and I'm totally
privileged as I said at the start to be
even honored to be able to say a few
words in his presence I'm so totally
honored about that fact a person of
integrity of soundness of judgment who
has been able to put before his own
country and the world criticism about
their deceitful ways of behaving and
dealing with other nation states or with
other peoples and what a marvelous thing
as human beings we have a fellow human
being amongst us capable of that courage
that integrity and that passion to
ensure that there is a voice for the
voiceless a voice for the downtrodden a
voice for those who are the subject of
the powerful and privileged because they
have power make and therefore rule upon
us and I am so privileged and so pleased
that the Sydney committee for the Peace
Prize have selected one of the most
worthy recipients of this particular
award and can I just say I feel humbled
to have been considered in any way to be
the recipient in the previous years and
to be in the presence of professor
Chomsky who has done far more for the
over for the quality of humanity and for
human beings to find themselves in a way
that is far more based on truth and on
justice and on integrity and about
equality at its highest levels and not
to give credence to the hollowness of
those words when they are espoused by
powerful and particularly influential
nation states in their relationships to
others so can I please express my thanks
to the City of Sydney Peace Prize
Committee to professor Chomsky for
accepting this enhances us as
Australians and let's move forward from
this in a way that we can rectify our
own backyard thank you very much
thank you well it's unnecessary to say
how to save much about how grateful I am
for the honor and the wonderful
atmosphere and how gratifying it is to
join a group of people who I greatly
admire and respect some of whom former
recipients are close personal friends
for many years on an occasion like this
this is phrase that resonates and my
mind often does in fact that's a
declaration that was issued by Bertrand
Russell and albert einstein in 1955 it
was a call to the people of the world a
plea actually to face a question that's
as they put it stark and desperate and
inescapable either mankind will put an
end to war or we will put an end to the
human race and that's they were thinking
of course with nuclear war primarily and
since that time we have come very close
to a virtually terminal nuclear war a
number of times
the danger continues in fact it right
today it's very much alive the area of
primary concern now is west and south
asia that region and in fact if you've
been happen to have been reading the
papers carefully for the last few days
you'll notice that there have been
exercises in the eastern Mediterranean
either actually intended or
psychological warfare aimed at bombing
of Iran Israeli actions there's been a
rash of newspaper articles in newspaper
reports in the Israeli press about an
apparent decision of the government to
proceed with bombing Iran's nuclear a
nuclear site very strikingly there's
been a long series that for some months
now of declaration statements by the
former high security officials in Israel
heads of Mossad and so on people that
rarely say anything
speaking very strongly denouncing the
plan saying they'll be disastrous and
horrible effects they wouldn't be coming
out publicly unless they had some
information that these are plans are
actually in the works it's worth
remembering that Israel did strike a
nuclear reactor once before post-rock
reactor in Iraq and though it's not too
well known there was credible
information right away and it is it's
been confirmed even by US intelligence
that that bombing attack actually
initiated some Hussein's nuclear weapons
program the reactor it appears was only
capable of producing low grade uranium
for energy purposes but after the attack
secret nuclear power and nuclear weapons
program was initiated and we know where
that led to and it's conceivable that
that could happen again along with other
very threatening and dangerous
consequences that could follow from an
attack of that sort we'll know very soon
whether it's whether it's happened but
it's too close for comfort there are
things that can be done about these
problems I shouldn't say that for
several years now us
have been arguing that the most
dangerous problem in the world the
security problem is Iran's possible
development of nuclear weapons and it's
it's interesting to see why they think
it's such a danger the questions rarely
asked but there is an authoritative
answer to it the authoritative answer
comes from the highest sources namely
the the Pentagon and US intelligence
they give annual reports to Congress on
the global security situation and
they've of course discussed this
repeatedly and they do agree that the
Iranian potential for nuclear weapons
whether they're doing it or not they
don't know is extreme and extreme danger
and the reason they say is because it's
going to be part of Iran's deterrence
strategy they have a detailed analysis
of the Iranian military they argue that
it's very small it's even expenses are
very low even by the standards of the
region and it's aimed specifically for
defense that's its goal is to deter an
invasion long enough for diplomacy to
set in and they add that if Iran is
developing nuclear weapons that would be
part of their deterrence strategy so why
is a deterrent strategy such a threat
well very simple a deterrence strategy
can deter
it can prevent the United States and its
allies from free unconstrained military
action in the region because we'll be a
deterrent and that's a threat if you of
course intend to carry out military
action military attacks at will and
that's the threat and we should
recognize that our own countries are
interpret that the possibility of a
deterrent as a very serious threat it
tells us a lot about ourselves and about
the potential for there are very
dangerous consequence as many of which
some of which are in process right now
others can come is there a way to deal
with these problems well there's this
kind of a narrow way which has an
enormous international support and that
is to move towards the developing a
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle
East now there are several such
initiatives around the world Africa
Pacific Islands other places they have
not really been implemented and it's
important to know why so take the
African nuclear weapons free zone
there's one impediment to its being
implemented and that's because Britain
in the United States insist that an
African island diego garcia which was a
former british dependency be available
for nuclear weapons storage
nuclear submarines and so on they use it
as one of the main basis for the bombing
and Central Asia Obama has recently
built it up to extend that it so it can
it has facilities for nuclear submarines
that mint submarines with nuclear-tipped
missiles well as long as that is going
on the African nuclear-free zone can't
really be implemented and the same is
true in the Pacific area the Pacific
nuclear free zone was held up at first
by France which wanted to use its
specific dependencies for nuclear
weapons testing I think that was about
20 years they finally finished their
tests but now it's being held up by the
United States and its British Ally and
maybe Australia's in 12 which want to
use in effect are using the Pacific
dependencies for a transit of
nuclear-armed naval vessels that in fact
sustaining a nuclear weapons bases there
well what about the Middle East the most
dangerous one there's an impediment
there to support for a Middle East a
nuclear free zone is so broad that the
United States has been compelled to
formally agree to it at the there's a
every five years there's a
non-proliferation treaty review meeting
last one was New York and overwhelming
support for moving in this direction and
the Obama administration Hillary Clinton
was the spokesperson agreed that yes
it's a very good idea but with a
qualification several qualifications is
good idea but not now and furthermore
there's a condition
any nuclear weapons-free zone will have
to exclude Israel and in fact exclude
any requirement that other states
provide information about anything
they're doing to support Israeli nuclear
weapons well okay that fuels that idea
so yes now we have this tremendous
danger danger of a deterrent to our
actions and it may move on to a
devastating war with all kind of
horrible consequences well there are
other ways more far-reaching ways to
deal with the problem generally friend
of mine I've actually forgotten who
Australian friend may be here a couple
of a while back sent me a book of
collection of Australian writings
writers short essays on nuclear weapons
it was in 1986 the international year of
peace and there was a comment but there
was an Aboriginal poet hadn't a comment
which is so eloquent that I don't want
to paraphrase it so if I can find it
i'll actually read it leading people in
it the comment was this
there will come a time when our mother
whom the invaders so ruthlessly raped by
cutting down her trees by slaughtering
her creatures and mining her minerals
will retaliate are we so imputed as to
expect that we can survive her backlash
I speak long before the white man came
to this land he the dangers of which I
speak long before the white man came to
this land in the northern territory
there's a green ant dreaming it is a
legend about what will happen if the
yellow metal uranium is taken from the
ground the giant ant will grow and will
devour the living Earth and that's
what's happening that's the point of the
comment and that's in fact what's
happening and one way to stop the
proliferation of nuclear weapons is
simply to prevent the materials from
reaching the developers and the fact
that it will develop the devour the
living Earth is all too dangerous all
too threatening that's with Russell and
Einstein were warning about well these
comments open up the contemplation of a
different thread which actually wasn't
evident at the time that Russell and
Einstein were issuing their warning but
is very evident today
I learned about it myself about 40 years
ago when two personal friends well known
earth scientists actually the chairs of
the Harvard MIT earth sciences
department began to talk about recent
discoveries that were emerging about we
know no Eva's no I was local warming
those were the first indications that
there's a serious problem coming by now
it's a very serious problem that
recognized to be the International
Energy Association just last couple of
months ago issued its latest report
annual report they conclude that
determined that the last year the
preceding year the greenhouse gas
emissions had reached a record high
which is pretty striking because it was
a year of recession and a manufacturing
decline and they furthermore
a warrant that the extent of the global
warming was coming very close to
reaching what the main scientific
consensus regards as a kind of a tipping
point that point beyond which it's
irreversible 2 degrees centigrade
warming they said that's coming close
and if we reach that point they don't
put it this way but mother earth will be
at mother our mother will be devouring
the liver of living earth mother nature
will be devouring the living Earth we
can kiss each other goodbye there won't
be a possibility of a decent human
existence well they're things that can
be done about that now and there isn't a
lot of time the waste and things are
being done most countries are doing at
least something taking at least halting
steps towards addressing the problem
unfortunately that's not true of the
countries where it matters most the
country where it matters most is of
course the United States richest most
powerful country in history and it not
only is not taking halting steps it's
taking steps backwards the Republican
Congress now is dismantling programs
instituted under Richard Nixon that's an
indication of what's happened in the
past roughly 40 years there now
dismantling programs under Nixon who is
in fact the last liberal president if
you actually look at the programs
and that's drawing backwards the pulling
backwards the efforts to do something or
other about global warming there are
much more positive directions they are
in fact coming mostly from the
indigenous communities the in Ecuador
for example with a substantial
indigenous community there's there are
protests serious protest the
government's kind of torn by them at the
moment the indigenous population is
calling for an end to mining for oil
which is substantial that is huge oil
exploration with enormous environmental
disaster associated with apparently much
worse than the Gulf of Mexico disaster
recently actually in the Nigerian Delta
there's no doubt that the pollution and
destruction is far greater than the Gulf
of Mexico but these are poor people
people of color so doesn't matter what
happens to the note e pays attention
unlike the Gulf of Mexico however the
Native communities have are demanding
that
all of this stop they don't see any
justification for destroying their lives
their culture their societies so that
people can sit in traffic jams in New
York and their SUVs too they argue
that's not a fair exchange in the most
striking case is actually Bolivia where
the indigenous population is a majority
and have in the past ten years entered
the political arena successfully elected
someone from their own ranks as a poor
peasant as president and have been
carrying that in fact taking the
international lead now in taking steps
towards doing something about global
warming that's the poorest country in
South America and it's kind of its kind
of striking that the poorest country in
South America is taking the
international lead on this program and
the richest country not only in the
western hemisphere but anywhere in the
world and in fact in history is not only
not contributing but is drawing back
eliminating efforts to deal with it
recently one of the recent efforts in
Bolivia was legislation granting rights
to nature so in addition to human rights
there are now rights to nature nature
has rights and we have to observe them
well you know sophisticated Westerners
can mock this ridiculous idea
but the fact of the matter is that
unless we are able to gain some of the
sensibility of the indigenous
populations this is worldwide the last
laugh is almost certainly going to be on
us
