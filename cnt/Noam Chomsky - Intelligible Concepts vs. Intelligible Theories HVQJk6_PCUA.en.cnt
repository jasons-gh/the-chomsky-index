what are the things that you put in the
category that you think basically as far
as we can tell we don't really know how
to move forward
let's take problems that have been
raised for thousands of years where were
in exactly the same spot as we were
thousands of years ago so every one of
us is convinced with good reason that we
can make choices like I can choose to
pick this up and throw it out the window
or I can choose not to we all know we
can do that it is it doesn't fall within
the range of the sciences as we
understand them which are based on
principles of determinacy and randomness
that much was understood in the 17th
century that you can have determinacy
and you can have randomness is there
anything else
well the my ability what's called
freedom of the will my ability to choose
and decide yes that false what appears
to fall without it now there's a huge
amount of literature arguing that this
is an illusion right we don't really
have this but this is something very odd
about that literature as in fact was
pointed out by William James once
everyone who presents that argument
believes that they are giving reasons to
other people to convince them that they
don't have freedom of will but that
means they're proposing for your moogle
I think we all accept it that's why the
descartes had what today up till today
stands as maybe the best statement about
this he says it's observed to disavow
Bandhan what we know to be true just
because of there's reason to believe
that we will never understand that his
reason to believe we don't have to
accept that is it's divine it's in the
area of the divine but we can
reinterpret that as saying it might be
beyond our the range of our cognitive
capacities you can't prove him maybe
somebody will invent something beyond
around them
derman see that'll accommodate freedom
of the will but as I say for a couple of
thousand years we've been waiting with
zero progress so there are areas of
human thought that do you think we've
just basically threading water are stuck
in place or finding different ways of
saying the same things and take
classical examples one classical example
in fact though is what I mentioned
Newton and Hume
if you look at modern science from
Galileo through the Beyond it was based
on a conception of the natural world the
conception that the National world is a
machine gears levers things pushing each
other things very much like the highly
complex and intricate artifacts that
were all over Europe at the time so the
world should be of just a more complex
one of those it's called the mechanical
philosophy when Newton came he was a
firm believer and when he he discovered
that it simply doesn't work that if you
look at attraction and repulsion they
require they take place without contact
and he regarded that as such an
absurdity his word that no one with any
scientific intelligence could ever
accept it and the great scientists of
his day agreed
Leibniz christiaan huygens others said
yes of course it's a total absurdity
you're just bringing in all cold forces
well what happened to that idea
notice that Newton's theories were
perfectly intelligible it was the world
that they were describing that wasn't it
did not the criterion of intelligibility
was you can construct a mechanical model
for him David Hume argued that Newton he
in his history of England he writes that
Newton's maybe the greatest genius who
ever lived he uncovered unrevealed and
explained many of the mysteries of
nature but he left other mysteries which
he showed we
we'll never comprehend namely these
alright now let's take a look what
happened later science basically lowered
its aims it does not aim to give an
intelligible concept of the world it
aims to give intelligible theories of
the world like Newton but that leaves a
gap now there are several ways of
reacting to this we could say Newton
Hume live nuts and so on was pretty
stupid we're smarter so we realized this
is nonsense
the other possibilities to say that
we've discovered something since that
they didn't know well the second one is
false the first one is certainly fools
now physicists often delude themselves
about this by pointing out that if you
take say general relativity and you
think of curved space-time and geodesics
and so on there's no action of distance
so therefore we've overcome the problem
but we've only made the problem deeper
because curved space-time is even more
remote from some of the mechanical
philosophy than action of distances so I
think we were left with this gap we do
not aim for intelligibility of the world
now if you look there's a research topic
here which could be pursued I think you
could probably show that the model of
intelligibility that Galileo the others
developed as soon as they kind of
escaped from the bounds of neo
scholastic philosophy it is probably our
ordinary cognitive limits about how we
conceive of the world that's an
experiment topic could be researched
that will turn out to be true well what
that will tell us is that our intuitive
innate instinctive concepts of
intelligibility simply don't work for
the world the best we can do is to lower
our sights try to find theories that
will understand that we'll somehow deal
with the unintelligible world
well that's miss as you
pointed out a mystery that we cannot
solve
