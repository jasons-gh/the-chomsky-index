well uh i live at georgia and there's a
lot of people i've talked to who are
ultra right-wing you know ron paul
libertarians is there any way for love
they mean they're they're extremely
cynical is there any way to reach out on
the left is there any way to reach out
and talk to them about trying to bring
them over to the left well i think what
you have to do is ask what makes them
wrongful libertarians and I you know I
happen to think that that makes a lot of
sense but nevertheless underlying it our
feelings of do make sense I'm in the
feeling for example that the government
is our enemy well that's it's a very
widespread feeling in fact that's been
induced by propaganda as well so present
it will be April fifteenth and the
people in your neighborhood are going to
have to send in their income taxes the
way they're going to look at it and
we've been trained to look at it is that
there's some alien force like maybe from
Mars which is stealing our hard-earned
money from us finally the government
okay well that would be true in a
totalitarian state but if you had a
Democratic Society you'd look at it the
other way around is a great at April
fifteenth we're all going to contribute
to implement the plans that we jointly
decided on for the benefit of all of us
but that idea is even more frightening
than Social Security it's means that we
would have a functioning democracy and
no setor concentrated powers that we're
going to want that for perfectly obvious
reasons so yes there's major effort
sounds pretty successful efforts to get
people to fear the government as their
enemy not to regard it as the an int is
just the collective population
in terms of common goals that we've
decided on which would you would have
what happened in democracy and is to an
extent what does happen in functioning
democracies like Bolivia poor country in
South America that's kind of what's
happening they are more or less but in
very remote from here so well i think
you know ron paul supporters can be
appealed to him on these grounds they're
also against a military intervention and
we can ask okay why no i mean is it just
for their own security or they want to
be Richard or something will I doubt it
i think people are concerned that
destroyed iraq and so on so if there are
lots of grounds for for fighting there
are lots of common grounds that can be
explored even if the outcomes at the
moment look very different they look
different because they're framed within
fixed doctrines but those doctrines are
not graven in stone they can be on her
own I hope Kathy
the pleasure yeah
