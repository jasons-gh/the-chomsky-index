there are basically three major power
systems roughly speaking North America
Europe and North East Asia now joined to
India and South Asia and to Southeast
Asia there are lots of integration among
them they're not distinct but they are
identifiable power centers separate from
them are the major oil producers which
have no power but have a lot of
financial resources Europe and the
United States are roughly comparable in
every dimension except the military
force the United States its military
spending now exceeds substantially that
of the rest of the world combined and
nothing is even close the Northeast Asia
is probably the most dynamic economic
region in the world china-based Japan
North South Korea it's has amassed
enormous financial resources in fact
it's Japan China and the stomach set the
oil producers have been sustaining the
US economy how long they'll do it is
unclear the primary regions of this
plenty of violence all over the world
with the most extreme regions are the
Middle East region mainly because that's
the major energy these are the major
sources of energy for the world US
invasion of Iraq is the central part of
it but not the only one it's and it's a
very volatile area there could be a
confrontation between the u.s. and Iran
US attack on Iran which one well-known
British military historian curly Barnett
I said that would be World War three
many could be right the there are other
tendencies developing South America as
you mentioned is thank you for the first
time in its history since the Spanish
invasion is making significant moves
towards integration the society has been
very countries who are separate from one
another they've been ruled by tiny
wealthy mostly Europeanized elites
related to the imperial societies not to
one another and they're moving towards a
degree of integration hence independence
and they're also beginning slowly to
tackle some of their immense internal
problems there's a huge in equality in
fact some of the most exciting
Democratic experiments maybe the most
exciting are taking place right there
especially in Bolivia where the majority
of the population the indigenous
majority has for the first time entered
the political arena in a serious way
elected their own candidate from their
own ranks it's leading to a possible
threat of secession by the white
Europeanized a leak which is always run
the country and has most of the
resources there's plenty of sources of
conflict there but important develop
many wisdom in many ways the most
exciting area of the world I think
there's the bank of the south which is
broadly supported could be an
alternative development fund just as the
asian development bank could be there's
what happens in China and India will be
no doubt of enormous significance there
they do have a high growth rates a a lot
of people have been taken out of poverty
it should be recalled that they've
succeeded in doing this largely by
violating the
rules of the rules of the game that are
that the Western powers have attempted
to establish that's no surprise to
economic historians because that's the
way the developed countries got rich
themselves but they're now significant
players on the world scene particularly
China however within extraordinary
internal problems hundreds of millions
of people either destitute or in serious
serious economic problems enormous
ecological problems India which has has
developed significantly in the last
actually starting in the 1980s but
particularly in the last 15 years still
ranks that I think about 125th or so in
the United Nations of Human Development
Index seen of enormous poverty and
destitution but so they have tremendous
internal problems to deal with there nor
near the level of the rich developed
Western European and North American
countries but shifting power in the
world seemed doubtless these are some of
the China happens to be the center of a
developing strategic system the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization which based in
China includes Russia with its quite
enormous energy resources and other
resources India and Pakistan and Iran
are associated they're admitted
observers the Central Asian states are
part of it the United States has sought
observer status but in rejected the
organization has called on the u.s. to
leave the the region central asian other
regions and this is a slowly emerging
power block that some regard is attached
counterpart the NATO with substantial
internal resources Russian particularly
but if it ran joins in even more and
reaching out towards the even toward
Saudi Arabia which is the jewel in the
crown as far as energy resources are
concerned doubtless a source of enormous
concern to the United States which is
trying pretty desperately to set up a
Sunni counter force and the somehow
control Iraq which is turned to a total
catastrophe the these are some not all
of the major live issues on the global
global scene
