I struggled about how best to introduce
noam chomsky and got the answer earlier
this afternoon in the form of an email
it is from Jan Fabian dull bomb is he
here tonight somewhere probably in the
audience this is what it says hello I
would so much like to see professor
Chomsky give a talk once in my life I am
from Germany and came all the way from
Mexico where I studied politics - boss I
came from Germany from Mexico where I
study politics to Boston to see him give
a talk I only had three more days in the
area then I would fly out and not come
back for a long time I think and hope
that I will be allowed to attend to talk
tonight in Portland his secretary just
printed out for me the information about
the talk and gave me your email address
can I please come and attend the talk I
will now go to the main to the train
station and buy a ticket because it's so
important for me I hope I will be let in
thanks a lot and sorry for the
inconvenience and the strange email by
Jan Fabian dole bomb Jan I'm not I'm not
sure if you're here tonight and all who
made tonight
here's non-pom scheme
thank you well the the title for tonight
is very well chosen very topical each of
the two tendencies in the title is of
historical significance
each is also a work in progress
complex outcomes are highly uncertain
sure to be of considerable significance
for the future and they interact in in
many ways one way in which they interact
was illustrated dramatically earlier
this year right in the middle of the
huge demonstrations in Madison Wisconsin
protesting the effort of the government
of the governor to essentially destroy
the public service unions they received
last March they the demonstrators in
Madison occupying the Statehouse tens of
thousands in the streets received a
message from Kemal Abbas as a labor
activist and in Egypt he was expressing
he was conveying the Solidarity of
Egyptian workers in Tahrir Square to the
people in Madison fighting the same
battle the Arab Spring of course also
inspired the quite remarkable Occupy
movements that began in wall street
have now spread literally thousands of
places in the United States the
trajectories in Egypt and the United
States are intersecting but moving in
opposite directions so the Arab Spring
is an effort to gain rights that had
been denied by the brutal western-backed
dictatorships in the United States the
projector is in a different direction
it's an effort to protect rights that
had been won and long and hard struggles
and are now being dismantled and
destroyed there's another point of
contact which is significant in both
cases Egypt all of the Middle East North
Africa
Maina region sometimes called in both
the United States and the main our
region the up the uprisings are a
reaction to vigorous assault against the
population that's been going on for 30
years worldwide it's under the
neoliberal banner sometimes called the
Washington Consensus sometimes it's
called the IMF World Bank World Trade
Organization unholy trinity sometimes
called the World Bank IMF treasury
complex all approximately the same thing
and it's had similar results everywhere
the rails have been harsher for the
populations where the rules have been
more rigorously applied Latin America
and sub-saharan Africa or this of
striking cases I'll just keep to Egypt
in the u.s. Tahrir Square is not
Zuccotti Park but the uprisings share
many of the same roots
in Egypt as is standard Mubarak's
neoliberal programs since the early 80s
have created vast wealth in very small
sectors and have engendered a huge
corruption while severely harming the
large majority of the population as
inequality soared all of this not
surprisingly been accompanied by
increasingly brutal repression of
workers and others who sought elementary
rights virtually up to the moment of the
outburst of the Arab Spring
the World Bank in the IMF were issuing
glowing reports on the remarkable
achievements of Egypt's economic and
political managers that's again a
routine practice right before the
edifice collapses as it regularly does
now all of that should be quite familiar
here fed fat Federal Reserve chair Alan
Greenspan who was known as st. Alan
during his glory days he was hailed as
one of the greatest economists of all
time as he presided over what was
claimed to be a miraculous economy in
which all fundamental problems had been
resolved thanks to the triumph of the
market and also as he proudly explained
the Congress thanks to what he called
growing worker insecurity which reduces
pressures for compensation and decent
working conditions which are plainly
Worthing worthy features of a decent
economy and society meanwhile wealth
concentrated in the pockets of a small
fraction of 1% of the population a
section so small that the census doesn't
even pick it up
- details sophisticated statistical
analysis to identify them roughly a
tenth of a percent of the population it
counts for a substantial part of the
enormous inequality in the United States
and while that was happening for the
majority for the past generation real
incomes of largely stagnated declined
for african-americans wealth is now
practically zero after the collapse of
the housing bubble people have tried to
get by through increased working hours
by now well beyond other industrial
countries by debt which is of course
unsustainable and by asset inflation
it's temporary paper wealth that
disappears with the collapse of the
bubbles this has been a regular feature
of the economy ever since the early
Reagan years through the neoliberal
years as the New Deal regulatory
apparatus collapsed under bipartisan
assault there were no financial crises
until the early 80s after the Second
World War the and the economy shifted
dramatically from the 1970s to
financialization and offshoring of
production well the basic facts I think
are probably too familiar to review in
the United States the first major
popular reaction to this era of what
should be called vicious class war first
major reaction is the Occupy movement
that began in New York and have now
spread to much of the country
inspired by the dramatic developments in
Egypt and other parts of Mena well not
surprisingly all are facing repression
its of
four kinds of course and so the
character of the society but the general
tendencies are strikingly similar just
as the global assault of the past
generation has been similar in many of
its fundamental aspects in Menna the
outcomes are highly varied and quite
uncertain the major successes so far
have been in Tunisia and Egypt and
there's a reason for that
Joel Beynon who's the leading American
scholar of our labor movements as
pointed out that the successes of the
Arab Spring are closely correlated to
the existence of a militant labor
movement in the case of Egypt militant
labor activism has gone on for many
years
usually beaten back by the dictatorship
gaining some successes the April 6th
movement that sparked the this is kind
of tech-savvy young professionals of you
know about and sparked the February
occupation in Tahrir Square and the huge
movement that followed from it there
called the April 6 movement for a reason
they formed on April 6th 2008 at the
time of a major set of labor actions at
the mahalo textile conglomerate one of
the biggest industrial conglomerates in
Egypt elsewhere in the country popular
demonstrations planned it was mostly
crushed by the dictatorship but survived
have been the April 6 movement remains
and has continued and did initiate the
current Arab Spring in Egypt the suez
when the labor movement joined in as it
shortly did it really became a mass
movement inches well it got rid of the
dictator the reigning system is still in
place the military still rules pretty
harshly about 12,000 people have been
sentenced in military courts that's
actually more than through the entire
period of the Mubarak dictatorship and
plenty of harsh conflict is going on but
the struggle continues there have been
real victories that one major victory
has been for the freedom of speech press
is much freer than it was before the
dictatorship crumbled this month there's
a lot of open discussion debate the
labor movement has continued to be
active independent labor movements have
been formed for the first time and its
strikes continue the crucial issues and
the situation is very much in flux
we don't know where it'll go well they
sharp at contrast to this in the United
States the labor movement has been
declining under the same scrutiny see
incidentally the in the United States
labor movement has been under severe
attack it's been declining in the
private sector as I'm sure you know the
union organizing is now down to about 7%
public sector unions have been sustained
they've been protected by labor laws
that were basically violated openly
since the Reagan years when Reagan
pretty much informed employers that they
weren't going to apply the laws and
illegal firing of organizers sharply
increased that continued through the
Clinton years and of course on under w
bush the public sector however has
maintained itself it's now under a
serious attack by partisan attack so for
example when the President Obama
declares a freeze on federal workers
more accurate description would be a tax
rise on federal workers that amounts to
the same thing but the sound is good
that way freeze on pay tax rise for
federal workers is the same and in other
ways the public sector unions are under
severe attack sometimes as in Wisconsin
by efforts to take away basic elementary
labor rights like the rights of
collective bargaining that's happening
in many places even in Massachusetts the
couple of days ago you may have seen
there was a David Montgomery one of the
major labor historians died Montgomery
is one of Montgomery's main works is
called the Fall of the House of labor
he's actually referring to the 1920s to
the crushing of the labor movement by
extremely harsh repression under Woodrow
Wilson his red square scare which almost
destroyed a very vibrant labor movement
well it arose again in the 1930s with
Oregon organizing the CIO sit-down
strikes the main impetus in fact beyond
behind the New Deal legislations which
significantly changed the country
greatly improved the standards for most
of the population that continued for
some years but didn't take long for the
attack to begin again and it's
culminating in the what I described just
to mention another book there's a
important book by Jefferson Cowley
called the 1970s and the last days of
the working class he's describing the
way at which this great neoliberal
assault was taking off the late 1970s
driven forward by Reagan Thatcher in
England and carried on right until today
and unless there's again a revival as
there was in the 1930
the country's in for bad times typically
over the long period an organized labor
movement has been in the forefront of
social progress one of the reasons it's
under such a sharp attack consistently
well it's worth remembering that this is
not the first time that the trajectories
of the United States and Egypt have
crossed the first time is quite
revealing was in the early 19th century
at that time both Egypt and the United
States were well placed to undertake
rapid industrial development the
economic development generally both
Egypt in the United States had rich
agriculture particularly cotton it
cotton remember was essentially the fuel
the oil of the early Industrial
Revolution there was a difference
unlike Egypt in the United States it was
necessary to resort to conquest
extermination of the indigenous
population slavery in order to develop a
huge cotton production industry not in
Egypt they had a peasant class there was
one consequences of course still resound
one fundamental difference between Egypt
in the United States at the time was
that the United States had gained
independence from England Egypt hadn't
there therefore the United States was
free to ignore the prescriptions of
sound economic theory of those
prescriptions were given to the colonies
by no less than Adam Smith in terms that
are quite similar to those that are
preached by the unholy trinity to
developing societies today Adam Smith's
prescriptions were that the colonies
should keep to what was later called
comparative advantage produce primary
products that's with the good add for
export import superior British
manufacturers and crucially that the
colonies he warned them not to
monopolize not to try to monopolize the
major resources that they that they
possessed most particularly cotton any
other path cooked Smith any other path
would retard instead of accelerating the
further increase in the value of their
annual product and would obstruct
instead of promoting the progress of
their country towards real wealth and
greatness
those are Smith's words and they're
essentially the same prescriptions given
to the third world the so called
developing societies today well having
gained their independence the American
colonies were former colonies were free
to ignore the laws of sound economics
and they were able to follow England's
own path of state directed industrial
development that's including high
tariffs to keep out superior British
exports to develop first a textile
industry later steel and others and made
use of many other devices of state
intervention to accelerate economic
development that's pretty uniform
through economic history the colonies
also the former colonies now independent
sought did seek to monopolize cotton
this was done in the 1840s and 50s the
Jacksonian presidents the goal was as
Tyler put it to place other old place
all other nations at our feet
particularly the British enemy that was
great enemy of the day that's part of
the motivation a large part of the
motivation for the conquest of Texas and
half of Mexico it's kind of and it came
pretty close to achievement not total
but very significant the idea was if the
US could monopolize cotton Britain would
not be able to use its deterrent force
to prevent the u.s. expansion growth
rather strikingly this is very similar
to the chart to what was charged the one
realistically in 1990 against Saddam
Hussein you recall that when Saddam
invaded Kuwait there was a lot of
fevered rhetoric about how he was trying
to monopolize oil and bring the world to
his feet that was sheer fantasy just an
effort to try to build up support for
the invasion but in the case of the u.s.
president it wasn't fantasy in fact it
pretty in pretty close to happening and
had big effects well that's the United
States independent could ignore the
economic prescriptions what about Egypt
well in Egypt which was poised for
industrial development a comparable
course was blocked by British power Lord
Palmerston essentially farm secretary
said that no ideas of fairness towards
Egypt ought to stand in the way of such
great and paramount interests of Britain
as preserving its economic and political
hegemony expressed as hate for the
ignorant barbarian Muhammad Ali who
dared to seek an independent course and
deployed Britain's fleet and financial
power at the terminate Egypt's quest for
independence and economic development in
France the other great imperial power
went along
after World War two and Egypt became
Egypt not rising developing rich country
like the United States which by the end
of the 19th century had thee it was far
and away the richest country in the
world after world war ii the united
states replaced britain as global
hegemonic power and and washington
adopted essentially the same stand made
very clear to the egyptians that egypt
would receive no aid unless egypt that
here to the standard rules for the weak
essentially adam smith's those are the
unholy trinity the united states
meanwhile continued to violate those
rules it imposed high tariffs on Tabar
egyptian cotton and other ways caused a
severe dollar shortage in egypt which
prevented egypt from picking up process
of development after the second world
war well that's actually the usual
interpretation of market principles it's
fine for you but not for me
please a couple years after in 1958
President Eisenhower discussed with his
staff a disturbing phenomenon what he
called a campaign of hatred against us
in the Arab world not among the goat not
not the government's there okay but
among the people and in the same year
1958 the National Security Council the
main planning agency produced a study
directed to this campaign of hatred and
it explained that there's a perception
in the Arab world that the United States
supports harsh and brutal regimes and
blocks economic and democratic
development and that we do so because we
want to maintain control of their energy
resources and I went on to say that this
perception is more or less accurate
and furthermore that's pretty much what
we ought to be doing echoing Lord
Palmerston so it's and it's small wonder
than the face of the policies that have
just described that you'll recall I'm
sure that after 9/11 the George W Bush
issued a plaintiff request demand and
plea asking why do they hate us and he
said well they hate us because of our
freedom and because we're so magnificent
and so on the Pentagon actually
commissioned right at that time a study
by the defense Science Board as to why
do they hate us and its conclusions and
not surprisingly were exactly the same
as those of the National Security
Council in 1958 they hate us because we
support dictatorships we block democracy
and development and we do it because we
want to make sure we control control
their energy supplies nothing much has
changed well going back to Adam Smith
and his defense he recognized something
that is highly pertinent today he
recognized what would happen he
discussed what would happen to Britain
his topic of course what would happen to
Britain if it adhered to the rules of
sound economics so suppose he felt
what's now called neoliberalism so
suppose he said that the merchants and
manufacturers in England decided that
they could make more profit if they
invested abroad produced abroad and
imported from abroad and he concluded
that they would profit but England would
suffer in case that sounds familiar it
is they would profit England would
suffer but he said he didn't think this
was going to happen because they would
be guided by what sometimes called home
bias just a commitment to your own
country so they'd prefer to invest in
England and
get there get the goods from England
because they have a commitment to the
country and this would be better for
them so therefore he said as if by an
invisible hand England will be saved
from the ravages of markets global
market systems global neoliberalism and
today's words that's a passage in Wealth
of Nations his famous book that's pretty
hard to miss in fact it's the only
occurrence of the phrase famous phrase
invisible hand in Wealth of Nations in
what amounts to a critique of what we
call global neoliberalism his a the
second major figure in classical
economics David Ricardo had the same
perception in fact he said he would he
hoped that home bias would lead men of
property to be satisfied I'm quoting him
to be satisfied with the low rate of
profit in their own country rather than
to seek a more advantageous employment
for their wealth in foreign nations and
he said that these are feelings that I
should be sorry to see weakened he
recognized if they were weakened England
would suffer though it's the masters of
England would would gain and the
instincts of the classical economists
were sound in the United States and not
here alone we were essentially living in
a nightmare that they predicted
producing offshore very profitable for
the sea you know the owners of apple and
Dell and many others very harmful to the
American population and shifting the
economy from production of useful goods
that you do abroad rotten labor
conditions no environmental constraints
high profits shifting from that to
financial
Galatians the financialization of the
economy has grown extraordinarily since
this began in the late 70s and the
consequences are about what you'd expect
in fact exactly pretty much what the
classical economists expected let's take
a look at the American winter the other
half of the title the current issue of
the major establishment international
relations journal the Journal of Foreign
Affairs of the Council on Foreign
Relations quarterly this current issue
has big on the front cover rate asks the
question is America over there referring
to the theme of American decline as it's
called very standard theme now of
scholar and political science
international relations scholarship and
also a public discussion american
decline so they're asking is america
over and there's a corollary to this
common theme namely that power is
shifting continuing its long shift from
east to west so from the east in the
17th and 18th century to northwest
europe then across the atlantic to the
united states and now across the Pacific
to the rising economic Giants especially
China the that's the kind of corollary
well that's something true about the
thesis American decline will come to it
the corollary is extremely dubious the
China is a very poor country India much
more so China's has a spectacular growth
but its economy is mainly as an assembly
plant the parts and components and
high-technology
mostly come from surrounding industrial
societies Japan
one South Korea all of which have a
favorable quite favorable trade balances
with China the products are assembled in
China
not much value-added and shipped off to
you no tea for you to buy on them all
the China will surely sooner or later
move up the technology ladder but it's
not an easy climb in fact when you
calculate trade deficits accurately us
famous us-china trade deficit if you
recalculate it in terms of value-added
which is the right way it turns out that
the trade deficit with China goes down
by 25% and the trade deficit with the
peripheral industrial countries goes up
at about the same amount there's much
discussion the last couple of days about
the conference the international
conference in Durban about global
warming and the standard description is
that the United States and China are the
main responsible for most of the
emissions actually China's past the
United States that's a little misleading
in a number of ways that one way of for
obvious reasons is just per capita
emissions which are far higher in the
United States the other is that the
emissions in China to a large extent are
traceable to wealthy Western industrial
societies West including the periphery
of China the Western industrial
societies who are shifting their
production to places like Foxconn where
they make Apple appliances under
absolutely horrifying conditions and the
produce emissions which are then called
emissions of China actually should be
traceable to the West including the
surrounding societies at China and even
more so India have enormous internal
problems far worse than anything that
the
the rich countries face the they are
there has been spectacular growth but
enormous problems ahead demographic and
others and it doesn't really seem to be
any likelihood that anywhere in the
foreseeable future there will be the
China will be an alternative global
power anywhere near comparable to the
United States well nevertheless the
decline of the United States is quite
real and there are a few things that
should be borne in mind about it
one is that the decline is to a
substantial extent self-inflicted this
has to do with the changes in the
economy that have been designed by the
people who dominate the society small
sector of power that dominates it and
designed very consciously in the manner
that I described shifting the economy
radically towards financialization and
production of useful goods offshore the
Smith Ricardo nightmare that has
consequences it sets off a vicious cycle
it leads to sharp concentration of
wealth concentrated wealth yield
concentration of political power that
leads to legislation fiscal measures
taxation rules of corporate governance
deregulation others which accelerate the
cycle and you end up with where we are
now meanwhile parallel to this the costs
of Elections have gone sky-high the next
election is just going to break wildly
break all records that many billions of
dollars already farmers already been
spent than in past elections that has a
consequence it means that the political
organizations are driven into the
pockets of the concentrations of wealth
increasingly the financial institution
parallel process discussed mainly by
political economist Thomas Ferguson is
that the part of the the the parties in
Congress are increasingly ceasing to
become to be traditional political
parties Republicans sorry several
decades by now Democrats the Democrats
who are now what used to be called
moderate Republicans that's they're not
far behind one of the ways in which this
is illustrated is in positions of
influence within Congress so say a
committee chair these used to be given
by on the basis of seniority and service
some sort of public service for a long
time among the Republicans now
increasingly the Democrats those
positions are basically bought you have
to put money into the party coffers
which drives the members of Congress in
the same direction so you get kind of a
very narrow oligarchy along with the
economic crisis this has many
consequences in the country it's led to
a high degree of anger of fear
frustration it's pretty dangerous mix
the Occupy movements are a response to
it the first constructive response to it
but I think it's very much in the
balance and could be very dangerous well
a second fact about American decline is
that it may be in the headlines now but
it's been going on for a long time the
peak of American power was reached in
1945 the end of the Second World War the
Second World War was the US had entered
the war by far the richest country in
the world in fact it was half a century
earlier the war was very beneficial to
the American economy it ended the
depression industrial production zoomed
correctly quadrupled meanwhile
other industrial countries were
devastated or severely weakened by the
end of the war the united states had a
position of power without any historical
precedent it literally had half the
world's wealth a position of
overwhelming security the controlling
the Western Hemisphere both oceans
opposite sides of both oceans of the
planners of the Roosevelt administration
during the war that recognized that this
was happening and knew that the war was
going to end with the United States in a
position of simply overwhelming power
they developed plans to deal with the
situation the plans were later
implemented the plans the basic plan was
that the United States should dominate
control essentially control of course
all the Western Hemisphere it's taken
for granted the entire Far East and the
former British Empire including
crucially its Middle East energy
resources and as much of Eurasia as
possible surely the most significant
industrial and commercial parts and
Western Europe well that's the minimum
the maximum is everything the the Middle
East oil reserves were recognized to be
of extreme significance 1940s they were
described by high officials as a
stupendous source of strategic power
greatest material prize in world history
President Eisenhower called them the
most strategically important part of the
world it was recognized that if we
control the Middle East we can control
the world for this reason well that was
1945 but it started to decline very
quickly one major blow to these plans
was just a few years later in 1949 when
China
independent now there's a name for that
event in American political history it's
called the loss of China that's a very
interesting phrase if you think about it
I can't lose your computer right
I can only lose something I own but it's
simply taken for granted that we possess
China
so therefore if it became independent
we've lost it and therefore a uniform
description to this from the late 40s
til today major theme in American
politics is the loss of China and what
that means tells us a lot about our own
culture and understanding by 1950 year
later there were serious concerns about
the loss of Southeast Asia the partially
Indochina but much more significant was
the threat to the possibility of losing
Indonesia which had major resources on
interesting history after that the the
Vietnam War was largely fought to
prevent this all of this from happening
the conception which runs right through
the second world the post-war period all
over the world is that you've got to be
careful about what were sometimes called
viruses that might spread contagion
Domino that would topple the dominoes
the virus was the threat of successful
independent development which could
appeal to others to try to pursue the
same course pretty soon you have
contagion spreading and the system of
domination begins to erode that's
essentially what the Vietnam War was
about how do you deal with the virus and
spreading contagion where you destroy
the virus and you inoculate potential
victims from contagion destroying the
virus means invasion bombing destruction
military coos and so on
preventing contagion means imposing
military dictatorship sirs will control
the population that's what was done in
Southeast Asia all throughout the region
and not only there by the early 1950s
the threat of loss was beginning closer
to home that Guatemala had its first
democratic government overthrew a
dictatorship the Eisenhower
administration was deeply concerned that
that would be another virus that would
spread infection the Guatemalan there
was a military it was carried out a
military coup in Guatemala installed a
brutal vicious murderous regime it's
still people it's still one of the
horror stories of the Western Hemisphere
years later this went on over and over
the most striking an instructive case
was Cuba the Cuba had been in effect in
American colony 1959 it gained its
independence for the first time very
quickly
Washington began to make plans to
overthrow the government bombing started
a couple months later when John F
Kennedy came over came in next year was
escalated yet the Bay of Pigs invasion
when that failed enormous terrorist
operation run by Robert Kennedy his his
biographer Arthur Schlesinger historian
who was Kennedy's Latin American advisor
he writes that in the biography that
Robert Kennedy's task the task given to
him was to bring the terrors of the
earth to Cuba and in fact that was his
prime responsibility they're quite an
ugly development it almost led to a
nuclear war and the Missile Crisis went
on again right after that there was a
harsh embargo the purpose was to destroy
the virus or at least constrain it and
it was very explicit the CIA
warned that the major threat of Cuba was
its successful defiance of the Monroe
Doctrine 150 years earlier which had
declared the American goal of dominating
the hemisphere couldn't be implemented
at the time because of British power
Kennedy himself as he came into office
intended to devote attention to Latin
America he had a Latin American mission
which was in fact headed by Arthur
Schlesinger realizing his report to the
president did of course discuss the
problem of Cuba he said the problem of
Cuba is the spread of the Castro idea of
taking matters into your own hands which
might influence others in surrounding
countries which where people face the
same problems so you have a virus and it
might spread contagion and the methods
that were used were the standard ones
and effort to destroy the Cuban virus it
was a plague of repression was set off
all through Latin America beginning with
a military coup in Brazil and spreading
through the continent reached Central
America in the 1980s worst plague of
repression in Latin American history
which did prevent contagion while the
virus will not totally destroyed was
contained and it was serious it's
understood by scholarship at least so if
you take a look at the latest
Cambridge University history the Cold
War is an article by a leading American
Latin American scholar John cotesworth
he points out that quoting him from the
Kennedy years to the Soviet collapse in
1990 the numbers of political prisoners
torture victims executions of
non-violent political dissenters in
Latin America vastly exceeded those in
the Soviet Union and it's East European
satellites all backed by Washington
often initiated by a
included many religious martyrs and mass
slaughter the final bloody event just
shortly after the fall of the Berlin
Wall was the assassination of six
leading Latin American intellectuals
Jesuit priests in El Salvador they were
murdered on the orders of the High
Command by which was in close contact
with the u.s. they were murdered by an
elite Salvadoran battalion which already
had a bloody history of massacres and
destruction they had just been they were
just returning from the refresher
courses at the John F Kennedy School of
Special Warfare in North Carolina
murdered on command the Jesuits and also
their housekeeper and daughter so there
wouldn't be anyone to report it it's
denied for a long time effects of
trickled out sins and it's kind of
symbolic of what happened as the
contagion was was constrained well all
of this is out of history because no
country is it's hard to find any society
which looks at its own crimes you lament
the crimes of others but not your own
those you suppress well the decline
continued the industrial countries
reconstructed from the Second World War
decolonization began to take place by
1970 the world was economically what was
called tri-polar
three major economic centres North
America based in the United States
Europe comparable economy based
primarily in Germany and the dynamic
growing region of East Asia at that
point
Japan center later later Japan China
centered the other industrial countries
by then the US share of world wealth had
declined from 50% to 25% which is still
extraordinary but not 50% then it
remains roughly at that level today then
won't run through everything but in the
last decade there's been a very
significant development Latin America
broke away especially South America
broke away and moved towards
independence for the first time in five
hundred years one also began to move
towards addressing its horrifying
internal economic problems very rich
region but to every country after
country ruled by tiny elite westernized
often white sea of misery that's
changing country by country they also
thrown out every US military base the
u.s. is no longer able to carry out
regular crews in South America Central
America they still can weaker societies
but not South America the just a couple
of days ago this a new organization was
formed the c-loc which is the includes
the all the countries of Latin America
and the Caribbean except for the United
States and Canada that would have been
unheard of in earlier years it could
become a substitute to the US dominated
Organization of American States so
that'll be the that already is
recognized as the loss of of South
America considered the backyard well
this last year it's shifted to may not
could be the loss of the main our
country's Middle East North Africa which
is much more dangerous than loss of
South America because of the
understanding of the enormous
significance of the resources of that
region well the u.s. reaction has been
the expected one for the United States
and its allies its Western
European allies the worst threat in the
Manor region is democratization of
course everybody talks about how they
love democracy but the Western countries
will do anything they can to prevent it
for very simple reasons if you want to
know why just take a look at polls there
are extensive careful Western run us run
polls of the Arab world and they're
revealing that I've reported but Planner
certainly know them right on the eve of
the Arab Spring that a year ago polls
showed just take say Egypt the most
important country that for 90 percent of
the population the greatest threat they
perceived was the United States and
Israel opposition to US policy was so
strong that about 80% of the population
thought the region would be more secure
if Iran had nuclear weapons they don't
like Iran and they don't want to have
nuclear weapons but the balance what
they see is the major threat they felt
that would make the region more secure
maybe 10% regarded Iran as a threat
figures are somewhat similar throughout
the region obviously the United States
and Western Europe France and Britain
don't want those attitudes expressed in
policy but if you insofar as you move
towards functioning democracy you have
public opinion expressed in policy
that's what democracy means and in fact
even the early steps very partial steps
in democratization in Egypt have already
had effects that the US and its allies
regards extremely threatening so Egypt
opened up transit in the Suez Canal to
Iranian ships for the first time
including military vessels which they
don't threaten the u.s. 6th fleet in the
Mediterranean but the Mediterranean
supposed to be an American Lake
else is allowed in there certainly not
Iran the Egypt has moved to as attempted
to bring about reconciliation of the two
major Palestinian factions philosophy
and the Gaza Strip of Palestine Fatah in
the West Bank the US and Israel have
been trying for it and working very hard
for 20 years now to separate Gaza from
the West Bank to break them apart for
very good violation of the Oslo Accords
but nobody cares about that
the reason is straightforward if there's
ever any kind of Independence for some
sort of fragment of the West Bank if
they're separated from Gaza they're
imprisoned they have no access to the
outside world take a look at a map and
you'll see it they're imprisoned between
the Jordanian dictatorship in Israel
Gaza is the outlet so you got to
separate them despite the fact that the
Oslo accord says that there are
territorial integrity which cannot be
separate separated has been going on for
20 years and the effort to bring them
together whether it will succeed or not
we don't know is itself very threatened
there's also concern that Egypt might
they might be compelled by popular
opinion to revise the 1979 Israel Egypt
treaty not really to revise it but the
revised us interpretation Egypt
immediately interpreted the treaty as
did Israel in the United States as
essentially a license to Israel to do
anything at once the Egyptian deterrent
is removed
Israel's therefore free to invade its
northern neighbor Lebanon as it did
almost immediately and to extend its
colonization of the occupied territories
that was understood explicitly by
Israeli strategists Egypt Egyptian
dictatorships green population didn't
like it and they are already making
threats to revise that interpretation
real knows it well that's what's
happening that's in the background if
you look at the actual policies the US
has followed to the Arab Spring it works
out pretty much this way as you'd expect
so in the first place the oil
dictatorships the really important parts
there are given carte launched do
anything they like so there's no Arab
Spring in Saudi Arabia the most extreme
radical fundamentalist state the major
US ally and the sort place where most of
the oil is there was an effort weak
effort to have demonstrations you know
arab spring type demonstrations in saudi
arabia but the police presence security
presence was so enormous that people
were afraid to go out in the streets of
riyadh nothing happened
that pretty much same in quate bahrain
is a interesting case it's not doesn't
produce a lot of oil but it's
significant that's as you know i'm sure
there's been a very harsh repression in
bahrain and in fact there was a
saudi-led invasion to ensure that the
demonstrations would be crushed
they were pretty brutally with a kind of
tap on the wrists by the western US and
its allies the reason is a befriend is
about 70 percent shiite it's right
across the causeway from eastern saudi
arabia which is largely Shiite and which
happens to be where most of saudi saudi
oil is and there's been a real concern
by western planners for a long time that
there could develop a kind of a tacit
shiite alliance the dictatorships are
sunni tacit shiite alliance of eastern
saudi arabia's southern iraq and western
iran right around the northern part of
the end of the the gulf which happens to
have the major concentration of energy
reserves in the world that would be a
nightmare
so that's anything do anything like that
the horns also the home base of the u.s.
5th fleet the major military force in
the region so that's all pretty
predictable the second major category is
the non-oil dictatorships like say Egypt
Tunisia what's been followed there is a
very standard game plan it's applied
over and over again there's case after
case where it's become impossible to
support your favorite dictator usually
because the army turns against him or
something like that or it just gets
overthrown Somoza Marcos and the
Philippines it's shown in South Korea
and Suharto in Indonesia abouttwo in the
Congo
Ceausescu in Romania at one after
another of the West's favorite dictators
have gotten to a point where they CH
can't be sustained well the game plan in
those cases is to support them as long
as possible no matter what kind of
atrocities they're carrying out if it
can't be sustained send them off
somewhere and issue ringing declarations
about your love of democracy and then
try to restore the old system as much as
possible and that's pretty much what's
happening in the non-oil dictatorships
in Egypt for example pretty much as
expected other cases are varied there's
one major case that's different looks
different
that's Libya in Libya the Western powers
were pretty strongly supporting Qaddafi
right up to the Arab Spring weeks before
a interesting story in itself we'll go
into it but it was recognized that it
would be better to replace an
unpredictable kind of erratic figure by
a more reliable regime in Libya as
distinct from the other countries there
was direct military intervention
actually two interventions the first one
which lasted about five
of minutes that was under the authority
of the United Nations the UN did pass a
resolution calling for a no-fly zone and
protection of civilians well okay that
was used as the pretext for bombing but
it was immediately disregarded by the
three traditional imperial powers
Britain and France in front the United
States backing them they immediately
turned to a different intervention and
no relation to the UN resolution simply
joining the side of the rebels to
overthrow the government that it's a
other word it should be recognized that
this second intervention is very
isolated in world opinion had very
little virtually no support and
alternatives were proposed right away
even before the first UN resolution they
were proposed by the International
Crisis Group that's the main neutral
body that all over the world monitors
such matters a lot of expertise they
presented alternatives the so-called
BRICS countries rising industrial powers
Britain Russia Brazil Russia India China
South Africa the African Union's an
African country they all made turkey
basically all made the same proposals
namely that there should be a ceasefire
as called for in the UN resolution and
moves towards negotiation and diplomacy
to see if it would be possible to head
off head off a serious humanitarian
crisis which in fact took place if you
look at the developments and
particularly at the last month and sira
the-- happens to be the home base of the
largest tribe in libya the tribal
society was a monstrosity
so the imperial triumvirate was almost
alone particularly interesting
it was the African Union now since
Africa is come
quickly African opinion is completely
ignored in the West it's worth quoting
what they said I'm quoting from a
leading journal in India where it was
reported the African Union I'm quoting
it called for dialogue even before the
UN resolutions that authorized
intervention and after those resolutions
ignoring the African Union for three
months and going on with the bombing of
the sacred land of Africa has been
high-handed arrogant and provocative an
attack on Libya or any other member of
the African Union without express
agreement by the African Union is a
dangerous provocation sovereignty has
been a tool of emancipation of the
peoples of Africa who are beginning to
chart transformational paths for most of
the African countries after centuries of
predation by the slave trade colonialism
and neocolonialism careful assaults on
the sovereignty of careless assaults on
the sovereignty of African countries are
therefore tantamount to inflicting fresh
wounds on the destiny of the African
peoples well you can understand when
none of that gets reported in the United
States or the West but we ought to know
about it and it's also as a background
to this Qadhafi was the major backer of
the African National Congress Mandela's
and see right at the time when the
United States was supporting the
apartheid regime in its war against the
ANC that went on right through the
Reagan years late 80s 1988 the Reagan
administration declared the African
National Congress to be one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
so therefore supported South Africa by
that time was even violating
congressional sanctions may not be
remembered here but it's understood by
the victims in fact Nelson Mandela
himself just was removed from the
terrorist list about two years ago
he can now come to United States without
special dispensation well such things
are of no interest to the powerful but
they're not so quickly forgotten by the
victims in Libya itself there are many
prizes for the triumvirate the Imperial
for amber one major one is that the
invasion the intervention removed a
Chinese competition there were about
several dozen maybe 75 Chinese companies
working in Libya 35,000 personnel mostly
they were working in infrastructure
development projects well they were
evicted that's part of a much larger
struggle over African resources Libyan
resources are quite significant Libyan
oil is very important it's light oil
very easily refined that Libya is right
next to Europe you know the pipelines
and so on and there the transitional
National Council the new government is
made very clear they're going to give
priority to the Imperial triumvirate
primarily France and Britain actually
the French press had an interesting
article I don't know if they intended
the irony or not the article was called
total victory in Libya and among other
things it cited the fact that the new
government promised 35 percent of the
Libyan Confession concession to the
French oil company which is called total
so it was a total victory maybe they
meant that maybe they didn't another
major resource in Libya which isn't
discussed much it's water
Libya has huge underground water
resources there had been incipient
efforts to try to use them for the very
arid regions to the south they are
mainly controlled by French oil
companies now French oil water companies
which are the main international water
companies that's a very significant
resource for the future
another major
active development of major significance
has to do with AFRICOM that's the new us
Africa Command it when Qaddafi took over
in 1969 he kicked the United States out
of its major base wheels air base the
Africa has no base in Africa they're
looking for a base very likely we'll get
one in Libya that's part of the
recolonization that the African Union is
warning about right now they're in
Stuttgart in Germany as you probably saw
a couple of weeks ago Obama sent small
military forces to Uganda under a
pretext that makes no sense at all to
combat the Lord's Resistance Army which
has been a murderous force for years now
on its last legs but it's generally
speculated that those forces are really
aimed at South Sudan which has plenty of
oil newly newly liberated a lot of
competition again with China well all of
this is part of the race for African
resources there is one more case in the
Arab Spring there are a couple of others
but another major case is the countries
that are still under military occupation
foreign occupation there are two the
first where actually the Arab Spring
began about a year ago is Western Sahara
Western Sahara is the last colony it's
technically a colony under UN of UN
supervision it was supposed to receive
independence in 1975 it was invaded by
Morocco Morocco sent has been sending a
large number of people into the Western
Sahara try to nominate Sahrawis
population as a long history that I
won't run through Morocco is basically a
French dependency the French have been
intervening regularly to prevent the
United Nations from responding to
Moroccan crimes and atrocities actually
transshipment of populations itself a
major crime war crime in fact but and
last November there was there were
protests there have been many protests
there were more last November tent
cities and so on
they were very quickly crushed by the
Moroccans there were efforts to bring it
to the Security Council France
intervened to block it the US backed
them and that's kind of nobody pays
attention but that's before what
happened in Tunis a couple of weeks
later and before Egypt that's one case
the second case of course is Palestine
Palestine remains under foreign
occupation the as you know the
Palestinian Authority approached the
United Nations to try to gain admission
as a state to the United Nations public
opinion around the world is highly
supportive of this in Egypt ninety
percent in Europe it's about two to one
even in the United States pretty
amazingly almost a half the population
supports the Palestinian statehood bid
that's pretty remarkable when you look
at the media coverage Congress and so on
which treats this is utter anathema so
with any open discussion possible those
figures would surely be much higher
meanwhile the White House and Congress
quickly moved to punish both the
Palestinians and the United Nations for
daring to think about this Palestine was
admitted to UNESCO the United States
immediately defunded it
the United States is defunded in
Congress and has legislation to defend
the palestinian administration if they
dare to do anything like this
Israel did the same they reacted to the
UN bid by immediately initiating new
settlements in what they call
Jerusalem's a huge area much bigger than
traditional Jerusalem which Israel and
next the settlements between Bethlehem
and Jerusalem which going to close the
circle and prevent any contact between
them should be mentioned that the
settlements themselves are all illegal
there's no question about that
every International Authority has made
it very clear and the settlements in
Jerusalem are doubly illegal because
they're not only like all the others but
they're also in violation of explicit
Security Council demands but it goes on
Israel also for a time withheld customs
and taxes that it's legally obliged
obliged to provide but all of this is
punishment to the Palestinians for
seeking to break out of the system which
guarantees that nothing will ever happen
well there are lots of I'll finish with
this there are plenty of hard problems
in the world so if you try to think of a
possible solution for problems like say
Kashmir or eastern Congo worst
monstrosities in the world it's not so
simple Palestine in Israel is quite
different there's a very simple solution
there's overwhelming agreement on it and
there has been for 35 years the first
formulation of an official formulation
at the United Nations was in a proposal
in 1976 brought by the major Arab states
Jordan Egypt and Syria to the Security
Council calling for what is now just an
overwhelming international consensus a
two-state settlement on the
international border with guarantees for
the right of every state in the region
to exist in peace and security within
secure and recognized borders that's the
basic wording of UN 242 which everyone
recognizes to be the basic document that
would include Israel and a new
Palestinian state in the territories
that Israel was occupying well that was
vetoed by the United States similar
resolution vetoed in 1980 won't run
through the rest of the history but it
continues that way US and Israel
virtually alone in blocking this
continues to the present last February
they actually a u.s. veto last February
did receive some attention because it
was so outlandish Obama vetoed a
Security Council resolution calling for
implementation of official US policy
official US policy you know in words at
least is that Israel shouldn't expand
its settlement that's the least of the
problem it's the settlements that are
criminal but the u.s. vetoed even that
one that caused some flurry of attention
the last last couple of weeks at the at
the United Nations the Obama has simply
been ridiculed I mean if you look at the
international commentary it's like a
joke in Israel for example after Obama's
speech to the General Assembly hi
Israeli diplomat said that Prime
Minister Netanyahu is going to have to
rewrite a speech because Obama already
gave it to him for him and which is
approximately true the the US and Israel
you read the press it says they say the
US and Israel are calling for
negotiations without preconditions
Palestinians are insisting on
preconditions truth is exactly the
opposite the US and Israel insist on
strict preconditions crucial ones
designed to ensure that nothing will
happen
the first precondition is that
negotiations have to be run by the
United States
well you know if there were that we if
there were real negotiations going on
they'd be run by some neutral party that
has some international respect that
maybe Brazil and the two sides would be
the US and Israel on one side and the
rest of the world on the other side
that's the way it's been lined up pretty
much for 35 years but the u.s. is not
going to abandon its control over this
crucial region to anybody no matter what
votes there are in the UN or anywhere
else
so first precondition the US has to run
it which pretty much guarantees that
nothing will happen
the second precondition is that Israel
must be free to expand settlements
that's nine question anymore I mean the
us occasionally makes a couple of words
about it but then says basically go
ahead well a third precondition is that
Israel's already announced what it's
going to annex illegally of course
well obviously under those conditions
negotiations will get nowhere that's why
the Palestinians made it may be
desperate effort to try to get around
this system to the United Nations you
can argue about whether there was a wise
move or not but it's understandable as
things now stand there are several
options what's usually the usual
description which i think is highly
misleading is this they'll either be a
two-state settlement in terms of the
international consensus or else israel
will take over all the territories and
the Palestinians can wage a civil rights
struggle like an anti-apartheid struggle
and in fact many Palestinian activists
and even Palestinian leaders and are
advocating that at this time but that's
very misleading that's not the second
option it's not an option at all that
Israel will never accept that in the US
will never accept it and they're the
ones that matter the other option is
that the US and Israel will continue
doing exactly what they're doing what
they're doing is implementing policy
basically what was called the show run
Israel takes over the parts of the
territories that are value to it leaves
the rest kind of Canton eyes what RL
show run called banter stands separated
from Gaza which will remain under siege
and the past the rest of the
Palestinians can just remind don't take
any have no commitment they don't want
them to they don't want to introduce
them under Israeli jurisdiction they'll
just be off in a hill somewhere or
they'll leave which many of the say the
Christian communities and others are
just doing and that will continue that's
the second option so it's either some
version of a two-state settlement and
the basic outlines of that have been
clear for years or else this well is
there a solution to all of this yeah
there's a very simple one u.s. policy
has to change already a majority of the
population majority the population
supports it we're now back to the
American decline that I was talking
about there's a growing gap between the
public will and public policy a huge
number of issues there's always a gap
but by now it's kind of a chasm this is
one case and unless there is some
process of real democratization in the
United States towards a functioning
democracy where public opinion has them
do with policy everything is going to be
in deep trouble and this in particular
and in a way as far as Israel Palestine
is concerned I think that's pretty
optimistic conclusion that means the
easy well understood solution is within
reach that's furthermore within our
control to bring it about Thanks
we have about four questions
where are you are they're gonna come
this way and they're gonna ask them I
don't see where the oh you're coming up
here I see okay hello my name is Dan I'm
a junior at the University of New
England in the political science program
and my question today is do you believe
that the states involved at the Arab
Spring will experience a period of
modernization after stable governments
are established and if so what changes
can we expect well as I pointed out for
close to 200 years almost 200 years the
United States and Britain have been
trying to push Britain than the United
States have been trying to prevent
modernization in maena
Egypt and I mentioned Egypt but it's all
over the region
now first was Britain since the early
19th century then us took over after
1945 when it displaced England I read
you a few things from the internal
record that continues the same happened
in South America first it was mostly
European influence then US influence in
the last century and for pretty good
understandable reasons the ones that the
National Security Council spelled out so
will it take place and I'm a bit as well
or to a certain extent it's up to us I
mean first this question for them can
they succeed in overthrowing dictatorial
regimes the way that was finally done
pretty much in Latin America and South
America at least and move on on their
own well that's can they do it second is
will we let them do it a very
significant question the imperial
triumvirate is quite powerful it's been
at this for centuries
shifting from Britain and France to the
US but Britain and France still very
active will we allow our own states to
act to prevent democracy and development
well the answer your question is those
two questions some of its not in our
hands some of it is in our hands part
that we should be mostly concerned about
but I don't think anyone can predict its
taking various forms in different main
countries roughly along the lines that I
outlined this very uncertain prospects
there's certain to be a lot of conflict
and controversy and what we do is going
to have a substantial impact on it
hi my name is Eddie and I'm from und
College of Pharmacy my question is in
your book you talk a lot about the the
first be the second conflict in Iraq and
how we're occupying it right now and you
don't approve of it
what do you think do you think the
initial invasion of Iraq in the early
90s the first conflict was justified
well the first the second conflict was
just an outright aggression it was just
you know it's caught it was what was
called in the Nuremberg Tribunal the
supreme international crime which
include differs from other war crimes in
that it includes all the evil that
follows that's the second invasion I
don't see what there is discuss about
that the total horror story the first
invasion is more controversial but good
and it's kind of interesting to look at
if you're interested of going into the
details including the internal record
and shortly after it in a book called
deterring democracy mores appeared since
but roughly the same story what happened
is that in the United States was very
strongly supporting Saddam Hussein
remember that began in 1982 under Reagan
we have this thing called a terrorist
list which is just an outrage it's a
list invented by the government it's not
under any review if someone's put on it
like say Nelson Mandela there's nothing
to say about it the Mandela case
illustrates the way it works but a very
said it's being used right now remember
that's being used to attack American
groups and so on the one striking
illustration of how it works was in 1982
Saddam Hussein had been on Iraq had been
on the terrorist list but the Reagan
administration wanted to support Iraq in
its aggression against Iran the bigger
enemy so it was necessary to remove Iraq
from the terrorist list so they were
removed shortly after Donald Rumsfeld
made a famous trip to Baghdad shaking
hands with Saddam ranging for aid to be
given and so on there incidentally was a
gap on the terrorist list and so I had
to be filled so they decided to put Cuba
on the terrorist list the reason
presumably was because Cuba was far and
away the leading victim of international
terrorism which in fact had been
expanding right through the late
seventies and go through the details so
that was the terrorist list u.s.
strongly supported Saddam during the
iran-iraq war the Reagan administration
even went so far as to block protests
against Saddam's worst atrocities the
massacres of the Kurds you know Al Anfal
massacre
the Reagan administration blocked any
action in fact tried to blame them on
Iran basically won the war for Iraq that
by the end ran finally capitulated after
the war was over the US continues to
strongly support Iraq and this is now
Georgia first Bush George HW Bush he
increased aid to Iraq he actually
invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to the
United States for advanced training and
nuclear weapons development that was
1989 goes on into early 1990 the Bush
administration sent a delegation to Iraq
led by Robert dole Center Senate
Majority Leader later presidential
candidate including Senator Simpson
other dignitaries they went there to
Iraq to bring the president's greetings
to his friends that I'm Hussein the
transcript that that meeting is
available and I urge reading it they
were and basically informing Saddam that
he should disregard critics and the
American press we have this Free Press
business we can't shut him up but but
they said they would remove somebody
from The Voice of America who was
criticizing Saddam and so on all of that
was I think April 1990 a great friend
August 1990 Saddam made his first
mistake he either violated or probably
misunderstood orders and invaded Kuwait
well there were all kind of reasons for
that I won't go into them whatever they
were he invaded Kuwait very quick the
Bush administration immediately
recognized that this is an opportunity
not only to switch sides but they're
finally you know crushing that they
liked them but it's better to have
somebody loyal
Sadam immediately recognized he'd been
made a big mistake and within weeks he
began to produce offers to withdraw the
in Washington you look back at the
debates the concern was this chief of
staff Powell put it that Saddam will
withdraw and leave a puppet regime in
place and all the Arab states will be
happy
in other words Saddam would do what the
United States had just done in Panama
look at the reports on Noriega today and
you'll notice something's missing how
the United States got rid of Noriega and
Panama Panama Noriega had also been a
big buddy the United States but he also
kind of stopped obeying orders they
turned against him invaded Panama killed
hundreds or maybe thousands of people
nobody counts when their victims
attacked the Vatican embassy where
Noriega was tonight he gets asylum and
finally kidnapped got him out of the
country took him to Florida where he was
tried and convicted for real crimes
which he had committed while he was on
the CIA payroll like if you read the
papers today they talk about how the
family of Spada for one of his victims
are calling for the compensation they
failed to mention that Spadaro was
murdered while the United States was
supporting Noriega under Reagan and in
fact praising him for the wonderful
things he was doing that out of history
again anyhow they were afraid that Iraq
would do just what the u.s. had done in
Panama and invade the country install a
puppet regime and leave the difference
was that the Latin American countries
were infuriated they weren't happy about
it
but they thought that the Arab countries
would be happy with this well they
wanted to block that they wanted a
chance to invade and in fact if you look
over the next couple of months the media
reporting is quite interesting there
were people in the government
were leaking regularly leaking offers
from Saddam Hussein to negotiate a
withdrawal and the press wasn't covering
them they were finally they were being
published interestingly mainly by a
small suburban newspaper the Long Island
Newsday it's a Long Island newspaper
which happened to be distributed in New
York so you could get a the newsstands
in New York would have a no cover of the
Wyland news day with Newsday with a big
headline saying saddam says let's talk
us says no well you know after that the
New York Times had to have a comment on
page 28 at the bottom of a page the next
day saying State Department the NIH's
rumors or something but these things
were almost certainly being leaked to
the New York Times
nobody leaks things to Newsday and
presumably they just wouldn't publish
them so they were leaked the news that
this went on for a couple of months
finally by January we're now in January
1990 so I made a pretty definite offer
to withdraw on conditions which were in
fact supported by about two-thirds of
the American population withdrawal from
Kuwait total withdrawal from kuwait in
the context of a regional conference on
security issues
okay that's code words for Israel's
occupation of Palestine so of course the
US wasn't having any of that and that
also essentially wasn't reported a
couple of lines here and there then the
u.s. invaded crushed Iraq easily
destroyed the infrastructure that carry
out a really brutal war I'm in Iraq of
course withdrew from queit but it looked
as if that could have been easily
arranged just by diplomacy negotiations
then comes the sanctions regime that's a
huge issue in the Arab
nothing here after 9/11 polls here taken
here about you know why did they hate us
that kind of thing show that one of the
main reasons was the Iraq sanctions even
among people very supportive of the
United States the sanctions were really
murders they killed hundreds of
thousands of people they devastated the
civilian population they strengthened
Saddam they compelled the population to
rely on him for survival
they probably protected him from the
fate of other monsters those I mentioned
who were overthrown from within
yo Somoza and Marcos the rest of them he
was protected from that and this this
was known the people who knew mo the
Westerners who knew most about Iraq by
far were the two international diplomats
who administered the oil-for-food
program distinguished international
diplomats at Dennis holiday from Ireland
Hans von sponeck from Germany a very
outspoken both resigned on grounds that
the sanctions were as they put it
genocide 'el they had a lot of
information about Iraq they had
investigators all over the country they
were getting all sorts of information
sending it back to the Security Council
where the US wouldn't let it be
presented both resigned on grounds of
the they were genocide 'el fun sponeck
published a major book on it I urge you
to read it it's called a different kind
of war carefully documented scholarly
account of what the sanctions were doing
I don't things ever been mentioned in
the United States or in England not that
I can find at least that's what was
happening that protected Saddam and then
we get to the second invasion so there's
a lot to say about the first invasion I
mean you can argue about it at least
it's debatable
unlike in my opinion the second one
but I don't think it stands up very well
to scrutiny and I didn't think so at the
time for the kind of reasons I mentioned
you can check them out and see what you
think I my name is Alex and I was a bio
major and now I'm a student at the
College of Pharmacy with an interest in
like in my free time for political
economy economics that sort of stuff and
in many of you works illustrate the
economic doctrines that America imposes
and other countries like ace hate sorry
asymmetric free trade agreements and
overthrowing leaders outright to just
exploit resources and labor power so
what I was wondering is is it necessary
for us to do this if we want the
American economy to prosper so well
first of all remember it's the u.s. is
just following on the paths of every
other imperial power it's not you know
new circumstances but it's doing what
Britain did what France did with other
great powers have done in their day in
the Sun and it's easily understandable
the question that you're raising is
quite an interesting one so what's the
impact of this on the American
population does the American population
gain from it well you know it's pretty
hard to measure precisely but in the
case of the British Empire which is a
much longer history there have been
attempts by economic historians to try
to do a cost-benefit analysis of the
British Empire so like how much did they
gain how much did it cost its imprecise
you can't put much faith in the figures
there's too many variables but the rough
conclusion rather rough conclusion seems
to be that the cost and benefits more or
less balance that there's a lot of
benefits there's a lot of costs and
they're kind of in the same range
roughly so why have an empire well the
answer to that comes out as soon as you
ask who paid the costs
who got the gains okay if you look at
that it turns out that the British
Empire is essentially class war internal
to England the people who had the gains
you know are the people who had shares
in East India Company you know the the
banks in the city of London and so on
and so forth enormous gains who paid the
costs well you know the sailors who were
dragoon into the British Navy the the
poor or the poor population and so on
so it's essentially a form of class war
I think if you look at the American
dominated system it's pretty similar so
take say the war in Vietnam which I
discussed for for Center today the
planners understood what they were doing
they wanted to destroy that virus before
it spread contagion same reasons why
they imposed dictatorships at the same
time and Indonesia in Thailand
Philippines and so on kind of like South
America so from their point of view it
was a success they killed the virus they
prevented contagion the region didn't
move towards independent development
little a long way from it and it remains
pretty much under Western domination not
exactly everything they wanted but
pretty much how about the costs well you
know sixty thousand American soldiers
were killed severe economic problems
within the country
let the stagflation fact it laid the
basis for the developments that took
place in the 1970s by severely harming
the economy then comes all the things
that follow and I think if you take a
look case by case it's sort of like that
I'll take the Iraq invasion it's
probably several trillion dollars a
thousand soldiers killed pretty big you
know it sharply increased terrorism I
don't know how you put in measure on
that but as predicted it was predicted
that the Iraq invasion would increase
terrorism
intelligence agencies predicted that the
British and American of independent
experts and it did a terrorism went up
by a factor of seven that's big the year
after the invasion and it's spread well
beyond it led to it it let it increase
the perception in the Muslim world which
is very high that the US isn't a war
with Islam you take a look at polls in
the Arab world Muslim world there's an
overwhelming feeling that the u.s. is at
war with Islam and that you know that
not only provides a basis kind of a
reservoir for terrorism we got to defend
ourselves but also just strong and
anti-us feelings which show up in all
kinds of ways how do you measure that
you know you can't put a number on it
but it's certainly harmful to the people
of the country and their future well
that's the downside the upside is you
know whatever you win from it it was not
most of the population but others and I
think that if you look I think it's a
very important question it should be
looked at frankly I don't think that
it's the right criterion to determine
whether an invasion is correct or
whether Terror is correct like you don't
ask suppose Hitler had actually won the
war well would it have benefited the
German population that's not the right
question you know but nevertheless
though it's not the right question you
can ask it and you can ask it for the
British Empire for French atrocities in
Africa which are horrendous US policy
and so on and I think if you look at it
it usually turns out to be something
roughly like this it's kind of internal
class war within the Imperial Society I
thank you again for coming my name is
Erica I'm a junior biochemistry major
here you seem to have a lot of strong
opinions about the United States foreign
policy my
question was is there anything the
nation is here the last port is there
anything you like about Washington's
foreign policy
take all the countries we haven't
invaded I like that
I let me repeat this is I mean I happen
to be particularly interested in US
foreign policy for two reasons
elementary moral reasons for one thing
it's by far the most powerful state in
the world so what it does is far more
important that when anyone else does for
another one another reason which is
sufficient even if it wasn't the most
powerful state in the world I'm here I
have a share of responsibility for what
the US government does
and to extent I can do something about
it especially in a pretty free country
like this one now we understand that
very well with regard to enemies so for
example it takes a Iranian dissidents
like shereena body and Akbar Gandhi and
others nobody asks them is there
anything good about Iranian foreign
policy it's not their job to say what's
good about Iranian foreign policy you
know there's some things that aren't bad
but that's not their task their task is
to condemn the crimes of their own state
and we honor them for that it doesn't
matter what they say about the United
States or what they say about Israel
like if it rannian dissidents criticize
Israeli crimes and maybe they're right
but we don't give them any respect for
that and the same ought to be true about
Americans who criticize Iranian crimes
you want to do it okay but it's like
criticizing the crimes of Genghis Khan
you can't do anything about it so it's
just a way of you know supporting
domestic power or your own reputation
what matters is what you can do
something about and overwhelmingly that
means what you're involved in either
directly or indirectly and we understand
that in the case of enemies we go to
apply the same criteria to ourselves if
you try to do an evaluation of British
actions us actions French actions and so
on yeah you can find things that
sometimes are even helpful so for
example take george w bush not my
favorite person but of his policies with
regard to say diseases in africa we're
pretty positive i think okay that's fine
but
uh I don't think it's a huge issue
frankly so thank you so much
