thinking about the various kinds of
technical ways in which representation
can take place that don't really carry
us very far almost because what really
matters is what kind of socio-economic
arrangements are there now here we go
back to I think you have to start with
something more fundamental for plenty of
hierarchic relations in society all
kinds from family to international
affairs I think we should always ask the
question wherever there is such a
structure is it legitimate and there's a
burden of proof it has to prove its
legitimacy it's not automatically self
legitimating so wherever there's a
structure of authority domination
hierarchy patriarchal family the
International Affairs anything
in-between the question of legitimacy of
the structure arises sometimes you can
justify a structure of dominance but
very rarely and wherever you can't it
ought to simply be dismantled and that's
across the spectrum and it can be done
in many different ways so say the the
feminist revolution of the last roughly
generation had a big impact on certain
kinds of dominant structures okay that's
quite significant that worker owned
enterprises set the basis up for a
different kind of economic and political
structure and they exist as some of them
in fact are quite substantial
the Mondragon conglomerate in Spain is
first of all economically quite
successful it's one of the few parts of
the Spanish economy that's going to
survive this austerity devastating
austerity policies but it also is
democratic in a way which
show up in method of voting and so on
and I think those are kind of the major
factors that have to be looked at the
kinds you mentioned are important and I
don't you could debate exactly how it
could be done but I mean I don't see how
any complex system can avoid some sort
of representative democracy I only just
can't have a vote on everything but the
representative should be accountable
recallable subject to constant
surveillance and control and
interchangeable and that does have you
know there can be negative aspects to
that but I can't see that much can be
avoided
