back to the UN resolution did call for
stopping the flow of arms into Gaza in
fact but it also quote ensures the
sustained reopening of the crossing
points on the basis of the 2005
agreement on movement and access between
the Palestinian Authority and Israel
what was the 2005 agreement that
determined that the crossings to Gaza
would be operated on a continuous basis
that is never closed and that Israel
would also allow the crossing of goods
between Gaza and the West Bank the two
parts of Palestine in January 2006 the
US and Israel abandoned the agreement
that's part of the punishment of
Palestinians for voting the wrong way in
a free election we take democracy very
seriously here must be understood
there's a good deal of sober debate
these days on what the attackers hope to
achieve I don't think that's very
obscure when we took a take a brief look
at recent history Israel abandon Gaza in
September 2005 why well rational Israeli
hardliners like Ariel Sharon as the
patron saint of the settler movement
understood that it was senseless to
subsidize a few thousand settlers to
live illegally of course in the ruins of
Gaza protected by a large part of the
IDF the Israeli army while they took
over used much of the land and scarce
resources of the territory including its
water it made much more sense to turn
Gaza into what's properly been called
the world's largest prison and two unlit
the people just rot and to transfer the
settlers to the West Bank which is much
more value
territory and they can be subsidized
illegally to live there a couple other
places Israel is quite explicit in its
intentions about the West Bank in Word
and in deed the goal is clearly too and
they say it to annex the air the arable
land that's the water supplies the
pleasant suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv all of those that lie within what
they call the separation wall and
annexation wall it was declared illegal
by the World Court the US Justice
agreeing but of course that's again
irrelevant in outlaw states the
territory to be annexed includes vastly
expanded Jerusalem that's in violation
of security council orders that go back
to 40 years in addition Israel will take
over and in fact has been taking over
the Jordan Valley it's about a third of
the West Bank that imprisons what's left
the part that's imprisoned is broken
into fragments by settled salience to
major said ence that basically trisect
the territory and many other settlements
and hundreds of mostly arbitrary
checkpoints which are designed to make
life impossible for the two-headed
beasts who may remain and will be like a
drugged roaches scurrying around in a
bottle I'm quoting the highest Israeli
political and military leaders in this
case the revered Prince's as they're
called the owners of the land may grant
the drug roaches a few scattered parcels
but that's out of goodwill and not by
right Prime Minister Olmert you may
recall addressed a joint session of
Congress and me too
2006 and to rousing applause and a
standing ovation he said I believed and
to this day still believe in our peoples
eternal and historic right to this
entire land his start the entire land
includes at least everything from the
Jordan to the sea and given his
background it may include Jordan as well
to which it laid this party lead claim
the he also announced the program that's
for what he called convergence that's
for taking over a program for taking
over whatever is valuable in the West
Bank leaving the Palestinians and
isolated Canton's such plans trace are
not new you know maybe the details are
but they traced back to the earliest
days of the occupation a few days after
the end of the war defense minister
Moshe Dayan who among the Israeli
leadership is perhaps the most
sympathetic to the palestinian plight he
explained poetically that the situation
today resembles the complex relationship
between a Bedouin man and a girl he
kidnaps against her will you
Palestinians as a nation don't want us
today but will change your attitude by
forcing our presence on you you will
live like dogs and whoever will leave
will leave and meanwhile we'll take what
we want that's 1967 at the very moment
there was no doubt that these Paul
announced policies were criminal
immediately after the 1967 war the
Israeli government was informed by its
highest legal authority Theodore may run
well-known international figure in
international law they were informed
that the civilian settlement in the
administered territories what they call
them
contravenes the explicit provisions of
the Fourth Geneva Convention that's a
serious crime and it's incumbent on all
of the High Contracting Parties that
parties that signed the Geneva
Convention it's incumbent on them to act
to prevent such crimes of course they
don't do it the United States not only
doesn't do it but that's the crimes but
again in an outlaw state that's an
irrelevant so he's no discussion of it
that's Theodore Mayron he was supported
by the Israel Israel's Justice Minister
concurred in his judgment and the World
Court unanimously endorsed that
conclusion in its decision in 2004 on
the annexation wall meanwhile the
Israeli High Court formally agreed with
the World Court while disagreeing in its
usual convoluted style if you look at
the judgments in the West Bank Israel
can pursue its criminal programs with
you a support and with no disturbance
that's thanks to its effective military
control and by now also the cooperation
of the collaborationist Palestinian
security forces that have been armed and
trained by the United States and its
allies it can also carry out regular
assassinations and other crimes while
the settlers rampage under IDF
protection but while the West Bank has
been effectively subdued by terror there
still is resistance in the other half of
Palestine the Gaza Strip that too has to
be quelled for the us-israeli programs
of annexation and destruction of
Palestinians to proceed hence the
invasion of Gaza the timing of the
invasion was probably presumably
influenced by the coming Israeli
elections a hood Barack who runs the
invasion
had been lagging badly in the polls but
one Israeli commentator run huh Kahane
in the early days of the slaughter
calculated that for every 4 840 Arabs
killed a barrack gains one parliamentary
seat however the reasons why much deeper
than winning an election I think the
reasons are those that I mentioned and
they're really on the surface doesn't
take much insight to perceive them well
aggression always has a pretext in this
case there's a mantra that's endlessly
repeated you've heard it a thousand
times in Israel and the United States
and in Europe and the mantra is that
Israel has the right to use force to
defend itself against kassam rockets and
that's partially accurate the rocketing
is a criminal act and it's true that a
state has the right to defend itself
against criminal attacks but the claim
that a right that the state has the
right to use force to do so goes far
beyond any principle that we would or
should accept
