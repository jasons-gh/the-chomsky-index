Oh Ellen until Kotoko allottee the fat
who alleged ERT Reza okay if I cannot
relate Oh a number of times the earlier
efforts were from Israel but it was
always closed could get in Gaza
I've been involved in Palestinian issues
for 75 years old story and Gaza has a
special place because of the
specific personal mrs. role in the
Palestinian system for active central
role but also because of the unusually
harsh and savage treatment it's been
subjected to for a long time most
recently in the case of the cast led
operations 2008-2009 but also just
because of the state of siege that was
imposed after the 2006 January 2006
election so I'm particularly interested
in going to get into the West Bank a
number of times actually and this an
opportunity came up but it was an
international conference of language
linguistics and good friend of mine a
former student actually it's really what
my next patriot
it was organizing the international
delegation she asked me to come I also
received invitations I was glad to take
the opportunity Melinda I eat all feel
as Monica but I want the bark and the
low God and few dozen well I met a
number of a range of people and actually
most of the people I met were students
at the University because I was at the
University most of the time but the
group went together to con Janice for a
day we met
Paris people there officials engineers
sawsan we're able to get a little bit to
the refugee camps in Gaza City itself
like I met people from ranging from the
Prime Minister spot idea to
activists to faculty students didn't get
out too much into the streets at that
time and that a fair range of people and
I might have read a lot about
see wasn't surprised in general but it's
rather striking to see it directly what
I saw I actually reminded me right away
of wonderful what was written about 35
years ago I guess by Roger Shahada at
which he identified the main
characteristic of the Palestinian people
as some of endurance no matter what they
do to us we're gonna endure will
continue and finish striking in Gaza no
I also met other friends like Rajesh -
Ronnie that's erotic and others but yeah
it's quite dramatic to see the capacity
of people to go on with their lives to
resist to keep struggling for the future
under conditions of extreme duress on
the college campuses there's a lot of
vitality
Leia's ended a home imaginable stuff but
it's a mixture I mean I don't feel after
a few days that I'm confident to
describe the spirit of people of Gaza
but the sense I got also from talking to
others you know a lot better than I do
like serenity and Suraj hey for example
that there is a lot of enthusiasm and
vitality but also a kind of an
underlying sense especially when the
youth of desperation that is some of
somebody described it to me as a powder
keg ready to burst the way it did during
the First Intifada because there's just
so much that people can take before it
blows up and they are being very
consciously and purposely strangled
primarily by Israel but Egypt is playing
its role as well listen
did this at a hospital was surgeon in
chief the doctors there
though they describe this isn't
communist not to as a hospital they the
extreme shortages there's some medicines
there's no surgical equipment they try
to save somebody's life and they need
some simple equipment they don't have it
this is blocked
it's really Gaza Egypt ordered now of
course nothing will come through the
Israeli
some things that get illegally through
tunnels but some things they can't it's
it's pretty shocking that these
materials are blocked by Egypt they
forget the loot
I'm done I don't recommend it to anyone
it was about three hours come again
few hundred meters and approximately the
same leaving most of it apparently just
bureaucratic paper shuffling as far as I
could tell
it should take five minutes look at your
passport see who you are but you but
there's no custom it's a bit of look at
what we're bringing in around it's just
waiting people sitting there waiting for
hour after hour or well something is
being done in a couple of back rooms
would it maybe I don't know it's
and it's not tragic it's unnecessary
severe or annoyance it ends for the
people engaged it increases this sense
that they are trapped you know they're
animals trapped in a cage from every
side and the thin ability that something
as simple was crossing it to the
neighboring state
mostly friendly steak adds another layer
of humiliation and insult to the tragedy
their daily largely they was Anna

is concerned for the fate of suffering
people and in this case totally
unnecessary suffering their ways out of
this and very severe suffering this is
after all
well the suffering goes way back their
land was taken away from a monthly
driven out since 1967 it's been a
harsher military occupation brutal tens
of thousands arrested torture beatings
humiliation physical attacks aggression
in the case of Gaza in particular
trapped in a state of siege separated
from the rest of Palestine by the United
States and Israel for now 20 years in
explicit violation explicit violation of
the Oslo Accords that they signed with
great publicity which declare Gaza the
West Bank to be a territory in unity US
and Israel immediately moved to separate
them in Gaza they've carried out a
policy that
the scholars and Sarah Roy of Harvard
University's most of the work on Gaza
describes as de developpement
it's not that Gaza is an underdeveloped
society it's a deep developed society
image is a unique phenomenon em guess it
could be a relatively prosperous
Mediterranean country except rich
agricultural resources beautiful beaches
might have them destroyed by sewage
because they can't construct sewage
plants the rich fishing areas except
they can't fish because the Israeli Navy
has taken over Gaza in territorial
waters and keeps the fishermen within a
couple of kilometers of the shore and
even sitting in their seaside hotel we
could hear machine gunfire out in the
and the ocean is really done cheers
driving fishing boat starts sure so they
have to pollute to efficient polluted
waters instead of going out then at
everybody kept from the border by big
areas that take over a lot of the arable
land and the one step after another is
just constant humiliation of destruction
that's Gaza
then there's the West Bank mr. Israel
with us backing is systematically taking
over
systematic plans also totally illegal
recognized on all sites that it's
illegal violation of fundamental
humanitarian law violation of explicit
Security Council resolutions and so on
but as long as the u.s. backs them they
think they can do whatever they like
essentially the plans that are right now
being implemented for the West Bank
traced back to 1967 they've been given
various names over the year a
long-planned sure unplanned Yahoo
planned variants of war or less the same
scheme take a essentially take over
whatever's valuable and leave the rest
that isolated separate rights them but
describe the details and that's
basically what it amounted to what so
sure the problem is very severe for
anyone who cares about human beings in
their fate other than forgot the book

Masefield there's nothing I can do it
would be a martyr I slowed my call the
fate of all it depends on whether
outside powers impose it more likely I
think there's another possibility
we don't have internal documents from
Israel in the United States so we can
inspect your they don't like but I'm
plenty of documents was not specific
enough if you look at the things that
have been happening the separation of
Gaza from the West Bank by the US and
Israel which has been going on for 20
years the development of Gaza the
punishment of Gaza this specific
operations like a sled all seem to have
one systematic scene behind them get rid
of them get them to leave and in fact
that's an explicit science told quite
official goal since 400 years
the Palestinians normally belong here
it's our land they can be just as happy
somewhere else after 1967 speaking of
the West Bank in this case Moshe Dayan
who was the defense minister and in
charge of the west of the West occupied
territories and and incidentally among
the Israeli leadership one of those who
was most sympathetic to the plight of
the Palestinians that some grew up with
money felt some sympathy for them and he
spoke to his colleagues frankly he said
we should tell the refugees that we have
nothing for them they will live like
dogs and those who leave will leave and
we'll see where this leads
it's almost direct translation from the
internal records and that's that's
expresses a kind of an underlying theme
sometimes official like they have no
place here they couldn't go to Iraq the
but I think it's a it's a it's often
implemented in practice that's what it
means to so stick say the Jordan Valley
which is real plainly plans today so
it's the way they're doing it is a way
that goes back 100 years establish a
military zone so people aren't allowed
into it
Palestinians were in and have to leave
after all a military zone nobody can
come in start digging wells begin to
build settlements call the military
settlements at first pretty soon
you have settlements and cities and so
on that is exactly a pattern that goes
back 100 years it's being done all over
what's called Aris seeds the area that
Israel controls about 16 percent of the
West Bank and Palestinian and
Palestinian proposal requests for
construction let say routinely denied
virtually none immunity that's what they
can't expand the population grows more
and more constricted life becomes more
and more impossible and the option is to
leave and among more privileged sectors
who were more able to exercise that
option that's happening one of the
reasons the Christian population has
declined directly
yes it could be going back to Gaza I
can't prove this but just looking at the
systemic behavior that that is in fact
the goal for example if you take a look
at cast led looked at you took a look at
the bombing which was very
Israel could bomb anywhere they like to
populations defenseless they trap rats
into what you like
I was very and it's a sophisticated
military
now if you have a defenseless victims
you can do what you like the bombing was
centered in the populated areas as a
city it wasn't much bombing in the south
the bombing was they had no detectable
military purpose of course they claimed
it was military if you look at what was
being done it was essentially picking
out places that would intimidate terrify
of the population and perhaps induced
them to flee to the south it could be
that that and that's would be that that
was one of the purposes just shortly
before that that cast lid there it was
an incident which what we call where
people in Gaza just out of frustration
broke through the Egyptian gate and
thousands poured into the northern Sinai
and Israel was not opposed to that in
fact some of the minister's fine and
it's good of you yeah I mean we don't
need them there
it wasn't an official position but there
were statements that effect and it's
conceivable that one of the long-term
goals is to do what is clearly being
done in the West Bank and as I say it
goes back to the origins of the whole
Zionist Enterprise induce them to leave
well if that works they go into the
Sinai the next step would be that Israel
could retake Kazon turn it into the
prosperous Mediterranean resort that it
would be become that in fact they were
trying to do that during the period of
the occupation now that could be a
long-term goal I can't read their minds
but and so no that might be part of the
reason for Egypt their resistance to
permitting the border to become a normal
order possibly deficits that they like
even our Lord our fee must and must not
alone though Lemuria Tata has even Alec
famous Obama in an Outlook and now say
was a relevant article yet well you know
there's a million and a half people in
jazz so whatever they do
in terms of numbers it's not gonna
affect Egypt in terms of their
constitution of the population
yeah little makes it would mix into
Egypt maybe basically on notice and on
the other hand Egypt certainly doesn't
want that to happen there's a kind of a
struggle going part of the reason why
Israel imposes such a harsh regimen on
Gaza
you know like blocking toys because
there are security threat and things
like that is that they want to become
more dependent on the SAP on the no
these is funded you
that's why Israel doesn't really try to
block the tunnel economy don't sometimes
the bomb tunnels
no sign of strength or something to does
they more or less let it go but if they
wanted to they could destroy it of
course they can just do anything they
want their that total control but at the
same time Egypt seems to be resisting
they don't want to take responsibility
for Gaza so so you know I mean must
suffer dozens of Nadella container
Mubarak can allow it again a miracle
well a canal and by the Maison arabe on
our own Laden equivalent normal length
worketh even and loves real Callicoon
connect gated we must leave our industry
a talk on an Israeli
not that they know about our a Leela
probably already do a nasty little good
you seen it yes it depends very much on
what kind of country Egypt is and
becomes it's just another direction
Mubarak had very close relations with
Israel of the intelligence systems
cooperates closely they find relations
and the popular movements in Egypt are
not happy about this and never work so
if you go back to the 1979 treaty for
the Egyptian elite you know it was fine
and so on they want to preserve it the
population doesn't look as far as I can
tell doesn't oppose the treaty but they
do oppose the way it was interpreted
yeah the 1979 treaty had a first of all
it did include provisions for
Palestinian autonomy but Israel agreed
but then instantly rejected them and
moved on to
expand the take over Palestinian
territory but more critically from a
strategic point of view the treaty was
interpreted in Israel right away and in
fact overtly here you can go brick went
to the documents as a rationally as
freeing Israel to take over the
territories and attack its northern lit
neighbor because as a potential security
restriction had been eliminated
I'm an Egypt after all as the only it's
a really significant military Commerce's
in the Arab world and if that's removed
Israel's free to carry out its other
objectives and in fact that's exactly
what happened after the treaty the
expansion of settlement escalated it
increased and very quickly is real
attacked lemon the 1982 Lebanon War and
then since then there's been another
attack

Kevin animal Obama see her bother the
red line with regard to Egypt okay God
of Egypt stops backing the Accords that
will be a red line yeah
take a look at the Accord the Oslo
accord is referring to actually I
immediately wrote articles and started
giving talks look at a Yanni and more
have at the Camp David well it's all you
look at Camp David
yeah well but you know Egypt as far as I
can tell the Egyptian population is not
calling for rescinding the 1978-1979
treating they're calling for
implementing it so the 1979 treaty
explicitly a cold for moves towards meet
the autonomy for the Palestinians okay
that's the 1979 treaty for them where
there's nothing in the 1979 treaty that
says it should be interpreted as
offering is really means to expand its
escalation of the of settlements and to
attack its northern neighbor that's not
written into the treaty that's an
interpretation of it Obama probably
wants it to be interpreted that way
okay that's his brother but then he
can't talk about that as maintaining the
treaty his actual red line is that the
treaty should not be implemented but
what should be implemented is
the us-israeli version of it meaning no
autonomy for the Palestinians increasing
settlement and freeing Israel to use
force will as it started the new one

my said mrs. teeman your indeed oh who
Oxford Lee is relieved
well but it was a major change in 1967
the current us-israeli relationship was
basically established after the June
1967 war before it before that or
reasonably close reasonably close
relations but not that extreme as you
recall in 1956 Eisenhower forced Israel
along with France and England out of the
Sinai and in fact he did so the most
sensitive political moment right on the
eve of an election but that didn't
bother and he just the longer going
you've got to get out they forced them
out the Kennedy administration was mixed
but didn't 67 had changed radically and
since 1967 it's been pretty stable not
too many changes
as far as Obama and Romney are concerned
that were on these position is extreme
if it believes what it's saying or even
understands what it's saying it's kind
of outlandish Obama on the other hand
has always been extremely supportive of
his reelection I wrote about him even
before the 2008 election just looking at
his website and if it's still there I
suggest that people look at it I first
had a section on it about the Middle
East
most of it was expressing his adoration
of Israel there was a maybe a sentence
or two about the Palestinians saying
well you know maybe they have some
rights of the most interesting part
there's about Lebanon this was late 2007
right before the election right after
the 2006 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and
he did have a section about that as a
senator he didn't do very much but one
of the things he did that he was most
proud of was that in the middle of the
Israeli attack on Lebanon his recall was
a devastating destructive attack on
civilians he co-sponsored a Senate
resolution instructing the US government
not to do anything to inhibit the
Israeli invasion until it had reached
its enacted and they punish Iran and
Syria if they tried to support the
resistance to the Israeli invasion that
was one of his great fries when he
was elected on November 4th 2008
actually the day on which that Israel
exploited to invade Gaza killed half a
dozen Hamas activists and break the
truce there had been a truce which Hamas
had observed 100% not a single run yeah
but they broke the truce on Election Day
then things went on up until late
December when there was an opportunity
to reinstate the truth split Israel
chose instead to invade Obama was asked
if he hadn't yet been inaugurated he was
asked about it and what he said was
there's only one president not me and
therefore I can't say anything his staff
did release a statement describing in
which a law expressed his feelings that
if his daughters were being subjected to
an attack he'd do anything to stop it
referring to steroid not not to Gaza
which was being destroyed in the Israeli
invasion was timed explicitly to end
immediately before the inauguration so
and he was inaugurated there's then only
one president yes and he made a
statement he said now is the time to
look forward not backward and it goes on
from there Dez no get a Henry Kissinger

talking about the American population
here the American political leadership
American elites after night they were
very grateful for Israel's victory in 67
it's it's important to understand that
Israel performed a major service to the
United States there was a conflict at
the time between secular nationalism
based in Egypt and radical Islamic
fundamentalism based in Saudi Arabia
which is of course where the oil is the
u.s. like written before it has rather
systematically supported radical Islam
against secular nationalism and as a
reason for that secular nationalists
like Nasser threatened to take over the
resources of the region and use them for
the benefit of the domestic populations
instead of for the west and skimming off
some to enrich themselves and that's
unacceptable and there was an actual war
going on between Saudi Arabia and Egypt
the proxy war in the Yemen
well Israel
delivered a smashing blow to secular
nationalism that's a gift to the United
States and it's Souda Ally and right at
that point policy changed towards its
present situation in fact in 1970
something important did have it and
Black September it it seemed for a while
as if Syria might intervene to protect
the Palestinians who were being
decimated by the Jordanian forces and
the United States didn't want that they
regarded that as a threat to the
monarchies of the Gulf the United States
was completely tied down in Southeast
Asia at that time couldn't do much so
they called on Israel to mobilize its
forces to mourn Syria and not to move
and in fact Syria backed off US aid to
Israel
virtually quadrupled at that point it
did strengthen the already existent
alliance
yes that was ginger but in - and it went
on from there
Kissinger's main intervention was a year
later in February 1971 a very important
event took place through the mediation
of a Norwegian UN mediator clearing
there was a proposal for a full peace
treaty between Egypt and Israel offering
nothing to the Palestinians they weren't
an issue at the time the returned for
withdrawal from the Sinai in effect he
said everything he meant the Sinai and
and so not accept that Israel rejected
it they said they didn't want to
withdraw from the Sinai the question was
how the US would react because they're
the boss after all and there was a split
inside the US government the Secretary
of State William Rogers
was apparently in favor of it
it was basically his own plan Henry
Kissinger was National Security Adviser
was explicitly opposed to it
he wrote composing and he said we have
to maintain what he called stalemate no
negotiations just forced and he took for
granted that Israel had the force to do
whatever like and that he couldn't mount
any opposition well you know what
happened after that set out tried very
hard to get the United States to do
something they kicked out the Russian
advisors offered just about anything and
Kissinger refused
in fact Sadat had an interview and not
long before the October war which was I
think one of the American journals
Newsweek I think in which he said that
he's confronting two enemies who will
not budge an inch
Golda Meir and Henry Kissinger right
through 1973 we know from released
internal records that Kissinger was
continuing to try to block any any
diplomatic move again assuming his rule
was so powerful it didn't matter
well that's Henry Kissinger that was
very crucial at that point there was a
choice for Israel between security and
expansion hmm with Egypt removed they
get almost total security and they chose
expansion and Kissinger backed them up
and that's well as in the futility haha
