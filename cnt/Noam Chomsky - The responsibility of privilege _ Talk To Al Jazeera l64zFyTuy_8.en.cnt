linguist and political activist Noam
Chomsky vigorous as ever at the age of
84 Chomsky's popularity or notoriety is
somewhat set indoors because he is still
criticizing politicians business leaders
and other powerful figures for not
acting in the public's best interest at
the heart of Chomsky's work examining
the ways elites use their power to
control millions of people and pushing
the public to resist and it is his
activism that keeps this us scholar
engaged in the public discourse well
into his ninth decade today on talk to
Al Jazeera a conversation with Noam
Chomsky
professor Noam Chomsky thank you for
talking to Al Jazeera with you you've
described your life as taking two tracks
one the track of political activism and
the other the track of research into
language the study of linguistics and
over the years you've noted that
political activism has taken up more of
your time and you'd like to spend more
time on your research first how did the
activism outpace the academic work well
I'm after the activism for me long
antedates the professional work I grew
up that way so I was a political
activist as a teenager in the 1940s
before I ever heard of linguistics I
really got back into it intensively back
in the early 60s when things started to
develop in many domains civil rights
anti-war movement all sorts of things
and I knew enough about it from
experience to know that it's not the
kind of thing you can put your toe in
and then walk away once you get into it
it's all-encompassing for one thing it's
urgent
they're real human beings involved and
their needs and so on that plainly is
more important than any moral scale than
discovering something new about the
structure of language so it just tends
to fill every empty space and over the
years as active involvement in one or
another thing and created a number of
issues and crises and the engagements
and demands just keeps going up I mean
when I go home tonight all right at
least a dozen letters regretfully
declining an invitation to do something
because I can't and it just keeps going
up so it does tend to crowd out other
thing
is it the responsibility of academics
and other intellectuals to be engaged
politically or every other human being
I mean responsibility basically is
measured by opportunity if you're a poor
person living in the slums and you have
to work 60 hours a week to put bread on
the table your responsibilities less
than if you have a degree of privilege
for obvious reasons now is that now if
you have privilege are you more
obligated yes your privilege you have
the more opportunity to have the more
opportunity you have the more
responsibility you have it's elementary
so why don't we see that in the United
States there so there's been so much
talk about people getting richer many
many more people growing poor and yet
the rich are seemingly resistant to
giving more of their time of giving more
of their wealth giving more of their
talent this assignment that's why they
rich I mean if you dedicate your life to
enriching yourself and those are your
values and you don't care what happens
anyone else then of course you won't
care what happens anyone else so it's
self selected it's also institutional in
its most extreme and pathological form
it's the nine Rand ideology I just don't
care of anyone else I'm only interested
in benefiting myself and that's good and
Noble how do you change the institution
how do you change the system that says
it's okay to be so selfish that all of
your actions that you don't ascend chily
you're not taking responsibility for
your actions you're taking
responsibility to yourself to maximize
your own short-term gain
I should say there are much worse cases
than systemic risk and bringing down the
financial system that's bad enough but
there's another externality that's much
more severe a destruction of the species
and that's not a joke
for if we it's imminent that global
warming will cause a major catastrophe
you can argue about the details but not
much doubt that it's coming and if you
don't pay attention to it because it's
an externality I'm interested in gain
not what happens to my grandchildren
then you're going to accelerate the
disaster that's the most severe of all
of them but there's it goes from
transaction about a car to that that's
just inherent in market systems so how
do you change it well you constrain and
control the system or else just overcome
it
so for example it's not a law of nature
for example in the 1950s in the 1960s
which was the biggest growth period in
American history financial institutions
were regulated the New Deal regulations
were in place and there were no
financial crises none banks functioned
like banks you put your money in them
they lend it to somebody wants to you
know buy a house or send a kid to
college or whatever it is that's what
banks are supposed to do it's starting
in the nineteen seventies have changed
pretty radically there were decisions
made not laws of nature to reconstruct
the economy so as to undermine domestic
production it's called globalization
ended up to Bangladesh and to shift
investment to financial finit fanat
financed rather than production and
partly those because of the declining
rate of profit and production partly is
just decision well that had all kinds of
these two things had tremendous
consequences that's what's called the
neoliberal program everywhere it's been
applied it virtually it's been pretty
harmful
different ways like in Latin America
where it was applied very severely that
a couple of decades of disaster in the
Middle East a large part of what lies
behind say the Tahrir Square uprising is
the brutal effects of the neoliberal
programs that Mubarak was imposing
following IMF in the World Bank and that
mercy is now reinstating but and in the
West it's at one effect is the austerity
programs in Europe which are devastating
southern Europe in the United States
rich country had different effects the
effects are the dramatic concentration
of wealth the stagnation and decline for
much of the population the increasing
poverty which you mentioned for really
repressed parts of the population it
really is a catastrophe so when you come
back to the question of activism and
your contention that every person needs
to stand up are you seeing in both the
Occupy movement and in the numbers of
people who came out in 2012 to try to
protect the vote to try to push for
legislators who would put in more humane
economic policies do you see those seeds
as being potentially fruitful for the
United States or have things simply gone
too far in the goalt direction nothing's
ever going too far
anything can be reversed these are human
decisions but they have to it has to
take it has to gain much more power
momentum and force I mean what the
concurrent direction is in the wrong
trajectory after you take a look at this
morning's newspaper sometimes it's
almost comical front page of today's New
York Times there's a story about AIG
huge insurance company which was making
taking very risky actions in order to
bring in high profit and it crashed and
it was going to crash most of the
economy the big investment firms like
Goldman Sachs would have collapsed and
so on so the taxpayer came in and
rescued them and now they're suing the
government because it was too high an
interest rate when they were bailed out
I mean that's almost surreal you know I
don't know what word you used to
describe it the arrogance and the sense
of justification for myself you know I
need everything you know the guy who's
leading the suit is a multi-billionaire
you know but it wasn't enough that they
bailed him out and saved them from
bankruptcy they should have done it for
free they should have done it even with
less blizzard acosta to him you know I
don't know why I described it and that's
the kind of it's already this suit has
already imposed a considerable burden on
the taxpayer just in litigation costs
and there'll be more but that you know
that arrogance that's I don't know what
word to use to describe it when you
raise the point about a lot of the
opposition to President Obama
particularly since his reelection in
part because of his race in part because
of what people think his policies are
I'm thinking of what has just happened
here in the United States
his rounding out of his national
security team and watching already the
criticisms of his choices I'm wondering
whether the criticism is simply driven
out of a desire to deny the sitting
president his nominees or whether there
are real questions being raised in
particular about how the US deals with
groups such as Hamas or with countries
such as Iran
or and whether or not the US is
undercutting its moral stature by
continuing to use drones to take out
targets yes and you know Whitney oh do
you which which is it are you know are
these legitimate questions that are
being grappled with or is this just
about political blockage I mean that
would be a legitimate question but
unfortunately that's not what's being
raised except way at the margins what's
being raised is the opposite we're not
doing enough we're not militant enough
we're not violent enough there's almost
no broad protest against the global
assassination campaign unfortunately
it's outrageous
it actually undercuts principles of
anglo-american law that go back to the
13th century does President Barack Obama
have a moral compass and if he does is
he ignoring it at his own peril at the
country's peril interesting question I
was during the last election I happen to
be talking to a well-known black
activist very much involved in civil
rights and other activism and he told me
a story he said that after Obama's first
election 2008 he was visited by a group
of African American women leading
activists who wanted to talk to him he
said he was there when they came out of
the meeting I asked them what was like
and their answer was this man has no
moral Center that's their reaction I
think they're right if you look at his
policies I think that's what they reveal
I mean there's some nice rhetoric here
and there but you look at the actual
policies pretty shocking
the drone assassination camp campaign
it's a perfectly good example I mean
it's just a global assassination
campaign where his efforts to try to
keep Israel from expanding settlements
didn't make the effort he said a couple
of words effort it was no it was no
or let me just look at his predecessors
say George Bush the first I mean when
Israel was the Bush administration
ministration they don't really oppose
the expansion of settlements but they
were opposed to the brazen offensive way
in which was being done so when say
Secretary of State Baker would land in
Jerusalem the Prime Minister Shamir
would announce that day we're putting up
a new settlement oh you know patrician
American elites don't like to be
insulted to their face so the Bush
administration actually imposed
penalties did Obama do anything no he
just said it's not helpful and then in
at the Security Council February 2011 it
was actually a resolution which was
calling for implementation of official
US policy Obama vetoed what does that
tell you he's telling Netanyahu and
other Israeli leaders and I'll tap you
on the wrist but go ahead and do what
you like
and in fact during the settlement freeze
take a look at what happened it didn't
stop a construction continued in East
Jerusalem the projects that were started
were continued there were all sorts of
exceptions and the US did nothing
so in fact Obama is the actually the
first president who hasn't really
imposed restrictions on Israel is one
interesting case right now it's the case
of what's called
II one you know there's this corridor
between the town of Malta to me and
Greater Jerusalem which for 20 years is
really wanting to build their that would
complete the biceps virtual bisection of
the West Bank
without it there could be no contiguous
Palestinian state yeah I mean actually
there can't be any way but with this it
kind of ends it every American president
has blocked it and in fact what Israel's
had to do is sort of find devious ways
around it like putting up a police
station
something but they have been able to
develop it now they've announced that
they're going to develop it Obama's
reaction and claw Hillary Clinton was it
wouldn't be helpful in other words we're
not going to do anything about it
well if and in fact the US continues to
support it provides the economic aid
military diplomatic support and so on
that allows it to continue Israeli
leaders can see that they don't care
about a statement saying it's not
helpful fine it's not helpful okay so
it's it's just the opposite he's been
unusually soft on Israel in fact it's
what every president has blocked things
including the second George Bush not
Obama and in fact if you look back at
his record it's not surprising I
actually wrote about this before the
2008 primaries just looking at his web
page it was advert self advertising and
it was pretty striking there's this big
section on the Middle East and it's
almost all about love for Israel that is
probably nothing about Palestinians and
maybe they should have some rights or
something but what was interesting was
Lebanon this was remember right after
the Israeli invasion of Lebanon 2006 and
he describes with pride the fact that he
co-sponsored a Senate resolution the
calling on the executive not to do
anything to hamper the Israeli invasion
and for the more to punish Syria and
Iran if they tried to impede it I don't
have to describe to you what the
invasion was like that's what he was
boasting about what can you expect one
quick final point on the media something
very close to my heart
we're coming into the u.s. and it has
for lack of a better phrase upset some
people what is it about sources of
information about language that makes
people think that they have to try to
control it they don't like what it says
it's pretty straightforward I mean why
doesn't anyone report the fact that
there's a very straightforward way to
deal with the what's alleged to be the
greatest threat to peace in the world
well I want to hear that and that's
pretty normal
that's in the case of Al Jazeera there's
something else as well there's a
background of anti-muslim racism which
is quite deep and that's part of it and
it is deep actually wanted one of the
funniest press conferences I've ever
read about it was partially recorded was
a couple of years ago under the Bush
administration the Emir of Qatar came to
Washington and Colin Powell who was
Secretary of State
tried to urge him to call off al Jazeera
in like the things they were reporting
and the Emir I suppose the sense of
humor or something gave a press
conference in which he sort of gave a
mocking speech in which he informed the
press about this thing called freedom of
the press he wasn't going to interfere
and so and so forth barely reported but
must have been pretty funny I wish I had
been there but there's a double and it's
true that el Jazeera you could read
about say the bombing of Lebanon you
could see the bombing of Lebanon the
bombing of Gaza
you know things happening in Iraq on al
Jazeera which you couldn't see you
literally couldn't see them because I
think at the time al Jazeera had two
small cable stations that were running
it
them in the Michigan with his big Arab
population and one somewhere up in
northern New Hampshire or something but
basically you couldn't see it unless you
went to the internet nobody knows to do
that and now they're yes they picked up
a cable station and as you say there's
birthdays small cable cable outlet
because you got a control information
and that's been understood for a long
time in fact it's quite striking that
there there are industries devoted to
controlling attitudes and opinions
conscience a very specific explicitly
it's called the public relations
industry and take a look at its founding
its documents and so on the goal is
control attitudes and opinion and it's
quite striking that the industry
developed in the freest countries in the
world it developed in England and the
United States about a century ago and
they were the countries that plenty of
restrictions but they were the most free
countries and the business world and the
conservative elements understood very
well that it's getting harder to control
people by force and the British
Conservative Party it's hard to control
people by force they're getting too many
rights you know parliamentary Labour
Party's women getting the right to vote
so on so we got it move on to
controlling attitudes and opinions
that's the but next way to control
people and so these huge industries
developed which are dedicated to that
that's exactly what they do and
furthermore in a sense everyone knows it
but nobody understands sees it so
suppose you turn on a television set
there's advertising that's the main task
of the PR industry commercial
advertising if you ever took a course in
economics you were taught that markets
are based on informed consumers making
rational choices okay turn on a
television set and look at an ad are
they trying to create informed consumers
will make rational choices like if you
see somebody driving a new car
are off into space you know with a
football player and a sexy actress is
that trying to create an informed
consumer making a rational choice
well emotional well the whole thing is
to try to create uninformed consumers
making irrational choices now going back
to responsibilities of intellectuals
they ought to be pointing out that this
huge industry is largely devoted to
undermining markets well suppose you
turn to elections which they now run the
PR industry basically runs the elections
are they trying to you look at
television ads they try to create
informed voters will make a rational
choice quite the opposite they want to
undermine democracy by creating
uninformed voters will make irrational
choices so we have this huge industry
spending hundreds of billions of dollars
a year dedicated to undermining markets
and democracy and nobody says it I mean
it's transparent you know it's not
profound at length my 10 year old
grandchildren but try to find somebody
who says it no it's just too deeply
ingrained we have to keep the mass of
the population uninformed marginalized
so that we you know the responsible men
can run things and this is very explicit
across the board progressive
intellectuals others I mean that's and
it's it's understandable
we are the elites and we should be in
control and the rattle out there are
stupid and ignorant and for their own
benefit we've got a delude and
controlled them it's like you don't let
a three-year-old run into the street you
know that's the way we have to treat the
population it's all very explicit and it
takes a kind of genius not to see it I
know that you are extremely busy you've
said to others I spend so much time on
my work I don't have time to go to the
movies or go out to dinner I feel bad
that I took up your time we should have
just gone out to dinner
so no I'm Chomsky thank you so much for
talking to Al Jazeera Kapoor thank you
