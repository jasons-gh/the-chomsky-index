as I say abstractly one cannot comment
comment on social security or any other
identification system one has to ask did
it arise through democratic
participation public discussion the
kinds of reflection and discourse that
would be to a legitimate Democrat
decision or did it come about simply by
executive order that's one question
second if the latter then we already
have a significant element of the
legitimacy if the former might be
legitimate or social security in the
United States as it's a public uses in
the benefits beneficial in many ways all
Social Security numbers then comes the
question of the that's the question of
how it seems to then comes the question
of how it's used is it used in an
abusive way to control people or is it
used to facilitate two people's everyday
lives to improve things look do to make
things easier for them and more
convenient so those are the questions
that have to be raised in the case of
the Indian system which I haven't
investigated would you describe the same
as abusive in both respect both that's
how it was in student and how it's used
