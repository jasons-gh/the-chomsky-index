I just gave a series of lectures at
Columbia on philosophy department and
one of them was on the theme of
something I called 40 years ago problems
and mysteries its problems meaning by
that a distinction between matters that
we are in principle capable of
understanding we may not understand them
but they fall within our cognitive reach
it's you can imagine how we might
understand that those are problems
mysteries simply fall behind our
cognitive reach and those are quite
deep-seated you're right in the
physicals and Sciences they're not
recognized enough but if you look over
the history of the physical sciences and
then when you get to the Social Sciences
this magnifies beyond the discussion but
at the core of the physical sciences the
hard physical sciences there are
mysteries for humans which are tacitly
understood to be beyond the level of
understanding a human understanding
there's classic moments of this you take
the early modern science revolution my
scientific revolution which began
basically with Galileo and his
contemporaries young early 17th century
they wanted to overcome neo scholastic
mysticism going back to you know with
its versatility at origins they were
confronting a scientific world in which
explanations were given in terms of what
were called occult forces the sympathies
and Tippa these things fall to the
ground because that it's their natural
place so on and so forth they wanted to
give real Galileo and others wanted to
give real explanations and they had a
concept of explanation of
intelligibility namely had to be a
mechanical explanation of the world had
to be accounted for as a machine and by
machine they meant something very
concrete
something that an artisan could build
somebody with gears and levers and so on
and so forth and in fact it was supposed
to have been built by a super skilled
artisan so the next an intelligible
account for say Galileo that would be an
account in terms of mechanical
principles was called the mechanical
philosophy the philosophy just met
science in those days
so mechanical science the world is a
machine and Galileo recognized that he
was incapable he lamented at the end of
his life he'd been incapable of
accounting for the motions of the
planets of the tides and so on and
mechanical terms so this was not yet
understood but the concept of
intelligibility was clear this goes
through the next century the great
scientists Huygens Descartes Leibniz
Newton all believed in the mechanical
philosophy and then a problem happened
the Newton discovered that it's false
the famous body-mind problem is based on
the assumption that body is explicable
in mechanical terms wine the big heart
recognized that there are things that
aren't explicable and mechanical terms
of actually the main one was normal use
of language for good reasons in fact but
so that was the basis of mind you had
these two substances Newton showed there
are no bodies he showed that nothing is
explicable in mechanical terms there are
no machines
this is totally misunderstood especially
in the social sciences where it's
assumed the mechanicals that Newton
showed that the world operates by
mechanical principles big machine he
showed the opposite be sure that you
cannot account for it in mechanical
terms Newton regarded this is a complete
absurdity
he said no person with any scientific
intelligence could accept this and he
spent the rest of his life trying to
overcome it he had various the problem
was having a counter for action at a
distance interaction without contact so
how can it be if I move my hands I move
the moon you know there's no contact
that's the mystical force but and he was
correct it was an absurdity but it was
true and it points to something that
goes beyond the level of human
intelligence how can we deal with the
world that's based on occult forces that
we cannot comprehend we have to accept
them because they're true but we can't
comprehend them well what happened that
this was well understood by his
contemporaries by John Locke later David
Hume right through the 18th century
since then has been forgotten the
concept a science simply limited its
goals when Sciences since Newton have
not attempted to develop an intelligible
account of the universe they have
lowered the goals to try to develop
theories that are intelligible that's a
much lower goal but to understand the
theory is one thing to understand what
it's talking about is another thing but
that goal has been abandoned well
there's a dramatic example of something
beyond the level of human intelligence
and it goes on from there when you go
into more complicated things than in
basic physics it expands all over the
place so for example the human choice or
animal choice it's completely
unintelligible to us I mean you can't
deny that it happens we all know
perfectly well that we make choices and
we make decisions but it's completely
it's not right beyond the range of
existing science no one has a coherent
idea of how you could explain it
probably because it lies beyond the
bounds of
cognitive capacities I'm if you think of
the things we can understand they pretty
much reduced to determinism and
randomness so we understand things being
determined like a machine you know you
turn a lever and something else turns
that are a thermostat I mean that kind
of thing we understand the concept of
random behavior that was understood in
the 17th century you know some things
just happen randomly but suppose
something falls beyond the bounds of
determinacy and randomness well it's
beyond our cognitive capacities and
that's what we'll enjoy seem to be like
