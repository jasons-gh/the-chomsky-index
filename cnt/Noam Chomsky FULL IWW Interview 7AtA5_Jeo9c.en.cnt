how workers in a piece you say that that
the financial crisis will presumably be
patched up somehow
leaving the institutions have created
the promotion place while thinking about
this I came to understand that working
people in the US and North American and
Europe basically are not coming they're
being helped by the stimulus with the
stimulus and the bailout are two
different things and not enough by the
stimulus is much too small it should be
much larger that's why they're you know
being unemployed but the you know the
policies are not made to reduce
unemployment they're made to help banks
there has been a recent upsurge of I'd
say a melting industrial action time in
workplaces turnout throughout Europe
also
a few in North America the first factory
occupation of the week since 1930
maybe no not quite because the
Youngstown steel that was an occupation
in 1979 I think and actually that's I
think I mentioned that in the article
it's a a model that really should be
pursued now they went on from to try to
have the work force in the community to
take over the fact the abandoned
factories the US Steel was dismantling
and they that effort was led pretty much
the legal effort that followed was led
by Staunton Lind radical labor lawyer
and I went at the courts and they were
they didn't win in the courts but they
could have won and if they could have
won it would have been with enough
support which they didn't have it it
could have meant a lot and in fact the
same thing could be done right now
republic windows the corporation saw
what was coming and sold it off which is
pretty normal but it ought to be done
right now on the in the auto industry
for example there's just no reason why I
mean other than weakness and lack of
kind of conception of how to proceed
there's no other reason why the
workforce and the communities and say
Detroit and Flint and so on can't take
over these installations that General
Motors is dismantling or selling off and
convert them take some assistance but
nothing like what the the bailout of the
banks convert them to say producing a
high-speed rail instead what's happening
I may
mentioned that in the article an already
cool is that the Obama administration is
using federal stimulus money to try to
get Spain and France to produce
high-speed rail for the United States
which badly needs it but not the
installations that are being dismantled
presumably those policies are more
profitable for the banks and other
financial institutions but that's a
perfect opportunity for the workforce
and the communities to simply proceed to
do what they were trying to do in
Youngstown yeah a little bit and
Republic and that is take over the
factories put them under worker
self-management produce what the country
needs badly needs like high-speed rail
for example or green technology and so
on that's what we should be doing
providing that spark you're right it's
reactive but the same was true of the
sit-down strikes in the thirties I mean
the reason the sit-down strikes struck
such fear and the parts of Management
was that they know that a sit-down
strike is just one step short of taking
over the factory and running it and
that's the end
so it seems the other video you could
provide that I feel that are at the
moment we're so we're getting numbers
and working with strength and power but
I feel that we're it were very much
lacking a certain level of seriousness
in in terms of how the rest of if we
could have us how the rest of the labor
movements as human thoughts and that
there would be a very difficult feat to
go from being you know the u.s. is
different from Europe of the country's
misters other industrial countries and
it's respect not Japan but many it has a
very the IRS's to a very unusual extent
of business run society they're all kind
of reasons for that
you know the feudal background the
institution's remained in place in
Europe didn't remain in place here they
were wiped out that's a lot of reasons
but the fact of the matter is the u.s.
is unusually is run by an unusually
class-conscious and the dedicated
business class that has a very violent
labor history much worse than Europe
goes pretty far no the attack on unions
has been far more extreme here and much
more successful there's also the proper
that business propaganda has been far
more successful so at a Union propaganda
is has been considerably more successful
here than in Europe even among working
people who would benefit by unions and
those are all things that infected a
rather striking aspect of a business
propaganda in the United States is the
demonization of government starting and
after the Second World War which I mean
the Second World War ended with
radicalization of the population in the
United States and everywhere else and
calls for more popular take over
government intervention workers take
over factories all kinds of things and
business initiated a tremendous
propaganda offensive it's been pretty
well studied but the scale is surprised
me when I read the scholarship its
enormous and it's been very effective
they're two major targets one is unions
the others democracy
well democracy means getting people that
regard government as an a and force
that's robbing them and oppressing them
not as their government in a democracy
it would be your government so in a
democracy on say the day when you pay
April 15th it would be a day of
celebration because you're getting
together to provide resources for the
programs that you decided on in the
United States it's a day of mourning
because you're you're this alien force
is coming to rob you of your hard-earned
money the alien force being the
government well that's the general
attitude and it's tremendous victory for
the opponents of democracy and of course
any privileged sectors nona hate
democracy so they won that one and
they've wanted a lot of respects you can
see it in the health care debate the
they have managed to instill the idea
that if in fact you take a look at the
recent polls majority of the population
thinks that if the government runs
health care they're going to take away
your freedom because that's that a and
force again that steals your taxes at
the same time the public favors a
national health care program
contradiction is somehow unresolved and
in the case of the business propaganda
it's particularly ironic because while
they want the population to hate
government they want the population for
the love of the government namely they
are in favor of a very powerful state
which works in their interest so you got
to love that government but hate the
government that might work in your
interest and you might control and
that's a interesting propaganda task
that has been carried off very well you
can see it in the worship worship of
Reagan worship is the right word this
kind of worship you don't find outside
North Korea that's a the worship of
Reagan portrays him as somebody who
saved us from government from you know
oppression and so on actually he was an
apostle of big government there when
rule under Reagan it was the most
strongest opponent of free markets and
post-war history among the president but
that doesn't matter they concocted an
image that you worship that doesn't
matter what the reality is North Korea
probably most of the population believes
the propaganda about the Dear Leader
it's hard to achieve that especially in
a free society but it's been done and
that's the kind of thing that activists
IWW have to work against and the right
on the shop floor it's not so simple
been done before
you
you mentioned that then the business the
businesses are very fast conscious can
you elaborate on that statement we have
to do is read the business literature
like in the 1930s they were very
frightened when they were concerned
about the hazard to industrialists in
the rising power of the masses straight
marxist rhetoric just values changed and
it's constantly like that constantly
talking about the masses the dangers
they pose have to control them you know
and that's a very you know they
understand what they're doing and
they're very class conscious they press
policies which work for their interests
I mean for example they're the insurance
industries and the big banks are
absolutely for it to know because they
have on the business pages they don't
even concealed it because they've
succeeded in coming out of the crisis
thanks to a huge public bailout even
stronger than they were before and in a
better position to lay the basis for the
next crisis but they don't care because
they'll get bailed out again I mean you
know that's class consciousness of the
Vengeance in fact you know the labor
movement is occasionally recognized you
may remember I think it was around late
seventies duck Fraser than the head of
the UAW criticized the auto industry's
kind of with astonishment because he
said as you guys are fighting a bitter
class war I thought we were supposed to
be cooperating I'm sure big chance
they'll cooperate and sure they were
fighting a bitter class war the union
leadership didn't want to see it for
their own interests and then I mean the
Healthcare's a good case the health it's
been discussed that disgusted others
have but the health care suited States
and Canada have quite
different histories or three or two
Healthcare although they're very similar
societies and one reason for the main
reason is the union movements in Canada
the union movements fought for
healthcare for everyone in the United
States the same unions fought for
healthcare for themselves so if you were
in the UAW you had a pretty decent
healthcare system but it was a compact
with management and that's a compact
between collaborationist labor leaders
and highly class conscious management
and you know were a spent lead
so if management says the end of the
compact you know the end of the conflict
you don't have health care or anything
else well that's the difference between
a socially conscious labor movement more
or less in Canada I don't exaggerate but
more so than here and an individualist
oriented labor movement says I'm going
to get something or myself
Sam comforts unionism which the UAW fell
about how businesses use use there have
again
for I don't see now more so V they used
to probably get a moratorium for union
busting well now Union but I mean for a
while after the Second World War when
there was strong support for labor and
there was rather radical society in many
ways this was done subtly but since
Reagan it's just done openly
I mean Reagan but you know I don't know
if you had an idea in his head but what
we called Reagan namely his
administration bitterly hated unions and
one of them destroyed it began with the
you know the air controllers strike and
went on from there so during the Reagan
years the administration has told the
business world they're not go enforce
the labor laws and the number of illegal
firings
had tripled during the Reagan years you
read that in Businessweek
which was pretty happy about it and you
know it's at that time that you start
getting these companies that are
specialized that specialized in how to
destroy unions and they're you know
quite public they don't make it secret
and they have ulcers techniques for
management to destroy unions
well when Clinton came along it sort of
moderated a little bit but Clinton had a
different device for breaking unions
called NAFTA because the government was
entirely lawless employers could exploit
NAFTA to threaten union organizers with
transfer it's illegal but when you've
got a lawless government doesn't matter
if it's illegal and I think the number
of Union drives blocked increased by
about 50 percent just using nafta's and
the legal tactic destroy unions ACTA the
study of this then under NAFTA auspices
part of the NAFTA legislation required
studies of labor practices
quite a good study that came out but
this labor historian at Cornell his name
escapes me at the moment on labor on the
use of NAFTA to undermine and destroy
unions well that was going on over in
the Clinton years and of course Bush no
need to talk about but starting with
Reagan it became quite open you know the
attack on unions I mean it wasn't
Pinkertons anymore but it was just not
applying Bulow's you're seeing that very
much in especially the Starbucks or
presumes where Starbucks will without
all kinds of anti new propaganda both
internally within the company and
externally a lot of it is as Tom workers
they don't need a union better off
without it that's the whole food slide
and a lot of it is is actually very
effective right now so one of my burning
questions for you was how could we as a
small independent labor union work to
fight against
so to get people organized and tell them
the truth
there aren't any magic tricks to it but
sometimes it's pretty amazing actually I
mentioned I think in that same article
you mentioned I'd imagine one pretty
striking case that was the caterpillar
case the caterpillar was quite important
because that was the first manufacturing
in the industry that used Reaganite to
strike baking techniques called in scabs
which happened to be illegal doesn't
matter in a lawless state called in
scabs to break a major strike I was in
my early 90s I think but and there was
there were reports of it emission it was
reported pretty well in Chicago Tribune
very often the business process much
better labor recording than anything
else and the Chicago trib had good
stories about it I quoted some of them
and they pointed out something very
interesting they said that the workers
got a little very little support and I
think it was Peoria when scabs illegally
broke the strike and that was
particularly striking because that whole
community have been built up by the
Union was a union based community which
they had it created the community it was
the work force they won many rights but
when it came to the crunch the community
itself didn't support them that's good
that's kind of interesting about Obama
but Obama was a community organizer
supposedly in Chicago at that time I'm
sure to read the Chicago Tribune so he
knew about it
but when he went to show his solidarity
with the work force first place he went
was caterpillar ladies I don't think
he's forgot and and the labor movement
didn't react even radical labor
historians didn't remember I remember
talking to a couple of them pointing it
out because it's been wiped out of
consciousness it's only 15 years after
it's it's a real triumph of propaganda
to in many ways and yeah it's a lot of
work to reconstruct it's happened before
in the 1920s the labor movement was
almost completely destroyed you know a
foreign visitors I mean even the
right-wing British press was writing
articles I can't believe that workers
are treated in the United States and it
looked as if there's a book by David
Montgomery a very good labor historian
it's called the rise and fall of labor
or something and the fall of Labor that
he's talking about is the 1920s well you
know the 1930s it really revived and
became pretty radical things can happen
but not by themselves I mean then you
had the Communist Party and whatever you
think about the Communist Party got
nevertheless they were the right at the
heart of a you know civil rights
activism labor activism and so on and
without that it's something else has to
provide it and you don't want to have
their Russia worship but
domestically they'd a pretty good record
remember pretty well from childhood my
family was they were mostly he was in
the IWW but if you want to know the
truth he came over as an immigrant
didn't know any English I got with the
working switch up in Baltimore and he
told me they told me later he said he
didn't really know English but this guy
was coming around he seemed to be for
the workers so he signed up it was a
night WWE organizer he didn't regret it
he just really didn't know what don't
even know if I ever knew I knew with my
other relatives that women were garment
workers union men were shop
important well this was New York I
hadn't we pulled up here but the family
was in New York and you can see I could
see what the union was doing for it
really saved their lives I had two aunt
Spence Spencer Spencer aunts who were in
the seamstresses and of course
unemployed in the thirties but the Union
gave him a life I mean they had a couple
of weeks in the country and a union
installation they had educational
programs all sorts of things it was
there was a life you know real community
and that you know they were members of
the Communist Party but they didn't care
one way or another about Russia they
just cared about the United States and
I'm also looking to think ahead with
this wasn't a future for for the labor
movement and and not not so much about
what we can do but what will
realistically happen and how we'll all
deal with that
one thing I think is difficult is what
your communities of the employee Beach
ways that I think it's bit unfortunate I
mean unless there's a lot of force
organized before of course Obama
promised it before the election election
promises don't mean anything I mean it
gradually sank down on the agenda as you
know he moved into office and it wasn't
surprising Shearer um there was a there
was an interview with in the Wall Street
Journal with Rahm Emanuel I think it
must been right after the election and
the interviewer asked the amount of one
of the question is well you know what
are you gonna do with these kind of
crazed radicals in the party like Barney
Frank and others crazy you don't worry
we were pragmatic will control them no
so I don't remember if it asked to that
F good he might have
so it's more generally before I came
here as number of Wobblies anarchists
and my family my mother's loving was sue
she was she had her own questions to
amass them what were they ask you if
they had one question and the most the
most common response I got was if you
had one piece of advice to offer future
generations of say radicals and walkways
and revolutionaries and linguists and
every every party especially in light of
the tough economic financial to
financial transit we're facing probably
continue to face her
yes I'm not a I get a lot of letters
from people when I go tonight it'll have
15 letters today from mostly young kids
who don't like what's going on they want
to do something about it can I give them
some advice as to what they should do or
kind of tell them what they should read
or something it doesn't work like that
it I mean everything depends very much
on who you are what your values are what
your commitments are what circumstances
you live in what options you're willing
to undertake and that determines what
you ought to be doing I mean there are
some I think very general ideas that
people can keep in mind like one of them
is is something that kind of truisms
it's only worth mentioning them because
they're Austin hi first of all don't
believe anything you hear from power
systems so if Obama the boss or the
newspapers or anyone else tells you
we're doing this that and the other
thing either dismiss it or assume the
opposite is true she often is you have
to rely on yourself your associates
gifts don't come from above they're
gonna come you're gonna win them or you
won't have them and you win them by
struggle and that requires understanding
and serious analysis of the options and
the circumstances and then you can do a
lot and it's a tick right now there is a
right-wing populist uprising
you know the town hall meetings you know
the demonstrations and so on that's very
common even on the left just ridicule
that look at these lunatics talking
about you know
socialists or the Communists and the
fascist and you know death panels and
all the rest of it but that's not the
right reaction if you look at these
people and you listen to them on talk
radio those are people with real
grievances
I mean you know I listen to talk radio a
lot it's kind of interesting I mean it's
insane but it's interesting and if you
can sort of suspend your knowledge of
the world and just sort of try to enter
into the world of the people who are
calling in you can understand them I
mean I have never seen a study but my
sense of it is that these are people who
feel really aggrieved I've done
everything right all my life I'm a
god-fearing Christian I'm white male
I've worked hard you know I carry a gun
I'd do everything I was supposed to do
I'm not getting shafted and in fact they
are getting shift you know for thirty
years their wages have stagnated or
declined the social conditions have
worsened the children going crazy - you
know there's no schools there's nothing
so what's somebody's doing something to
me who is it well you know rush limbaugh
has an answer it's the rich liberals who
own the banks and run the government and
first run the media and they don't care
about you there's a name for them you're
the fly by people you don't live in
Weston in New York and you're not in San
Francisco everything's run by gays
you're the other people you know the
kind of hard-working honest Americans
and they don't care about you these guys
along the corporations in the banks they
just want to give everything away to
illegal immigrants and
you know gays and Communists and so on
and we got to defend ourselves against
them and everything they tell you is
just a way to suppress you like they
talk about this thing they made up
global warming because they want to take
away your jobs and they talk about
health reform because they want to put a
microchip in you and make sure the
government runs you and it goes on like
that well you know these the reaction we
should be having to them is not ridicule
but rather self-criticism why aren't we
organizing I mean we're the ones who
ought to be organizing not rush limbaugh
then if they're if they're caught up in
this well they're full and they're
historical and analogs which aren't not
exact of course but are close enough to
be worrisome this has a whiff of early
Nazi Germany a Hitler was appealing to
groups with similar grievances and given
him crazy answers but at least they were
answers they weren't getting them from
anywhere else it's the Jews - the
Bolsheviks you know what happened in
this case they're not getting answers
from anyone else I mean the Liberal
Democrats not going to tell them yeah
they're being shafted because of the
policies that we've established over the
years that that we're maintaining now
I'm not going to that's not going to be
an answer and they're not getting
answers from the left so okay there's an
internal coherence and logic to what
they get from limbo you know Glenn Beck
the rest of these guys and they sound
very convincing you know they're very
self-confident the good answer to
everything and crazy answer most of the
time but it's an answer and it hangs
together and that's our fault it just
goes on so this one thing to be done is
don't ridicule these people join them
and talk about their real grievances and
give them a sensible answer like take
over your factors
you
you
