in his book interventions author Noam
Chomsky discusses u.s. foreign policy
and other topics this event hosted by
back pages books in Waltham
Massachusetts is a little over an hour
where where so much of then it seems
like the world leadership I think most
recently of course hear about benazir
bhutto Bhutto having been educated in in
this area and at Harvard and and so many
of the world leaders seem seem to come
here to be educated for better for worse
you know remember how recent that is
definitely I looked up until the Second
World War the United States was kind of
a cultural backwater sure if you wanted
to study philosophy or physics you'd go
to England or Germany and you want to be
a writer you go to Paris you know the
United States at that time in its
relation to the rest of the world it was
kind of like well it's off anybody but
maybe central Indiana to Boston today
it's a place you tried to get out of if
you wanted to be a creative writer
thank you or something that changed
during the Second World War and it for
in fact the whole relationship between
the United States and the world changed
and part of it was much the rest of the
industrial world was seriously harmed or
destroyed and the United States gained
an enormous lead during the war
in fact it already was by far the
richest country in the world but
industrial production more than tripled
during the Second World War and it just
ended up the United States ended up
owning half the having half the wealth
of the world yeah
there's never been anything like that in
history and it affected the mentality
the institutions and so on this radical
shift so what we see today is not the
traditional United States certainly
certainly no do you see are there any
commonalities and these people who come
out of this sort of modern education
system who are becoming world leaders
around do they they seem to be sort of a
similar foundational approach are they
taking anything out of this American
system or this American ideal if that is
true it does not reflect very well on
the education system you take a look at
the world and you say is this what
we want to train people to create I
guess it it ties into a question I've
been thinking about is sort of
obsessively rereading a poem called the
the Hollow Men by TS Eliot and it's sort
of it begins this we are the Hollow Men
where the straw men but it ends with the
lullabies sort of sort of this is the
way the world ends this is the way the
world ends this is the way of the world
ends not with a bang but with a whimper
and it strikes me that that you know I I
look to education very often as a route
of how people can port themselves even
even in the political sphere or maybe we
perhaps shouldn't be expecting that to
be a relevant sort of part of your
resume but that that it seems to me that
for all of the bombastic things that are
happening around the world it seems to
be occurring here almost as as a whimper
as a whimper and as the end of this poem
that it that it seems to be incredibly
muted here in Boston and in America in
general and and while there are
definitely large movements you know
there's a level of obfuscation that
seems to be preventing that from being a
general sentiment that you feel they
today walking around and I wonder if are
there other places like this in the
world where people feel muted do they
feel almost as though things are for how
large the scale they are and in what's
happening that it oddly has this sort of
played down sense T or your maybe your
sensibility of what you can do about it
but maybe your sensibility of even how
to grasp the concept of what's happening
in the first place I guess I just don't
see it that way really in fact it seems
tame we're exciting now than it was
thirty years ago much more than it was
fifty years ago in what ways what
because I guess well let's just take
this room absolutely okay when I started
giving talks on general topics it was
originally the Vietnam War back in the
early 60s a talk would be in a in
somebody's living room with two
neighbors or in a church with four
people that the minister the organizer
somebody wanted to kill me and a drunk
who walked in off the streets that was
the level of concern for the outside
world
in fact horrible thanks for going on all
over the world the United States was
involved in them and nobody cared for
example I want to take a poll but very
try with your friends I mean very few
people even know when the United States
attacked South Vietnam I mean that was
one of the major events of the modern
history ask people when the United
States attack South Vietnam we did have
a client state there which killed about
maybe 60 70 thousand people during the
50s but when did the invasion take place
well turns out was 1962 I mean nobody
cared I'm it wasn't a secret you could
read in the back pages of the New York
Times that the John F Kennedy had sent
the US Air Force to start bombing South
Vietnam under South Vietnamese and
markings claims with South Vietnamese
marketing so they wouldn't know that the
huge jet there's the US Air Force the
that's when they started the programs of
a chemical warfare to destroy crops and
ground cover
they started rounding people up and
driving them into what we're about at
the concentration camps eliminating
millions of people and strategic
Hamlet's and urban slums authorized
napalm really cared I mean a couple of
years it was years before things really
became vitalize and the sixties just
changed the place is enormous Lee so for
example of a meeting like this would
have been inconceivable in fact as late
as the late sixties the politically
active groups like say SDS
you could apparently mention a word like
capitalism people would shrink them oh
god that's really frightening concept
talk about the things we just take for
granted now we're considered outlandish
then and in many areas in fact it's
striking to compare the beginning of the
Vietnam War with the beginning of the
Iraq war in the case of the Iraq war
there were huge protests before the war
started in the case of Vietnam you
didn't get protest of that scale until
South Vietnam had been essentially
destroyed much of the rest of the region
as well I think there there is a
remaking that goes it goes on though so
that the the sense of people who weren't
alive or aware during that period it's
is often that yeah you know the 60s are
are this this decade you know they start
in 1960 they end in 1969 and that's a
strike it's picked up since then
absolutely I mean the major popular
movements they've had a real effect on
the society are from a later period it
takes a the women's movement which just
changed the society enormous Lee I mean
take say MIT again since Wilson if you
walk down the halls of MIT when I got
there 1955 you'd see white well-dressed
deferential males okay take a walk down
the halls now you know what you're going
to see it's about a half linen third
minorities casual dress informal
relations and it's just that political
activism was unheard of at the time and
has just changed tremendously and that's
changed all over the country but the
women's movement is
earlier product at sixties germs or in
seventies the germs were there in the
60s but barely
no and then it picked up and changed
things enormously or takes a the
environmental movement I mean that
speaking of the end of the earth that's
gonna be important in the sixties I came
out of the began developing the
seventies did the Solidarity movement
Central American solidarity movements
not worldwide
that's the eighties and that's something
new in Western history I mean no one to
say in France ever thought of going to
live in an Algerian or a Vietnamese
village in order to help the people who
were under attack from French violence
nobody thought of going to live in a
Vietnamese village erupted in the
nineteen eighties thousands of people
did it and now it's all over the world I
guess it begs almost a simple definition
question that is you know sort of what
is contemporary liberalism with this my
sense that there are nothing there no
you sit platforms they're not
necessarily the same kinds of platforms
and movements especially where you can
say you know I I'm liberal and I am a
communist I'm liberal and I have a
socialist I'm an anarchist they're not
you know you don't hear that as often in
these discussions now there seems to be
a different kind of solidarity in
different kind of definition of
liberalism and I wonder what you see
that as being now one reason is the
world words have simply lost meaning so
what does it mean to be a liberal
communist or anything else that maybe
went to door well made I mean the one
way of trying to undermine independent
thoughts and creative purchase to the
world is to simply destroy the way of
talking about things so the words
literally almost have no meaning in fact
right now just right every word has its
use in political discourse has at least
two means a literal meaning and its
opposite and it's the opposite that's
use so take a contemporary debate that's
going on right now
you see headlines in newspapers about a
report done foreign fighters in Iraq the
Condoleezza Rice announces that she's
got a there's an easy to ask the
question about how can we sell problem
in Iraq says crazy
just keep the foreign fighters out
keeping the foreign weapons out and
it'll all be settled and that's an
eyelash are there 50,000 US troops there
I mean are they bringing in weapons
they're not farm because anything we do
is not far invaded Canada they would be
enemy combatants and we would be there
by right so the concept of concepts like
aggression invasion terror anything
inventions exhibit a kick democracy but
George Bush was in Egypt yesterday
appraising President Mubarak the
Egyptians are
at the same time he's giving talks about
how we have to promote democracy and so
on I mean they just come from Saudi
Arabia the most extreme one of the most
extreme fundamentalist tyrannies in the
world you know see a picture of them
with King Abdullah watching a horse show
and so on and so forth I mean what are
we to make of all of this the terms for
discussing things have been almost
evacuative content that's why you don't
hear these words but on the other hand
people's instincts and commitments and
engagements I think are significantly
improved over the 60s I'm gonna take
your own field okay which were telling
me about yeah
you go back to the 1960s the general
assumption even in the academic world
was that there was nobody living in this
hemisphere just a couple of savages
wandering around the idea that what has
been discovered about the pre
pre-contact history it's just you know
it's kind of mind-boggling if he was
even in scholarly literature time a
little on people's ordinary mentality
like when I was growing up as a kid I
considered myself pretty leftist but we
played cowboys and Indians where we were
the Cowboys killing the Indians if maybe
it still happened somewhere but like not
wouldn't be my children they wouldn't
have done that these are just changes
that took place in our consciousness our
conception of what the past was what
we've done who we are how we relate to
one another let's just change the
normally a lot of sparks were lit in the
sixties but much of it took off later
for example the beginnings of the
rediscovery actually of the
what happened the original sin of this
country what happened to the native
population that really just began in the
70s yeah from outside the academic world
and to them people like Francis Jennings
where these where these words have lost
so much if not all of their meaning and
and you look at the sort of there's
there's a rhetorical sort of tactic of
this government in particular which is
sort of the broad blitz of you send out
you know the top ten people you have and
you reiterate the lie on ten news
programs at once in the same sort of
quasi doublespeak sort of way so that it
becomes a truth I wonder is is that if
if you look at the rhetoric being used
by other world leaders around the world
whether you know whether it's it's
Vladimir Putin or whether it's Sarkozy
or whether it's Hugo Chavez are there
are there different are they drastically
different tactics of the same sort of
approach being used right now or are
they are they sort of all following this
model or just sort of blitzing the same
idea over and over until people don't
particularly listen I think it's a
mistake to expect anything from leaders
other than attempts to expand their
power and control and domination they
differ but as soon as you mentioned the
word leader you should shudder and look
somewhere else
in a free society you might have
representatives but he wouldn't have
leaders so let's imagine that this was a
really functioning we're in the primary
season what a Democratic primary be
let's say take New Hampshire it wouldn't
be a candidate comes into a town and
says tells you lies about themselves and
what would happen is the people in town
would get together and say let's work
out the kinds of programs they want the
next president to follow and then if
somebody wants to come in to be elected
they say if they come here's what we
want you to do if you're willing to do
that maybe we'll vote for you if you're
not why won't you look for it but you
don't have and then you there should be
mechanisms to ensure that they do it or
else you throw them out the way we do it
is quite different the leaders come they
tell you what they present themselves
usually falsely and your seer than to
decide well do I want him we're going on
him but that's completely backwards from
what a functioning democratic society so
when you talk about leaders you have to
shiver on the other hand there are
differences and also takes a Chavez who
you mentioned December thought I don't
know how many people know this but on
December 31st
the end of last year Chavez announced an
amnesty for participants in the military
coup in 2002 April 2002 not for all
improve any of them
this is a military coup backed by the
United States probably with
participation u.s. participation
certainly support which overthrew the
government kidnapped the president
disbanded Parliament the Supreme Court
every other democratic institution
applauded in the United States denounced
in Latin America almost entirely it was
overturned and a couple of days later
but suppose it happened here I'm suppose
there was a military coup here which
overthrew the government you know
kidnapping George Bush disbanded
Congress and something that was popular
uprising and it returned the coup would
they be amnesty the people who took
pardon
get the death sentence there wouldn't be
any question of that misty well I don't
know it was out of embarrassment or lack
of interest but actually I had a friend
do a database search on coverage of the
amnesty a couple of lines scattered
lines you're in there I'm sure you know
the Travis is like a demon in the
Western press and one of his worst
crimes which just elicited
a torrent of abuse was canceling the
counseling the license of a television
station RCTV actually didn't close the
station contrary that was said he
canceled their license to take up a
large part of the publicly owned
frequencies it's still go on cable
now that was considered utterly
horrendous and the press you know
denounced them as if this couldn't it
the kind I think it never happened here
it's perfectly true it couldn't happen
here
but very few have pointed out the reason
the station and if you have to think of
an analogy let's go back to the imagine
very coup in the United States the way I
described supposed to the CBS and helped
instigate the coup have supported it
openly as the popular uprising took
place that overthrew the coup leaders of
CBS started playing you know comedies
and anything that collect so that people
wouldn't know what's going on in the
streets but what would happen to CBS
afterwards after their managers and
owners would they be allowed to keep
broadcasting for five years and then
have their pub their license to for the
Public Broadcasting immediately sent to
jail probably get the death sentence
so it's true it wouldn't happen here I
have but not for exactly the reasons
that were mentioned well go on and on
like this we simply let me take one last
example to illustrate just area you know
the difficulty of applying to ourselves
the standards we do to others take 911
terrible atrocity huge
outpouring of sympathy and support all
over the world including incidentally
from the jihadi movements and they later
turned because of a reaction to it at
the beginning that are highly condemned
it very strongly and it was a terrible
atrocity undoubtedly but it could have
been worse so let's imagine how it could
have been worse for example I suppose
that on September 11th al Qaeda had
bombed the White House and killed the
president into the murderous brutal
regime which killed maybe fifty two
hundred thousand people and tortured
about seven hundred thousand set up a
major international terror center in
Washington which was overthrowing
governments all over the world
installing brutal vicious neo-nazi
dictatorships assassinating people and I
suppose he called in a bunch of
economists school of the Condor boys to
run the American economy who within a
couple of years had driven the economy
into one of the worst collapses of its
history you know I suppose that this had
happened what that would have been worse
than 9/11 right what did happen and it
happened on 9/11 it happened on
September 11th 1973 in Chile the only
thing I've changed its per capita
equivalence which is the right way to
look at it well did that change the
world well because and and because just
in in terms of your comment of the
replenish that way just to finish we
were responsible for that definitely and
and but because you know as you said
with the amnesty on December 31st which
received no coverage you knee look at
Chile during that period and you look at
the New York tonnes majority the
articles are being filed from Argentina
they're not even being filed from Chile
so you're where it where is
you know the the magnitude of the event
was immediately
I think muted by the fact that that
nobody who was reporting for the
American media was even there is not the
case every all the wire services covered
which means that every editorial office
no I mean every editorial office picks
up Reuters AP and stay of P and so on so
every desk at every editorial office
knew about it they decided not to put
printed another main reason is it just
doesn't fit the image that's supposed to
be presented actually I was even
involved in that inadvertently when you
when Chavez was at the UN couple years
ago he he gave talk they gave a press
conference in which she allegedly said
that he was very sorry that he had been
able to meet me before I died I was big
stories all over the country it was
actually interviewed by the New York
Times they thought was very funny what
did I have to say about it and so on so
that was a big issue because then he
showed what a crazy idiot he is only one
problem that's not what he said what he
said is that that was very explicit
unambiguous he said he was sorry that he
hadn't been able to meet John Kenneth
Galbraith before he died well evidently
the editorial offices decided that it
wouldn't do to present the image of
Chavez as somebody who admires a liberal
icon so they changed it you know it was
pointed out right away a fair media
monitoring organization very good one I
mean he looked at the transcript and
what the New York Times and others
saying so it was and the New York Times
did issue
correction seventy days later the bottom
of whatever that page of advertisements
yeah that you know this correction
alright you can imagine that the
American press didn't understand the
Spanish it's hard to imagine how John
Kenneth Galbraith and Noam Chomsky would
be confused but let's imagine it did
live long not understand the Spanish I
did a little more Carrillo and Chile
don't understand the Spanish this is
just a way of demonizing the figure who
the state orders you must demonize I
think it does independent whether you
like it or not yes I think it you know
it strikes me more often that you know
while this was sort of an extraordinary
you know moment of of yeah baffling sort
of rewriting that they did it off and it
seems like the articles that you find
and the reportage that you see is is
just diversion oriented so that I
remember reading an article about the
coup in Chile where the entire it was a
front-page New York Times article from
just after September 11th 1973 where the
entire article was about bank runs in
Argentina and and nothing about Chile
there was there was no sense even that
that who was Pinochet what was going on
what was it that point the hunter that
was in control and bear in mind it's a
much worse atrocity than era 9/11 was
often cold in South America the second
9/11 for good reasons actually had
personal ends of my guide a teenage son
who my wife and I decided to Lexington
where we live the Lexington movie
theater was playing missing you know the
film
so we can put their son figure you
clearing something about it he thought
it was a kind of an interesting
adventure story
but as we were walking out of the
theater I was listening to people
talking about it I don't think much of
the audience knew that it was about
chili I mean they knew that the American
government had done some bad thing they
hadn't rescued this nice American guy
but that's about the level of them
that's true that the film didn't spell
out in detail this is chili 1973 United
States helped instigate a coup which had
all these horrible effects but it takes
a remarkable degree of insularity not to
know enough about the world to
appreciate what this is I should say
that the second 9/11 powers one of its
consequences was to introduce many
cracks in that insularity it opened a
lot of people's minds you could see that
in all sorts of ways and I could see
just personally like the number of
invitations from around the country to
give talks just escalated radically
audiences are much bigger much more
engaged small bookstores like little
left book stores which were barely
struggling along had to suddenly reprint
books from the 1980s and 70s it never
sold because people were interested and
a lot of people one of the consequences
of it was to shatter some of the
mener internal focus of a highly insular
society and maybe people feel if we
gotta learn about the world do you think
that even though perhaps the yeah these
sort of these sort of platforms or
identifiable movements attached to an
issue may have sort of sort of dropped
off in certain ways in the old sort of
polemical identification way that now
perhaps it is the seeking of information
that drives this more than anything
because it's I think it is abundantly
clear to people that it's you know you
can't just turn on the CBS Evening News
you know that this clip emerged last
week of Katie Couric you know clips
between her her segments from New
Hampshire where she you know it's clear
that she sort of has no sense whatsoever
of what even she's reporting on so that
people perhaps it is the seeking in and
of itself that might that might be
engendering the the larger the larger
you know sort of sort of active sense
that people have you know it's hard to
generalize about a diverse complex
society like this one but there are
tendencies that you can identify and one
tendency is to a certain level of
skepticism a certain level of interest
and independent inquiry trying to find
out what happened I mean it can lead in
crazy directions too it can lead to wild
conspiracy theories and so on and so
forth internet kind of tends to engender
that kind of phenomenon but it's also
just a much healthier concern with
things that are happening in the
Internet also brings in I think a
tremendous amount you can't find
anywhere else it does before and perhaps
that what's that maybe what what makes
it better is this sense that you have to
be more discerning with what you're
reading but you're prepared to be
discerning which was not the case
perhaps with the older media on that
cusp of when the internet was I think
sort of really rising there
you know that a lot of folks I think
weren't as able to be as rapidly
critical because you got one picture
good morning newspaper you know local
television station yeah now if you want
at least you can get a quite a wide
variety of information for example the
things I just mentioned you can find out
about it takes as you say discernment
first a little commitment and then
discernment not much different from the
sciences in that respect you can't just
take a look at all the data that exists
and come up with a theory you have to
know what makes sense to look at what
doesn't make sense you have to sort of a
framework for interpretation I mean the
best scientist is not the one who can
list all the papers that have been
written on the topic he's working on
it's the one who knows what to look at
actually I had a friend of MIT who was
Nobel Prize laureate and biology once
described to me how he taught us classes
he said he goes in and gives a lecture
about the way he thinks these things
ought to be just in principle and then
the task of the students is to check the
literature and find out he's right
that's kind of the way you have to look
at the world - it's just getting
overwhelmed with meaningless data you
have to pick out what matters which does
take discernment done training and so on
if we had you know the kind of
educational systems that you and I would
the rest of us would like to have that's
what children would be trying to do was
they encouraged to do figure out how to
do it it's very different than no child
left behind we're trained to pest test
sadly I've I've gotten selfish here I
don't know if anybody has a question on
this sort of specific topic at all you
yes you
as as a child of the period of the 1930s
and 40s period of the war and the
Holocaust and so on I I grew up thinking
as I got older that the world is never
going to be like this again
and quite an optimistic view of how
things change but as time goes along as
I get older I find that the world
repeats itself and that many of the
things that I had feared are still all
going wrong and will continue to go on
and I look ahead and I see a very
dangerous and dire world as we look
further into the future and wondering
whether you have the same feelings and
had the same experience and whether at
this point you two are looking
optimistically to the future or as well
I I guess we're about the same age I
grew up in 30s and 40s to but and those
were very frightening period and the
rise of fascism over the Europe was
really frightening actually I couldn't
remember the first article I wrote which
was in exactly when it was it was
February 1939 was right after the fall
of Barcelona was fourth grade there's
paper and that is the
the only reader of like this but and it
was about the I kind of remember it was
about this this symbol of Austria
falling Czechs a locket full and frankly
this tipping over Spain you know what's
going to come next it looked like this
monstrous plague was going to spread
over the world
then came the depression was been a much
more serious economic crisis than
anything that's happened in the years
since then comes for Holocaust wasn't
really known then was known bits and
pieces were known was really only known
about later and then we at the end of
the word you can probably remember all
the states 1945 when the atom bomb was
used I mean that struck me as being as
terrifying as the full rise of fascism
over Europe
and that could be the end of the world
it may turn out to be the end of the
world but it was already pretty clear
all the sixth six the 1945 even worse
couple days later when Nagasaki was mom
that came many real horrors one of the
threats of the Cold War were in fact
exaggerated but they weren't something
was exaggerated and so it goes on is it
worse now in some ways yes I mean there
are two maybe three
the contingencies that might really deal
a lethal blow to the survival of species
one we name its nuclear weapons and that
threat is getting worse unfortunately
another is environmental catastrophe and
we may be near some kind of tipping
point on that it's not do another is
pandemics I mean if there's a bird flu
mutation or the kind that could happen
it could lead to a pandemic in which a
huge numbers of people would die and
very little is being done about any of
these things effective many ways are
getting worse
so there's reasons for pessimism on the
other hand they're reasons for optimism
including those we just were talking
about the it's a much more civilized
society than it was 30 or 40 years ago
in many respects including those who
mentioned and you can see it in policy
as well I mean it back in the 50s and
the 60s the United States was
overthrowing governments that will
imposing brutal violent murders
tyrannies every year they'd be a couple
of them we can't do that anymore the
last time the United States tried to
support a military coup to overthrow a
democratic government was in 2002 in
Venezuela and it was over time within a
couple of days but for one thing that
was a huge up for and Latin America
about it most of Latin America and also
because it was a popular uprising and
also because the US couldn't couldn't do
it openly you know the way it was done
in the past because there's too much
opposition here those reason things like
that or reasons for optimism so you take
a choice I mean you can be pessimistic
if you like the well imagine golden days
of the past or look at the things that
are
does anyone else have a question yes
yeah if it's some bit tricky to detangle
what's going on on a social the social
from the biological and I tagged that
question on to the gentleman's last
question so when I talk about the social
I just think everything about human
activities that's how I think about it
from the social so biologically is is
there something underlined what we see
going on on a social level and in that
way is that a commentary about human
beings where the circular cyclic thing
about what we do keeps repeating itself
it's not about human nature growing up
in the 1930s as I can't hear what you're
saying
I think that the the nature of our
question was that there's to her it
seems that there there is there's no
that there's some connectivity between
the social and the biological aspects of
humanity and just sort of humanity in
general correct yes and what kind of
creature are we exactly so so do you see
if they do you see any sort of
relationship in the biological end of
things that sort of sort of explains the
more social aspects I guess of the way
we act and why we do what we do is that
correct yes - one of the many areas
where I think people should be pretty
skeptical is in what you read about this
I mean there's this very popular topic
these days to discuss what evolutionary
psychology is it's now called
sociobiology it used to be teaches us
about the nature of humans but the
problem is it doesn't teaches anything
much at all it's extremely it's an
extremely hard scientific problem to
understand the nature of any organism
say insects we could do any experiment
you like when you get to something as
complex as human beings which is just
fine is it was anything you look for you
want to find aggressiveness and violence
and sadism yeah we can find that we
don't need evolutionary psychology to
tell us about it we see it in the world
you want to find
self-sacrifice courage integrity and a
willingness to sacrifice yourself for
some totally you know remote species
like to wade out into the tree wars of
Cape Cod and save dolphins now you can
find that you'd find what which look for
that humans have all these capacities
different ones manifests themselves and
different circumstances and different
backgrounds and so on but the science is
just don't reach far enough to answer
questions like this it's worth looking
at there's interesting work say Robert
rivers has work on reciprocal altruism
which is very interesting how a
willingness to have an altruistic
relation to someone else could pay off
in terms of selection survival yet could
and that tells you maybe something
interesting about the roots of this
concept it's not a new idea incidentally
the first book on this topic called
mutual aid a factor in evolution was
written over a century ago by profession
leading anarchist thinker who was also a
natural historian and he tried to show
this is I think maybe 1900 or something
like that but you know he have a lot of
evidence but he tried to argue that in
the natural world up to humans mutual
aid commitment to help others help the
community would be could have survival
value and could have been selected for
so maybe that's kind of creature we are
and in some sense yes that's the kind of
creature we are world
unfortunately any other kind of creature
if you like so yes there's certainly a
connection and someday maybe will be
understood but and there's something
known about it it's not that knowledge
is zero but a big grain of salt is
necessary whenever you read articles in
the New York Times Magazine
right into doing something that's
effective
it must have been frustrating I don't
know where new forever looks frustrated
realizing that facts and reality didn't
really change things much you know you
could you could explain something to
Congress people or whatever and they'd
still vote for a million dollars a day
to about Salvador
they must must be maddening but but it's
speaking of diving deeper I mean what do
you think we can do - apart from using
facts which don't seem to work to
increase the sense of empathy that we've
seem to lack when we you know bomb other
countries and discriminately or destroy
them economically you put much thought
to you know what you know how we can
actually make something happen from what
you know you explain to us so
beautifully like you think yard but I
don't think there's any that just
rephrase that on the on the bike so that
so that people can hear it just in terms
of I think you know he's asking what's
her thought goes in to what Professor
Chomsky is is writing as he goes
understanding that or perhaps words and
ideas are not do not have the same
efficacy now at least they may used to
have had so that so that going going
forward you know is there a way to sort
of sort of plan what you're going to
write that sort of affects people in a
way where they have a I think a greater
sensibility then of what we're doing
abroad and what the political sense of
is that I mean the fact that there's a
couple hundred people here with a
veterinaries consciousness it doesn't
change the fact that we're finding other
countries and doing things and there's
no repercussions for the leaders or
representative why do you think it
doesn't change things
I mean it's there are things that the
United States did that leaders did quite
freely eight years ago we can't do no so
take say the most liberal
administration's like say Kennedy okay
was carrying out a major terrorist war
against Cuba it wasn't particularly
secret you know I mean not all the
details were known then that or not now
but during its biography of Robert
Kennedy John F Kennedy was there of
course the John F Kennedy gave Robert
Kennedy the task of bringing the terrors
of the earth to Cuba and that Robert
Kennedy picked that as its highest
priority I went ahead and did it
American presidents can't do that now
because of the change of consciousness
just as they can't overtake me
I mean look backwards bad enough and if
they go after a brand it will be much
worse but it doesn't remotely compared
with the other China Wars I mean these
what we knew at the time was horrifying
enough but what has come out recently
and is not being reported but you can
find it it is much worse
so take say Cambodia I mean we now know
we didn't know in 1972 we now know that
in 1973 Nixon gave Kissinger the orders
you know carry out massive bombing of
Cambodia and Kissinger transmitted those
orders - well hey with the words which
were something like this massive bombing
against camp campaign of camp against
Cambodia anything that fly is against
anything that moves I even have to work
pretty hard to find it for genocide at
that level and the archives of any state
well we now know it we didn't know it
then and something happened after that
Mike's gone well a good pass
you know better pets I mean there's
trajectories going on
one is the dangers and the threats are
getting much worse in fact they may be
threats to survival on the other hand is
an improvement in consciousness and
understanding and commitment and
solidarity which one is going faster let
me go back a little in 1973
Henry Kissinger transmitted to the Air
Force Al Haig the kiss and Nixon's off
orders to bomb Cambodia the words were
something like this massive bombing
campaign against Cambodia anything that
flies against anything that moves okay
suppose that at the trial of Milosevic
the International trial somebody had
found a statement of Russia which is
saying against Bosnia anything that
flies against anything that moves
okay trial would be over you get 25
death sentences finished this is us it
was reported barely you can find it he's
not a trial and very few people know
about it nor do they know about the
consequences there is there was a study
by two leading Cambodia scholars been
cured on Taylor venture known as the
head of the genocide project Yale will
known Cambodia scholar Taylor too they
published an article in which they went
through documents that had been
Declassified during the Clinton years on
the actual bombing of Cambodia it turns
out it was five times as high
the horrifying level that was already
known it with the bombing of rural
Cambodia was greater than the total
Allied bombing and all theaters
throughout world war two direct against
rural Cambodia and as they point out it
one of the effects was that the Khmer
Rouge had been a marginal group in
Cambodia became a huge army of enraged
peasants and we know what they did next
okay well that information is now there
you can find it wasn't they their
article appeared in the Canadian Journal
as far as I know the only publication of
it in the United States is an article on
Z net that I posted there and now it's
appearing in some other places and so on
but you know these are things that
happen freely we can at least now know
about them and no American government is
doing anything like that now nor could
they as for the effect of the public
it's significant I don't know if you've
ever looked at the Pentagon Papers the
full Pentagon Papers not the excerpts
that appeared in the New York Times but
take a look sometime at the ending it
ends in early 1968 right after the Tet
Offensive after the Tet Offensive
Johnson wanted to send a couple hundred
thousand troops to South Vietnam the
militant the Joint Chiefs opposed it and
the reason that they opposed that is
they thought they would need these
troops here for civil disorder control
if they because of the popular reaction
that would take place if they did it you
may not convince many congressmen to
vote differently but you can get people
to understand that they will look at
these things differently and when they
do that creates a frame kind of a
background in which any leader is going
through which any leaders gonna have to
react I mean even in dictatorship you
can't ignore the population and in a
relatively free societies or I can't so
therefore decisions are made
the leaders become followers much more
than they want to and as we would want
them to be because their things they
just can't do so I'm not as convinced as
you seem to be about the in efficacy of
trying to reach people to encourage them
to think about things I think it works
may not work as fast as we'd like but it
has an effect and beyond that there is
no other there's nothing else to do
there's not any magic trick around
that's going to achieve anything this is
another way to bring about meaningful
social change or cultural change I've
never heard of it so that's what we're
stuck with and it does work it's sort of
the other dies is working anybody okay
it's sort of it sort of begs a question
that a student who was a senior at
Brandeis last year asked when we hosted
Howard Zinn there he got up and I think
very very genuinely said I'm about to
graduate I'm about to go out into the
end of the world and he said I think I
do have a real social conscience I
really do want to change things I really
don't like a lot of what I see and I
think I could have an impact he said at
the same time I want I want a family I
want a wife I want kids I want a steady
job I want to be able to support myself
and he said so so then what what is left
to me to do what is in my control what
what are the things that that I can hold
on to and I think as a parent as that
may seem to some of us I think to a lot
of us that's that's not quite apparent
as to how do you balance I think a
lifestyle that America has given us that
is that is better than you'll find in
many places in the world and yet you
know how do you keep that while trying
to alter you know the things you don't
like about the social landscape let's
you know say tilt they're not working oh
yeah well it's opposite this rings it's
kind of poignant picture that you're
describing because the answer one answer
to that question is look at the person
you're asking the question to I mean
that's one way you could do it so Howard
Zinn had a family sports the families
he's changed you know he's probably had
more effect on you know the current
generations understanding of the world
that anybody can think of just for
people's history alone let alone from
actions he's been carrying out since his
early support for the activists in the
civil rights movement back in the 1960s
thrown out of Spelman College for
supporting black students that's these
are the kinds of things you can do and
we're in we happen to be people like us
or like most of us I guess uniquely
privileged I mean we have you know a
tremendous amount of freedom thanks to
the struggles of people in the past we
have a by comparative standards
historical standards an enormous amount
of privilege that confers opportunities
and I think part I get questions like
that every day tonight my go home and
look at my email there's going to be 20
letters like that but I think that the
problem that young people face is
there's just too many choices I mean
it's not you can't think of anything
that you can do you can think of so many
things you can do you can't pichu's you
know should I become involved in
political activism should I join
yourself arity group should I try to
organize anti-sweatshop movement I mean
I can think of thousands of things you
can do and my own children have picked
some of them and done them other people
I know have done a lot of them they're
there the opportunities are there for
older people to do we want to make use
of them that's the question I think the
you know the the the options part is is
definitely true but I think maybe less
spoken about openly and and dealt with
in the public I think is it is a large
and of fear and I think that when you
when you speak about the 60s and the
movements that followed you know to us
our age we see the sacrifices made then
that we're required of the people who
put themselves forward the most during
that period to lay that sort of
foundation and so I think it is
counterbalanced by the sense of what
what can be lost in this and the
question is you know you're reframing
this I think in a way that is very
helpful in this idea that there's enough
to hope for where perhaps that the loss
needs to be the sense of the fear of
loss needs to be tempered but I think
both seem to play an equal part to a lot
of people you know as much as this is
another way of looking at that suppose
you decide okay I don't want to take the
chance so I don't become involved in any
of these things I'm gonna invest in the
stock market have a nice home somewhere
or go to the movies and so on there's
big loss involved in that too you look
back on your life and you think what a
waste it was it's nobody likes a Howard
Zinn doesn't look back in his life that
way so there's all kinds of losses to
calculate I think what he was asking for
though may have been a balance between
the two and and that's something that's
we rarely speak in shades of gray we
speaking in terms of the sense of we
would all like to be Howard Zinn I think
I think we would all like to sort of
take something like that on and have
that sense of self courage that seems
almost indefatigable they you just don't
wear down you consistently go and go and
manage to make something great for your
life out of it but I think and had a
huge effect absolutely and I think and
yet there's this there's a sense of your
odds on that and people don't like don't
like gambling in that way I guess let me
say again you're gambling either way so
if you decide not to under not to make
use of the opportunities you have not to
try to live your life in a way which is
constructive and helpful you end up
looking back and say why did I bother
living
that's a loss - yes in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts the life expectancy of
black males is worse than in some
third-world countries the life
expectancy of Americans in general was
worthless
you know in fact life expectancy in the
United States is approximately like Cuba
I think the infant mortality in the
United States is like Malaysia that's
why if I remembered too I qualified and
I said most of us or have a unique
historically comparatively unique level
of privilege not all of us certainly not
many miles from where we're talking
maybe right next door I don't know the
town so yeah you're right I mean there's
the the the fact that the United States
ranks at about the lowest level of the
industrial countries in the things like
infant quality of social indicators you
know things like infant mortality abuse
things like that that's a scandal this
is the richest most privileged country
in history it's scandalous that there
should be something like an infant
mortality level compares to Malaysia or
that black males should have a lower
life expectancy than many third world
countries it's a real scandal and it's a
scandal that goes deep into our history
case of black males it goes right back
to slavery we does a claim that I'm in
the 14th amendment is supposed to have
given equal rights to everyone you know
it's a century it was a century before
it was even formally implemented and
it's still very far from actually
implemented as the statistics you
mentioned indicate or the incarceration
rate indicates yeah these are these
scandals and the scandals going to do
something about I mean very concretely
if people want to know what to do okay
take the the problem that in the United
States has been ranking right at the top
of in polls is the most serious problem
that people face for years
mainly the disastrous health care system
it is a catastrophe you know compare
considering the options that are
available we have sure most you know in
about twice the per capita costs of
comparable industrial societies and
about the worst outcomes among
industrial societies literally at about
the level of Cuba you know a poor third
world society that's under constant
attack by us is there anything to be
done about it of course and in fact most
people know perfectly well what can be
done about it for decades the large
majority the population has been in
favor of a national healthcare system
which would have a fraction of the costs
and much better outcomes it has been up
until recently this election is
interesting in this respect this is the
first election really in which there is
some attempt on the part of number of
candidates to respond to the
long-standing public will on this not
completely but at least partially we go
back one election 2004 and it was just
off the agenda effect I you may recall
the last presidential debate and the
2004 election was on domestic issues and
the New York Times had a report on it
the next day an accurate reporting which
it pointed out that Kerry had not
brought up the issue of any government
role in health care and the reason was
that it has so little political support
it's just supported by a large majority
of the population as it had been for
decades but that's not political support
what the reporter meant is it was
opposed by the financial institutions
and the pharmaceutical corporations so
it didn't have any political support
well this election things have changed
enough so that the Democratic candidates
are talking about it some of them have
proposals that are not too far from what
the public is wanted for years what
changed well I think two things changed
one better understanding and more
commitment something else changed which
is does not reflect well on the nature
of our society there is now a component
of concentrated capital that is in favor
of it namely manufacturing industry
manufacturing industry is getting
slaughtered by the inefficient health
system so General Motors says that it
costs them over a thousand dollars more
to produce a car and Detroit then and
say Windsor Canada across the border so
they want to have a rational healthcare
system all right at that point you start
getting something that's called
political support a major sector of
concentrated economic power is
interested in it not very nice but it's
a step forward and it means that the
population can be organized to press for
it so you won't have statistics of the
kind that you're talking about that's
not utopian you know these are pretty
simple proposals actually in a recent
book of mine I went through polls of
people's attitudes it turns out that the
public opinion and public policy are
miles apart on many crucial issues and
in fact when you run through a list when
I run through a list of things that
people favor I find myself pretty much
in the center of public opinion on many
things well can you do something about
it can you make these things politically
possible even if no sector of the
corporate elite happens to be for them
sure you can it's been done in the past
can be done again so we're back to
optimism yeah it can be kind of
opportunities you can do it if you try
if you don't try it won't happen
and my my general sense of
discombobulation and loss of time I run
very short but I we are a bookstore and
I I will I will run over for the one
question that I think I I at least
desperately would like to know which is
what what in last year of reading what
was the most important or entertaining
or just valuable you know whether it's
dr. Seuss by the nightstand or whatever
whatever else sort of book what was your
favorite book of last year a lot of
books is the favorite I think look at my
bookshelf but there well there's one a
couple of very good books that came out
that topics I happen to be interested in
one of them is a book on the
international economic system by the
Hajin Chung it's called bad Samaritans
he's very good at economists an economic
historian who goes through and in a
lucid even entertaining way things that
are kind of known he has a lot of new
material about how economic development
has really taken place and it turns out
as any economic historian ought to know
that is exactly the opposite of the
prescriptions that are that the economic
elites right and the institutions try to
impose on the rest of the world exactly
the opposite goes through case-by-case a
very convincingly all the rich countries
developed by violating the rules we're
trying to impose on others and so on and
that's worth knowing it's a it's
readable available the public and so on
another one that I read about the same
time was Peter Howard's book which just
came out recently on the overthrow of
the our state government in Haiti in
2004 in which the US and France who have
been the two major tortures of Haiti for
two hundred years played an essential
role in overthrowing the democratic
government bringing about a
reign of terror and so on that's worth
knowing another book was really
Magisterial studied by if anybody's
interested in Israel's buy save my was
Israeli strategic analyst political
scientist 800 pages or so on
it's called defending the Holy Land or
something like that I wish you runs
through the actual policies from the
inside that Israel has undertaken and
discusses how self-destructive they've
been case by case what along what
they've done to other people and we've
supported them all the way through just
finished a really very good book by Mike
Davis was a great writer called the in
praise of barbarians or some name like
that in which he's the theme is the
barbarians that were through the Roman
Empire we've got a praise the people who
are trying to overthrow this Empire and
it's a very insightful and decisive
study of many different aspects of
American society and you know can easily
go on lots of Harry Potter can't forget
that except that I can't read it anymore
Mike when my grandchildren were little
enough they wanted it to be read to them
but now that they're mine ten years old
that's over they want to read it
themselves the first night it comes down
professor Noam Chomsky thank you very
very much
noam chomsky Institute professor
emeritus at MIT is the author of many
books on American foreign policy
including failed States the abuse of
power and the assault on democracy and
what we say goes
conversations on US power in a changing
world for more on professor Chomsky's
