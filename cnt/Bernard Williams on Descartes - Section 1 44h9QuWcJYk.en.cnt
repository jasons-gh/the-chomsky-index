when the term modern philosophy is used
in universities it's usually to make a
distinction from ancient and medieval
philosophy so it doesn't mean just the
philosophy of our own day here in the
20th century
it means the philosophy of the last four
centuries in fact there's one man who is
generally and I think rightly regarded
as the inaugurate er of modern
philosophy
the Frenchman Descartes so in practice
what the term modern philosophy means is
philosophy from Descartes onwards Rene
Descartes was born in France in 1596 he
received an unusually good education but
he also had unusual independence of mind
and while still young he perceived that
the various authorities he was studying
quite often put forward arguments that
were invalid as a young man he became a
soldier and traveled widely in Europe
though without seeing any fighting and
he was struck by the fact that the world
of practical lies was as full of
contradictions as the world of books he
became fascinated by the question
whether there was any way at all in
which we human beings could get to know
anything for certain and if so how
he stopped travelling and went into
seclusion in Holland the country in
which intellectual life in those days
was at its freest and there during the
20 years from 1629 to 1649 he produced
work of the profoundest originality in
mathematics and philosophy and also did
a great deal of work in science he
invented the branch of mathematics known
as co-ordinate geometry it was his idea
to measure the position of a point by
its distance from two fixed lines so
every time we look at a graph we are
looking at something invented by
Descartes
in fact those two familiar lines on a
graph are known by his name they are
called Cartesian coordinates Cartesian
being the adjective from the name
Descartes his most famous works of
philosophy are the discourse on the
method which was published in 1637 and
the meditations published in 1642 he
never married though he had an
illegitimate daughter who
at the age of five he always had an eye
to his own dress was proud of being an
officer and on the whole preferred the
company of men of affairs to that of
scholars but during the years of his
creative work he lived a very solitary
life when he was 54 he was prevailed on
by Queen Christina of Sweden rather
against his will to go to Stockholm and
become her tutor in philosophy it was a
mistake in the bitter Swedish winter he
succumbed to pneumonia and he died in
the following year 1650 with me to
discuss the work of this first of modern
philosophers is the Provost of King's
College Cambridge bernhard williams
author of a well known book on descartes
Bernhard Williams I think the best way
we can begin is try and get clear in our
minds what it was that Descartes thought
was the main problem he was going to
have to confront when he started now
what was that I think he'd been
impressed by the education you referred
to and his experience of the life around
him with the idea that there was no
certain way of acquiring knowledge it
looked as if there were some sorts of
knowledge around but there was no
reliable method by which people could
advance knowledge I think it's very
important to put it in historical
context that one realizes that science
in our sense really didn't exist I mean
the concept of science and our sense as
an organized international enterprise
with research methods and the bharatas
and all that simply didn't exist and
there was room for an enormous range of
opinions about what chances there might
be of ever being on a science of there
being a science I mean on the one hand
there were people and perfectly sensible
people who thought that if you just
found the right fundamental method you
could solve all the fundamental problems
of understanding nature in a very short
while for instance Francis Bacon the
English statesman thought that that
you'd be able to get everything on the
right Road in a very brief period on the
other hand there were people skeptical
people who thought you couldn't find any
knowledge at all that wasn't going to be
any knowledge that if everything was up
for grabs as it were I think one
particular reason is quite important
actually why there was so much
skepticism
was actually a result of the religious
Reformation that after the religious
Reformation there all sorts of claims
made about how you found out religious
truth and they all conflicted with one
another and there was no way of deciding
between them and that gave rise to a
tremendous amount of controversy in
which people said in enemies of all
religions and well there simply isn't a
way of solving any of these questions
all these people disagree with each
other you can't put it on the foundation
and then religious people sort of
reacting against that in turn said well
religion is no different in this from
anything else there isn't a way of
putting anything on the firm foundation
so that skepticism was quite an
important current in the intellectual
climate of Descartes time coexisting in
an odd way with very extravagant hopes
of what science might be able to do and
for instance might be able to do for
mankind through what we would now call
technology for instance there were great
hopes that there could be a scientific
medicine and the scientific industry and
so on but nobody quite knew how to do it
for a fundamental innovator like
Descartes
the institutional set up must have
presented problems to must never een
almost every serious institution of
learning or study or teaching was in the
hands of an authoritarian church whose
own intellectual leaders were for the
most part in thrall to ancient authority
that is there they certainly true of
course there were there were many
different religious in influences as as
we just said I mean that one effect of
the Reformation had been that some seats
of learning had more of a Protestant
complected complexion while obviously
those in Descartes zone Paris had a
Catholic complexion and so on but of
course the point you mentioned about
authority is very important although
there had been a good deal of research
into what we would now call mechanics or
Kant mathematical physics in the Middle
Ages and we shouldn't forget that in
fact a great deal of what was would go
by the way of being science was actually
in the form of commentary on ancient
books above although not exclusively
those of Aristotle and one thing that
Descartes and others of his generation
absolutely knew was that historical
authority was not the same thing as it
were first order research or inquiry so
in other words what one can say is that
Descartes in starting out on his famous
search for certain
knowledge was really looking for a way
of moving forward from the situation
that you've just outlined I mean he was
looking for a research program as we
might say in modern parlance and prior
to that a research method yes I think
that that's that's perfectly correct
description situation it's very
important as one further fact which
conditions all of his work and which one
finds the thread thread whilst that
science was not conceived as a shared or
joint or organised enterprise as it is
now for us it's just taken for granted
that science means scientists there are
a lot of people and they communicate
with each other and there's a division
of labor division of intellectual labor
at that time the first half the 17th
century it was still a reasonable
project for one man to have the idea
that he could lay the foundations of all
future science and Descartes who did
really fundamentally believe that it was
not as it were a piece of megalomaniac
insanity on his part as it would be in
the modern world for anybody to have
that I do now in my introduction to this
discussion I said that Descartes became
fascinated by the question of whether
there was anything that we could know
for certain yes he was clear from the
outset wasn't he that certainty and
truth are not the same thing and that
the I to put it at its uttermost crudite
certainty is a state of mind
the truth is relates to the way things
are at yes in a world yeah but he seems
to have thought that you could only be
know that you've got the truth so to
speak if you also had grounds for
certainty so that his method was not
only going to have to be one which
delivered the goods in the form of
worthwhile concludes yes also gave him a
way of defending them against skeptical
arguments so now how did he go about
meeting that double-barreled job well
Descartes had a set of conditions on
inquiry and some of them were just sort
of sensible rules about dividing
questions up into handleable amounts
trying to get your ideas clear and
things like that but it had got this
very characteristically important rule
for him that you shouldn't accept as
true anything about which you
take slightest doubt now of course as
you said on the face of it that isn't an
immediately sensible row because in
ordinary life we're constantly seeking
true beliefs about things but we don't
necessarily want to make those beliefs
as certain as possible one thing we'd
have to invest too much effort into
making the ultimate you know ultimately
certain beliefs all the time but
Descartes who was trying to get at the
foundations of science and also not only
at the foundations of a science itself
in the sense of fundamental general
truths about the world but also to lay
the foundations of inquiry that is to be
able as he thought to lay the
foundations of the possibility of going
on to find out more things to establish
that scientific knowledge was actually
possible for him he felt that it was
absolutely essential you should start
the search for truth with a search for
certainty that what he wanted to do was
to be able to put the scientific
enterprise as we would put it into a
shape in which it could no longer be
attacked by skeptics so the first thing
he wanted to do was to engage in the
kind we might call it pre-emptive
skepticism in order to put the
foundations of knowledge beyond
skeptical reach he said to himself I
will do everything the skeptics can do
only better and what I can do by
pressing the skeptical inquiry hard
enough is he hoped come out the other
side with something which would be
absolutely foundational and rock-hard
and among the most characteristic
features of Descartes is not that he
confuses the idea of looking for truth
and the idea of a sir looking for
certainty he saw they were two separate
separate things but he thought that the
only sure way of searching for truth was
by starting four by searching for
certainty
