well august 6 1945
is a day that is
unforgettable to or should be to anyone
alive at the time i was i was a
teenager a counselor in a summer camp
it was announced in the morning that uh
the atom bomb had been dropped in
hiroshima
city destroyed uh
everyone listened and went off to their
morning activity
baseball game swimming whatever it might
be
i was so appalled i couldn't believe it
not only at the event but that nobody
cared
and to this day i have never lost that
feeling
i still have it i can't imagine
how people can not be utterly
horrified what happened and
simply lacking concern over the fact
that we are
getting closer and closer to terminal
nuclear war
not uh not my judgment
as everyone should know the famous
doomsday clock
last january was the analysts
dropped minutes moved to seconds now
100 seconds to midnight
since then since january we have been
moving closer
president trump had already abandoned
the
uh intermediate nuclear forces treaty
immediately following it with the
testing of
missiles that violate the treaty
basically
saying to others come on and join us
and destroy helping destroy the world
since january he's abandoned the open
skies treaty
which goes back to eisenhower which
offered another
limited protection against the threat of
nuclear war
he's uh posed frivolous objections to
the
signing of the new start treaty
the russians have been pleading for
negotiations about this for some time
it's due to be signed in a few months
it's probably too late to do anything
that's the last of the major uh that's
the end of the arms control regime
there's no threatening to uh start
nuclear tests violating the
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty
which actually the united states never
ratified but
has observed that's almost 30 years old
again encouraging others to
do the same uh meanwhile pouring money
into the development of new
and more destructive weapons uh
others are doing it too but this mutual
discourse stimulates others to do so
arms manufacturers are euphoric
uh huge new contracts coming in to
develop new means to destroy everything
and you know they plan long range so
they're
expecting later contracts to try to find
ways to defend ourselves against the
weapons that we
are constructing that others will
construct
this is all part of the manufacturing
system
it's part of the way to stimulate to try
to make it look as if we're
in a recovery which of course we're not
uh
to for to advance electoral prospects
all of this goes on with no comment
virtually
take a look at the campaign
nobody talks about it maybe a word here
and there
even among left
critics it's very hard to hear anything
meanwhile a provocative actions are
taking place along the russian border
trump is sending a major naval
contingence to the
south china sea uh
the background is one of increasing
provocation and development of
massive means for destruction going back
to august 6
1945 was
clear to anyone with a brain functioning
that human intelligence had reached the
point
where it would soon have the means to
destroy
everything hiroshima bomb was still
limited you could only destroy a single
city with a bomb
but it was perfectly obvious that
technological advances would soon
lead to greater destructive capacity
that happened by 1953 when
thermonuclear weapons were exploded at
that point
yes human ingenuity had found the ways
to this
essentially destroy life on earth and it
gets worse after that
anyone who's looked at the record of the
nuclear age can only conclude that it's
a
virtual miracle that we've survived a
case after case
where it came very close to
launch of nuclear weapons
averted either some mostly by by
accidental misinterpretation of signals
the automated signals fail all the time
human intervention at the last moment uh
sometimes reckless acts of leaders
uh it's almost miraculous
and miracles don't persist uh
we're perpetuating an
age of uh destruction
virtually of organized human life
this is i should say one of two
races to disaster the other is
failure to address
appropriately the
growing the threatening environmental
catastrophe of
global warming and in the unique case of
the united states
normally refusing to deal with it but
racing as
quickly as possible toward the abyss
it's almost impossible to observe what's
happening to human beings
and think that this is a viable species
i just can't get over the amazement that
nobody cares
it's un unimaginable
