what times you talk tonight six o'clock
I think what are you speaking them up
I'm supposed to speak about the driving
forces in the u.s. foreign policy not
okay yeah all right Noam Chomsky thanks
so much for joining me glad to be with
you what I want to ask you about today
is some of the challenges and
confronting the major issues of our time
some not challenges in terms of facts
but challenges in terms of how we
actually go about building something
against them building something positive
and also just building something against
the power structures and with such
massive massive issues I'm thinking
particularly about climate change I
think there's particular challenges that
come along with that and one of the main
ones i think is is sort of the lack of
feedback that happens if you're trying
to do something positive about them
trying to make something happen you know
there's the National Security Agency and
things like econ economic inequality
which are massive about themselves but
climate change is really massive it it's
going to take completely changing how we
run their societies how we run our
economies and how we plan our cities
it's a really huge challenge and as
someone who's confronted huge issues
before that seemed hopeless at the time
like Vietnam I was wondering if you had
any thoughts on how we can as
individuals and as groups go about
trying to organize and confront
something as major as climate change
when it can feel like you're pushing a
giant rock and not getting anywhere the
problem of how you do something without
necessarily getting positive feedback
well you can't expect positive feedback
from power systems they have their own
interest let's say take climate change
Canada is a good place to think about
this it kinda de used to be a pretty
civilized society by comparative
standards now it's becoming this scourge
of the earth that's partly canadian
mining opera
which are very destructive all around
the world and are arousing great
resistance among the victims mostly
indigenous people but also the
dedication to develop the most harmful
the forms of fossil fuels just this
morning's newspaper there's a discussion
and take a look at the business section
of the New York Times it discusses
Canadian plans plans of Canadian
corporations in the Canadian government
to vastly expand the pipeline system to
the west to aim for the asia market and
to the east so as to be able to reach
directly to europe with the rest of the
world without going through the united
states and it points out that there are
difficulties in at the west there are
problems with First Nations the town
where they wanted the major export
terminal two be has voted strongly
against allowing it to be used the
indigenous groups are struggling hard
against it this is typical this tells
you first of all it's partially an
answer your question it also tells you
something very interesting about the
current world it takes a Canada and this
is typical the richest most educated
sectors of the society with the greatest
advantages are pressing very hard to
escalate the threat of global
destruction the people who we consider
primitive you know in Canada First
Nations in Latin America indigenous
people in Australia Aboriginal tribes
and India but tribal societies they're
the ones who are trying to retard the
threat and what's happening in Canada is
typical and it is a kind of an
interesting and if you're if you can
separate yourself from the horrifying
consequences since it's an interesting
kind of paradox if you'd like but it
tells you the answer your question every
it's urgent for those who have the most
privileged the most opportunity the
greatest advantages to be in the
forefront instead of in the rear in
trying to impede what is likely is to be
a serious catastrophe again take a look
at this morning's newspaper the lead
story in The New York Times other
newspapers is a several scientific
reports that just came out about
Antarctic ice melting West Antarctic ice
melting it's now pretty much determined
that it's taking place and probably
irreversible and the predictions are
that within several generations it will
start will keep increasing sea level
rise but within a few generations at
let's plate very fast to about a 10-foot
rising sea level take a look at the
world and ask what will be like with a
ten-foot rising sea level well while
we're looking at that we see that in
Canada and in the United States those
sectors of the population which have
most power most influence most advantage
are trying to race as fast as possible
towards this destructive outcome
meanwhile first nations and their
counterparts elsewhere trying to retard
it that is the answer popular forces
just have to move up to the front and
not not accept the what's being done in
their name and there's no big secret
about how to do that I mean every
possible social you know every positive
social change in history that I could
think of as work pretty much the same
way grassroots organizing development of
popular movements finally enough
pressure on the centers of power so that
they're compelled to respond
and that can happen we don't live in
totalitarian dictatorship we're by
comparative and historical standards
they're very free to act sure there'll
be refreshing that's taken for granted
but nothing like what's been faced in
the past or is faced elsewhere and
therefore it's really a matter of will
or choice the the situation is so big
though and there's so many different you
know avenues you could go about trying
to to work on on the issue and I think
if at least for me if you just focus on
the facts of the matter it's very easily
to quickly feel paralyzed and not know
how to move forward and given you know
you've talked about when you were first
getting involved with the Vietnam War
yourself and others would try to give
speeches and it would be to a tiny group
of people may be basically just the
organizers and one other person thing
you said at the time things felt
completely hopeless that it would be
impossible and you just kept kept going
anyways and so I was wondering what your
thoughts on this for climate change are
I mean do you think generally it helps
to try to focus on one small area even
if it seems trivial in the vast scale of
things and and try to work on that or in
order to get a sense of a feedback and
like you are having an impact depends
who you are and where you are there's no
single right answer for everything there
are some places where maybe the most
important thing you can do is Institute
local pressures to support say use of
solar power or wind power or
weatherization of homes there are other
places where maybe the most important
thing to do is to press for control over
the plans to create pipelines and impede
them my first nations can do it there's
no reason why people in Toronto again
but but this is simply no single answer
we have all kind of ways it it's very
different from the early
nam war movement then that as you
mentioned there was no support and now
there's pretty substantial recognition
that there's a serious problem actually
some polls just international foals just
came out a couple of weeks ago there I
don't think they included Canada but I'm
sure Canada would be in the mainstream
spectrum it's this pretty high
recognition on the population of the
world that is a serious problem I think
the highest that they found that the
international poll was Brazil than more
than three-quarters the United States is
below the norm but that's for a simple
reason partly you can see it outside
this window where you see the cook
Cancer Center there's a huge propaganda
campaign perfectly public nothing secret
about it by major sectors of the
corporate system energy market Chamber
of Commerce others working really hard
to try to convince people that either
there's no global warming at all or if
there is humans have a role in it that's
and that has had an effect on the
population it's below the global norm
and it's interestingly stratified so if
you break it up and holes break it up
into Democrats and Republicans the
Democrats are somewhat below the global
norm Republicans are off the planet yeah
their way down at the bottom and they
are the ones who are much it's it's the
party that's a former part I wouldn't
call a political party anymore that's
lockstep dedicated to the service of
wealth and power and for them what
happens in the future just doesn't
matter I didn't have to recognize that
in the moral calculus of North American
state capitalism the fader grandchildren
amounts to essentially nothing as
compared with the need for profit
tomorrow now people can understand that
it's not like the anti-war movement the
majority of the population already
understands it
the point is to get them active
energized all kinds of ways protests
sit-ins take over buildings whatever it
takes to try to make it possible for our
near descendants not very far off to
have a chance for a decent living that's
pretty straightforward message one of
the things he always point out is you
know if you were asked before the civil
rights movement would it make sense for
someone to stage a sit-in at a counter
you'd have said probably not and same
with the occupied movement if people ask
to you should you you know have a camp
in a tecate park it was said be a waste
of your time and I guess I guess one of
the main issues is we never know what's
what's actually going to work sometimes
we can despite our best efforts it might
even be a push back where we actually
lose ground and so I wanted to get your
thoughts on how does one keep forward or
keep going in the face of not knowing if
the tactics that you are pursuing are
even with while or not well as you've
just indicated I'm probably the worst
person to ask because my judgment has
often been wrong the first case you
mentioned was the Greensboro North
Carolina a couple of black students
sitting in at a lunch counter at my
assumption when I heard about it is this
is going to be smashed instantly turned
out to be a spark that set off a huge
popular movement occupy if I can
fortunately I wasn't asked but if I had
been in Zuccotti Park I would have said
you're wasting your time turned out not
sometimes I think it's my judgment right
other times not but the point is you
really don't know so how do you keep
going you consider the alternatives the
one alternative is to say look I don't
know if it's going to work so I'll do
nothing thereby helping ensure that the
worst will happen the other
possibilities say look I don't know
whether it's worth of a work i'll use my
best judgment if my best judgment is
look there's a chance it will succeed
i'll try
and then we'll see but it's not a secret
there's no magic keys to these things
these are the only thing weighs anything
has ever worked in the past sometimes
successfully sometimes there is an error
and you get a bigger backlash then and
they then your own achievement the net
effect is negative you can't be sure you
can only think it through as carefully
as possible and do what seems best he
also thinks up I guess part of the issue
is realizing how how difficult it's
going to be in a lot of ways you you
gave the example somewhere I read about
Columbia students occupying the the
universities in 1968 and there's sort of
this attitude that like well we'll do
that and then our work will be done that
sort of understanding just how how much
power how much inertia how much
institutional structures you're up
against do you think just understanding
how how difficult it's going to be is
important in ensuring that we don't one
doesn't burn out when you're when you're
working on these things and they have to
a realistic sense of hell so if we
change takes place with the structures
of power like take for granted that
they're going to resist change that
harms their interests in any way they
can but when you say it's a couple of
points to bear in mind in the United
States and Canada a lot of the activism
for a long time last 20 or 30 30 for
maybe half century has been initiated by
young people that is people who do not
have an institutional memory it's not
like the labor movement or the old
communist party or others some new look
we're in it for the long haul it's not
going to we're not going to have a
victory tomorrow maybe it'll be defeat
tomorrow but we'll lay the basis for
going on beyond because we have a
conception of
what institutional structures like the
Columbia students in 68 I'm going to do
a lot of them they literally thought
that if they sat in the president's
office for a couple of weeks we'll have
peace and love the world doesn't work
like that you have to understand how it
does work and then if you have a partial
defeat which is likely say go to the
police come in and destroy the ducati
park at cabin well you go on to the next
thing you say take for granted that's
the way power systems work well so we're
ready we'll go on to the next thing we
already planned for it of course you
have to sort of deal with the enormity
of that the scale of what you're up
against that's the second point I was
going to make the enormity is less than
it has been we're much more free today
than in the past and then in other
places by comparative in historical
standards the barriers are not high a
lot of freedom has been won over the
years the kind of actions that the
police used to take with impunity are
unthinkable now except with regard to
you know the people who are so lacking
and privilege that they can be attacked
fear you know with impunity but for most
of us by now the the barriers are very
limited as compared with what has been
through and what is true elsewhere I
mean want to see what barriers are take
a look at that that photograph painting
over there when it's a painting of what
happened in El Salvador a week after the
fall of the Berlin Wall we're leading
intellectuals were just massacred by the
by the army on the orders of the high
command who broke into the university
and murder him we're phasing that and
yet despite this despite the facts that
you know that the oppression and the
obstacles faced elsewhere are are much
bigger I think there is there are subtle
subtle difficulties that but I think
maybe we we most
of us overestimate or underestimate how
how powerful they are like just pure
social factors of wanting to get along I
mean you've talked a lot about how you
know you went well sort of an
alternative school until you were 12
that what you didn't even know you were
a good student there was no there's no
real competition that for the vast
majority of us we spend the first 20
years or so of our life maybe even more
basically learning to get ahead and
learning that our validation comes from
pleasing those an authority or the
people who have a bit of elite status
and and I think this this plays a much
bigger effect on us than we really
realize it and you've talked about this
yourself how you know it just you you
meet the people you go to a place like
Harvard or something when you're doing
the fellowship and and they seem nice
and you just want to get along and
before you know it you're sort of
conforming and you just want to cause a
ruckus just compare the pressures with
conformed to for conformity with the
fear of getting your brains blown out by
the military does it be different we're
lucky to face the pressure there are
pressures for conformity obedience
passivity but to overcome that is very
slight as compared with overcoming the
violence of the state it's true but I
think I think the one thing is that the
only problem with the conformity is that
you often don't even recognize that it's
a current you don't it's harder to see
which is pretty easy to see you have to
think about it and then you can
understand that you can make a decision
of do I want up and form or do I want
overcome it there's nothing new about
this I mean I'm sure you've read Animal
Farm I'm pretty sure you haven't read
the introduction to Animal Farm because
it wasn't printed it was found later in
Orwell's unpublished papers it was kind
of interesting what he points out is
that in
the book itself is the satire the
totalitarian enemy with a really are
barriers harsh barriers to Detroit so
harsh that to try to overcome them can
mean you know death imprisonment torture
and so on and it compares with England
his looking was a free society but in
England I'm quoting now unpopular ideas
can be suppressed without the use of
force and one of the reasons he gives us
exactly what you said if you've gone to
the best schools and colleges you have
instilled into you the understanding
that there are certain things it
wouldn't do to say but which is harder
to overcome that conformism that's
instilled into you or the threat of the
torture chamber we're lucky we have real
opportunities more than in the past
because a lot has been one we have the
legacy of the successful struggles of
our predecessors we can use that legacy
or we can say look it's too hard to
overcome the fact that I don't want to
conform it's a choice and it's a choice
that can be made and just a final
question then there's this interview
with Bertrand Russell with bb's the BBC
from 1959 and the final question he was
asked was if this if this tape was to be
found sort of like in a thousand years
and you sort of had a few words of
advice to to that generation of what you
have learned from your life what you've
gleaned from your experiences what would
that be and he said you know there would
be one intellectual thing and one moral
thing the intellectual thing is just
deal with the world how it is don't deal
with the facts of the matter whenever
you're trying to figure out how things
work not not how you wish they were or
what you think it would be have a
positive social effect to believe in
just just the facts however dire or good
they are and second thing is love is
wise heated is foolish and
I was wondering if if what your answer
to that would it be the same is there
anything you would add to that or what
what have you clean from your life well
there is so we can ask him I don't think
I would put it exactly the way that you
described that the basic point is
correct and very simple everyone knows
it first point try to understand the
world as it is not as you wish it were
second point decide what outcomes you
just think are desirable and then ask
yourself am I willing to commit my
energy effort dedication to trying to
achieve the outcomes that I think are
beneficial so take say to climate change
do I want to commit energy and effort as
I can right now not with total impunity
but with a fair amount of freedom do I
want to commit those efforts to ensuring
or at least increasing the likelihood
that my grandchildren will have a decent
world to live in that's a simple
question anybody can ask themselves and
the choice is possible for people like
us are quite fast noam chomsky thanks so
much fire try me yeah thank you
you
