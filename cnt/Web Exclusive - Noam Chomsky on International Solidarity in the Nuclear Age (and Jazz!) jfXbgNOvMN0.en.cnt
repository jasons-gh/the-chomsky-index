what am i listening to music well my
wife is trying to educate me
I have very conservative tastes but
she's introducing me to jazz for the
first time in my life
some of those just noise but some of it
I can begin to comprehend she's trying
it's a mixed story the two minutes the
midnight was established in January in
March two months later the bulletin of
Atomic Scientists came out with a very
significant article which should
describe how we're a little closer to
midnight day it was a careful discussion
by leading specialists who pointed out
that the nuclear modernization programs
started under Obama under congressional
pressure now extending under Trump have
actually increased the they call the
kill ratio of weapons to an extreme
point up to the point where they say
explicitly that the US Nuclear Posture
today is the posture that a government
would have that is planning a first
strike Putin gave a talk on nuclear
policy a couple of weeks ago which was
bitterly condemned because he pointed
out that the Russians are developing
weapons which will evade the
anti-ballistic missile systems that the
u.s. was creating yeah that's what
happens when you put a system on the
border of an adversary which is an
effective first strike weapon they're
going to counter react
so that's escalating and if you look at
the the general tendency since the
two-minute warning is to increase it the
Iran deal also does however there are
other things North Korea and South Korea
are clearly moving towards an attempt at
reconciliation and even denuclearization
furthermore the declaration from the JEM
declaration it has deadlines of
commitments details about the steps that
will be taken by the two Koreas on their
own accord
now if the Trump administration has any
brains at all
just don't interfere with what the two
koreas are doing you want to take credit
for it that's fine you know you want to
prance around in public it's your
business but just leave us alone so we
can settle this in peace
now if the Trump administration agrees
not to disrupt it that's the crucial
issue nothing they're doing it helps if
the sanctions were nothing the threats
are nothing they can talk whatever they
like but the two Koreas are seeking to
move towards peace in general the
tendency is negative that there are some
positive signs
International so
among people is quite possible and it
can't have an effect because they could
affect their own governments in the case
of North Korea there's something very
definite that we should be doing
pressing the US government politely to
stay away maybe Trump will do it anyway
because then he can get credit for it
and I can get a Nobel Prize be a
transformative figure I was you know go
to Mount Rushmore or whatever he wants
in the case of Iran the Europeans in my
opinion are very unlikely to stand up to
the United States the United States it's
just too frightening we don't think
about that here but the world is
terrified of the United States in fact
there's even evidence for this the
Gallup administered poll polling carries
out international polls over year one
year 2013 they asked a very important
question which they've never asked again
because they didn't like the answer I
suspect they asked the question which
country is the greatest threat to world
peace the United States nobody nobody
else was even close literally that was
the last time that question was asked
however solidarity among peoples in the
European countries in the United States
could make a difference one in lessening
the threats from the United States
that's our job
another is fortifying other governments
to stand up to the United States which
is other people's jobs but that's a
basis for international solidarity it is
in everyone's interest in the world to
cut back the threat of nuclear war and
global warming I mean one thing that is
absolutely astounding there is a flee
nothing like it in history we have an
organization a major organization which
is dedicated to destroying the
possibilities of human life that has
never happened before went through the
Nazis it wasn't true of Attila the Hun
there's just nothing like it in history
it's called the Republican Party here's
the most powerful country in human
history which is telling the world we're
not going to cooperate in dealing with a
devastating problem we're going to make
it worse we're going to maximize the use
of fossil fuels which we know very well
or destroying the environment of course
they know it like Trump may say there's
no global warming but he's building
walls around his golf course to stop you
know the sea level rise and this is
really serious this is not in the far
future the last time the world was
anywhere near this temperature a couple
of degrees of both twenty-five thousand
years ago the sea level was maybe 50 30
feet higher there's no you imagine what
that would mean and we're moving in that
direction
it's an imminent problem the fact that
this is happening is astonishing enough
the fact that it's not a headline in the
newspapers every day is even more
astonishing that and the increasing
threat of nuclear war really do raise
questions about whether the human
species is even viable
Bernie Sanders did something that
completely broke with American political
history
the most remarkable thing about less
November December 16 - summers Bank was
not the election of Trump it's the first
time that a candidate went way to the
top no funding from the corporate sector
no funding from private wealth no media
support either ignored or denigrated and
that a might have won the election most
popular political figure in the country
in a Democratic Society the most popular
political figure on the country would be
over the front pages every day okay
that's the way we keep this our system
keeps democracy from functioning here he
talked about socialism but it meant New
Deal welfare state capitalism that
Corbin's the same the parliamentary
Labour Party is dedicated to killing him
The Guardian you know the liberal press
is just turning out a massive campaign
against him all kind of crazed charges
about anti-semitism this that and the
other thing doing anything they can to
undermine him he's maintaining popular
support it's quite similar of the
Sanders phenomenon the liberal
establishment press and political class
are desperately trying to crush these
movements but they're maintaining
themselves in the United States and
something similar in England the
Democratic Party as an internal crisis
and if it can't overcome it a little
probably decline continue to decline the
popular base is Social Democratic the
establishment is donor orietta New
Democrats and there's a break there if
they can't get together they're in
trouble and there's something similar
namely with the popular base being in
favor of kind of social democratic
policies Corbyn tight policies and the
parliamentary party and the leadership
the Blair type
the equivalent of new Democrats they're
trying to block it along with the
liberal press and that's a very serious
problem and the sort of center left
