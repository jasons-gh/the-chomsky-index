president Trump's national security
adviser John Bolton just gave a major
speech in Miami on u.s. policy in Latin
America Bolton described Venezuela Cuba
and Nicaragua as a troika of tyranny
saying quote this triangle of terror
stretching from Havana to Caracas to
Managua is the cause of immense human
suffering the impetus of enormous
regional instability and the genesis of
a sordid cradle of communism in the
Western Hemisphere professor Chomsky can
you respond to that troika of tyranny
says John Bolton well that of course
immediately brings to mind the axis of
evil speech of George Bush back in 2002
which was the precursor laying the
groundwork for the invasion of Iraq the
worst crime of this century with
horrendous consequences for Iraq
eliciting esic conflicts that are
tearing the region apart a major
atrocity John Bolton was behind that his
new troika I doubt that the US will dare
to do something similar but that's what
it brings to mind if it's kind of
interesting to see this hysterical
raving alongside of another astonishing
propaganda campaign that Bolton and his
colleagues are carrying out with regard
to the caravan of poor and miserable
people fleeing from severe oppression of
violence terror extreme poverty from
three countries Honduras mainly Honduras
secondarily Guatemala thirdly El
Salvador not Nicaragua
incidentally three countries that have
been under harsh US domination way back
but particularly since the 1980s when
Reagan's terror Wars devastated
particularly El Salvador and Guatemala
secondarily Honduras Nicaragua was
attacked by Reagan of course but
Nicaragua was the one country which had
an army to defend the population in the
other countries the army were the state
terrorists backed by the United States
the most extreme source of migrants
right now is Honduras that why Honduras
will was always bitterly oppressed but
in 2009 Honduras had a mildly reformist
that President Mills Alaia of the
Honduran powerful rich elite couldn't
tolerate that a military coup took place
expelled him from the country was
harshly condemned all through the
hemisphere with one notable exception
the United States the Obama
administration refused to call over
military coup because if they had they
would have been compelled by law to
withdraw military funding from the
military regime which was imposing a
regime of brutal terror or Honduras
became the murder capital of the world a
fraudulent election took place under the
military regime want again harshly
condemned all over the hemisphere or
most of the world but not by the United
States Obama administration praised
Honduras for carrying out election
moving towards democracy and so on now
people are fleeing from the misery and
horrors for which we are responsible and
you have this incredible charade taking
place which is which the world
looking at with utter astonishment poor
miserable people families mothers
children fleeing from terror and
repression for which we were responsible
and in reaction
they're sending thousands of troops to
the border the troops being sent to the
border outnumber the children and who
were fleeing and they're with a
remarkable PR campaign they're
frightening much of the country into
believing that we're just on the verge
of an invasion by you know Middle
Eastern terrorists funded by George
Soros so on and so forth it's all kind
of reminiscent of something that
happened 30 years ago you may recall in
1985 Ronald Reagan strapped on as cowboy
boots and called got in front of
television called a national emergency
because the Nicaraguan army was two days
march from Harlingen Texas just about
the overwhelm and destroy us and it
worked I mean this spectacle is almost
indescribable
even even apart from noticing where
they're coming from the countries that
we have crucially been involved and
destroying it's the ability to carry
this off repeatedly is quite an amazing
commentary on much of the popular
culture but that's but the Troy the the
troika or the just are just like the
axis of evil are those who just don't
obey us orders Columbia for example has
the worst human rights record in the
hemisphere for years but they're not
part of the troika troika of
- ranee all of this is rings very
familiar bills
it so long as it's been a long-standing
element of the US propaganda system on
the mostly on the far right but not only
which goes way back and the which is a
kind of pathological feature of the
dominant political culture that should
be understood analyzed and dismantled
the world-renowned professor linguist
and dissident Noam Chomsky will return
with him in a moment to talk about the
twin threats of climate change and
nuclear war
