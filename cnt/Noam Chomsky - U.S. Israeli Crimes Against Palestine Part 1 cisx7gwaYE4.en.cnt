you
is my honor today to introduce professor
Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky is an
institute professor and professor
emeritus of linguistics at MIT widely
considered one of the fathers of modern
linguistics professor Chomsky has also
established himself as a political
activist in prominent critic of u.s.
foreign policy in the nature of American
support for Israel in particular
professor Chomsky is received numerous
awards including honorary degrees from
over 30 universities his written written
and lectured widely and subjects ranging
from linguistic theory to international
politics among his recent books are new
horizons in the study of language on
nature and language and the forthcoming
hopes and prospects I have always
considered Noam Chomsky rare and
refreshing source of clarity especially
regarding Palestine Israel I think I
speak for many of us when I say no I'm
Chomsky is a tremendous personal
inspiration and I cannot imagine a
speaker who would generate more
excitement on campus please join me in
welcoming professor Noam Chomsky
Oh
Thanks now we can go home well let me
begin by giving credit where credit is
due to someone i rarely praise in fact i
can't remember when I ever have namely
the Jerusalem correspondent of the New
York Times ethan bronner had a good
column this morning it's worth reading
he's describing the the mood and Israel
on Independence Day and he points out
that the mood was on you unusually grim
in fact maybe uniquely so he refers to a
quite an interesting letter that was
written by one of the major Israeli
correspondents Ari Shavit in our it's
kind of a centrist correspondent very
influential it's an open letter from
Chevy to Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and he says we don't really
know each other but WR you know who i am
and i never write letters to people in
the government but the moment is so
significant and dangerous that I just
have to write you the letter he has a
long open letter letter says that you
mr. Netanyahu or maybe the most hated
person in the world in Israel the left
hates you the right hates you well my
friends hate you I'm the only person who
doesn't hate you and of course all the
Arabs hate you and everyone the United
States hates you and the rest of the
world and so on and he says the reason
is because it's not your fault he says
you know I really like you I think
you're a nice guy but Israel's facing
may be the worst crisis in its history
and we have to do something about it and
then he runs through the crises the
worst one he
it's just the general attitude in the
world toward Israel will he didn't know
it but the day after his litter appeared
there was a poll an international poll
by the Pew Research Center which
incidentally he's in runner also refers
to in his column and the poll ranked was
a global ranking of countries as to what
people think about them in many
countries and Israel ranked way down at
the bottom fact right next to North
Korea almost at the very bottom and
attitudes so the concern is justified of
course it's a lot of paranoia and
self-righteousness the world doesn't
understand us everyone it's the Jews
we're right about everything but there's
no point just we can't go along just
knowing that we have to somehow do
something little convince the world
there are some striking analogies which
runner didn't bring up one of them is
South Africa there are a lot of
analogies drawn between Israel and South
Africa most of them of pretty dubious
quality but one makes a lot of sense it
has to do with the history if you go
back about 50 years the mood in white
nationalist South Africa was very
similar to this they they were aware of
it that they were aware that they're
becoming a pariah society they reacted
very much the way Israel's react you
today a large-scale international
information systems effort to explain to
people it's not propaganda its
explanation just as it's called in
Israel to explain to them that
everything we do is right just and
highly moral and you should understand
it and so on and also kind of circling
the wagons a lot of defiance shifts to
the extreme nationalist right right
ultra
nationalist movements and a lot more
it's all very similar about that time
about 50 years ago the South African
foreign minister in a conversation with
the American ambassador told him that we
know that there are strong resolutions
and the United Nations denouncing us the
past by most of the countries in the
world but he said that doesn't really
matter and his words were what matters
more than all other votes put together
is the position of the United States in
view of its predominant position of
leadership in the Western world so in
brief there's only one vote in the
United Nations that's yours as long as
you vote for us the rest of them we
don't care about that was an accurate
observation then it's pretty much an
accurate observation today and it became
much more so in the case of South Africa
as the decolonization proceeded remember
this is 1960 the decolonization preceded
and protests international protests
against apartheid were more intense well
actually the u.s. continued to support
the histories informative the United
States continued to support South Africa
the US government the apartheid regime
right through the period of mounting
protests at home to that continued right
through the Reagan years into the late
1980s Reagan had to at that time he
already had to evade congressional
sanctions against south africa in order
to make sure the US trade increased as
it did and he also had to ignore even
business opposition it's a little
unusual by then the business world late
seventies early eighties the American
business world was starting to disinvest
they didn't like what was happening they
thought they were they should get rid of
apartheid but Reagan overruled it and it
was no small matter and
South African crimes with us court
dwarfed the crimes that Reagan was
responsible for in Central America in
the Middle East which were pretty
awesome but in South Africa was much
worse I'm just in the surrounding
countries Angola and Mozambique the
South African depredations were
responsible for killing about a million
and a half people causing sixty billion
dollars of damage not a small thing and
the US government not the population not
even Congress not even business content
but the government continued to support
it right through they had a reason and
the reason is familiar a justification
the justification was the war on terror
what were told these days is that George
Bush declared the war on terror and
after nine eleven which is not quite
accurate here ii declared it reagan had
declared it when he came into office in
1981 said a centerpiece of u.s. foreign
policy is going to be state-directed
international terrorism the plague of
the modern age retiring the barbarism in
our time and so on that's all been wiped
out of history for simple reason
reagan's war on terror very quickly
turned into a massive terrorist war with
enormous destruction and atrocities and
that's not a good thing to maintain
within history so it's kind of going
away except for the real world so when
Bush Rida cleared it the original had
been forgotten defense of South Africa
was justified by the war on terror 1988
the Pentagon declared that the African
National Congress Nelson Mandela's a
African National Congress was one of the
more notorious terrorist groups in the
world that was 1988 after everything
that happened in fairness
I should say that a year ago last May
Mandela finally was removed from the US
terrorist list so he can now travel in
the United States without special
dispensation but that was 1988 and in
fact the apartheid regime looked
unassailable the foreign ministers
analysis in 1950 was pretty accurate as
long as they had that one vote the world
could be disregarded well I right that
time for reasons which aren't exactly
known a US government policy shifted and
within a two or three years apart height
had collapsed that's gone that's a lot
to say about what followed not so
beautiful but it was certainly a major
victory for freedom and justice well
those are important lessons worth
keeping in mind and it's worth keeping
in mind that virtually without exception
Israeli actions Israeli policies are in
fact joint policies their us Israeli
policies Israel can go just as far as
the u.s. permits just as far as it
supports it and no further when Israel
doesn't does something the US doesn't
like tells them loud and clear and they
withdraw quiet doesn't matter who the
president is under george w bush there
were some extreme examples that's been
in fact Israel relies much more on the
United States for diplomatic military
and economic support than South Africa
did South Africa was getting support
from other terrorist states like Britain
and others Israel in particular but the
but Israel is really not it's much more
dependent on the United States and it
follows that any meaningful change in
the relationship Israel and Palestine is
going to have to be based on a change
here
in the United States now there have been
substantial changes in past years so a
meeting like this say would have been
inconceivable as recently as five or ten
years ago if I wasn't long ago that when
I a couple other people tried to talk
about these topics we literally had to
have police protection and the meetings
were broken up even my own University
MIT police protection meetings were
broken up couldn't talk about it it's
all radically changed particularly since
the Gaza attacked last year which made a
big shift and how two dudes and
understanding and it also means that
actions are now feasible that weren't
even thinkable up until recently for
example the kind that we're taken with
regard to South Africa after decades of
education and protest a long time but by
1977 Hampshire College I think was the
first one did pass a divestment
resolution and by the early 80s as I say
it was even congressional resolutions
there's a crucial example in fact is is
just that that divestment from the US
corporations that are involved in
criminal actions in the occupied
territories there's that focuses right
where it should on our activities
focuses on us it's what we should do
anyway your responsibility is yourself
not other people's crimes and it's also
the decisive factor in what's going to
happen that's what we can influence
there is a brown group brown students
for justice in Palestine which is called
for divestment from US corporations that
are involved in criminal actions and the
occupied territories so in other words
is asking Brown University to keep to
the law international law in fact
domestic law that the actions are
criminal is not really in question the
wall the so-called separation wall
what are we called an annexation wall
that cuts through the West Bank as many
of you I'm sure know that was a subject
to a decision by the by the World Court
International Court of Justice which
unanimously including the US Justice in
a separate declaration unanimously
concluded that the Geneva Conventions
apply to the occupied territories the
Geneva Conventions very explicitly bar
any transfer of population from the
occupying power to the occupied
territory so that means any settlement
anywhere in the occupied territories is
just illegal de facto and violation of
international criminal law the US judge
judge Bergen thoe declared that includes
every part of the fence that goes into
West Bank territory roughly eighty five
percent of it which is there not to
defend Israel but to defend settlers who
were there illegally so the wall is
illegal and the same is true of every
other settlement with regard to
Jerusalem which is the area of extreme
intention now the actions are doubly
illegal a not only in violation of
international law but even in violation
of very specific security council
resolutions which the u.s. in fact
agreed to back in the late 60s in the
early 70s when the United States was
still part of the world on this issue
departed in the mid seventies but those
resolutions still stand say that's dull
criminality and it was understood in
Israel so in late nineteen sixty-seven
right after the June 67 war is when
question of settlement and the occupied
territories is beginning to be brought
up Israel's top legal advisor theodor
meron was a very distinguished
international lawyer is on the
national Commission's Human Rights
Commission's and so on he informed the
government that the Geneva Conventions
clearly apply to the occupied
territories than that any transfer of
Israeli citizens there would be in
violation of fundamental international
law the Israeli Attorney General
seconded that and if interestingly the
person was really in charge of the
occupied territories much a day on his
defense minister but he was responsible
for what happened there he agreed that
publicly said yes it's in violation of
international law but we're going to do
it anyway because countries violate
international law all the time so we
will too and he was basically correct he
he probably not consciously but he was
essentially repeating what the South
African foreign minister said as long as
the master agrees it doesn't matter if
it's in violation of law I'm the master
happens to be a criminal state anyway
and if it authorizes criminal actions
we're okay doesn't matter what the law
says and that goes until today very
strikingly in fact it rarely really gets
reported in fact mostly doesn't but as
I'm sure you all know the big issue the
big international issue is Iran at its
possible pursuit of nuclear weapons
capability and you know a lot of
hysteria about that Obama just made a
big speech which presented a new nuclear
posture and said us promises not to
attack not not to carry out a first
nuclear strike against countries that
don't have nuclear weapons with an
exception he said there were outliers
and the main outliers you put it is Iran
so we can carry out a nuclear attack
against them even though they don't have
nuclear weapons right through this
period you know Security Council
resolutions
so on there are other things going on so
the International Atomic Energy Agency
which is responsible for you know
monitoring the non-proliferation treaty
last September it passed a resolution
calling on Israel to join the
non-proliferation treaty and opened its
facilities nuclear facilities to
inspection Europe and the United States
tried to block the resolution but they
failed and it passed anyway well it
didn't really matter wasn't reported in
the United States or in England and one
or two notices here and there also
unreported except for the mooning
newspaper in Washington the Washington
Times was that Obama immediately
informed Israel that it doesn't apply to
them so they can forget about it at the
same time the Security Council passed a
resolution which got plenty of publicity
it was described as aimed Iran so it was
good it called on all states to join the
non-proliferation treaty and to settle
their disagreements within the framework
of the day of the UN Charter and the the
non-proliferation treaty being by
peaceful means well those provisions
were directed against the United States
there's only two countries in the world
that are threatening the use of force
which is also criminal take a look at
the UN Charter which bars the threat or
use of force and international affairs
but across the spectrum in the United
States the threat of force is considered
legitimate and often the use of force so
yes it's a criminal state across across
the spectrum and so the US and Israel
the only countries that are threatening
the use of force and in fact preparing
for it so they'll do it who knows but
without report here the United States
has recently sent to the island of Diego
Garcia in the Indian Ocean has sent
submarine tenders to care for nuclear
submarines nuclear submarines are
people and they can carry nuclear
weapons and it has also sent to Diego
Garcia the biggest bombs in the u.s.
Arsenal short of nuclear weapons would
have called massive ordnance penetrator
zat bunker busters they're called
they're aimed specifically Iran nobody
else is a huge 13-ton bombs which are
supposed to be able to penetrate deep
into the earth through you know
thousands of tons of reinforced concrete
it doesn't get reported here but of
course it's known to Iranian
intelligence and it's supposed to be
it's a threat of force actually Diego
Garcia the RIT Jago Garcia is an island
which isn't talked about much but it's
crucial to us international aggression
it's the major base for the bombing of
the Middle East and Central Asia and so
on that's a shape was a British island
the British expelled the population on
orders of the master the appeal to be
returned and one in British courts but
as Diane said law doesn't matter if the
master says no so they can't return
Diego Garcia is part of Africa the
African Union just a couple of months
ago established a nuclear weapons-free
zone if anybody were really interested
in stopping nuclear limiting nuclear
proliferation what they'd be doing is
supporting nuclear weapons free zones
around the world well Africa finally had
one but they can't implement it because
of Diego Garcia the United States and
Britain loyally trailing behind refused
to allow the nuclear free treaty to
apply to Diego Garcia because they
intend to use it they do use it for
storing nuclear weapons I might use it
for attacking the outliers that's
instantly not the only case there's also
a South Pacific nuclear weapons-free
zone which also isn't implemented
because the US insists on excluding the
pacific islands which are used for bases
where the u.s.
stores nuclear weapons nuclear
submarines and so on so that's not
implement come back to another important
nuclear weapons free zone in a moment
anyway the outlier is Iran now actually
there are three countries that have not
thought they were signed the
non-proliferation treaty in nuclear
States Israel India and Pakistan all
develop nuclear weapons with us support
and are still doing so Pakistan is one
of Ronald Reagan's gifts to the world
India its accelerated in the last couple
of years there's an under Bush it was a
US Indian treaty sign which is in direct
violation of all the international
conventions on non-proliferation it
permits India to develop nuclear weapons
in secret and it permits the US to help
them by providing them with nuclear
technology now the story is it's for
civilian use but everybody knows that
the boundary between civilian use and
military application is quite small and
furthermore even providing it for
civilian use permits India to divert its
technology and research to nuclear
weapons as in fact it's doing quite
openly so immediately after the Security
Council resolution i mentioned india
announced though it wasn't recorded here
that it can produce nuclear weapons with
the same yield as the superpowers the US
and Russia Obama quietly informed India
that the Security Council resolution
doesn't apply to them Pakistan responds
to India's so they're openly in fact
developing new nuclear weapons
facilities your aim enrichment and so on
those are the real threats of nuclear
weapons in the region the three
countries that refuse to sign the treaty
and that are backed by the US that when
they open
defy the Security Council the
International Atomic Energy Agency and
so on not the out the outlier may be a
problem but that's a US issue and so the
u.s. is not supported by the world on
this contrary to what you read so the
call for sanctions what you read is Iran
is defying the international community
the international community is a term
that has a rather technical meaning it
refers to Washington and whoever happens
to agree with it at the moment so the
international community excludes the
majority of states in the world the
non-aligned former non-aligned movement
which vigorously support your ends right
to develop the nuclear power to go as
permitted under the non-proliferation
treaty everyone agrees it excludes a
China and Russia it's excludes India
which as opposed to sanctions excludes
Brazil which is pointedly opposed to
sanctions at Turkey the one major Middle
East powers doesn't want sanctions in
fact even the Arab League which the US
is supposedly catering to they just had
a meeting and declared their opposition
to sanction school for diplomacy but
nevertheless the international community
steadfastly insists on higher sanctions
incidentally the American people aren't
part of the international community I
haven't seen a recent poll may opinion
may have changed after all the
propaganda the last couple of years but
in 2007 a considerable majority of
Americans agreed with the world outside
the international community that has
agreed that Iran has a right same rate
as everyone else to develop nuclear
energy well there are the outliers there
was a meeting in Tehran of 60 States a
couple of days ago it's very hard to
find out who was there because nothing's
covered but there was a meeting and they
came out with a
declaration calling for an end to any
nuclear weapons and they called for
establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone
in the Middle East that's an interesting
proposal in this case the US population
is overwhelmingly in support of it and
so it's just everyone in the world who's
polled at least very strong support for
a nuclear weapons-free zone that would
mitigate and maybe terminate whatever
the alleged threats are of Iran
developing a nuclear weapons capability
it is called for it in the tower on
meeting I don't think it was reported
here there are two countries that have a
particularly deep commitment to this
namely the United States and Britain the
reason is because when the US and
Britain invaded Iraq they tried to
provide a kind of a thin legal cover for
it and the way they did it was by
appealing to a Security Council
resolution resolution 687 in 1991 which
called on Iraq to dismantle its weapons
of mass destruction and the US and
Britain claimed they hadn't done it we
know that was false but that was the
claim and that justified their invasion
of Iraq well if you bother reading that
resolution you'll see that it commits
the signers to establishing a nuclear
weapons-free zone in the Middle East so
the US and Britain over and above all
others have a commitment to this and if
there was a real interest in
non-proliferation instead of just
rhetorical that's what would be pursued
well going back to Israel which is not
the only beneficiary of us criminality
India and Pakistan are too but in the
case of Israel they're immune from the
International Atomic Energy Agency
Security Council and in fact a long
record of us vito's of Security Council
resolutions that charge Israel with
another crime actually the USPTO's
resolution charging itself with crimes
too if we had a free education system in
the United States everyone would know
that the United States is the only
country that has rejected World Court
decision in the past it was one of three
Libya and Albania also hadn't accepted
them but they've since accepted them so
the u.s. is in splendid isolation that
was a World Court decision calling on
the United States to terminate its
terrorist war against Nicaragua of
course totally rejected that went to the
Security Council there were two
resolutions calling on the all states
didn't mention the u.s. calling on all
states to observe international law the
u.s. vetoed both of them France and
Britain politely abstained so there are
outliers in the world but Iran's got an
awful government nobody doubts that but
there are other outliers may be more
significant one certainly more
significant for us well it's going back
to Israel Palestine it's kind of strange
on the surface that the conflict
persists why does it why is it cold
unresolvable you know toughest problem
in the world I mean they're plenty of
problems in the world where it's hard
even to conjure up a solution to imagine
one in this case you can not only
conjure it up but everyone knows what it
is and furthermore the whole world
agrees to it outside of the United
States and Israel in fact it's even got
international law on its side supported
by the Arab League it's supported by the
organisation of Islamic states including
Iran supported by the relevant non-state
actors like from us the resolution is it
the basic contours are very well known
to state settlement on the international
border presume 67 border perhaps with
minor and mutual modifications
that was the official US term back in
the late 60s and early 70s before the
u.s. departed from the world on this
issue so settlement on the international
border was a ceasefire line so kind of
messy with minor and mutual
modifications and various conditions
about Jerusalem refugees and so on well
well that's a solution but much like the
nuclear free weapons free zone there's a
barrier and it's right here the u.s.
won't accept it and as long as the US
doesn't accept that Israel feels
entirely free to continue to violate it
now that's been going on since the
mid-70s in 1976 January 76 the major
Arab states brought a resolution to the
Security Council a calling for a
settlement roughly in these terms
recognizing the rights of every state in
the region including Israel to live in
peace and security within recognized
boundaries and all the standard
diplomatic terminology it was vetoed by
the United States again in 1980 record
and General Assembly is similar a veto
by the United States is in fact a double
veto maybe a triple veto first of all it
doesn't happen and secondly it's vetoed
from reporting and third is vetoes from
history so you have to look pretty for
hard to find find out much about this
that's what it means to have
overwhelming power those are some of the
prerogatives overwhelming power and a
very obedient intellectual class which
keeps things quiet you know doesn't make
sure that young minds aren't distorted
by knowing too much about the world the
but in fact in this entire record of 35
years of us rejection ism there's one
exception and a very illuminating one
it's in two thousand year 2000 it's not
the one people talk about
everyone talks about the Camp David
negotiations which failed but how
