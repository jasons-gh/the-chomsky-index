fora tv' the world is thinking campaign
funding is a remarkably good predictor
of election and also of policy in pretty
well predict policies by looking at
where the campaign funding comes from
there's good political science work on
this thomas ferguson very fine political
economist has done extremely good work
on this and it's convincing and in fact
we see it right in front of us all the
time so the rate of election of
incumbents is overwhelming it's like 98
99 percent this is happening at the same
time that public attitudes towards
approval of congress is in the low teens
but they are out spending their
opponents so ok they get elected you
know if people don't like him or just
take the last election 2008 and with a
core of obama's funding it was financial
institutions they preferred him to
mccain they thought he'd serve them
better and it's turning out it's
probably true
you can almost read off the policies of
the administration from looking at the
concentrated campaign funding financial
institutions are doing marvelously so
yes taking money out of politics would
be a good idea very good it's not gonna
solve all our problems that much deeper
than that
but it would be substantial it would be
hard because they're all kind of ways to
get around it but it's an important
topic and your tendencies are going in
the wrong direction right now the
supreme court is considering a suit
which what it amounts to is you know if
they if they approve if they change the
law she probably will it means that
corporations can buy elections directly
instead of indirectly so that they don't
put it that way but you think through it
that's what it amounts to so that's what
the supreme court is doing and there's
something kind of surreal going on
because at the very same time
at the logic of this for the Supreme
Court is that corporations are persons
they have personal rights so they
approve the right of free speech that
was in fact a gift to the corporate
world by the courts about a century ago
conservatives who used to exist the name
does not the category bitterly condemned
it they called it a form of communism a
return to feudalism and so on
but they got it and by now they have
rights way beyond persons so because
they have rights of persons they have
the right of free speech so therefore
they can buy elections directly at the
same time Congress is there's a
competition going on in Congress between
the Democrats and the Republicans to see
who can be more brutal in denying health
care to undocumented aliens and there's
a legal argument behind that too they're
not persons under the law the courts
have shaped American law so that if
you're an undocumented alien you're not
a person you don't have personal rights
so on the one hand the corporate
entities are have rights of persons and
have to be allowed to buy elections
directly on the other hand undocumented
aliens on whose backs a lot of the
economy rides they are not persons and
therefore we the Democrats and
Republicans have to show that we're more
savage than the Opposition in denying
them health care we shouldn't be
allowing this to happen before our eyes
I mean the facts are there but they're
not being discussed
there's no they're not being addressed
and that's another serious lack of
people who care about living in a
civilized community
