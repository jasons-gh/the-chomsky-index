noam chomsky is widely considered to be
the leading dissident intellectual in
this country his research and
information over the years have proved
irrefutable in all is writing since the
Vietnam War Chomsky has never once
retracted a single piece of information
yet you seldom had ever see him debating
the finest minds in Washington on any
major networks he's almost never invited
on National Public Radio or even on
public broadcasting PBS undaunted
Chomsky goes on turning out books faster
than any other political writer in this
country to have chomsky's most recent
information is like an empowerment booze
for those in the struggle for justice
well today on democracy now we want to
bring you one of Noam Chomsky's most
recent talks on the fairy tale of the
booming economy in this country the talk
is entitled whose world order
conflicting visions he gave it at Purdue
University just a few weeks ago I want
to say some things about the way the
world is the way we're taught the world
is and then about the way most people
experience the world here and even more
so in countries aren't as rich and full
of advantages as this one and then talk
about why how come it current things
turn out like this and towards the end
what are some of the plans that are now
being laid mostly in secrecy to enhance
a process which is quite injurious to
the large majority of the people of the
United States and even more so elsewhere
which is why they're kept secret and
well how is the world presented to us
you not to spend much time on this
because you hear it all day and every
day I'll just take one example from the
New York Times newspaper of record a
lead story in the Sunday Times last week
headline is by one of their leading
correspondence the headline reads
America is prosperous and smug Americans
goes on say Americans have boundless
confidence expectations of on
economic success they're living in the
happy glow of an American boom a fairy
tale u.s. expansion since 1991 under the
direction of the man who the
international financial press christens
the saintly alan greenspan's with
reverence well that's sort of that's way
things are supposed to be okay you can
ask yourself whether they are let's have
a look at the way they are beginning
with the happy glow of the American boom
and the fairytale expansion well it
certainly has been a fairy tale for some
sectors of the population mainly the
business world in fact the story that I
just quoted actually gives one example
of the fairytale economy namely the
stock market and it's true that asset
inflation is going through the roof and
concerning plenty of economist and
that's a real benefit to the one percent
of the population who own households who
owned half the stock roughly comparable
figures for other assets or that even
the top 10% who own about ninety percent
of them if you throw in pension funds
you get a little redistribution of
figures among the top fifth for the rest
of the population it's essentially
irrelevant it's also pretty much
irrelevant for the economy that's
another story but for them had certainly
been a fairy tale especially the top 1%
in fact it's been a fairy tale for the
business world altogether so year after
year you have reports of what they call
a dazzling stupendous profit growth
breaking all records the problems they
treat Business Week you find out that
the problems that the business world
faces are things like what to do with
all that cash as surging profits are
overflowing the coffers of Corporate
America with liquid assets of
non-financial institutions corporations
reaching a staggering at
surge of a trillion dollars which are
causing which is causing vexing problems
for Boeing and Intel and General
Electric and other suffering
corporations for them undoubtedly it's a
fairy Hill turning looking at the rest
of us the fairytale expansion since 1991
is in fact the weakest recovery of the
post-war period post-second World War
period it's even below the quite anemic
growth rates of the 1980s in the 1970s
and well below the historical average
since the Civil War like the worst one
on record that's the fairy tale a growth
rate if you look at per capita economic
growth and you rank the United States
among the OECD countries that Klingon
rich countries it's about average
actually slightly below average in per
capita economic growth in the 90s pick
up a little the last couple of quarters
but in general nominee slow unusually
slow growth but unusually slow growth of
productivity which is a predictor for
the future that's the fairytale economy
so how come we raise a question happy we
have a you know stupendous profit growth
when the fairytale expansion is the
weakest since World War two well it's
actually pretty simple answer to that
for approximately two-thirds of the
population hourly wages have either
stagnated or declined in the last 20
years working hours are going up wages
are going down the average wage is early
fifteen percent lower than it was in the
mid-70 entry-level wages first job they
collapsed during the 1980s they went
down by about thirty percent you read
and you know economists tell you well
this is only unskilled workers but then
small footnote the definition of
unskilled workers is about seventy-five
percent of the workforce
the in the late 1980s which was a period
of weak recovery better than this one
but still some kind of recovery during
the latter half of the 1980s hunger in
the United States went up by 50% reached
30 million people the go back to around
nineteen eighty the United States was
more or less average in a like other
industrial countries by measures like
say child poverty or malnutrition infant
mortality percentage of the population
in prison inequality other standard
quality of life measures F by the end of
the 1980s far in the lead and it's going
still farther in the lead by such
measures if lead is the right word the
during the 1980s industrial accident
accidents on the job doubled illegal
firing of union organizers tripled in
the 1980s along with a whole host of
other violations of labor laws the
Reagan administration in fact informed
the business world that it simply wasn't
going to inform enforce the laws they
could be on the books if you want but
they weren't going to enforce them an
advantage was taken to that again you
can read about it in Business Week which
described it quite accurately that's
continuing under Clinton that's a big
factor in the rising inequality in the
attack on wages on incomes and in fact
it's kind of recognized in the business
pages of the New York Times not be you
know the lead stories of the kind they
read where they describe what they call
a treadmill economy in which most people
are going nowhere fast with quite poor
prospects because of such factors is
unusually low productivity growth low
entry-level wages and so on well what
about the boundless confidence of the
smug cross
as Americans you can learn about that
from the new york times two is another
front page story with the title
rehabilitation of morning in America
morning in America was the slogan that
Reagan's speech writers gave him when
he's riding off into the sunset and
imitating John Wayne or something so now
there's a rehabilitation of morning in
America and the story goes on to explain
that things are really looking up you
know contrary to the doomsayers with all
their boring statistics about hungry
children and wage decline all that kind
of nonsense things are like the story
does concede that I'm quoting it now
things are looking up mostly for the
well-off and successful people like
Jerry Jason osky who's the head of the
National Association of Manufacturers
factor of suits quoted liberally right
through the story like the main person
quoted but then it says the story says
sunt just the will often successful even
the millions who are quoting even
million even the millions who are
suffering appeared to be helping
reestablish what mr. Jass Sinofsky
considers the right priorities as their
expectations have diminished so they're
pretty well off to of course the right
priorities for the business world are a
little different I mean there they are
surging profits overflowing the coffers
of Corporate America and causing vexing
problems and so on the story quotes the
head of the University of Michigan
research center which is the main center
that kind of monitors public opinion
regularly he says it's like people are
saying I'm not earning enough to get by
but it's not as bad as it could be well
before the Reagan Clinton economic
miracle people had old-fashioned ideas
about getting by so it's morning in
America Americans are prosperous and
smug with
boundless confidence and so on what is
all this about well it actually makes
perfect sense if you understand how to
read English you have to understand that
the word Americans doesn't refer to
Americans Americans refers to the
constituency of the New York Times the
people who they meet in elegant
restaurants and executive suites and
editorial offices and so on that's
Americans and their prosperous and smoke
and they have boundless expectations and
for them it's a fairytale economy and if
these there's other sort of two-legged
creatures out there they have to
establish the right priorities which are
well you know could be worse and you
know maybe I'm not getting by but don't
just don't have any expectations even as
things get worse and worse that's what's
called a healthy economy of fairy tale
economy and from a certain point of view
it is stay only the saintly Alan
Greenspan who presided over the fairy
tale economy in the 1990s he testified
about it that the Senate Banking
Committee about a year ago it was very
proud of his achievement and he
explained it he attributed the miracle
to what he called greater worker
insecurity meaning workers are
intimidated they're afraid to ask for a
living wage or for benefits and that's a
good thing that contributes to what's
called the health of the economy that's
a help of the economy as a term kinda
like Americans doesn't mean what the
word seemed to indicate it's a technical
term which refers to making sure the
Americans are smoked and prosperous
health of the economies that term is
uncorrelated with the health of the
economy even the you know literal health
of the population so that's these are
good things you know that's what we
should hope for so naturally we're proud
workers are nice and intimidated and so
on the economic report of the president
which comes out every year described it
pretty much the same things and sort of
more unit terms they also took pride the
Clinton administration took pride in the
fairy tale boom and they attributed it
to significant ways restraint which they
say results from changes in labor market
institutions and practices which are not
detailed but they include things like
for example not enforcing the laws on
about illegal strike strike breaking or
not enforcing osha regulation safety and
health regulations which counts for the
sharp rise in industrial accidents and
so on so they vets change in labor
market institutions and practices there
are other changes the United States one
of the major ones is the use of what are
called permanent replacement workers
which is a step worse than strike
breakers that's impermissible in any
industrial country in fact the United
States has been censured by the
International Labour Organization for
resorting to this practice you should
realize that the ILO very rarely
criticizes its main and funders so this
was quite unusual when the US was
censured and it was 1992 there were two
countries to industrial countries that
allow permanent replacement workers the
United States and South Africa I think
South Africa is now off the boat with
the unfortunate changes that have taken
place there in the last couple of years
so that means the United States probably
alone in this respect which wouldn't be
too surprising the United States also
has the worst record in your
from the Western Hemisphere and
ratifying ILO labor conventions
conventions on labor rights if you're
really a stickler you oughta catch me on
that it actually has the third worst
record lithuania you're listening to
professor Noam Chomsky of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
giving a recent speech at Purdue
University in Fort Wayne Indiana we'll
come back to him in just a minute here
on Pacifica Radio is democracy now as we
continue with the speech of professor
Noam Chomsky given just a few weeks ago
at Purdue University in fort wayne
indiana Noam Chomsky professor of
linguistics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology I took a look at
the category strike that the just end is
the big defeat for working people
caterpillar didn't resort to the
permanent replacement workers option but
also to other things caterpillar like
other major corporations other Americans
in the special sense of the press
caterpillar enjoyed dazzling profits it
was part of the huge profit woman it
used the profits not for economic growth
but for excess production for creation
of excess capacity abroad that doesn't
contribute the you know economic health
and the ordinary sense but it does
contribute to class warfare and it makes
good sense for that reason if you have
excess capacity abroad then it's working
people in Illinois strike you can fill
your you know of fill the orders for
your markets by using super exploited
cheap labor abroad that you've got
available thanks to the excess capacity
that you've created a result of the
dazzling profits so that's a good way of
attacking American workers and that
again contributes to the health of the
economy and the fairy tail boom and so
on the the fact the general effect is
that capital is extremely mobile now
wasn't always i'll come back to what is
so mobile but later obviously isn't
furthermore the links among working
people are extremely weak other than
major attacks on the unions even
in countries but the international links
are weak and to confront coordinated
concentrated tyrannical structures with
enormous resources is very difficult
particularly when they're backed by
powerful states and by secret huge
secret bureaucracies like the IMF which
are devoted their interests and so on
it's an unequal struggle and if unless
it is equalized and changed the future
please for democracy and human rights
doesn't look so great another change in
labour market institutions and practices
results from the trade agreements the
mislabeled free trade agreements so it
takes a NAFTA the NAFTA's is an investor
rights agreement it's not a free trade
agreement it has some wording about
labor rights and environmental rights
but they're basically toothless they
were put in to get people to shut up the
but they don't they're not completely
vacuous under NAFTA rules it's possible
for workers to bring complaints about
illegal labor practices and in fact some
vids of telecommunication workers
brought a complaint under NAFTA they
actually won but the corporation got a
tap on the wrist a couple of years later
didn't amount to anything but one side
effect of it was that it was a study
done under NAFTA rules about the role of
NAFTA in strikebreaking in the United
States it was done by a labor historian
at Cornell University Kate
bronfenbrenner published under NAFTA
suppressed by the Clinton administration
but released by Canada and Mexico I her
conclusion is that half I think the
Clinton administration finally released
it after a delay not that you'd know
anything about it by reading oppressed
according to her study about half of a
half of organizing efforts since NAFTA
have been disrupted by threats
transfer that it means things like
putting up a you know putting a trailer
outside a plant where people are trying
to organize with a sign that says you
know Mexican transfer job or something
like that and these threats are not idle
when organizing efforts nevertheless
succeed there have been closures at
triple the rate the pre NAFTA rate so
meaningful threats of course they're all
illegals all such efforts and strike
breaking or illegal but remember that's
a technicality since the Reagan
administration and now the Clinton
administration have essentially a form
informed the business world that you
don't to worry about laws because we're
not going to enforce it crime pays in
other words with state protection well
that's a sample of some of the benign
changes in labor market institutions and
practices that leads to significant wage
restraint and gives us a fairy tale
economy for Americans who are smug and
prosperous I have to do is translate the
words a little and you go from
propaganda the reality quite easily the
saintly Allen has also also gives public
thoughts he gave one recently to the
newspaper editors meeting in the United
States interesting talk worth reading
it's full of passionate rhetoric about
the miracles of the market the wonders
that are brought about by consumer
choice and all these magnificent things
and even gave examples which is nice his
examples are the internet computers
information processing satellites and
transistors products those are kind of
interesting examples of the miracles of
the market and consumer choice because
as any even the most ignorant economist
knows those are textbook examples of
creativity and production in the state
sector in the public sector picked up
later by the business world
to them as gifts after the works been
done so takes a the internet which not
stellar example and that was developed
for 30 years within the Pentagon and
then the National Science Foundation and
just the cup a year ago was handed over
to private corporations so now you know
Bill Gates is real interested in the
internet for the 30 years that was being
developed a private business had no
interest Kate's wouldn't even go to a
conference on the Internet there were
three years ago I have to say he is
honest about it he has attributed his
success to his ability to putting him to
embrace and expand the ideas of others
most of which come from your pocketbook
incidentally the internet is a is almost
a classic example I hate computers the
core of modern industrial society same
story in the 1950s they were
unmarketable so the public paid for
their for the research and development
under the cover of an air defense system
and other such things when they when
they advanced to the point where you
could sell them they were handed over to
private corporations some of them
spin-offs from the military project
that's why IBM isn't making typewriters
anymore and so on for a whole bunch of
others the but the public contribution
remain and in the 1980s particularly it
went up with new you know new
developments in advanced computer
technology and so on that's computers
it's the same story with information
processing satellites too obvious to
comment the one example that he
mentioned that where you could claim
that there's a private sector
contribution in the crucial research and
development stages transistors so that
one is worth looking at the others
aren't even a joke and this one is at
least the joke which is what it
transistors were invented and in a
private laboratory a bell labs in 1947
but what was the role of the market and
consumer choice in that well the answer
is zero because Bell Labs was the
laboratory of AT&T which was a
government-supported monopoly so there's
no consumer choice and no market the
since it was a monopoly it was able to
charge monopoly prices which is in
effect a tax on the public and taxing
the public through taxing the public it
was able to establish a very good
laboratory Bell Labs with a fine lab
where they invented transistors and
solar cells and the information theory
and radio astronomy all kinds of work it
was a great flat I used to go there in
the 50s as soon as the monopoly was
broken Bell Labs went down the two
because the public wasn't paying for it
anymore so no more l-last but it's true
that in 1947 a government-supported
monopoly was able to use indirect
taxation to develop transistors however
that's not the end of the story
transistors were the development of
transistors was based on wartime
technology technology developed during a
war again at public expense furthermore
when transistors were developed there
was not much to do with them so the
government stepped in meaning you
stepped in or your parents or whatever
and paid for transistor research and
development the procurement the
government procurement was the total use
of transistors in the early crucial
years when the research and designs and
so on production techniques and so on
were developed in fact ten years after
they were invented the Western Electric
Company which is bells supply AT&T
supplier they were producing I think a
couple hundred thousand transistors and
a hundred percent of them were for the
government market so that's the one
example which maybe rises to the level
of a joke of the miracles of the market
and consumer choice these are the
saintly alan's examples I didn't pick
them but in fact again as even the most
ignorant economists must know certainly
the business world knows just about
every dynamic sector of the US economy
works that way whether it's electronics
or pharmaceuticals or biotechnology or
whatever there's an enormous public
component for the research and
development stage and for absorption of
risk the story is that the way you know
the miracles of the market are supposed
to work the cost and risk are socialized
there the public's responsibility
private there is a private component
namely profit and power or private eyes
that's really existing markets and it's
not just the United States it's every
industrial society and it's not move it
goes back to the origins of the
Industrial Revolution so what you might
call really existing market theory and
these examples are good ones well of
course the business world thinks this is
a terrific arrangement why shouldn't
they I when you look at particular cases
you get a clearer sense of the way it
works so take say the leaders of the
conservative revolution in Congress the
leader in the house is Newt Gingrich
who's full of eloquent but rhetoric
about the work ethic and making sure
people get off the cycle of dependency
and you know seven year old children
have to know that nobody's going to give
you a gift in that kind of business he
also year after year keeps the record
for bringing federal subsidies to his
rich constituents in Cobb County Georgia
suburb of Atlanta heavily region where
the state role in the economy government
role mean public role is unusually
extensive
but he's champion again to be precise
he's third arlington virginia which is
part of Washington gets more federal
subsidies that's where the Pentagon is
in places like that and brevard county
florida which is the home of the kennedy
space center that gets more public
subsidies but apart from them gingrich
year after year is the record for
suburban districts the main employer in
his district is that noted the exponent
the free markets lockheed martin i
publicly subsidized corporation in fact
every american household the average
household pays about it now about a
200-year two hundred dollar a year
lockheed martin tax to make sure that
the rich folk found their don't break
the cycle of dependency even with the
public of public support lockheed
practically it was going to went broke
in the early 70s so it was rescued by a
250 million dollar bailout by the Nixon
administration it was that action that
led senator proxmire to coin the phrase
corporate welfare well okay that's the
leader of the conservative revolution in
the house how about a leader in the
Senate Trent Lott Senate Republican
leader I'll just quote the state and in
quite proper financial times the leading
financial Journal in the world from
London I had a headline reading most
successful pork producer of 1997 then
goes on to the story about Trent Lott it
continues like this if he takes a the
CEO of city Corp Walter Wriston man who
more or less invented you know huge
loans to the third world which led to
the third world debt crisis and so on
he's a great exponent of the free market
and less a fair and very proud of the
fact that markets can now set social
policy there's so
powerful say not to worry about
democratic states anymore on the other
hand when the whole thing went bust in
1982 he was quite happy to be bailed out
by the public when the third world
that's were socialized and the
commercial banks were essentially paid
off in various indirect ways by by
taxpayers and of course by the victims
who paid for it so the less a fair
doctrine disappeared is a little more to
that story Kristen's entrepreneurial
techniques included the tech a large
part of the bank's profits were based on
fraudulent schemes worked out in Brazil
which were declared illegal by the
Internal Revenue Service but that was no
big problem the IRS was overruled but
with him Simon another great believer in
the free market he was then secretary of
the Treasury and he shortly after
resigned and joined the board of
directors of sacred well that's the way
the real world works but the that's on
the other hand there's the picture world
that your thought about the as I say
there's nothing really new about this
but there are changes a big it goes way
back in the beginning of American
history and England before it but there
was though there have been changes there
was a major change around the Second
World War depression in the Second World
War the depression of the 1930s made it
very clear to anyone who had any
lingering illusions about the matter
that there's no conceivable possibility
for free market capitalism to work I
mean nobody really believed it much
anyway but that put an end to it the new
neo measures took some of the edge off
the depression but not very much I mean
they make people feel better and that
sort of thing but though the effects
were about the same it was not much
difference in 1939 1929 what these are
the Depression was the war the war
created a command economy or a semi
command economy market principles were
put to the side corporate executives
flocked the Washington and
organised a state controlled economy
which was extremely successful American
industrial production triple pressure
depression over resources were allocated
wages and prices mainly wages were
controlled and there was an extremely
effective any taught lessons in
particular had taught lessons to the
guys who ran the economy they didn't
have to read about canes and textbooks
they had just seen it here was a
organized state controlled economy which
had planned private profits of whelming
Corporation for example took off you
know doing its patriotic duty by making
huge profits and after barely survived
before but and that the lesson was very
clear and it was understood it was
assumed honest universally by
businessmen by economists and others
that the country is going to sink right
back into recession after the war unless
the government stepped in and if you
read go back and read the business press
in those days you know fortune
Businessweek and so on now they're
pretty frank about it so fortune
explained that high-tech industry I'm
quoting cannot they're talking about
aeronautical industry but then they
generalize to all high-tech industry
cannot survive in a competitive
unsubsidized free enterprise economy
