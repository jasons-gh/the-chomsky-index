I said a lot about the role of the media
in a so-called down democracy I'm
wondering how you see the role of our
educational system what it's doing right
now what forces are driving it and what
constraints are on it and how should it
operate
well I quoted the trilateral commission
view of the educational system namely
it's a system of indoctrination of the
young and I think that's correct
it's a system of indoctrination of the
young that was the way the liberal
elites regarded and they're more or less
accurate so the educational system is
supposed to train people to be obedient
conformist not think too much do which
told stay passive don't cause any crises
a democracy you don't raise any
questions and so on that's basically
what the what the system is about even
the fact that the system has a lot of
stupidity in it I think has a function
you know it means that people are
filtered out for obedience if you can
guarantee lots of stupidity in the
educational system you know like stupid
assignments and things like that you
know that the only people who make it
through are people like me and like most
of you I guess who are willing to do it
no matter how stupid it is because we'll
we want to go to the next step you know
so you may know that this assignment is
idiotic and the guy up there couldn't
think his way out of a paper bag but
you'll do it anyway because that's the
way you get to the next class and you
want to make it and so on and so forth
well there are people who don't do that
you know there are people who say I'm
not going to do it it's too ridiculous
you know those people are called
behavioral problems or something like
that they end up in the principal's
office or in the streets or selling
drugs or whatever and all of this is a
technique for selection for obedience
and I have I don't have to prove this
but I have a feeling that when you go to
the elite universities you find more
obedience and conformity probably
because you're getting the students who
were better able to do it well all of
that is functional that's the way it
works but it and it works right through
graduate school I mean if you Derek but
how do you get the graduate school it's
already a little more
because some real contradictions develop
in the system the problem is that you
can't have progress this way you know
now especially in the sciences and
engineering that's a problem because the
corporation's need science and
engineering no if you don't have
innovation you're really in trouble so
they have to encourage creativity and
independence because you can't get
anywhere if you just copy what somebody
told you you have to be challenging
things all the time
challenging everything you know thinking
new slots and so on and there you got a
real contradiction it's hard to train
people to be creative and challenging
and so on and yet to ensure that
somewhere else in their lives they're
conformist and obedient and everything
so you have problems that's a serious
problem in Japan incidentally we think
of Japan is this tremendous superpower
but that's very misleading Japan for
example is very poor in science for
example and they're aware of it and part
of the reason is it such as part of that
it's part of the same thing that makes
them good workers obedient workers it's
a very obedient society very
differential and conformist Society and
one effect of that is that you you know
there are real constraints against
independent frees and thinking and you
see it in the sciences very clearly the
but it's a problem here too so there are
those contradictions when you get to
graduate school they're beginning to
show up they show up much less in the
ideological subject because there it
doesn't matter so much if people have
you know there isn't the profits aren't
made by historians having original ideas
about the French Revolution so they can
have conventional ideas and that means
that the the pressure to try to support
innovation and freedom is much less and
the professor the pressures for
conformity on the other hand are much
greater because in the ideological
subjects it begins to be dangerous if
people think the wrong thoughts it's not
so dangerous if they have no ideas about
physics so it's saying but nevertheless
you know you there's you begin to get a
little flux in the system by the time
you get to graduate school and even at
lower levels you find it I mean there's
you know there are teachers who do
stimulate thought and sometimes they get
away with it and
all the way through you know if people
are learning things you just you just
can't control you can't make them just
regurgitate what they heard now there's
a lot of pressure to turn the schools
into the Marine Corps and there's a lot
of support for it
for example there's this bestseller last
couple of years by Alan bloom that was
all over the supermarkets
closing of the American mind yeah
whichever you know huge bestseller or
supermarket racks which is where I read
it mm-hmm things like that well you take
a look at what he's saying and those
plenty you know a lot of enthusiastic
accolades word and so on he was saying
that a couple of smart guys will decide
what the great thoughts are and every
student will memorize them and that's
education okay well you know I mean
that's a way to turn people into pure
automata I mean even if they happen to
pick the great thoughts there is no way
less likely to get anybody to think
about those thoughts than to make that
the curriculum that finishes them off no
but and I think that's the purpose
really I mean the purpose is just to
impose Authority you know here's the
great thoughts all this other stuff is
rubbish just learn those new okay I'll
pick them you memorize them that's
basically the line now of course that's
that's the opposite of Education and
that's the way you study Talmud or
something like that but it's very
popular and I think it reflects the same
concern over the crisis of democracy
thank Ellen was it Blum himself was
extremely the incident that really got
to him was a case in Cornell where he
was a professor where some black
students took over one of the administer
one of the buildings and he was he said
that's just like the Nazi you know in
fact of the Nazis his whole business
about the Nazis and so on and so forth
well you take a look at what happened
and that kiddin tell you what he thought
they and he says the faculty capitulated
you know just like Heidegger capitulated
to the nine cities and so on what
actually happened if you look back is
that there were real grievances
undoubtedly their students shouldn't
have done what they
go into the building with guns and so on
but it was settled very amicably it was
settled amicably nobody was killed the
grievances were to some extent dealt
with and the net result was better than
it was before
well he doesn't tell you what he thought
they should have done but it's sort of
implicit I mean I guess they should have
bombed the place or something like that
but that's what really set him off and
in general what set many people off was
the you know the the 60s are now
described in the literature as if it was
a time when students were running around
burning libraries and you know
destroying the foundations of
civilization and so on what was actually
going on is they were asking questions
you know they were raising questions
they were looking into things that
people hadn't looked into before they
were not just obedient and from a point
of view of a lot of the faculty that's
equivalent to burning the buildings they
can't even make that small distinction
you can't make that and this pressure
that turned the schools back to the days
when you didn't have to worry about
those things like disobedient students
asking questions about things that you
didn't tell them to think about it
