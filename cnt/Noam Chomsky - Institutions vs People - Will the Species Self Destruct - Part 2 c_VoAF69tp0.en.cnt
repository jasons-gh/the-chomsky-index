treated properly when it landed there
well without going on there's a pretty
well-established generalization the
greater the US military involvement in
control the greater the poverty and
misery pretty close correlation a few
things in history work out this clearly
and the poverty and misery is quite
severe Haiti and Nicaragua may be
literally uninhabitable in another
generation or two el salvador which is
another leading target of us terror
specially in the 80s that's not very far
behind well these things they take a
considerable effort to ignore I think
and particularly because they generalize
so in Asia there's one country that's a
basket case with an accept state out of
the wasn't part of the Asian economic
miracle of the last 20 or 30 years
namely the Philippines which was
conquered by the United States a hundred
years ago killing several hundred
thousand people stayed at us colony for
half a century and a neo colony of sins
again continues to the present this is
there other correlations that are again
kind of tricky to ignore takes a little
effort I suppose one of them is that
there's a very well-established
correlation which you know could read in
the mainstream scholarly literature in
fact between US aid including US
military aid and the torture and state
terror they correlate very closely
actually these studies were done in 1980
nobody bothered to do them during the
1980s because the results were too
obvious you don't do experiments to show
that two plus two equals four it
continues through the 90s very
dramatically in fact the leading human
rights violator in the hemisphere
through the 90s by a considerable margin
is Colombia it's also been the leading
recipie
the US military aid in training right
through the 1990s fact about half the
military aid and training in the
hemisphere so the correlation continues
in 1999 Columbia actually took first
place in the world as the leading
recipient of US military aid and
training notice I'm omitting here Israel
and Egypt which are in a separate
category but outside of them columbia
the first place it replaced turkey which
had previously been the leader for some
years except for a brief period when el
salvador took first place during the
period of the most intense state
terrorist attack basically US attack
against the population but turkey had
for a while been the leading recipient
of US military aid replaced by Columbia
in 1999 well why turkey turkey is a
strategic allies next to Russia next to
the Middle East so it had always gotten
substantial military aid it was kind of
level into the early 80s in 1984 the
military aid shot up notice that it
absolutely nothing to do with the Cold
War transparently what it had to do with
is the fact that in nineteen eighty four
turkey launched a counterinsurgency
campaign against its miserably oppressed
Kurdish population and that required
military aid and the United States was
happy to provide it in the interest of
the human rights and freedom and justice
and it stayed the aid stayed very high
as a turkey was first place though
replaced for a wild El Salvador stayed
very high until 1999 the main atrocities
were in the Clinton years and that's
when the aid went up as well as the
atrocities escalated so did the military
aid Clinton administration was providing
eighty percent of turkeys arms the peak
year was nineteen ninety seven
in fact in the single year 1997 the
United States provided more military aid
to Turkey than in the entire period 1952
1983 the entire Cold War period was
outweighed in a single year of 1997 the
end the results were impressive 2 to 3
million refugees 3,500 or so villages
and towns wiped out tens of thousands of
people killed I think nobody really
knows the detail since it's our crime
nobody investigates and it's rarely
reported very rarely in fact usually
denied the fact however is that this is
one of the most extreme examples of
atrocities and ethnic cleansing in the
1990s right through to the late 1990s
recall that this is within NATO it's not
across its borders where we're supposed
to be very upset about crimes the by 19
and 99 the Clinton backed atrocities and
ethnic cleansing had succeeded the
Kurdish insurance he had been crushed
the Colombian insurgency however had not
yet been crushed correspondingly and if
you're rational perhaps they're for
Colombia replaced turkey as the leading
recipient of the US military aid in
training well these again are things
you're just not supposed to notice
because they conform to well to the
moral truism they tell you too much
about our institutions and how they
fiction and about the intellectual
culture that protects and supports them
our culture which we take part in
contribute to and sustain it's not
something out there somewhere the same
issue of the New York Times on Sunday
also has a book review by a
liberal historian about several new
books about Vietnam that's appropriate
we are now approaching the 40th
anniversary of the US attack against
South Vietnam remember that South
Vietnam was always the major target of
the US attack of course the US said it
was there to defend the government of
South Vietnam from terrorists from
abroad essentially what the Russian said
about their invasion of Afghanistan and
with maybe about half as much legitimacy
but we're supposed to believe it so
therefore that's the line anyhow we're
coming up to 40 years 19 61 and 62 is
when Kennedy launched the direct attack
against South Vietnam that's after about
six years of us running a Latin American
tile terror state they're in which about
sixty seventy thousand people were
killed eliciting resistance which
couldn't be controlled to the US invaded
directly the results I don't have to go
through you should know them it's maybe
worth mentioning that in a poll a couple
of years the only poll I know of where
Americans were asked to estimate the
number of cat of Vietnamese dead in the
war the average guess was about a
hundred thousand if there was Poland
Germany which revealed that Germans
estimated the number of Holocaust
victims at 200,000 we might think
there's a little bit of a problem and
German culture that should perhaps be
looked at but since this is our
massacres and atrocities the question
doesn't arise and it doesn't arise in
the review or in the books the review
and the books never suggest that there's
anything wrong about anything we did the
only problem is was it a failure why was
it a failure you know who's responsible
and so on the kind of questions that the
German General Staff would have been
raising after Stalingrad I suppose
that's pretty typical just to mention
another current case the there was a
couple of weeks ago a meeting in Havana
which probably read about the paper was
a meeting of Kennedy advisors and they
have pigs veterans meeting with Cubans
to go over what happened at the Bay of
Pigs invasion the reports were quite
interesting they also never hinted that
there might be something wrong with
invading another country so it was a
question of why it failed that sort of
thing the I friend of mine is a Latin
American veteran Latin American
correspondent who actually recorded the
innovation from Cuba back at then he
attended and he asked him he told me
that at the discussions that question
was never raised just not an issue you
know raise that kind of question just
recently the State Department released
about a thousand pages of documents on
the Missile Crisis 1962 a good part of
the documents deal with the terror
operations that Kennedy organized
Kennedy was a super hawk and deeply
committed to massive terror the Cuba was
one of the victims Colombia was another
incidentally the and most a lot of those
deals with the terror wasn't jokes
either it was serious stuff killings
blowing up installations very blowing up
hotels all sorts of things there was a
review of the of all of this in the
diplomatic history which is the main
serious professional journal good
several reviews several scholars reviews
of the thousand pages one of them Jorge
Dominguez at Harvard pointed out in his
review went through the material but he
pointed out an interesting fact the fact
that he felt that was interesting namely
in a thousand pages of documents on
operation Mongoose and other terrorist
operations he was only able to find one
phrase in a thousand pages that suggests
of these
internal discussions and plantings the
one phrase that suggested that there may
be some problem with this it was a
staffer for the National Security
Council who raised the wanted to raise
the possibility that if any of these
atrocities became public it might harm
the US image in Europe and therefore
didn't care much about Latin America but
might harm it in Europe and therefore
maybe we should have some second
thoughts or at least keep them more
quiet remember who these people were
these were the intellectual elite from
Harvard MIT and places like that and
it's a interesting reflection on the
moral and cultural institutions that's
just from current things very easy to
find more if you go back let's go back
to the new york times review the think
piece on how others should face crimes
it opens with the trial of malaysia
bitch right now in fact that's the main
theme the main theme is served crimes
the writer points out correctly that the
war crimes trial the international war
crimes trial is only for malaysia
bitches crimes in kosovo hidden asked
why that limit was imposed interesting
question but let's put it aside actually
it's not quite accurate inu it's not for
malaysia bitches crimes in kosovo it's
for his crimes after march 24 1999 if
you read the indictment you find that
virtually every crime mentioned is at
that's the day when the u.s. NATO
bombing began virtually everything
mentioned is some crime that took place
after the bombing there are reasons for
that time frame as well carefully evaded
in the huge literature that's come out
about this topic come back to it if you
like but I'll skip it now anyway it's
fact virtually nothing in the indictment
few things but very little before the
bombing so the war crimes trials are in
fact for crimes within a very specific
time frame mainly the crime and they're
real crimes no doubt about that the
crimes committed under NATO bombing the
crimes that were incidentally
anticipated and not very surprising
doesn't change the fact that their
crimes well without proceeding with that
I'll mention that there's another trial
going on right now it's not in Belgrade
or in The Hague but in Washington this
is the trial of general Johnny lumen
tongue he's in Indonesian general who
was implicated in planning and executing
massive crimes in east timor in 1999 far
beyond anything attributed to the lush
of which i should say furthermore not
only are these much worse than character
they also had to be war crimes not just
crimes against humanity that his crimes
in the course of aggression of serious
kind furthermore these crimes were not
carried out under bombing by a
superpower in fact not even under any
fighting there's nothing going on just
plain massive attacks on the civilian
population there was a superpower
involved actually to the United States
and Britain they'd been involved for a
long time the 25 years in fact they were
involved they involved in arming and
training the killers that continued
right through 1999 in earlier years
their involvement actually it was Jen's
Idol one of the places where that
overused word really applies relative to
the population the deaths killings were
probably greater than anything since the
Holocaust and that continued through
1999 the US British client destroyed
about seventy percent of the country
drove out eighty-five percent of the
population killed nobody knows how many
people and nobody ever will know for a
very good reason the United States
prevented the
dispatch of any forensic experts quite
different from Kosovo where the place
was flooded by forensic experts to try
to dig out crimes of the official enemy
but here they were withheld despite
pleas from the UN Australia furthermore
the US has blocked any tribunal so
they'll never be an investigation but
there is a trial going on lumen tongues
trial Lilith on with served court papers
in Washington on March 27 he was in
Washington at the invitation of the
State Department he's one of their
favorites the State Department was pre
upset by the fact that it was handed a
subpoena and us apologized profusely to
the government of Indonesia for this
indignity he was quickly spirited out of
the country but the trials proceeding in
absentia and in silence there hasn't
been a word about it good reasons unlike
Milosevic under NATO bombing lumen
tongue is a u.s. run criminal
responsible for much worst crimes so
therefore his trial right in Washington
and I'm not very easy to ignore has to
be ignored and by the usual principles
well of course could be argued that
lumen tongue is not the top commander
which is correct it's greatly implicated
he was not to talk command the top
commander was generally ronto he was
granted an amnesty in advance just in
case they're ever might be a tribunal
not but there's much threat of that the
top leaders are of course exempt and the
decisive role of the United States and
Britain that's also exempt and it is
decisive back through the for
infertility Carter years in fact the
role of the United States is virtually
entirely suppressed in the United States
with pretty has been all along still is
in Britain not so completely written as
was a less disciplined society than us
not just in this respect well even worse
than that the current story that's now
around and that will enter his history
of course is that the us-led the
humanitarian intervention in East Timor
because it was so appalled by the crimes
which in fact it was carrying out and
this was after it had unfortunately
overlooked the crimes of the past 25
years for which over which it was
presiding and for which it provided the
crucial military and diplomatic support
without a third of the population wiped
out all thanks to the complicity of the
media and the intellectual culture
generally folks like us people who are
always very agitated about the other
guys crimes well these are near
historical universal it's all too easy
to continue this shameful story just
keeping to the sunday New York Times
which incidentally I haven't exhausted
i've just sampled i could go on for
another hour on that but i won't it's
the the and i should say that the US and
Britain are by no means unusual and said
before the Spree standard the main
difference between the United States and
Britain and other societies is that the
United States and Britain have never
been defeated and furthermore they have
been dominant societies and for those
reasons alone they have nothing to
regret it follows that if you're not
defeated and you're in a dominant
position you didn't do anything wrong
it's kind of like a principle of logic
therefore you have nothing to regret and
in fact you can bask in self adulation
for your courageous leadership in the
cause of human rights and freedom and so
on and it's essentially the task of the
intellectual community to make
sure that this all works very smoothly
and it does there's rarely a hitch well
I should say in for accuracy that
they're sometimes as a hitch so the
charge is not totally accurate the Arab
country the United States as you know
was founded on a and developed in fact
on the basis of terrible crimes slavery
and the most extreme ethnic cleansing in
history I suppose and there have been
occasional statements of regret never
any official statements one of the rare
examples and they are very rare in high
places is John Quincy Adams he was a
major contributor to massive crimes and
long after his involvement in that long
after he was out of office Adams
deplored I'm quoting the heinous sins
for which I believe God will one day
bring this nation to judgment he hoped
that this belated stand would somehow
aid that hapless race of Native
Americans that we are exterminating with
such merciless and perfidious cruelty he
hoped in vain of course the attack
escalated very quickly and continued
until the disposition dispossession and
the extermination were almost complete
leaving us miraculously guiltless in the
eyes of the history that we construct
actually how guiltless Lee are you can
test from your own recent experience
you're all beneficiaries of a good
education I'm sure like most people you
were focusing paying a lot of tension
last November two stories coming from a
county in Florida the dateline was
Seminole County Florida that was the
scene of various electoral shenanigans
you can now carry out an experiment you
can ask yourselves how you would have
reacted if there was an election in
Germany now and
everyone was focusing their eyes on
electoral shenanigans and say kike
county with area if you can imagine that
you're looking in the mirror you might
if you don't know why you want to find
out what the that's back to John Quincy
Adams in fact well this let's go back to
thee all of these are just among the
four requisites of power powerful you're
allowed to do these things these are
illustrations of the truisms that I
mentioned well let's look at the
question a little bit more generally
back off a little actually question has
been addressed at a very question of
whether this will lead to
self-destruction I'm now giving an
interpretation of an article that didn't
interpret what he said the way i do but
i think it applies the general question
was addressed by the grand old man of
american biology Ernst Meier of Harvard
he wrote an article a couple years ago
on the adaptive value of higher
intelligence and he was pretty skeptical
about it his reasons were that he said
we've had about 50 billion species since
the origin of life only one of which
achieved the intelligence needed to
establish a civilization that did so
very recently in a very small breeding
group from which we're all descended
probably were lots of other close
relatives but they're gone probably
exterminated along with big mammals the
am that's what's left and that's the one
exception he concludes Meyer that this
kind of evolutionary accident is not
favored by selection the history of life
on Earth as refutes the claim that it's
better to be smart than stupid the
successful organisms are stupid they are
very narrow ecological niches beetles
bacteria maxi phage which are in mass as
was the most successful capacity for
rapid mutation helps Meyer adds the
rather somber observation that the
average life expectancy of the species
on earth is about a hundred thousand
years it's just about the lifespan of
the one species that most radically
broke the pattern and now faces the
question of whether it's better to be
smart than stupid that's the question
I'm asking well the species is certainly
smart enough to have developed the
capacity to destroy itself no doubt
about that and it's also demonstrated
that capacity quite consistently
throughout history quite dramatically so
in the past several hundred years with
the salt and assault on the environment
that sustains life on the diversity of
more complex organisms and on each other
as well just the last century there are
about a hundred million deaths which are
directly attributable to war the last
decade contrary to what's often said
brought nothing new the consequences of
the collapse of the British and the
French and the Portuguese empires were
far more destructive than what followed
the collapse of the East European tira
knees and in fact those still remained
very prominently on the front pages
today decades later that's contrary to
what's commonly claimed but that takes
us back to the truisms I mentioned
earlier the many of the conflicts of the
past decade can be attributed to an
enemy empire that collapsed leaving a
terrible legacy namely the Soviet Union
so therefore those atrocities are real
as distinct from the legacy of our
friends and allies which is incomparably
worse but not real by virtue of the
historical
wisdom that I of immunity of power and
privilege from inspection well even
though the 90s were not unusual and in
fact less destructive than the collapse
of earlier empires Western empires and
even though the number of interstate
conflicts has declined quite sharply
through the 90s nevertheless it wasn't a
pretty decade by 1998 interest internal
to state interstate conflicts had left
about five million dead ten million
refugees 5 million people internally
displaced forty percent of those are in
Columbia where the regular increase
300,000 a year of the past decade is
expected to accelerate pretty sharply as
Washington's war moves into full years
Clinton's plan colombia that's in
addition to over a million who just fled
the country well more ominously still
the kind of intelligence needed to
establish a civilization to which Ernst
Meier referred it has constructed
particular kinds of dominant
civilizations and they are based on
institutional structures that do
increase the likelihood of dreadful
outcomes the most obvious example is
just the international system which 10
is designed in such a way structured in
such a way that it tends to enhance and
apparently inexorable drive to adapt
modern technology to the most
destructive ends nuclear weapons are the
most threatening example and endeavour
instead of looking at ourselves we might
attend to our own the situation right
here the primacy assigned to nuclear
weapons in the highest level strategic
planning of the Clinton years there's a
reason
from documents of the Strategic Command
highest level Planning Group they say
unlike chemical or biological weapons
the extreme destruction from a nuclear
explosion is immediate with few or any
palliatives to reduce its effect so
therefore the planners recommend that
nuclear weapons be visibly available
because although we are not likely to
use nuclear weapons in less than matters
of the greatest national importance
reassuring I suppose nevertheless they
cast a shadow over every crisis or
conflict furthermore it's beneficial for
our strategic posture if some elements
of government may appear to be
potentially out of control that the
United States may become irrational and
vindictive if it's vital interests are
attacked should be a part of the
national persona we project that's
what's called credibility in public
discourse and it's projected the world
is very frightened including Europe the
US must therefore reject the basic
principle of the non-proliferation
treaty namely that nuclear powers make a
good faith effort to eliminate nuclear
weapons and the US must retain them as
the basis for our strategic posture that
includes the right of first use of
nuclear weapons against non-nuclear
powers which have signed the
non-proliferation treaty it's all very
explicit in any country that valued its
freedom this would be all over the front
pages and would have been four years
since been Declassified the basic
conclusions have been approved in
presidential directives Clinton
directives they authorize first use and
they maintain nuclear weapons in launch
on warning posture that perpetuates a
high alert regime of the past years with
the ever present danger to survival
there are new programs that are being
initiated to implement these decisions
there is a change in the post-cold war
period so the Pentagon so on internal
documents right after the Cold War ended
recomm
and implemented a change from targeting
what it primarily would had called the
weapons rich environment of the Soviet
Union to the target rich environment of
the rest of the world the third world
which is actually been the main target
of US military action right throughout
the Cold War and is remaining so apart
from some modification of pretexts with
the Cold War require its major change
since the end of the Cold War is change
of pretexts and elimination of a
deterrent to us violence has even made
pretty explicit well more evidence that
it's may not be better to be smart than
stupid is the national missile defense
program there's a standard criticism of
this namely that it would be useless
since there are easy modes of delivery
that don't require missiles Graham
Allison is leading strategic analyst
over the Harvard Kennedy School pointed
out that if terrorists wanted to smuggle
a nuclear warhead into New York City all
they have to do is wrap it in a bale of
marijuana
another another common argument is that
they won't work that's the standard
criticism it's not our work a much more
dangerous possibility is that it might
work or that it might even appear to be
working remember that in issues of
survival like nuclear strategy
appearance has got to be an identical
interpreted as reality can't take any
chances so if there's any possibility
that it might work it's extremely
dangerous as long as it's not going to
work it's just a waste in Phoenix is the
way to fund high-tech industry if it
looks as if it might work however then
that's really dangerous and US
intelligence estimates have been pretty
clear about this they've predicted that
the deployment of the national missile
defense that looks feasible is come
quoting I was going to impel China to
develop new nuclear armed missiles
expanding its nuclear arsenal x factor
of 10 prompting india and pakistan to
respond with their own build ups with a
likely ripple effect to the Middle East
these same analyses and plenty of others
point out that the Russians only
rational response would be to maintain
and strengthen the existing Russian
nuclear force us negotiators clinton-era
negotiators in fact encouraged Russia to
adopt a launch on warning strategy
themselves the idea was to alleviate
Russian concerns and to induce them to
accept the national missile defense and
the revision of the ABM treaty that's a
proposal that's pretty bizarre one
expert commented because we know their
warning system is full of holes so it
simply maximizes the threat to us and
everyone else there was a UN conference
on the non-proliferation treaty last May
was very broad in fact universal
condemnation of the national missile
defense on grounds that it would
undermine decades of arms control
agreements provoke a new weapons race
but both political parties in the United
States are committed to it though at
different rates very few including
allies
pay much attention to the tales about
rogue states Canadian military planners
for example advise the government that
the goal of national missile defense is
more to preserve us native freedom of
action than because the United States
really fears North Korean or Iranian
threats classified briefings well the
reasons commonly given for this are the
pressure of military industry and so on
which could be I suspect myself and I
approve it that a non-trivial factor and
this may be traced back again to
cultural patterns in particular a kind
of a curious paranoid streak in American
culture which may well be the result of
centuries of victories against much
weaker enemies facing no military threat
since the war of 1812 so the bully in
the schoolyard may well come to fear
that everyone hates him for some reason
as compared with other countries there
are remarkably high levels of fear in
the United States that's of all sorts of
things crime terrorism aliens among us
Judgment Day spend anything you think of
except for the real threat to the United
States in the world which are high and
probably increasing now that would be
something of a problem if we were
talking about Afghanistan but we're not
it's vastly more significant when we're
talking about the most advanced
civilization that intelligence has been
able to create and the most dominant
well these global concerns are not
alleviated by other us stands last
November November 1999 the United States
blocked the UN general assembly
resolution opposing space-based weapons
it was passed 138 20 the US and Israel
alone abstaining but a u.s. abstention
is a veto the two years earlier the US
Space Command published what it called
its vision for the year 2020
which called for what they call
full-spectrum dominance including
control of space military control in
order to protect us interests and
investments well there are plenty of
threats in the world but the major
problems lie right at home and hence are
within the sphere of our influence and
control which brings us right back to
the truisms that I mentioned at the
outset well let's again a lot more to
say about this but let's turn to another
domain so consider something nice and
mild not nuclear weapons neoclassical
markets markets in which isolated
individuals seek only to maximize a
particular form of self-interest is only
a form that's consciously constructed
with very great effort with perceptions
instituted by vast industries that are
devoted to implanting and reinforcing
them in the United States about
one-sixth of gross domestic product
that's well over a trillion dollars a
year is devoted to marketing much of it
is just manipulation and control trying
to institute these values starting their
infancy well these constructed systems
have a number of well-known problems one
is that unborn generations who are going
to face the consequences have no vote in
the market from which it follows that
their interests count as zero in the
market system they don't enter into
consideration in a well-functioning
market that alone tends to undermine the
possibilities of the sustainable
development on which survival relies
these threats are currently being
enhanced very consciously by dedicated
efforts to begin the institutional
structures that might address these
externalities as they're called and even
more important to undermine the culture
of sympathy and solidarity that sustains
them now this
last commitment I think it's pretty
important my I believe it's the driving
force behind the propaganda efforts that
are designed to undermine popular
support for healthcare systems of the
kind that are found in other industrial
societies and to create a largely
artificial sense of crisis about the
schools and the social security and in
fact about any institutions that rely on
the dangerous sentiment that we might
care about somebody else not just
ourselves the Social Security scam has
other routes and it's a scam take a look
if you don't believe it whatever one
thinks about transferring Social
Security to stocks the stock market
there are two consequences which are
absolutely clear and under one is that
it's a huge bonanza for Wall Street
another is that it entails that working
people are going to have to have it are
going to end up with a tremendous stake
in the value of stocks the stocks on
which their survival post-retirement
survival it depends on the survival of
their families that means that working
people will have a strong reason to
oppose decent wages and working
conditions health safety health and
safety standards in the workplace the
social social and economic rights that
are given formal endorsement in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
which the u.s. strongly opposes and
other principles that are naturally
despised by the unaccountable private
tyranny that dominate the domestic and
the international society and close
alliance with one another and the
powerful states that they largely
dominate that's another prescription for
disaster and not so into such a long
term well it's commonly claimed it is a
huge payoff for these problems what's
called globalization or the new economy
or free markets or other terms terms of
propaganda I believe referring to the
social economic policies of the past
twenty odd years
according to the story they have led to
unprecedented economic growth though
unfortunately a few have been left
behind and do something about that all
led by the spectacular fairytale economy
of the United States you've read this a
thousand times so take say the most
critical voice in the New York Times
Anthony Lewis on march 10th he informed
us that I'm quoting the
