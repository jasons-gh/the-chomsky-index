or so graphically described by the press
and the country is called totally cool
it was pretty much destroyed in the
1980s but it's totally collapsed since
in every respect just about economically
is declined sharply since the u.s.
takeover and democratically in every
other respect it's now the second
poorest country in the hemisphere the i
should say i'm not going to talk about
it but i mentioned that i picked up
nicaragua because it's not in
controversial case if you look at the
other states in the region the state
terror was far more extreme and it again
traces back to Washington and that's by
no means all it was happening elsewhere
in the world to so pick say Africa
during the Reagan years alone South
African attacks backed by the United
States and Britain South African US UK
back South African attacks against the
neighboring countries that killed about
a million and a half people and left 60
billion dollars of damage and countries
destroyed and if we go around the world
we can add more examples that was the
war the first war against terror of
which I have given a small sample are we
supposed to pay attention to that or
kind of think that that might be
relevant after all it's not exactly
ancient history well evidently not as
you can tell by looking at the current
discussion of the war on terror which
has been the leading topic for the last
month I mentioned that Nicaragua has now
become the second poorest country in
hemisphere what's the first the most the
poorest country well that's of course
Haiti which also happens to be the
victim of most US intervention in the
20th century by a long shot which is
left it totally devastated it's the
poorest country Nicaragua's
second-ranked in degree of us
intervention the 22nd century it's the
second poorest actually it's vying with
Guatemala
they interchange every year to as to
who's the second poorest and they also
vie as to which is the leading target of
US military intervention we're supposed
to think that all of this is some sort
of accident you know has nothing to do
with anything that happened in history
maybe the worst human rights violator in
the 1990s is Columbia by a long shot
it's also the by far the leading
recipient of US military aid in the
1990s maintaining the terror and human
rights violation in 1999 Columbia
replaced turkey as the leading recipient
of us arms worldwide that's excluding
Israel in Egypt bucher a separate
category the and that tells us a lot
more about the war on terror right now
in fact why was turkey getting such a
huge flow of us arms well if you take a
look at the flow flow of us arms to
Turkey or you turkey always got a lot of
us arms it's strategically placed a
member of NATO and so on but but the
arms float of Turkey went up very
sharply in 1984 their main do with Cold
War I mean Russia was collapsing and it
stayed high from 1984 until nineteen
ninety nine when it reduced and it was
replaced in the lead by Columbia what
happened from 1984 to 1999 well in 1984
at Columbia launched a major terrorist
war against the Kurds in southeastern
Turkey and that's when US aid went up
military aid and this was not pistols
this is jet planes tanks military
training and so on and it stayed high as
the atrocities escalated through the
1990s aid followed it the peak year was
nineteen ninety-seven in 1997 US aid
that military aid the turkey was more
than in the entire period 1952 1983 that
is the Cold War period which is an
indication of how much the Cold War has
affected policy the end the results were
awesome this led to 23 million refugees
some of the worst ethnic cleansing of
the late 1990s tens of thousands of
people killed 3,500 towns and villages
destroyed way more than Kosovo even
under NATO bombs and all under the
United States is providing eighty
percent of the arms increasing as the
atrocities increased peaking in 1997 it
declined in 1999 because once again
terror worked as it usually does when
carried out by its major agents namely
the powerful so by nineteen ninety nine
Turkish terror called of course counter
terror but as I said that's universal it
worked there for a turkey was replaced
by Columbia which had not yet succeeded
in its terrorist war and therefore had
to move into first place as recipient of
us arms well what makes this all
particularly striking is that all of
this was taking place right in the midst
of a huge flood of self-congratulation
on the part of Western intellectuals
which probably has no counterpart in
history I mean you'll remember it was
just a couple of years ago massive self
adulation about how for the first time
in history we are so magnificent that we
are standing up for principles and
values and dedicated to ending in
humanity everywhere and the new year of
this and that and so on and so forth and
we certainly can't tolerate the
atrocities right near the borders of
NATO that was repeated over and over
only within the borders of NATO where we
can not only tolerate much worse
atrocities but contribute to them well
another insight into Western
civilization and our own is how often
this was brought up try to look I won't
repeat it but it's instructive it's a
pretty impressive feat for a propaganda
system to carry this off in a free
society it's pretty amazing I think you
could do this in a totalitarian state
and turkey is very grateful just a few
days ago of a prime minister
it announced that turkey would be would
join the coalition against terror very
enthusiastically even more so than
others in fact as he said it would
contribute troops which others have not
been willing to do and he explained why
he said we owe a debt of gratitude to
the United States because the United
States was the only country that was
willing to contribute so massively to
our own in his words counter-terrorist
war that is to our own massive ethnic
cleansing and atrocities and terror no
other country all other countries kind
of you know they helped a little but
they stayed back the United States on
the other hand contributed
enthusiastically and decisively and was
able to do so because of the silence
servility might be the right word of the
educated classes who could easily find
out about it as a free country after all
you can read human rights reports read
all sorts of stuff but chose to
contribute to the atrocities and turkey
is very happy to there was a debt of
gratitude for that and therefore will
contribute troops just as during the war
in Serbia turkey turkey was very much
praised for using its f-16s which we
supplied it to bombed Serbia exactly as
it had been doing with the same planes
against its own population up until the
time when it finally succeeded in
crushing internal terror as they called
it and as usual as always resistance
does include terror it's true of the
American Revolution that's true of every
case they know just as it's true that
those who have a monopoly of violence
talk about themselves as carrying out
counter terror well that's pretty
impressive and that has to do with the
coalition against that is now being
organized to fight the war against
terror and it's very interesting to see
how that coalition is being described so
have a look at this morning's Christian
Science Monitor that's a good newspaper
one of the best
international newspapers with real
coverage of the world of the lead story
the front page story is about how the
United States you know people used to
dislike the United States but now
they're beginning to respect it and
they're very happy about the way the
u.s. is leading the war against terror
and the prime example in fact the only
serious example the others are a joke is
Algeria it turns out that Algeria is
very enthusiastic about the US war
against terror the person who wrote the
article is an expert on Africa he must
know that Algeria is one of the most
vicious terrorist states in the world
has been carrying out horrendous terror
against its own population in past past
couple of years in fact for a while this
was under wraps but it was finally
exposed in France with defectors from
the Algerian army it's all over the
place there and in England and so on but
here we're very proud because one of the
worst terror states in the world is now
enthusiastically welcoming the US war on
terror and in fact is cheering on the
United States to lead the war that shows
how popular we're getting and if you
look at the coalition that's being
formed against terror tells you a lot
more a leading member of the coalition
is Russia which is delighted to have the
United States support its murderous
terrorist war in Chechnya instead of
occasionally criticizing at in the
background China is joining
enthusiastically it's delighted to have
support for the atrocities it's carrying
out in western China against what it
calls Muslim secessionists Turkey as I
mentioned is very happy with the war
against terror they're experts and in
Algeria Indonesia delighted to have even
more us support for atrocities that it's
carrying out and notch a and elsewhere
now we can run through the list the list
of the states that have joined the
coalition against terror is quite
impressive they have a characteristic in
common they are among probably about
certainly among the leading to our
estates in the world and happen to be
led by the world champion
so that brings us back to the question
what is terrorism been assuming we
understand it but what is it well there
happened to be some easy answers to this
there is an official definition you can
find it in the u.s. code or in US Army
manuals brief statement of it taken from
a u.s. army manual is fair enough is
that terror is the calculated use of
violence or the threat of violence to
attain political or religious
ideological goals through intimidation
coercion or instilling fear that's
terrorism that's a fair enough
definition it's reasonable to accept
that the problem is it can't be accepted
because if you accept that all the wrong
consequences follow for example the
consequences I've just been reviewing
now there is a major effort right now at
the UN to try to develop a comprehensive
treaty on terrorism when you and Kofi
Annan got the Nobel Prize the other day
you'll notice he was reported as saying
we should stop wasting time on this and
really get down to it but there's a
problem if you use the official
definition of terrorism in the
comprehensive treaty you're going to get
completely the wrong results so that
can't be done in fact even worse than
that if you take a look at the
definition of low-intensity warfare
which is official US policy you find it
it's a very close paraphrase of what I
just read in fact low intensity conflict
is just another name for terrorism
that's why all countries as far as I
know call whatever horrendous acts
they're carrying out counterterrorism we
happen to call it counterinsurgency or a
low intensity conflict so that's a
serious problem you can't use the actual
definitions you got to carefully find
the definition that doesn't have all the
wrong consequences there are some other
problems some of them came up in
December 1987 at the peak of the first
war and terrorism that's when furor over
the plague was peaking and the United
Nations a general assembly passed a very
strong resolution
against terrorism condemning the plague
of the strongest terms calling on every
state to fight against it in every
possible way I passed unanimously one
country Honduras abstained two votes
against the usual to United States and
Israel why should the United States and
Israel vote against a major resolution
condemning terrorism and the strongest
terms in fact pretty much the terms of
the Reagan administration was using well
is it reason there was one paragraph in
that long resolution which said that
nothing in this resolution infringes on
the rights of people struggling against
racist or and colonialist regimes or
foreign military occupation to continue
their resistance with the assistance of
others other states states outside and
they're just cause well the United
States and Israel can't accept that the
main reason that they couldn't at the
time was because of South Africa South
Africa was an ally of the unofficially
cold and Ally there was a terrorist
force in South Africa it was called the
African National Congress they were a
terrorist force officially South Africa
on contrast wasn't a lie and we
certainly couldn't support actions by a
terrorist group struggling for against a
racist regime that would be impossible
and of course there's another one namely
the occupied israeli-occupied
territories and Tara now going into its
35th year supported primarily by the
United States and blocking a diplomatic
settlement for 30 years now still is and
you can't have that there was another
one at the time Israel was occupying
southern Lebanon
