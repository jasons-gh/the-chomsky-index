Richard wolf Norman Finkelstein and many
more please check the website occupy
Boston org is in lectures wordpress.com
which is probably gonna migrate to the
main site soon for more details and so
now it's my pleasure to introduce to you
know Chomsky
you probably know them as the man who
invented context-free grammars but he's
also a very famous social activist at a
great radical thinker so let's give him
a big hand of applause aren't ya you're
gonna have to get down to the front
nobody
yeah well the first question always is
did you hear me closest but how's that
can you hear me in the back
how is this any different
how's that okay okay
well it's it's a little hard to talk to
give a talk in a Howard Zinn memorial
lecture at a occupy meeting this mixed
feelings necessarily go along with it
closer first of all regret that Howard's
not here to take part in and invigorate
in his inimitable way something that
would have been the dream of his life
secondly excitement that the dreams
actually being fulfilled it's it's a
dream that for which he gave he laid a
lot of the groundwork and I said it
would have been the fulfillment of a
dream for him to have been here with you
and it is a very exciting development
well there it is an extremely exciting
development in fact it's kind of
spectacular an unprecedented has never
been anything like it that I can think
of if the bonds and associations that
are being established and these
remarkable events can be sustained
through a long hard period ahead because
victories don't come quickly it could
turn out to be a really historic a very
significant moment in American history
the fact that the demonstrations are
unpressed the Occupy movement is
unprecedented is quite appropriate the
it's an unprecedented era not just this
moment but actually since the 1970s in
the 1970s there was began a major
turning point in American history since
the four centuries since the country
began it had been developing society
than not in very pretty ways that's
another story but it was a developing
society with ups and downs but a general
progress towards well the
industrialization and development even
in dark and hope there was a lot of a
pretty near constant expectation that
was going to go on like this that was
true even in very dark times I'm just
old enough to remember the Great
Depression and
after the first few years by the mid-30s
although the situation was objectively
much harsher than it is today but
nevertheless the spirit was quite
different there was a sense that we're
going to get out of it even among
unemployed people one of my relatives
that they'll get better there's this
there's a militant labor movement
organizing CIO organizing was going on
it was getting to the point of sit-down
strikes which really are very
frightening to the business world you
can see it in the business present of
time because a sit-down strike is just a
step before taking over the factory and
running it yourself and something which
incidentally is very much on the agenda
today and we should keep in mind welcome
back to both of the New Deal
legislations we're beginning to come
under popular pressure and it was a
sense somehow we're going to get out of
it it's quite different now now there's
a kind of pervasive sense of
hopelessness sometimes despair I think
it's quite new in American history and
it has an objective basis in the 1930s
unemployed working people could
anticipate realistically that the jobs
are going to come back if you're a
worker in manufacturing today and the
low unemployment Manufacturing's
approximately like the depression if
current tendencies persist
that's not those jobs aren't going to
come back this the change took place in
the seventies a lot of reasons for it
one of the underlying reasons discussed
mainly by economic historian Robert
Brenner's done a lot of work on it is
the falling rate of profit there were
other factors it led to major changes in
the economy
a reversal of the several hundred years
of progress towards industrialization
and development and turned to a process
of the industrialization and the
development of course manufacturing
production continued but overseas very
profitable but no good for the workforce
and along with that came a significant
shift of the economy from productive
enterprise producing things people need
or can use to financial manipulation
financialization of the economy really
took off at that time before the before
the 70s banks were banks they did what
banks are supposed to do in a state
capitalist economy take unused funds
like say you're a bank account
transferred to some potentially useful
purpose like buying a home sending a kid
to college or whatever it might be that
changed radically in the Senate
certainly there were no financial crises
it was a period of enormous growth
highest growth in American history maybe
in economic history sustained growth for
the 50s and 60s and it was a Galit area
so the lowest quintile did about as well
as the highest went a lot of people
moved into reasonable lifestyles was
called here
middle-class working-class of skull from
other countries
but they know is real
and the 60s accelerated the activism the
60s after a pretty dismal decade really
civilized the country in lots of ways
that are permanent you know that I
changing they're staying on 70s came
along sudden sharp change in the
industrialization offshoring of
production shifting to financial
institutions which grew enormously also
and I should say that in the 50s in the
60s there was also the development of
what several decades later became the
high tech economy computers internet
high tea revolution mostly developed in
the 50s and 60s as substantially in the
state sector took a couple of decades
before took off but it was developed
there the 1970s the developments that
took place set off a a kind of a vicious
cycle because it led to concentration of
concentration of wealth increasingly in
the hands of the financial sector which
doesn't benefit the economy probably
harms in the society but it did lead to
tremendous concentration of wealth
substantially there the concentration of
wealth yields concentration of political
power which in turn gives rise to
legislation that increases that
accelerates the cycle the physical
policies tax changes the rules of
corporate governance deregulation
essentially bipartisan alongside of this
cave began the very sharp rise in the
costs of Elections which drives the
political parties even deeper than
before into the pockets of the corporate
sector couple years later started a
different process which has been
described particularly by Tom Ferguson
is going to be here Monday he probably
will talk about it so I won't much but
the party's beacon was dissolved
essentially it used to be that if you
wanted to if a person in Congress hoped
for a position of say committee chair or
something some position of
responsibility you've got it mainly
through seniority and service within a
couple of years you started having to
put money into the party coffers in
order to get ahead that just drove the
whole system even deeper into the
pockets of the corporate sector
increasingly a financial sector that
tremendous concentration of wealth
mainly and
the top one-tenth of one percent of the
population meanwhile for the general
population it began to open the period
of this pretty much stagnation or even
decline for the majority people got by
but by your own official means of
borrowings or a lot of debt the longer
working hours but producing much higher
than in other industrial countries he
passed Japan on the passenger can't hear
me sorry
still how about that so there wasn't a
period of stagnation and decline for the
majority that continued along side of
our sharp concentration of wealth the
political system began to dissolve
there's always been a gap between public
policy and the public will but it just
proved kind of astronomically that you
can see it right now in fact be the big
can't hear me I don't know what to do
about it these things are in my mouth
I'll just keep going you can make it up
okay let's take a look at what's on
YouTube okay take a look what's
happening right now the the big topic in
Washington
everyone concentrates on is the deficit
for the public correctly the deficit is
not regarded as much of an issue and it
isn't really much of an issue than the
issues joblessness not a deficit there's
a deficit Commission but there's no
joblessness Commission as far as the
demo discontented is concerned pay
attention to it
the public has opinions particularly the
polls overwhelmingly support higher
taxes on the wealthy which is declined
sharply
