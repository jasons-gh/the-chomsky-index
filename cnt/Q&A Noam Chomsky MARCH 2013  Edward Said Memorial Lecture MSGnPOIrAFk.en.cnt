thank you
Thank You professor Chomsky what we're
going to do is we'll go round this way
we have microphones all over the the
hall I can't actually see everything but
let's start this way if you would like
to yes go on hello professor Chomsky I
am perturbed by two questions of moral
philosophy the first one is concerning
Peter Singer is he right on animal
rights and my second question is on
inequities at birth we can't
redistribute IQ height good looks talent
we can redistribute wealth and income
does this have any moral significance at
all thank you um well just out of
curiosity here that you kill insects
like mosquitoes when they're bothering
you or do you think that when mosquitoes
are carrying malaria we ought to develop
the means to kill them off questions
okay that's part of the answer you can
pretty sure I don't should have rights
but none of us believes that animal
including Peter Singer that animals
should have the rights of human beings
and there's good reasons for that the
right stone exist in a vacuum if you're
talking about moral philosophy the
rights are associated with
responsibilities we don't attribute any
responsibilities at all to other animals
doing we don't say that a lion has to be
sent to the gas chamber if it kills a
gazelle let's say no they don't have
responsibilities and that of course if
in moral philosophy now just abstract
discussion relates to the question of
what their rights are and
you can they should have rights so for
example it's a step forward in our
general kind of moral development that
animals are not subjected to a torture
in the way they were just a few years
ago so in Britain and the United States
there now constraints on the Torchwood
we call experiment torture of at least
animals that are closer to us like
primates than there were 30 40 years ago
so yes we're developing some sort of
conception of rights but I don't think
anyone thinks that animals have the
rights and responsibilities of human
beings okay then we can enter into the
details was the second question oh yeah
bout IQ not about about general gifts
that we are born with okay I mean like
you know somebody asked me to before to
sign a picture and told me that she had
only once before ask someone to sign a
picture some tennis champion okay well
I'm never going to be a tennis champion
so good I'm not sorry that he has those
talons which I don't have oh and I'm not
sorry that people can play the violin in
ways I can't dream of or and so I think
that's great otherwise it'd be extremely
boring world so yes people have all
sorts of qualities and capacities I
think you mentioned IQ that's one of the
least significant of them but whatever
it is some very marginal phenomenon
okay anyone that side but there are real
ones and I think it's great sure there
should be a very complex world in which
people can do different things and we
can admire and enjoy what they do okay
try to go here since there's no one
there thank you first stop ski this is a
measure Mirza from ceasefire magazine we
did an interview with you in the Spring
of 2011 as the revolutions were sweeping
the Arab world and at the time when I
asked you about Syria the picture was
not very clear and I was wondering two
years now down the line what your
thoughts were on this situation there
and if I could be allowed second minor
question Prospect magazine runs a poll
of the greatest intellectual in the
world and for the first two poles i
think i'm sure you're familiar with ten
years ago and five years ago you were
either the top intellectual or number
two I think based on popular votes this
year they've asked a number of people
including people you know such
luminaries as Bernard only Levy and and
so on to pick a short list of 65 on
which you did not appear and I was
wondering whether you have any comments
or that I didn't have any comments when
the first one appeared because joke
don't have any comments on the later
ones well there were some interesting
reactions to the first one one of the
main colonists for the Financial Times
Gideon raff when I think his name is it
wrote a blog and which he said we have
to organize people to make sure to
prevent me from getting on the list next
time
that was amusing but there's any other
interest in it I don't know what it is
that's a joke it's far as serious
concern now it's a tragedy the country's
moving toward some sort of suicide as to
what we ought to do I I think you ought
to turn around and ask him I'd suggest
reading Patrick Overton's column and the
independent yesterday I think that's
about right arming the factions is just
going to make it worse every far as I
know almost about everyone who knows
anything about Syria who cares about it
pretty much agrees on this I don't know
that much but in fact only what I read
but that seems to be a pretty general
understanding that the only hope is some
kind of move toward negotiations and
diplomacy which will settle a conflict
which otherwise is simply going to
destroy the society and there are
proposals mukhtar Brahimi's proposals
which to implement them is not going to
be easy I certainly can't be implemented
if nobody supports them as far as I know
the only countries that support them are
Russia and Iran Iraq maybe well we
should ask ourselves should we be
sporting I think wouldn't be a bad idea
okay I'm going to UM does the
anti-zionist left risk undermining
itself it doesn't also highlight Hamas
is abuses of its own people including
violent crackdowns on suppose of Western
decadence and the recent banning of
women from the Gaza marathon so you're
asking whether Hamas is harming the
Palestinian oh yeah sure I'm not a great
admirer of Hamas by any means when I was
in Gaza I met the dismal henao talked
about some of these things the
the Islamic movements in general of our
many very negative aspects like
religious-based movements everywhere I
mean I think to take something that's
closer to my direct interest the
enormous and growing power of the
Christian Right fundamentalist christian
right in the United States as I think
not only a danger to the country but to
the world because of us power and it's a
striking phenomenon it actually revealed
itself at the Hagel hearings was much
commented on but I'm sure you follow
those hearings but Jewish money and
Jewish votes overwhelmingly go to
Democrats okay but the Democrats
defended Hagel the Republicans denounced
him of why well I think a lot of it is
appealing to their but to their popular
base extremist Christian fundamentalists
who have a theology that this is we have
to have a war in the Middle East and up
an Armageddon everybody slow ders each
other the souls that have been saved
rise to heaven everybody else goes to
eternal perdition that incidentally
includes all Jews except for some reason
144,000 who discovered Christ and time
and they're saved well in order to bring
this about you have to have a war so
therefore you have to support you have
to blow up the Temple Mount you know you
have to goes on and on like this I'm
just today today this morning's paper
one of their great heroes Rand Paul and
probably be presidential candidate the
announced legislation to declare a
fertilized sell a person okay that means
that a fertilized cell can't has all the
rights of a person
can't can't be killed so no abortion for
example well those are the kinds of
policies that will indeed be implemented
as these groups become more powerful and
they're becoming more powerful for a
pretty simple reason if you take a look
at American politics the Republican
Party over the last couple of decades
has pretty much abandoned the pretense
of meeting being a normal parliamentary
party they're in lockstep service to the
extremely rich unto the corporate sector
you can't get votes that way so what
they've had to do is mobilize sectors of
the population that have always been
there it's in many ways very strange
society they've always been their
religious extremists nativists so Rand
Paul against is organizing a campaign to
oppose the UN's arms control treaty arms
exported arms are killing who does how
many people throughout the world in
Mexico you know 60,000 the last couple
of years huge numbers elsewhere but we
have to oppose it because the UN arms
control treaty is a plot by the United
Nations and abetted by the extremists
Obama and Clinton to try to take away
our arms so then the UN can attack us
and eliminate our sovereignty you think
that's a small thing it's not you look
at the guns and the gun lunacy in the
United States a lot of it is driven by
the fear that we have to have guns to
protect ourselves from the government
and from the United Nations and other
forces that are about to take us over
well this is really important i could go
on this is really important you know
what's what Hamas is doing i think is
very bad but this is incomparably worse
it's next to ya and then gotta
professor Chomsky do you think Israel
will exist in 50 years time well that's
interesting i visited the israel during
the First Intifada and an old friend of
mine is really a very dovish Israeli
asked me same question do you think
Israel will exist in 50 years and I feel
and felt what I've been writing for the
last 50 years or so that Israel's
following policies which maximize its
security threats and they're doing it
for good real odd a lot of states do
this securities nada is not a high
priority for governments I'm you see it
right here England like when the if you
followed the Chilcot hearings the you
know reviewing the Iraq war the head of
former head of mi5 a testified that
would be more or less knew that when the
US and Britain decided to invade Iraq
they did it on the assumption that it
would considerably increase terrorism
well actually it did way more than was
anticipated about seven fold in the
first year according to US government
statistics but it's just not an interest
governments are not all that interested
in protecting their citizens from terror
and destruction as many cases like this
some of them are totally horrendous
we've just passed the 50th anniversary
of the worst moment in human history the
cuban missile crisis when go through the
details a kennedy president kennedy was
willing to face what he considered a
third to a half probability of what
would have been a terminal nuclear war
in order to establish the principle that
we're allowed to have missiles
surrounding russia and
in Turkey actually obsolete missiles
which are being removed favors more
powerful ones we're entitled to have
that we're entitled have recently
emplaced missiles on Okinawa facing
China but nobody else is allowed to have
missiles anywhere outside their
territory that was the principal covered
up in various ways but it's hard to
think of a worse moment than that and
that's illustrative of the way States
think about the security of their own
population so in the case of Israel I
don't think they're breaking any making
breaking any precedents when they follow
policies which choose expansion over
security and sometimes it's very
explicit so I think one of the most
fateful moments in Israel's history was
in 1971 when President Sadat of Egypt
offered Israel a full peace treaty full
peace treaty offering nothing to the
Palestinians incidentally in return for
Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian
territory well you know for Israeli
security that would have been quite a
step forward but they preferred that to
pursue the plans for rapid expansion of
settlements into the Sinai and they were
backed by Henry Kissinger you can always
count on him to take the position will
be the most harmful to human beings
barely missed but so yes I think and
that's consistent ever since like a lot
of other states they're following
policies which lead to their moral
degradation their isolation there d
legitimation as they call it now and
very likely ultimate destruction that's
not impossible I thought
thank you for an absolutely wonderful
lecture professor Chomsky I want to ask
you to speculate about how you see the
future for the conflict between Israel
and the Palestinians in particular I'm
thinking of the to state 1 state debate
and wondering where you stand on that as
somebody who's observed this for so many
years your opinion is extremely valuable
and important I think for this audience
and many other people well right now if
we're realistic about it there are two
options what's discussed almost
universally Israelis Palestinians others
is two states or one state but those are
not the two options the two options are
two states or Israel in the u.s.
continue doing exactly what they're
doing right now those are the two
options and I won't run through what
they're doing right now but you can I'm
sure you know and go through the details
they're basically systematically
continuing to separate Gaza from the
West Bank turning keeping Gaza as a kind
of a prison imprisoning what remains of
the West Bank in the way I described
then taking over probably maybe forty
percent of of the land anything that's
valuable that's what's happening before
our eyes that's the alternative and it's
backed by strongly backed by the United
States and pretty much back by written
and other European countries whatever
their rhetoric that's the likely policy
if there isn't a two-state settlement
that what about one state or what then
my view more reasonable days used to be
called a bi-national state because it
will be a bi-national
but personally all my life I've
supported that back to the 1940s when I
was what was then called a Zionist youth
activist opposed to a Jewish state that
was part of the Zionist movement at the
time so yeah I thought Jewish state's a
really bad idea and groups i were with
left groups were looking for arab-jewish
working class cooperation lead to a
bi-national state well if we're
interested in this and we want not just
to talk about it but to try to reach it
which I assume yet we should then we
have to answer a question how do you get
from here to there okay you know
everybody can be in favor of say
eliminating nuclear weapons but then
help very much to say it I've say how do
we get there you know all right so take
this question how do we get there pre
1948 there was a straightforward answer
you just move immediately towards
establishing that and there were
prospects I think from 49 up till about
67 there were essentially no prospect
from 67 to the mid-70s there were again
prospects I wrote about it a lot at the
time would have been possible and there
was actually some support for this in
Israeli military intelligence and some
parts of the Palestinian movement for
moving towards some kind of Federation
which could lead to closer integration
and so on well it nobody was interested
so it died by not by the mid-70s that
option was gone because Palestinian
national rights that entered the
international agenda before that in the
international agenda Palestinians were
refugees you know so nothing about the
Palestinian national rights at once they
entered the international agenda and the
policy of of most of the world outside
the US
to move towards a two-state settlement
then there was a new option the first
proposal for a two-state settlement
incidentally was in January 1976 formal
proposal when the major three major Arab
states Syria Egypt and Jordan so-called
confrontation States brought a
resolution to the Security Council at
calling for establishment of two states
on the internationally recognized border
with in the wording was taken from you n
2 42 or guarantees for the right of
every state Israel and new Palestinian
state to exist in peace and security
with secure and recognized borders
that's that's basically the
international consensus now the u.s.
vetoed okay again in 1980 won't run
through the rest of the record but since
that time the US with the quiet support
of its allies like Britain has been
undermining it well you know if it was
realized and I don't think it's beyond
realization then there could be further
moves in every time in the past when
tensions have been somewhat reduced you
know cycle of violence has been reduced
you very quickly see interactions across
the borders I mean anyone has ever been
in the former Palestine those you just
can't draw a border through it on the
egg where you draw is totally crazy so
what happens is people start the
commercial interactions cultural
exchanges and so on that could lead to
closer integration and maybe to some
kind of Federation and then maybe on
incidentally I don't think that that
should be the final goal that we should
be thinking about okay tell your
personal anecdote
my first visit the Lebanon which was
inadvertent it was in 1953 my wife and I
were students and we were backpacking up
in northern Israel and by accident we
happened to walk into Lebanon there's no
meaningful border you know like every
other border in the world is just
something arbitrarily imposed by
Imperial violence no reason that worship
it Jeep came by and got yelled at us
were in the wrong country we should come
back so we came back but you know I
would think that if he can reach some
kind of binational settlement the next
stage ought to be eroding the Imperial
borders not just there a lot of places I
think that would be very healthy and
frankly I think realistically that's the
only framework in which i think there's
likely to be some meaningful approach to
the huge palestinian refugee problem
could be and so that's a possibility I
mean if there are other options i'd like
to hear I've just never heard anything
else except I'd like this well okay a
lot of things we'd like but how do you
get there upstairs number five please
one get you some water I have some of
you
hello professor Chomsky and we queued
outside to hear your lecture today and
I'm so glad we managed to come in i was
born in mexico city and my best friends
in my building and in my colonia or
borrow were from the Jewish religion
when my mother was growing up she went
to a non-school but her best friends in
her burrow in el zocalo were serially
beneath when I grew up the best friends
I had were the sons and daughters of
those who had flown from Franco and when
I became an adult my best friends were
the sons and daughters of jillians who
had run away from my yin and they're
from Pinochet I mean from be no Chatham
and then and the ones who had refuge
themselves from the I en de Kamp sorry
and I'm talking very senior people in
Mexico so you spoke of Latin America
with two fronts the one with hope and
the one which is trying to maybe make
business with the uranium for Iran could
you tell a Latin American what to expect
of her homeland and whether there is a
seed of hope there with all these
tolerance like the Londoners who are
gathered here tonight oh my Mexico's is
it very much as you describe it it's
been a center for refugee flow remember
them you know we're all everyone knows
everything about the horrors of Eastern
Europe you know
we couldn't reel off the European
dissidents who were badly treated and so
on like save a sloth hovel is put in
prison for a while they were not nice
but I just as an experiment how many of
you can even know the names of the
leading Latin American intellectuals
Jesuit priests who had their brains
blown out in 1989 by a US run state
terrorist force which already killed
thousands of people and had just
returned from renewed training at the
John F Kennedy School of Special Warfare
just the last you know the latter the
end not even end but of a major war
against the church that the United
States was conducting after Vatican 2
which is much in the news now because
Vatican 2 introduced a heresy the heresy
was to go back to the Bach Gospels and
in other words to what the church was
before the Romans took it as a you know
the church of the Empire and the Vatican
two calls were returned to the Gospels
you know radical pacifist message
preferential option for the poor I was
taken seriously in Latin America as I'm
sure you know priests and the nuns of
lay people went out into the villages
and organized based communities had
people read the Gospels think about how
to take control of their own lives I
mean that's an entirely intolerable
heresy I'm the Vatican played its role
in crushing it but the u.s. just went to
war and it's not a secret the famous
School of the Americas which trains
Latin American killers one of their
talking points you know advertising
points is that the US Army helped the
feet Liberation Theology the liberation
theology was the effort to bring the
Gospels back to the church and it was a
very bloody campaign of course most of
the people killed were you know peasants
were
people the usual victims but there was a
long strain of religious martyrs like
those I mentioned and plenty of others
but nobody here knows them I mean maybe
some of you maybe you know them but a
very few people could even mention their
name and the crimes in Latin America
through the safe from 1962 up to now or
far worse than what was going on in
Eastern Europe during the same years but
we only know the others because somebody
else was committing the crime so we were
supposed to know about them and deploy
them and so on and so forth not the ones
we're killing well is there a way to
overcome this yeah there isn't i think
it's going on in latin america the
development that i mentioned in the last
10 or 15 years i think is of really
historic importance in overcoming this
legacy and it's not just the last 60
years after all this is the first time
in half a millennium since the
conquistadors that the latin america has
begun to free itself from Imperial
control and that the changes are
dramatic what it mentioned about
globalizing tortures one case but many
others i'm in a long way to go but it's
he's pretty hopeful one of the mo
hopeful issues things in the world
that's for the iranian might i don't
think that amounts to very much of latin
america doesn't provide uranium it's
gonna have to take two more questions
only I'm afraid we're running out of
time can we take number three hi I want
to ask a question about the
effectiveness of the boycott divestment
and sanctions movement with relation to
Israel I'm part of an organization
called football beyond borders and we're
campaigning to get the upcoming UEFA
under-21 football tournament moved away
from Israel or if that fails to mobilize
a massive boycott of the tournament do
you think these kinds of boycotts are
effective and can they have the same
global impact as the sports boycotts
against apartheid South Africa
I think these are useful tactics but we
should recognize that there's a pretty
striking difference between the current
what's called by the participants the
BDS movement and the the resort to these
tactics in the case of South Africa
there was no BDS movement in the case of
South Africa rather there was often
quite careful use of these tactics when
they were appropriate and it was
selective and thoughtful sports boycott
was important it was against racial
exclusion in the sports teams and a lot
of it was carefully designed for
everything wasn't perfect but the reason
it was successful was that there were
several conditions that were understood
by the participants one of them is that
first you have to have a long
educational program so that people
understand what you're doing BDS type
tactics began seriously around pretty
much around maybe the late 70s that was
after decades of educational work
organization by then apartheid was a
correctly it was condemned bites but
everyone even corporations in fact that
Congress was beginning to pass sanctions
in fact Reagan who was a credible racist
had to he had to evade congressional
sanctions he tried to veto them but
they're passed over his veto and then he
had to evade them to keep supporting
South Africa for interesting reasons
that was part of his war on terror
remember that to the war on terror we
got in 1981 not 2001 and was the focus
of u.s. foreign policy and the ANC
African National Congress was designated
as quoting one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world
that was 1988 I right near the end of
apartheid Nelson Mandela himself just
got off the terrorist list a couple of
years ago he can now come to the United
States without special dispensation so
you had to defend white South Africans
from terrorism sounds familiar today but
he had lost the public on that I mean
the public had turned against it they
were ready for stronger actions notice
that were nowhere near that in the case
of Israel today not even close secondly
the use of these tactics in the best
cases and a lot of them were good I paid
attention to two crucial questions that
what's their impact on the society that
we're sanctioning like do they produce a
cost for the society okay that's
important and secondly what's there how
do they appeal to the audience that
we're trying to reach the audience were
trying to reach is people here these
efforts are as in the case of South
Africa are an F are part of the
educational program of getting people to
recognize we got to do something to
bring these crimes to an end so you have
to ask yourself well are the tactics
well adapted to that or do they have the
opposite effect I mean are they so
remote from the understanding of the
people you're trying to reach that they
agitate them and they have become more
supportive of the crimes activist
movements and nationalist movements have
always understood this so for example I
can remember long discussions with the
Vietnamese back in 1960s about what were
the right tactics to use and they were
strongly opposed to a lot of the tactics
that were used by young people who were
deeply committed to ending the war like
the Weathermen
march down the street right brick back
windows and so on they thought that was
just totally crazy because they
understood that it harms them it just
builds up support for the war what they
wanted is telling Mariama before one of
them mains I remember when they
suggested as a tactic this is a period
of real militancy in the United States
they suggested they said what they
really liked was when a group of women
in the United States went to the graves
of American soldiers and stood silently
they thought that was a great tactic
well you know that didn't much appeal to
kids who for good reasons were pre upset
by the war and wanted to do something
more militant but if you care about the
victims that's kind of question yes and
it was done pretty well I think not
perfectly in a South African movement
and those are the considerations that
have to be thought through but there was
never a BDS movement with principles you
know that you had to adhere to and so on
and never and that was wise I think so
they're good tactics they can be used
effectively but you have to think about
you have to think about all the aspect
of them it's one last question up that
number four hasn't had any share
whoever's got the microphone
well give it will give you bonus ok I
have recently become acquainted with the
global Commons movement that promotes
trustee ship and stewardship instead of
ownership of land currently we live in a
system that protects the ownership of
land ok do you think that land ownership
in its current form which hemorrhages
the lands produce and resources profits
into the pockets of the land owner plays
a part in our current Wars and what you
describe is almost by definition
something we should obviously be opposed
to but you know it's it's not really a
large part of the current Wars I mean a
lot of this and civilly is being carried
out by countries like Saudi Arabia and
others who are buying up big pieces of
Africa and there are the only ones to
try to convert convert it to
agricultural production which they need
they're doing a lot of purchase of lead
but that's not contributed it's not
right but uh contributing to Wars the
Western countries are not really like
when they invade Iraq or Afghanistan or
not trying to buy up the land I'm they
have all kind of strategic and economic
reasons but not to buy the land it's a
it's a bad thing here in our own
countries too and so should be dealt
with but I think without misrepresenting
the kind of context at which it takes
place very much I'm going to just end
with a housekeeping note if you're
interested in buying some sign copies of
a professor shamsky's book please come
out this way if you're fed up with us
and want to leave as fast as possible go
through the back and finally I want to
thank you all for your support and thank
you for passing
ok
