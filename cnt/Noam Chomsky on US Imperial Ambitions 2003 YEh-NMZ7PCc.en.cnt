well with US military forces in
Afghanistan and in Iraq as well as bases
in Turkey Iran is literally surrounded
now right by us all through Central Asia
and through Central Asian in the north
might not that objective reality on the
ground radicalize forces inside Iran to
you know develop nuclear weapons if they
don't already have them in self-defense
no it's very likely I mean there's you
know there's a lot of illusions about
this but the little evidence we have
serious evidence indicates that the
Israeli bombing of the Osirak reactor in
1981 probably stimulated and may have
even initiated the Iraqi nuclear weapons
development program but they were
already engaged in it they were engaged
in building a nuclear plant but what it
was nobody knew it was investigated on
the ground after the bombing by a
nuclear well known nuclear physicist
from Harvard they published his analysis
in a leading scientific journal Nature
and according to him it was a power
plant other Iraqi sources exile' have
indicated we can't prove it that nothing
much was going on it was no they may
have been toying with the idea of
nuclear weapons but that the bombing of
it did stimulate the nuclear weapons
program you can't prove this but that's
what the evidence looks like what does
the Iraq war and occupation mean for the
Palestinians disaster no road maps to
peace yeah I mean it's it's interesting
to read it one of the rules of
journalism I don't know exactly how it
got established but it's a absolute
consistency is that when you mention
George Bush's name in an article the
headline has to speak of his vision and
the article has to talk about his dreams
and that maybe there'll be a photograph
of him right next to it the peering into
the distance and one of George Bush's
dreams and visions is to have a
Palestinian state somewhere some
and some unspecified place maybe in the
Saudi desert and we are supposed to
worship and praise that as a magnificent
vision it has become a convention of
journalists the vision and the dream is
that maybe the United States will stop
undermining totally of the long term
effort of the third rest of the world
virtually without exception to create
some kind of a viable political
settlement up until now the US has been
blocking it the last 2530 years of the
Bush administration went even further
and blocking it sometimes in pretty
extreme ways so extreme that they
weren't even reported here so for
example last December at the UN for the
first time the Bush administration
reversed US policy on Jerusalem up until
now the US had at least the principle
gone along with the 1968 Security
Council resolution ordering Israel to
revoke its annexation and occupation and
settlement policies in East Jerusalem
and for the first time last December
Bush administration reversed it that's
one of many cases intended to undermine
the possibility of any meaningful
political settlement a couple of days
ago two weeks ago I guess Bush made a
what was called his first significant
pronouncement on at least on Israel of
Arab problem he gave a speech headlines
you know first significant statement in
years and so on well if you read it it
was boilerplate except for one sentence
that one sentence people take a look at
it closely what it said is as the peace
process advances Israel should terminate
new settlement programs okay what does
that mean that means until the peace
process reaches a point that Bush
endorses it could be indefinitely far in
the future
until then Israel should continue to
build settlements okay that's a change
in policy
up until now officially at least the US
has been opposed to expansion of the
illegal settlement programs that make us
political settlement impossible but now
Bush is saying the opposite say John
settle I'm paying for it
until we decide that somehow the peace
process has reached an adequate point so
yes it was a significant change towards
more aggression undermining of
international law and undermining of the
possibilities of peace you've described
the level of public protest and
resistance to the Iraq war as
unprecedented never before has there
been so much opposition before a war
began where is that resistance going if
you could talk about it inside the
United States and then internationally I
don't know any way to predict human
affairs it'll go the way people have
decided will go there are many
possibilities it should intensify I mean
the tasks are now much greater and more
serious than they were before on the
other hand it's harder no it's just
psychologically easier to organize to
oppose a military attack than it is to
oppose a long-standing program of
Imperial ambition of which this attack
is one phase and of which others are
going to come next
that takes more thought or dedication
more long-term engagement you know it's
the difference between being a deciding
okay I'm I'm in this for the long haul
and saying okay I'm going out to a
demonstration tomorrow and then I oh
those are choices also same in the civil
rights movement the women's movement
anything do we need to be concerned
about threats to an intimidation of
dissidents here inside the United States
and including roundups random roundups
of immigrants and green card holders and
citizens for that matter
well vulnerable people like immigrants
definitely have to be concerned I mean
the current government has claimed right
which go beyond any precedent there's
some in wartime but those are pretty
ugly ones like rounding up the Japanese
for a Wilton during the first world war
which was pretty awful but they're now
claiming rights that are quite without
precedent including even the right to
arrest citizens hold them in detention
without access to family or lawyers and
do so indefinitely without charges
that's unique and immigrants and other
vulnerable people should certainly be
cautious on the other hand you know for
us people like to ask people with
citizens with any privilege though there
are threats you know as compared with
what people face in most of the world
they're so slight that that's hard to
get very upset about I mean have just
been back from Turkey a couple of times
in Colombia and you know compared with
the threats that people face there we're
living in heaven with the US economy
deteriorating and with layoffs and the
prospect of more layoffs an economic
downturn on the horizon how is the Bush
administration going to maintain which
is what some people are calling a
garrison state here at home and a state
of permanent war overseas with
occupation of numerous countries how are
they going to pull it off they have to
pull it off for about another six years
by that time they hope they will have
institutionalized highly reactionary
programs within the United States
they'll have left the economy in a very
serious state a huge deficit that's gone
pretty much the way they did in the
1980s and then it'll be the else's
problem to patch it together meanwhile
they will have they hope undermine
social programs diminished democracy
which of course they hate by
transferring
decision out of the public arena in the
private hands and do it in a way that
they'll be very hard to disentangle so
it overlaps the legacy internally that
will be painful and hard but only for
the majority of the population I mean
the people they're worried they're
concerned about are going to be making
out like bandits very much like Reagan
years it's the same people after all and
internationally they hope that they will
have institutionalized the doctrines of
imperial domination through force and
the preventive war as Joyce I'm at the
u.s. now in military force and military
spending probably exceeds the rest of
the world combined and it's much more
advanced and moving off into extremely
dangerous directions like space and they
assume I suppose that no matter what
happens to the American economy that
will give us such overwhelming force
people will just have to do it they say
what do you say to the the peace
activists in the United States who who
really labored for long trying to
prevent the attack and invasion of Iraq
and who are now feeling a sense of anger
that the US has done this and an
enormous amount of sadness I think that
they should be realistic it takes a
abolitionism how long did the struggle
go on before they made any progress I
mean if you give up every time you don't
achieve the immediate gain you want
you're just guaranteeing that the worst
that's going to happen these are long
hard struggles and in fact the what
happened in the last couple of months
should be seen quite positively I mean
the basis was created for expansion and
development of a peace and justice
movement that will move on to much
harder tasks and that's you know that's
way these things go you don't win
an easy victory and go home
Boulder Colorado April 5th 2003
in recent years of the Pentagon and then
the media have adopted this term
collateral damage to describe the death
of civilians talk about the role of
language in shaping and forming people's
understanding of events
well it's there's nothing much to do
with language I mean language is the way
we interact and communicate so naturally
the means of communication and the
conceptual background that's behind it
which is more important are used to try
to shape attitudes and opinions and
induce conformity and subordination this
has been true forever but it became it
became an organized and very
self-conscious industry really in the
last century and not surprisingly it was
created in the more democratic societies
so the first coordinated propaganda
ministry called the Ministry of
Information was in Britain during the
first world war it had the task as they
put it of controlling the mind of the
world and what they were particularly
concerned with was the mind of America
and in pathetically the mind of American
intellectuals they thought if they could
convince American intellectuals of the
nobility of the British war effort then
American intellectuals could succeed in
driving the basically pacifist
population of the United States which
didn't want to do with European Wars
rightly to drive them into a fit of
fanaticism and hysteria which would get
him to join the war and Britain needed
us backing so Britain had its Ministry
of Information aimed primarily at
American opinion and opinion leaders and
the u.s. the Wilson administration
reacted by setting up the first state
propaganda agency here the called the
Committee on Public Information this is
already Orwell II and of course
we don't have to even comment on what a
committee on public information is but
it succeeded it succeeded brilliantly in
fact mainly with liberal American
intellectuals people of the John Dewey
circle who actually took pride in the
fact that they were for the first time
in history according to their picture a
war wartime fanaticism was created and
not by military leaders and population
and politicians but by the more
responsible serious members of the
community namely thoughtful
intellectuals and they did organize a
campaign of propaganda with which within
a few months did succeed in turning a
relatively pacifist population into
raving anti German fanatics who wanted
to destroy everything German I mean
reached the point where the Boston
Symphony Orchestra couldn't play by you
know it the country was driven into a
into a hysteria Wilson had won the
election on Pete the slogan peace
without victory but within a couple of
months he turned the country into
fanatics wanted the wind victory and
destroy everything German and no peace
and that had an impact the members of
the committee on of Wilson's propaganda
agency included people like Edward
Bernays who became the guru of the
public relations industry and walter
Lippmann the leading public intellectual
of the 20th century the most respected
media figure and they very explicitly
drew from that experience you look at
their writings in the 1920s they say oK
we've learned from this that you can
control the public mind you can control
attitudes and opinions you can
that's where Lippmann said we can
manufacture consent by the means of
propaganda
Bernays said the more intelligent
members of the community can drive the
population into whatever they want by
what he called engineering of consent
the essence of democracy he said both of
them held it also led to the rise of the
public relations industry I mean it sort
of exists
before that but it it was very impressed
by this achievement from that comes the
enormous public relations industry which
was based on an interesting conception
it's interesting to look at their
thinking back in the 20s when I really
got started this was a period of
Taylorism in industry when workers were
being trained to become robots that was
extremely impressive it created a highly
efficient industry with the human beings
being turned into automata Bolsheviks
were very impressed with it too they
tried to duplicate it in fact they tried
throughout the world but the thought
control experts realized that you could
not only have what was called on job
control but also off job control it's
their phrase off job control means turn
people into robots for the rest of their
lives so control them off job by
inducing a philosophy of futility
focusing people on the superficial
things of life like fashionable
consumption and basically get them out
of our hair let the people are supposed
to run the show do it without any
interference from the mass of the
population who have no business in the
public arena and from that comes an
enormous industries ranging from
advertising to universities all
committed to very consciously to the
conception that you must control
attitudes and opinions because the
people are just too dangerous actually
they have good constitutional sources
for that the founding of the country was
based on the principle the Madisonian
principle that the people are just too
dangerous power has to be in the hands
of what Madison called the wealth of the
nation people who respect property in
its rights and are willing to protect
the minority of the opulent from the
majority the majority have to be
fragmented somehow but by the 1920s this
became highly self-conscious and major
industries and it's particularly
striking that it developed a more
democratic society
it was later duplicated they tried to
duplicated in Germany and the Bolshevik
Russia and South Africa and elsewhere
but it was always quite explicitly on
the mostly American model and what why
in the democratic societies was a good
reason for that if he can control people
by force it's not so important to
control what they think and feel but if
you lose the capacity to control people
by force
it becomes more necessary to control
attitudes and opinions and it brings us
right up to the present
you know the by now it's not so much
government agent it was to some extent
like Reagan had a what they called an
office of public diplomacy but by that
time the public was no longer willing to
accept state propaganda agencies so the
Reagan Office of public diplomacy was
declared illegal and had to go in
roundabout ways but instead of this what
took over instead was a private Tara
nice basically you know corporate
systems which play the role of a
controlling opinion and attitudes not
taking orders from the government but
closely linked to it of course and that
their contemporary system
extremely self-conscious I mean you
don't have to speculate much about what
they're doing because they're kind
enough to tell you you know and industry
publications and so on right and also in
the academic literature so you go back
to say the 1930s
perhaps the founder of modern a good bit
of modern political science a liberal
progressive will phony and Harold
Lasswell in 1933 wrote an article the
cult propaganda that people used the
term freely then before the connotations
that came from the Nazis it was just
openly called propaganda now they're
embarrass euphemism he wrote an article
called out propaganda in the
encyclopedia of social sciences major
publication and which the message was
that we should not all of these are
quotes incidentally we should not
succumb to democratic dogmatism about
people being the best judges of their
own interests they're not we are
since people are too stupid and ignorant
to understand their best interests for
their own benefit because we're great
humanitarians we must marginalize and
control them through and the best means
is propaganda the perfect is nothing
negative about propaganda he said it's
as neutral as a pump handle you can use
it for good or for evil
and since we're Noble wonderful people
will use it for good
to ensure that the stupid ignorant
masses remain marginalized and separated
from any decision-making capacity and
that's in the hands of us and we're but
good by definition so we'll do the best
for everyone and that includes world
government domestic control and so on
this is not the right-wing that I'm
talking about these are the liberal
progressive intellectuals and in fact
the Leninist doctrines are approximately
the same they're very close to
similarities the Nazis also picked it up
if you read my Kampf Hitler was very
impressed with anglo-american propaganda
they argued not without reason that
that's what won the first world war and
vowed that next time around the Germans
would be ready to and develop their own
propaganda systems modeled on the
democracies the Russians tried it but it
was too crude to be effective
South Africa used it others right up to
the present but the real forefront is of
the United States because it's the most
free and democratic society and it's
just much more important to control
attitudes and opinions can you make the
leap from propaganda then and its
origins to what's going on today with
what is called Operation Iraqi Freedom
and you can read it in this morning's
New York Times this is what's today
Saturday April 5th April 5th
ok this morning's New York Times and the
inside there's a interesting article
about karl rove the president's manager
basically
minder is what they call it in iraq when
it teaches him what to say and do
and it describes what he's doing now
Karl Rove he's not directly involved in
the war planning but neither's Bush I
mean this is in the hands of other
people but his goal he says is to
present the President as a powerful
wartime leader aimed at the next
presidential election so that the
Republicans can push through their
domestic agenda which is what he
concentrates on which means tax cuts
they say for the economy but they mean
for the rich tax cuts for the rich and
other programs which doesn't bother a
numerating but which are designed if you
look at them to benefit an extremely
small sector of the ultra wealthy and
privileged and will have the effect of
harming the mass of the population but
more significant than that it's not
outlined in the article is to try to
destroy the institutional basis for
social support systems so try to
eliminate things like schools and Social
Security and anything that is based on
the conception that people have to have
some concern for one another that's a
horrible idea which has to be driven out
of people's minds the idea that you
should have sympathy and solidarity you
should care whether the disabled widow
across that towns is able to eat that
has to be driven out of people's minds
that's a large part of the domestic
agenda quite apart from just shifting
wealth and power even more than it is
now towards and our sectors and the way
to achieve that since people aren't
going to accept that the way to achieve
it and it's stated explicitly is to make
people afraid if people are frightened
that their security is threatened
they'll gravitate towards the strong
leaders and I says they'll trust the
Republicans to protect them from enemies
and therefore suppress their own
concerns and interests we'll be able to
drive through the domestic agenda maybe
even institutionalize it so it'll be
very hard to reconstruct and we can do
it by presenting the president as a
powerful wartime leader succeeding and
over
this awesome pho which of course is
chosen because it barely exists and can
be crushed in no time yeah Iraq and
that's the it's laid out pretty
explicitly I mean you know not precisely
in the words I just use but the message
is very clear well so yeah that's what
you do and it's aimed at the next
presidential election that's a large
part of this work clearly there's a huge
gap on the Iraq war between US public
opinion and literally the rest of the
world do you attribute that to
propaganda there's just no question
about it you can trace it precise the
campaign about Iraq took off last
September that was and this is so
obvious it's even discussed in
mainstream publications like the chief
political analyst for UPI Martin Seif
has a long article just describing how
it was done I mean it's transparent in
September which happened to be the
opening of the midterm congressional
campaign that's when the drumbeat of
wartime propaganda began and it had a
couple of constant themes one is that
Iraq is an imminent threat to the
security of the United States we got to
stop him now or they're gonna destroy us
tomorrow the second is that Iraq was
behind 9/11 mber 11th nobody says it's
straight outs kind of insinuated they
were responsible the next one is they're
planning new such atrocities and
therefore we've got to stop them now or
really in danger well take a look at
polls they reflected the propaganda very
directly the propaganda is distributed
by the media they don't make it up they
just distributed you know he attributed
the high government officials would be
like but the campaign was reflected very
quickly in the polls by September and
since then roughly 60% oscillating
around that of the population believes
that Iraq is a threat to our security
Congress if you look at the Declaration
of October when they authorized the
President to use force I said Iraq is a
threat to the security of the United
by now about half the population maybe
more by now believes that Iraq was
responsible for September 11th that
Iraqis were on the planes that they're
planning new ones these attitudes are
closely correlated to support for war
and it makes sense I mean if you believe
that Iraq is an imminent threat to our
security and was responsible for the
September 11th the trois ities and is
planning new ones then it makes sense to
say okay let's go were stopped now there
is no one else in the world that
believes that is
