well first off thank you so much for
conducting this interview and for your
many years of continued activism
solidarity over the past few years
there's been a reevaluation of violent
revolutionary practices by some
intellectuals on the left what is your
position on the role of violence in this
case subjective violence as opposed to
symbolic or objective violence in
movements of liberation well first of
all not familiar with the revival and I
don't know exactly what's being
advocated but is what being advocated
that we pick up our guns and overthrow
the government well basically some some
some theorists have said that we should
really look at the ethical implications
of violence through the lens of for
example the terror in France and thats
it was justified what was done not
during that time period if it was done
maybe it was not done but it was done by
a government after the government was
established and it carried out a terror
campaign basically against adversaries
is that situation we were in some would
say we are in you know dangerous times
will maybe in dangerous times but are
you and I part of a revolutionary
government that controls the armed
forces and is confronted with
oppositionists who we're trying to
eliminate we're not in that position of
course okay so then that analogy is
irrelevant okay so what is relevant the
question would be is is violent
practices justify for us to overthrow a
government associate again should we
take our gun Darren take our van go out
in the street and start destroying chase
manhattan bank and well if you want to
get killed in five minutes that's a good
suggestion hmm other than that has
actually nothing to do with the world so
there's not even any point
I'm I think it's a crazy idea of mice
right and but quite apart from that it's
like asking should we climb on an
asteroid and attack the earth okay maybe
a good idea but why talk about it so you
think this sort of like 20th century
revolutionary movements it's not just
20th century I mean it's a very rare
occasions when you can raise the
question right we're not anywhere near
those occasions right if you want to
raise the question about some abstract
in some philosophy seminar okay and
discuss it so we can discuss our their
circumstances in which it might be
justified to take up arms to overthrow a
repressive government yes sure for
example I was in favor of the
conspirators who tried to kill Hitler I
think that was good thing to do I was in
favor of the partisans who were
resisting the Nazis I think he give many
cases in which resistance to oppression
and terror and violence is justified I'm
not a pure pacifist so I can imagine
however I think it takes it cars a very
heavy burden of proof I mean the burden
of proof is always on those who choose
violence sometimes the burden can be met
in my opinion but it's a heavy heavy
burden and as I say now we're in a
philosophy seminar that did unrelated to
the real world right okay but if we're
talking about the real world which is
what I happen to care about I don't see
much point discussing it so I don't know
what the revival is that you're talking
about right there's in conjunction
there's just been a renewed interest for
example in the Jacobin legacy there's
been a lot of new writings on
reevaluating the terror in defense of
the terror justifying the terror
justifying Robespierre and his vision of
a new friends a revolutionary
it's a sort of secular friends that was
cut from what had happened previously in
history and so this is something of
course that is promulgated by some in
the left who have still connections with
maybe 20th century communist experiments
this sort of Leninist Vanguard ism that
came about and and what do you think is
is the is the legacy that we still face
in the left of for example jacoub anism
leninism these sort of things they're
quite different first of all in the case
of Jack organism we could discuss it but
that's now we're back in philosophy
seminar an interesting one at this time
unlike the other one which was not
interesting so there's an interesting
question as to what should have been
what were the property proper actions to
have been taken in revolutionary France
I don't happen to agree with Rob spheres
methods at all but we could discuss it
interesting historical discussion let's
move to leninism a totally unrelated and
no relation whatsoever Leninism was in
my view counter-revolutionary it wasn't
instituting communism there was a
popular revolution in fact there had
been for years that in through the 1970
and it grew very substantially from
februari on Lenin basically tried to
take control of it he take a look at his
writings in 1917 they went wave the left
April theses statement revolution the
most radical things he ever wrote almost
an artist and my view and is it was
basically opportunism I think you
believe
the word seems he was trying to
associate him to come the leader of the
revolutionary popular forces and we
became the leader he didn't waste much
time and Trotsky helped him in
instituting a pretty repressive regime
with not wasn't stolen but the basic
elements of stalinism they moved pretty
quickly to dismantle most of the organs
of popular power not overnight but over
not very long time they were able to
basically dismantle the soviets the
factory councils to convert the labor of
course the peasant revolutionary forces
they were very much opposed to this
incidentally as distinct from marks
marks saw revolutionary potential in the
russian peasantry the urban communists
like Lenin were strongly opposed to that
in fact a lot of Marx's latest later
work was even suppressed because they'd
like what he was saying but it wasn't
marks but they had contempt for the
backward peasants their conception was
the rush is a backward peasant society
it has to be driven to industrialization
and then out of that you know the iron
laws of history will lead to socialism
and so on but sometime in the future in
fact they regarded rushes back were they
were essentially waiting for a
revolution in Germany the most advanced
capitalist country that's where there
should be a revolution when the
revolution was crushed in Germany in
1919 by that time Russia had been pretty
much turned into the kind of labor army
that Lenin and Trotsky were advocating
not totally but mostly foreign stuff
kind of finished at all but when the
German revolutions
they realize that's not going to work so
we have to do something else to drive
Russia towards industrialization and
shortly after that comes the new
economic policy which is essentially
let's introduce state capitalism but
with an iron fist because we're going to
drive them forward and this is a Lenin's
Vanguard ism it was shortly criticized
back in the early years the 20th century
by Marxists in fact he's laid some of
his later associates and although some
of the critics liked Rosa Luxemburg
pointed out that Lenin's programs they
regard as pre right wing and I do too
was the image was that the via
proletarian revolution the party will
take over from the proletariat the
Central Committee will take over from
the party and the maximal leader will
take over from the Central Committee
yeah pretty much what happened but not
precisely but that's roughly what
happened and after that use of terror to
defend the repressive violent state has
nothing to do with communism in fact
santisi I think this is one of the great
blows the socialism at 20th century was
the ultimate revolution I mean it called
itself socialist and the West call that
socialist in fact that's one thing on
which the world's two major propaganda
systems agreed the huge propaganda
system in the west and the minor
propaganda system and these one of the
few things in which they agreed was that
this was socialism the West propaganda
system liked that because the way of
defaming socialism right relating it to
the what's going on in Russia and the
east vil feed the Russian propaganda
system liked it because they're trying
to profit from the moral or of socialism
which
great real so they kind of both agreed
on that and you know when the world's
major propaganda systems agree on
something it's kind of hard for people
to extricate themselves from it so by
now it's a routine that that was
socialism well that had was very handy
socialist I remember when what late 80s
when pre-clear the system was tottering
I was asked by a left journal I won't
mention it to write an article on what I
thought was going to happen when the
system collapses and I read an article
in which i say this i think it'll be a
small victory for socialism if the
system collapses they refused to publish
it i finally was published in an
anarchist magazine so it appeared but
because they couldn't understand that in
fact i ripped some of the same things in
journals here like the nation and they
published it but nothing anybody
understood it because this was socialism
you know how could you say this is
anti-socialist well it might be
something like unique and the left
Marxist said the same view people like
not gonna cook or course others who you
know they got to marginalized and
eliminate it because that's what happens
to people who don't have guns but i
think they were right the people who
lennon condemned as the ultra left the
infantile ultra leftist and they're
basically right not in everything but
that has where a lot of the anarchist
critics and early on bertrand russell so
it pretty well early on but you know x
1920 was unmistakable even earlier
earlier I'm not wasn't alive that when i
was at 12 years old pretty obvious to me
do you think that within the coordinates
of the entire Marxist tradition there
will always be this danger of going
towards that edge yeah I don't regard
Lenin as part of the marks of condition
frankly what the Marxist tradition is or
who knows nothing right but it certainly
wasn't Marxist position I mentioned his
belief as the in the revolutionary
potential of the Russian peasantry
certainly is a hint of that and Lenin
and after him Marx had a lot of
different views right for example he
thought that might be possible to reach
socialism by parliamentary means in the
work where's what democratic societies
England was his model of course didn't
rule it out and in fact he marks didn't
have very much to say about socialism or
communism it take a look at Marxist
works very deep analytic critique of
variety of capitalism capitals markets
properties imperialism and so on but
about the future society a couple of
scattered sentences and I think you know
just my guess is for good reasons his
picture was that as I understand that
that when working people liberate
themselves and can make their own
decisions they'll determine what kind of
a society will be it's not going he's
not going to dictate it to them
pretty water and frankly do you think
that the the newer forms of say
authoritarian capitalism where
authoritarian communism existed once so
for example in China or maybe in
Singapore where it was a massive move
against the left and instituted this
sort of state capitalism but very
regimented do you think that that's the
new danger that we face it's a teenager
and there are many dangers like that I
think it's pretty rotten system frankly
and it does keep the streets clean and
you know people get a good technical
education and so I'm very repressive but
I don't think it's admirable society by
any means there was a recent article in
January 2013 by Alan Johnson writing for
The Telegraph and he accused some of the
leftist specifically Dziedzic of being
left fascists of promulgating this view
of totalitarianism and violence as
justified within the left tradition and
something that we should reclaim in the
21st century and how does this
fascination with violence terror and
hegemony stem from the radical left
tradition do you think that it's a part
of it or do you think that it's sort of
this offshoot the radical ester there's
a lot of radical left traditions but the
ones that made any sense my view we're
not committed to violence except in
self-defense so if you manage to carry
forward significant changes and
progressive changes maybe Radek maybe
institutional changes and you start the
function and there's an attack on them
by former centers of power by outside
powers and so on and Avengers of
I think that's as i said i'm not up your
bass pissed i don't think you should
stop defending yourself when you're
under attack but it but under very
special circumstances the idea of
overthrowing existing forces by violence
is a very questionable 14 pretty good
reasons I think I mean any Syria about
revolution you know it's easy to talk
about but if you want a revolution
meaning is significant change in
institutions that's going to be a keris
forward rather than backwards then it
has to meet a couple of conditions one
condition is it has to have dedicated
support by a large majority of the
population people who have come to
realize that the just goals that they're
trying to attain cannot be attained
within the existing institutional
structure because they'll be beaten back
by force and if a lot of people come to
that realization then they might say
well go beyond the what's called reform
is an effort that introduce changes
within the institutions that exist at
that point the questions at least arise
the we're so remote from that point that
I didn't see any point speculate about
and we may never get there maybe Marx is
read that within parliamentary
democracies you can use the
institution's themselves to go to a
sharp institutional change affecting the
some evidence for that so for example
even in the United in the United States
there are the beginnings of germs of
what would be my view a real socialist
or communist society like work around
enterprises the beginnings of industrial
democracy you know popular democracy in
all institutions how far can it go
if it keeps going if it does keep going
and there is violent resistance to it
then you could raise the question of
using violence to defend it but if it
keeps going it doesn't mean we're
resistance will just continue it very
good going off of that there is this
sort of accusations I know since I'm a
student as well there's a accusation
from some intellectuals of students
today in higher education that they're
not radical enough or that they focus on
single issues like LGBT rights or
climate change instead of focusing on
radical transformation of social and
economic systems in their in their
totality what do you think the role of a
student and a university is in
revolutionary movements today to be
first of all to understand I must
understand what you're talking about
then if your ideas are clarified enough
to try to work to carry them forward so
let's take these examples so it takes a
climate change I don't think you can
discuss climate change for very long
without reaching a very radical
interpretation of the nature of existing
institutions and why they have to be
changed there are built-in features of
our existing institutions which are
leading us towards disaster with regard
to the climate built-in in fine
discussion of this and marks if you like
and so on but it's just part of market
systems we don't really have market
systems that's mostly fraud but we have
partial market systems and to the extent
that you have a marsh a market system
inherent problems of markets do enter
into operation you can read about them
in economics texts as a footnote that
talks about market inefficiencies so
what are the market inefficiencies
a lot of them that one of them which is
not talked about much is that markets
direct your choices in particular areas
like say I can choose to buy a Toyota or
Chevrolet but I can't choose in a market
system to get a subway system that's a
collective action markets isn't don't
allow that so it has an enormous
distorting effect on the set of choices
that are available let's not discuss
this inefficiency but there are plain
and efficiencies even for the point of
markets externalities virtually so for
example if you and I make a transaction
will make sure that we make out okay
we're not considering the effects on
that guy over there that doesn't enter
into market transactions and those
effects can be very substantial in fact
we're right in the middle of one right
now the financial crisis when big
institutions like Goldman Sachs and
whatever when they make some risky
transaction whatever it is if they're
paying attention they'll try to cover
their own potential losses but they
don't pay attention to what's called
systemic risk the possibility that their
failed transaction that might bring down
the system and in fact they really don't
have to worry much about that because we
don't have a market system so therefore
they can run cap in hand to the nanny
state and say bail me out then that's
what happens but if it was a market
system that's it would lead to a total
collapse this way it leads to massive
financial disaster and then the natick
state comes in and bails you out up to a
point with that those are externalities
that's a much more serious one if
say the business world say energy
corporations or for that matter both
political parties who work for the
corporate sector patient if they decide
as they are doing that we should extract
every drop of oil every of every bit of
hydrocarbons from underground including
tar sands and everything else they have
you know they're very excited about our
euphoric you can read it my newspapers
every day David Brooks this morning both
parties this will be wonderful little it
will save us from subservience to Middle
East oil dictators and Venezuela for
which there isn't one particle of
evidence but the Palestine and will be
self-sufficient for energy independence
for a century but Manuel this is slight
externality will destroy the world okay
but that's you don't pay attention to
that in a quasi market system that's not
part of the transaction the transaction
is let's make as much money as we can
tomorrow and for governments let's have
it as much power as we can't but not
well okay our grandchildren won't have a
world to live in that's an externality
it's not part of the system that's right
here you can't run to anybody cap in
hand to bail you out so that's what are
the song stayin here until the
institution's we have and you can see it
happening so if you look at its kind of
striking when you look at the world
today there's if there's ever a future
historian they're gonna be amazed what
they see in the early 21st century I
mean there are a variety of reactions to
very likely climate environmental
disaster it is very likely in fact
not very far away for us and there are a
variety of reactions there some that are
trying to do something about it so in
the lead trying to do something about it
are the pre-industrial societies the
indigenous societies the tribal
societies you know first nations in
Canada or indigenous people in Ecuador
Bolivia and so on Australia you know all
over there in the lead they want to do
something about it they are so for
example and say Ecuador which is an oil
producer the government is trying to get
some support for leaving their oil in
the ground which is where it ought to be
so that's the indigenous societies then
you look to the richest the most
powerful societies and history and
comparable advantages peak of Western
civilization they're trying to race the
disaster as fast as possible so you know
this silly Indians want to leave their
oil in the ground we want to get it out
as fast as possible so we can wreck the
environment for our grandchildren that's
the world we live in now you can't go
very far talking about climate change
without running into fundamental
features of our basic institutions so I
don't think this dichotomy means much
and that's ruin every other issue you
look at to Matthew very quickly run into
institutional factors that are deeply
rooted in the nature of the society so
you go quite quickly to it what's called
a radical critique it's doesn't mean do
the violence in society right so do you
think that for students today and in our
universities is actually in a society
like that we live in today say in the
United States it's important to focus on
a single issues because they in
themselves contain a critique of the
system it's important to begin with the
issues that interest and concern you
that's just for any I'm standings
but if you just look at those issues
you're quickly going to get into deeper
ones and I think you have to think about
the whole range I mean nobody can be an
activist work not everything you know
that's impossible so if you really want
to do something you're going to focus
after whatever they turn out to be but
as soon as you do flip because if you
think about it you're going to find that
you're facing fundamental questions
about the nature of the social and
economic institutions in which we live
in the political ones and then you're
going to link up with other people who
are working on their issue and if
they'll run into the same problems so I
just don't see a confrontation this is
for activism bleeds very good and so
many of our asking in the wake of the
Occupy movement how are we to rebuild
the left in America today if it's even
possible to have some sort of change and
I'd like to ask what your vision is for
a renewed left in America today first
was a lot of activism at a lot of
concern on all kinds of issues and
probably more than the sixties but it's
pretty scattered it's a very atomized
society xolo their actions are scattered
I mean right here in Boston for example
it's very striking of talks and around
different parts of the city there at
places where they're doing the same
thing as in some other part of the city
but they don't know that each other it's
it's amazing I mean I found it myself
you know been involved if your activism
in years and years and long ago I was
invited to give a talk and downtown
Boston by group I never heard of her
doing fantastic things I never heard of
it in a Christmas I'm street downtown
was another one
where else this is a lot happening it's
got to move together it's got to find
common ground the Occupy movement i
think has been very successful very
brief in a very brief period well months
after all it changed the discourse in
the country changed a lot of the
perceptions of mentality brought a lot
of people together it's country through
its claim that's active in functioning
doing a lot of important things like
actions on foreclosures and even hit the
news recently with being the first on
the scene after the hurricane sandy and
many things going on and that's always
good and I mentioned before that there
are other things happening like Sadie a
development of work around enterprises
that's could be happening right here
there if there were an active movement
it could be involved in similar
initiatives which begin to take off but
often are aborted because they don't
have enough popular support should give
you some real cases of a good time and
reaching out into one of the very good
initiatives of the Occupy movement was
the occupy the hood spin-offs I don't
know how far they got actually farther
than people think I believe I didn't
think they got very far but i have met
groups activist groups working in the so
called ghettoes in the slums who were
spin-offs of this and are still working
and doing interesting things in fact
growing so i think they're probably out
there you know we don't hear a lot of
course the media obviously aren't going
to cover it but we also don't use our
own options it's quite striking that you
take a look at the left last 40 years
one of the very sharp prison has had is
of the media they don't do the things we
ought to be doing that's true
corporate media but there are offered
opportunities always have been so when
congress passed the law for you four
years ago I guess this riveting rights
to cable television there was a
component of the law which required the
private companies that got the monopoly
which is very profitable to require them
to put up public data cable facilities
and they did it so in Cambridge and I've
been pounds all over the place there are
public cable facilities I've been on
them occasionally there it's not CBS but
don't buy standards of most countries
it's unbelievably good do we use them
almost never almost nothing's know
there's some things but like the king
you can reach an awful lot of people
that way if you do something about it
but you have to do it no and Boston
again is an interesting City and there's
a lot of activism but it's one of the
cities that Bishop has no public no has
no community radio small things you're
there but you know other lot of other
communities of community radio that when
you travel around the country and you
see you see that in places where there
is a community alive community radio
station with a lot of public
participation and so on people know what
other people are doing it's a way of
bringing people together and if you
don't have it it's scattered but you
know those are not in Super Bowl
barriers a lot of things that can be
done and I think how do that can grow
whatever movement will go out
that's what the participants decided to
commit themselves to very good my last
question you know that I don't keep you
slim was she checked in an interview to
the new statement in 2009 said about you
my friend told me Chomsky said something
very sad he said that today we don't
need theory all we need to do is tell
people empirically what is going on here
I violently disagree facts are facts and
they are precious but they can work in
this way or that facts alone are not
enough you have to change the
ideological background I'm sorry I'm an
old-fashioned continental European
theory is sacred and we need it more
than ever how would you respond to this
claim you have a sensible I'm is first
of all I quite agree that just spewing
out facts means nothing and in our
discussion here we haven't just been
spewing out facts it's within a
framework to the frame understandings
and principles and so on in the European
intellectual is he's talking about half
a concept of theory which in my view is
totally devoted almost radically
divorced from facts and radically
divorced from theory it's mostly big
complicated words that may be fun for
intellectuals to throw around to each
other but most of it i think it's juror
theta the honest truth it's not carry in
any sense that i understand and i've
been involved most of my life in the
sciences were their theories and so on
so I sure if you can find a theory that
has some real principles and which are
some interest and you can draw
conclusions from them which you can
apply to interpreting the actual world
around sure it's wonderful but and if
there are such theories you know happy
to see them
I don't find them when i read the paris
postmodernist talk what I see is
intellectuals kind of interacting with
one another in ways which are
incomprehensible the publican to be
frank incomprehensible to me so sure
let's have theories that have some
intellectual content some consequences
can be refined change Lee just a better
understanding it's fine all right good
thank you so much I really appreciate
