hello and welcome to the origins podcast
I'm Lawrence Krauss what's left to say
about Noam Chomsky he's known throughout
the world as perhaps the most important
living public intellectual and his
writing has been cited more than almost
any author in their arts and humanities
over recent decades and he's literally
the father of modern linguistics Noam
served as a role model for me since I
took a class from him in u.s. foreign
policy while doing my PhD in physics at
MIT and I watched him speak throughout
Cambridge with generosity and
intelligence we did a dialogue on stage
three years ago for the origins project
and we discussed a host of things from
language and consciousness to politics
that was before Donald Trump and brexit
and all that however and I was happy to
have the opportunity to update our
dialogue as always he was incisive
informative provocative and brilliant as
well as providing a unique treatment of
issues when simply does not hear
discussed in the US media making it
incredibly important to hear from him

gnome it's great to have you back here
we you and I had one of my favorite
conversations before the public I think
three years ago now it's three years I
think it seems hard to believe but I it
by knowing that it was before Trump was
elected so I because it seems that's
what's amazing in three short years it
seems like so much has happened in
something we BT and B 1880 that's right
exactly and it but that's not just all
trumpet I mean all the things happen is
that what's happening North Korea and
Syria and Israel and Venezuela Brazil
all over it's just amazing that what
seems to have happened in those four
years and even in our own countries
there's there's free speech debates
there's all sorts of things and I want
to want to talk about some of that but
at the same time the more things change
the more they remain the same so there's
all sorts of new issues but but the
underlying causes and impact may not be
so different I wanted to in you know
what I was thinking about that I I was
looking at what we said to each other
and then I was reminded of a book I had
been reading recently which is an old
book for nineteen sixties by Richard
Hofstadter called anti-intellectualism
in America and and it was interesting
for me to read that because it was
written in response to McCarthyism was
written in 1961 or so and I thought I'd
begin to put this in context in a quote
at the beginning of that book from 1961
where he quoted Emerson who wrote let us
honestly state the facts our America has
a bad name for superficial miss great
men great nations have not been bolsters
and buffoons
but perceivers of the terror of life and
of man themselves to face it so I
thought I'd ask you to comment on that
on that and then and then we can move
into recent politics well Emerson was a
very interesting thinker but in many
respects he unfortunately illustrated
the things that he's criticizing I agree
so take for example that
something not irrelevant today his
attitude toward the Civil War at the
very beginning was a pacifist in fact he
was in a sense in favor of the war he
thought it would break down the states
it would break down state power so maybe
would be beneficial after the Battle of
Bull Run he became a enthusiastic super
Patriot very much the way intellectuals
do all the time as soon as the conflict
begins
we're enthusiast for our own side in
fact if you look back at the
transcendentalist his group some of the
most distinguished intellectuals in the
United States certainly may be anywhere
one didn't go along with the tide
Nathaniel Hawthorne and he was kind of
excluded fact is a very interesting
article you might want to read if you
haven't in the Atlantic Monthly
Hawthorne towards the end of the war
about 1964 1864 1864 decided to just
travel through the south to see but then
the outcome of the war was reasonably
clear and he wrote an article which was
supportive of the north you know but
skeptical for example he interviewed
prison southern prisoners of war in a
fairly sympathetic way he said look
these are just rural farmers and they're
not war criminals they were brought up
to defend their homes and so on we
should treat them decently anyway the
interesting thing about the article is
not only his commentary which is
interesting but the interpolations the
editors agreed to have it published but
only if they were allowed and this is a
liver of the liberal intellectual
Journal yeah if they were allowed to
interpolate comments criticizing what he
wrote along the way so there you have
Hawthorne's moderately sympathetic view
to people who are too
and suffering and the liberal
intellectuals interpolating so no you
have to be a super Patriot you can't say
these things
it's very instructive about intellectual
history in many ways in fact if you look
at the history of intellectuals it works
very much like this so shortly after
this period came the Dreyfus trial which
actually is the first time that the word
intellectual starts being used in its
modern sense and it's very interesting
that we today we honor the Dreyfus ords
Emal's old ancestor not then they were
bitterly attacked by the Immortals of
the Academie Francaise how dare you mere
writers and artists criticize our ground
institutions you know the state so on
fast for a Zola actually had to flee the
country
yeah sure let's go forward to not long
before we met late 60s 66 67 roughly
then McGeorge Bundy a former Harvard
Dean of leading at electoral national
security advisor for Kennedy and Johnson
had an article in foreign affairs the
main establishment journal in which he
said he discussed the criticism of the
Vietnam War he said yes there are
legitimate criticisms about the tactics
and so on and then there are what he
called the wild men in the wings
people like hofferman Zola who are not
only criticizing the tactics but are
raising questions about our motives I
assume you were one of the wildman' in
the wings absolutely very far and this
is a theme that runs through basically
all of history
you go back to classical Greece who
drank the hemlock the guy who was
corrupting the youth of Athens by asking
too many questions yeah right up to the
present its and so it's interesting to
raise the question of Emerson it was
very distinguished
honorable figure but not immune well no
III liked that coat because of the many
sided aspects of it because of his
background and also this notion of
course great nations have not been
bolsters and buffoons which serve
resonates in some ways in the current
times but this and this idea of whether
anti-intellectualism it has been
prevalent and to what extent it's good
or bad it's a good question and yet for
example Li there are several kinds of
intellectuals there's the wild men in
the wings and there are the what are
sometimes called the stenographers of
power yeah and one has to make up one's
own mind but I think you can certainly
have different attitudes towards them
well you know I and we were talking
about lunch that I learned from you when
the first time we met when it was when I
was sitting in a course in American
foreign policy when I was a student at
MIT a shocking fact which to me just
surprised me because I'd always kind of
revered academia and I've it's been a
part of my life ever since but the
realization that in some ways during the
Vietnam War the last group to accept the
immorality of that war was were the
academics which which I always thought
maybe because I knew a vet you but I'd
always thought somehow the academics
were leading it but it was the students
it was the public maybe you can go into
a little bit well I would broaden it
beyond academics to the general
intellectual community with some
exceptions there always or the journals
all those and Nathanial often they know
Chomsky's another flip to a by and large
it's true in fact you get a kind of a
vivid picture of it but first of all
remember that opposition to the war was
very late in coming the the war actually
started in the early 50s by 1960 maybe
60 or 70,000 people had been killed in
South Vietnam just by repressed the
repressive government we were supporting
a Kennedy escalated the war in 1961 and
62 authorized the US Air Force to start
rural South Vietnam under South
Vietnamese markings but nobody was
fooled authorized a pom began and this
was very serious chemical warfare to
destroy crops and livestock to try to
drive the rural population into
concentrated areas would called
strategic Hamlet's where they were being
protected against the guerrillas who the
US government knew very well they were
supporting we know this from internal
documents that have been released was no
protest none then in fact just to give
you an example when 1965 I guess I would
a four six 64 65 I happen to be spending
a year at Harvard as a visiting fellow
on cognitive science senator 19 February
1965 the war against South Vietnam had
already half destroyed the country but
the u.s. escalated the war to the north
and the individual who was primarily
responsible for this was McGeorge Bundy
nationals you recall evidently coolants
yeah a couple of students Bundy it was
being invited had been invited to be the
commencement speaker at the June
commencement for Harvard and a couple of
students initiated a very mild petition
asking whether it's right to invite
someone who's just launched the war
against another country without
provocation since I was there they asked
me to see if I could get some faculty
signatures virtually impossible that was
1965 by that time the war was already
far advanced in fact in October 1965
there was an international day of
protest you were probably in elementary
school at the time yeah we're still in
elementary school and in Canada that was
automated but it wasn't International
Day of yet it's interesting because you
know it's a 60 so this was 65
yeah cuz one thinks of the protest is
being later of course but already and
maybe the American media maybe you're
gonna get well with what happened is
interesting I'm talking about Boston
yeah the most liberal city in the
country yeah we decided to try to have a
demonstration in Boston to join the
international demonstration yeah we went
to the Boston Common you know that
chartered place ever I was supposed to
be one of the speakers totally broken up
by counter-demonstrators mostly students
incidentally interests coming to smash
up this demonstration of the Boston
Globe may be the most liberal paper in
the country you look at the front page
the next day was denouncing the
demonstrators how dare you very much
like the Immortals of the Academy Hall
says how dare you attack our noble
institutions and so on this is October
1965 by then there was another
international day of protest in May in
March I think 1966 that we decided we
can't have a public meeting we'll have a
meeting in the church or on gin Street
Church Church was attacked at that time
Vietnam had literally almost been
destroyed at that just given a Bernard
fall who was the most respected military
historian Vietnam expert that no dove
incidentally but cared about the
Vietnamese he wrote at that time that he
doubted that Vietnam would survive as a
cultural and historical entity under the
most serious attack that had ever been
launched against an area that size were
words roughly like that I think that was
at the point when we in liberal city of
Boston we couldn't have a demonstration
in a church without it being attacked
well after that finally a an opposition
movement developed mostly young people
students and so on but let's fast
forward up to 1975 when the war ended
it says the war formally ended of course
everyone had to write about it yeah yeah
what what did it mean and you look
across the spectrum of public opinion
expressions public media major media and
they kind of break up into the Hawks and
the doves so roughly the Hawks saying we
were stabbed in the back we didn't fight
hard enough if he'd fought harder we
could have won yeah so on the doves are
always much more interesting
they set the kind of limits of possible
thought yeah this far but not on a
limiter probably so you go way to the
end say Anthony Lewis New York Times
strong critic of the war yeah absolutely
Marion a very interesting article he
said the war begun he said with
blundering efforts to do good blundering
because it didn't work to do good
because that's a tautology yeah you
don't give arguments for that that's
kind of like saying two plus two equals
four yeah there he's another wild man in
the wings yeah they said by 1969 it was
clear that it was a disaster we could
not bring democracy to Vietnam at a cost
acceptable to ourselves so it was really
a terrible mistake now up to the present
about as far as you can go to the
critical side is to say it was a mistake
very interestingly at that point
public opinion was being carefully
sampled the Chicago Council on Foreign
Relations does extensive Studies of
public opinion very scholarly there
1965-66 roughly then their report also
of course asked questions what would you
think about the Vietnam War and the
answers are interesting about 70% of the
population said it was not a mistake it
was fundamentally wrong and immoral now
that question kept being asked for
another 15 years or so up to about
roughly 1990 the answers were all
approximately the same they stopped
asking it after a while yeah the last
time they asked at the distinguished
Social Sciences serious social scientist
who was in charge of the surveys John
really asked the question and comments
of what do people mean when they say
this and he said well what they mean is
too many American lives were being lost
well that's possible yeah would have
been possible to find out yeah ask
another question exactly but the other
possible answer namely they meant what
they were saying it's just totally
discounted it's you know this is the
history of intellectuals well you know
okay well and we'll come back to that
cuz I want to circle around to that
eventually in a different context but
let lets and one of the reasons I was
happy to start with historical
perspective is of course it's always
it's always good to to look at the
present in that context I was just
reading a when is now one of my favorite
quotes of Mark Twain who said that
history may not repeat itself but it
sure rhymes a lot and I want to talk
about the in that context what's
happening around the world both what's
really happening and the perceptions of
what's really happening from
domestically to foreign we I mean we
could talk for hours about that but
we'll see if we can limit this okay but
let's pick let's pick what's going on um
you pick your favorite we could start
with you know Venezuela we could start
with North Korea we could start with
Israel or Trump I want to I want to sort
of sort of go through these and see what
what what we're hearing and and and
what's really there because this notion
of American exceptionalism which just
seems to be so prevalent part of it is
the notion which which again brings me
back to when I when I first met you to
this notion that somehow the United
States is different because we always
want to do good other countries have
been imperial powers but their
intentions were not to do good and I
remember us saying at the time that if
you asked a five-year-old is it likely
that America's foreign policy is
governed by anything different than
anyone else throughout all of history
they'd say it's unlikely but somehow the
perception is that intentionality is
that the United States really is
altruistic and there and it's
interventions around the world which may
hadn't had bad consequences were really
well intended but they were misplaced
and I and I kind of still get I still
kind of see that and in the
interpretation of much much of what's
going on so well blundering efforts to
do good yeah yeah and notice that the
five-year-old who you invented yeah read
with seventy percent of the population
at the end of the Vietnam War so so
let's take today's newspaper yeah okay
there's a article by David Sanger in our
York Times the leading one of the
leading security analysts yeah which is
an article about how to deal with the
Russian aggression the new new forms of
Russian aggression and intervention and
there's some interesting lines in it so
for example this sentence not just
somewhere in the middle nothing special
saying it's about time for these quoting
somebody correct positively is saying
it's time for NATO to enhance its
defensive capacities at the Russian
border does that strike anyone is funny
I mean is the Warsaw Pact enhancing its
defensive actions at the Mexico border
yeah yeah well no we're exceptional if
we happen to have forces at the Russian
border that's because its defensive if
we have ABM installations at the Russian
border which do actually have to use
capacity course and article in the
bullet and the atomic scientists the
lead article by Theodore Postal recent
pointing that oh yeah I know even if
their defensive that's a first strike
weapon of course it's one of the
concerns yes both of those are fine it's
not in concern we have them there as
President Obama said in order to protect
Europe from irani and missiles which
don't exist exactly that always amazed
me about this notion that we were
protecting Europe from missiles zone
exist which it just so happens that it's
offensive yes you had the Russian border
at the Russian border that it so happens
that they're pointing at the
potentially at yeah exactly if I were
but you won't see a comment about this
I'm sure because it's it's kind of
common sense sir and then well I mean
you know the first when you say that of
course one thinks about whether was
whether maybe putting missiles in Cuba
might have been defensive well in fact
it was we there's very good scholarship
on this but no and it's pretty well
agreed by mainstream scholarship what
the reasons were for her stuff to make
this very reckless move there were
basically two one was just what you said
the United States was carrying out a
major terrorist war against Cuba a very
serious terrorist and if the Russians
may not have known the details but they
certainly roughly news going on
certainly Cuba did in August 1962
Kennedy issued a national security
memorandum which called on the terrorist
operations operation Mongoose to be
enhanced leading to an effort to create
an insurrection in Cuba which would lead
the US intervention in October 1962 well
that's when the missiles went in I don't
think Castro and Khrushchev read the
internal like you could see what was
happening on the ground that's one
reason there was another in the first
Jeff when he took took office recognized
something pretty obvious that the Russia
could not compete economically yeah the
United States United States for more
advanced yeah in fact Western Europe
alone counterbalanced rush easily yeah
let alone the United States and Canada
so what he urged was a reduction a
mutual reduction in offensive weapons in
order to allow Russia to move towards
economic development the Kennedy
administration considered this rejected
it
and instead though they knew they were
way ahead militarily launched the
biggest arms buildup in history that was
a very big thing
shortly after this one of the reasons
for four chefs placing the missiles in
Cuba was to try to somehow minimally
balance this notice incidentally that
there was a crucial issue that almost
led to nuclear war the United States had
was surrounding Russia with missiles
with nuclear weapons of course that's
like our defensive behavior of the
Russian border yeah including missiles
and Turkey
Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Kennedy
actually didn't know about this he made
some comment atomic Bundy saying it
would it's as if we had missiles in
Turkey and Bundy said we'll mr.
president turned out they were obsolete
missiles a withdrawal order was already
in process because they were being
replaced by essentially invulnerable
Polaris submarines there's a much more
lethal and vulnerable so they were being
replaced they're obsolete her chef put
missiles in Cuba to sort of try to know
her nearer balance yet to compensate
slightly for the overwhelming US
advantage and its refusal to not only
refusal to go along with his offer to
reduce missiles but weapons but even
enhancing them through the crisis as you
recall this issue of the missiles and
turkey became critical yeah October 27th
peak moment of the crisis first chef
actually wrote a letter to Kennedy
saying let's get out of this before we
blow the world we'll remove the missiles
from Cuba you remove the missiles from
Turkey we'll do it publicly and it'll
all be over at that time Kennedy's
subjective estimate of the probability
of nuclear war was reported to be about
a half third
to have you know utterly outlandish yeah
he refused this is considered his and
then for chef basically back down yeah
so they made a kind of a secret
agreement but nothing public yeah we a
secretive here the meaning is we have a
right to keep in on the Russian border
obsolete missiles which we're replacing
by even more lethal ones but they don't
have a right to have anything anywhere
near us it's very similar today so we
have the right to enhance our defensive
capabilities on the Russian border which
are already enormous but if the Russians
dare to send anything to Venezuela we're
going to blow the world up history
rhymes exactly it's it's useful to think
about it yeah we'll get in fact I was
it's a nice segue I'm glad you cuz I was
gonna go to Venezuela but at the same
time it's also worth mentioning that in
terms that the United States also was
very by that point it it it I think it
it it had subsided but the United States
especially during the period of extreme
military superiority were very seriously
considered for strikes as in order to
never renounce truce yeah we've never
renounced forest rights most people
don't realize that we still have that
we've never said we won't strike first
but what we've but at the time there
were serious discussions of a real first
strike in order to before Russia or the
Soviet then Soviet Union was able to
catch up and all these it then
Ellsberg's book which I'm sure well
that's later on my list yeah yeah in
fact I read it because use I want to
come back to that so we'll come back so
I think you made the perfect segue
because I wanted to hit Venezuela in
this concept I mean here we are doing
trying to quote-unquote at least if you
read the papers do good in Venezuela
where end and whether it's blundering or
not so so I would like to hear your
perspective of our of our doing goodness
in Venezuela well what we're doing in
Venezuela is imposing extraordinarily
harsh sanctions which are cutting off
virtually the entire ring
the country and strangling the
population the populations opposed to
the sanctions of the leading economist
of the opposition and serious economist
Francisco Rodriguez one of the most
serious commentators on this he's
opposed to the sanctions he says they're
turning a serious problem into an utter
catastrophe of what we keep doing it
because we're trying to do good we want
to put into power our own guy quite oh
nothing much is known about him except
that he's a strong supporter of the
neo-fascist bolson ro who was just
installed next door Rosella yeah so
they're all kind of criticism of the
Maduro government which are quite
legitimate yeah I was gonna say why
should criticize I mean that government
is nothing it's very repressive it's
carrying out horrible economic policies
a lot wrong with it but why do we have
the right to impose the government of
our choice by strangling the population
into submission well there's nothing new
that I mean we try that so we try and do
it around right I mean I'm doing the
same thing in Iran I mean the idea is
the POW who's getting hurt by by
sanctions in Iran well the population
but what again what right do we have to
do that in fact you guys the same
question about China it's taken for
granted across the board I can't find an
exception that it's legitimate for the
United States and Europe in fact mostly
the United States to try to impede
China's economic development oh they're
moving forward they're trying to move
forward with a particular form of
economic development say we don't like
the way they're doing it so we'll try to
block their an economic development is
that legitimate in fact there are other
questions the sticking point in the
negotiations right now according to
Trump as intellectual property rights
they are not observing intellectual
property rights what that means is
exorbitant patent restrictions radically
opposed to free trade that built into
the World Trade Organization system to
protect us corporations so we want Bill
Gates to be the richest man in the world
so therefore there's a essentially
monopoly for Windows a pharmaceutical
prices have to go out of sight so
therefore this huge patent restrictions
on for pharmaceuticals suppose China
decided not to observe them who suffers
well Bill Gates will have a little less
money users of computers will be able to
find better programs and windows
pharmaceutical corporations instead of
having you know trillions of dollars
will only have a few trillions people
will be able to buy cheaper drugs
I mean it's argued that this would cut
back innovation but if you look into it
that's not the way innovation takes
place takes a Windows I mean I don't
have to tell you the development of
computers software or internet and so on
that was all a textbook most of it at
taxpayer expense for decades it's never
the same with pharmaceuticals you
there's a good reason why if you'd walk
around MIT you see pharmacy you see
Pfizer
yeah yeah all the artists they're all
they were kind of feeding off the the
creative scientific work done at the
laboratories mostly at government
expense if he'd gone back there were 50
years ago you would have seen Raytheon I
was an error rate those are the big
that's because of electronics was kind
of the cutting edge of the economy ya
know it's biology so yeah but and this
is at every research university in the
country not just MIT sure so so going
back to China and the intellectual
property why should they observe the
intellectual property rights which
rammed through by the United States and
other rich countries and now let's look
a little history how did England develop
by stealing techno
ecology from more advanced countries
like India or the Low Countries even
Ireland they haven't had the United
States developed by stealing technology
from India from England that's why we
got a textile industry steel industry
and so on of course it wasn't called
stealing then it was just that's the way
it developed every single developed
countries developed that way then comes
something that economic historians call
us taking away the ladder at first you
climb the ladder then you kick it away
so nobody else can do it
well that's kind of what lies behind all
of this lies behind the effort to try to
impede Chinese economic development by
things like demanding intellectual
property rights do you see any
discussion of this not in the mainstream
media that I can of course you can find
some yeah yeah Dean Baker yeah good
economist he writes about it but it's
basically out of off the agenda now I
one would assume that well since
American isn't exceptional except
sometimes maybe exceptionally bad in
certain cases but but what what's
happened but is that is reverse
happening I mean and as and how does he
nice states respond I mean I assume
other countries are trying to do the
same thing the United States impede
economic progress it's rational there's
a couple of things wrong with the
concept of American exceptionalism the
one is the facts you know yeah okay yeah
the other is it's not American yeah
every great power has had the same
exceptionalism Britain when it was
virtually genocide all over the world
was praising itself on its magnificence
sure I mean they all had the civilized
mission well the French Minister of War
was calling on the army to exterminate
the population of Algeria if we had
records from Mattila the hunt and he
would probably be just overwhelmed with
good the fact that every country's
thought that they've been the unique
source of goodness and because of
there's nothing exceptional about a
matter
well but since it is an exceptional what
about is diversity giving examples are
our other countries I mean other
countries are trying to assumedly impede
American economic progress and what's
the response here how can they impede
American economy not let me let me just
let me give you I'm not an economist my
ignorance is gonna show here but I'm
assuming you should know better than to
judge specialists but I mean it's to
some extent China can impede American
progress by being able to produce the
same goods and services much more
cheaply but Betty was producing them in
China US corporations who want a
function China if US corporations don't
like Chinese rules they can invest
somewhere else anyway there's an article
in today's New York Times that said
exactly that right it was the response
to some of the pressure I'm trump one
might say I don't know if you saw this
article but it was basically saying
there's some impact to what's going on
and some companies are stopping having
made things in China but what they're
doing is not bringing back the United
States are just finding another place to
do it yeah which is yeah but but the
idea that it's unfair for China to
impose technology transfer restrictions
or partial ownership restrictions on say
Boeing is it's not a question of
national policy if Boeing doesn't like
that nobody's forcing them to invest
there yeah okay so what right do we have
to punish them for trying to do that
well quite apart from the fact that the
whole is that's how we develop how
England develop Oh everybody developed
okay let's hit some other hot-button
issue we won't spend the whole time in
foreign policy because I want to I want
to it is in our last I like I want to
cover a broad area and I want to do it
around books actually so I started with
Emerson just for fun but but let's hit
North Korea I think I'd like to talk
about North Korea Syria a little bit and
maybe Brazil because we're talking about
and it's and interestingly enough I
think because it's something that I
haven't read about before and so that
may be my ignorant but anyway so what
about North Korea
well actually the Trump is not my
favorite person yeah you know
but on North Korea basically I think
he's doing the right things and he's
attacked for it on all sides that
whenever he does something more or less
right
why I don't know maybe he's shooting
arrows ran the blood myself right now
and then I get it whatever the reasons
are but let's take a look at North Korea
on just the recent history April 27th I
think it was 2017
the two Koreas met an issue
negotiated and issued a very serious
document a historic document Panmunjom
that declaration were very serious it
affected a good article about it and
foreign affairs of all places yeah for
the first time they not only made
rhetorical commitments towards
denuclearization towards integration
there and as foreign affairs pointed out
made concrete proposals here we'll do it
step-by-step and then it said the two
Koreas will do this on their own accord
incursio Lee yeah on their own accord
meaning leave us alone we know who
they're talking to
yeah okay Trump is the one leading
figure for whatever reason who's more or
less observed this the Singapore Summit
for which Trump was bitterly denounced
by the Liberals
the Conservatives by everyone he
basically said will you guys go ahead on
your own accord yeah I mean even took
steps towards reducing what he
recognized to be provocative military
operations American military operations
in South Korea remember what's going on
and these operations the u.s. is flying
nuclear capable aircraft bombers right
at the border of a country that the u.s.
wiped out
literally wiped out yeah back in the
early 50s I mean by the time the war
settled into a kind of a stalemate what
was happening was the eustress is
bombing massively they couldn't find any
more targets you read the official Air
Force history they describe how well we
nothing a bomb will just bomb the dams
which is a huge war crime yes yeah and
then it discusses how it's interesting
to read how euphoric they were about
bombing this huge dam and a massive
flood of waters ass whomping all this
area and Asians
a little bit of racism yeah depend on
rice and where they're fleeing and
they're screaming and so on this is the
country that we're now flying nuclear
Iran bombers right on their border so
yes it is provocative and the Trump said
well let's let's cut back some of this I
mean I'm not saying what he said was
wonderful but well we accept what he
says and what he does or not always
exactly the same and and the you know
the one thing it's usually to me that
after all this bluster the foreign
policy is somewhat coming back to what
might have been considered more
realistic I mean the the last the last
dialogue broke off because once again
the United States said unless you
totally disarmed we're not gonna we're
not going to reduce actions that which
is just seems to me to be completely
unrealistic well that's I think you know
I don't know the inside story yet it
looks like Pompeo and bold yeah I mean
it seems as if Trump's instinct was to
say we'll go ahead he was kind of pushed
and remember he's under attack from all
sides
yeah the liberals attack him even more
sharply than this sharply as the hawks
but as i say of all the major political
actors here he seems on this issue i
miss to be the one who's closest to
being what i would regard as taking the
same position letting the two Koreas
proceed on their own accord as they've
asked it and i think that that's what's
going on pinning I guess agrees that
that's what if it's gonna if this
quote-unquote crisis is gonna resolve
itself it's going to happen to some
extent internally if we allow it to be
the case
stay away - that's mean only hope North
Korea's idle hours cannot help ya and
North Korea I think really recognizes
that a greater alliances with South
Korea will be beneficial debt and South
Korea well I some president moon is
following a pretty reasonable path well
let's say okay since we since you
mentioned the T word let's let's start
let's we'll come back to foreign but
let's talk about Trump because of course
that's all anyone seems to talk about
and discussions of Trump dominate all
everything else we don't hear about any
other issues and I wonder what we maybe
we could talk about that a little bit
well Trump is a very effective con man
isn't doing it gotta praise him for his
achievements yeah narrow set of skills
but he's using them very effectively
he's got the major media completely
wrapped around his little finger he
manipulates them totally one crazy thing
after another they talk about that then
they say it doesn't make any sense and
everybody's forgotten because he's on to
the next one so one day it's let's
eliminate the whole health system
everybody attacks that two days later
says let's stop all traffic across the
Mexican border which of course we shut
down the economy everyone points that
out and then the next day it'll be
something else meanwhile he's carrying
out a very effective job you probably
saw the article in The New York Times a
couple days ago about how he's totally
taken over the Republican Party yeah and
top the bottom there's no his party and
remember two years ago the Republican
establishment hated him yeah okay now
he's taken over the whole party and he's
caring he's carrying out something
pretty set of all this should not be
much of a surprise if you look back for
the last 10 or 15 years even little
beyond during the neoliberal period
since basically Reagan both parties
to the right the Democrats are kind of
what used to be called moderate
Republican has the Republicans have just
gone off the edge yeah a Norman Ornstein
Thomas Mann of American enterprises to
describe them plausibly as a radical
insurgency which is given up
parliamentary polls yeah I mean the
health care plan that now is what and
Reagan's time would have been great
whale yeah yeah look if you read
Eisenhower no he sounds like Bernie
Sanders I mean we've gone so forth
literally okay so what what's happened
either very old or Republicans are so
I'm in both parties or essentially
business parties but the Republicans
just with abject subordination to Wilson
corporate power
kanka votes that way so they've been
forced to try to mobilize constituencies
which in the past weren't really major
political constituencies and to try to
get them to be the base of the party on
what are called ridiculously cultural
issues so gun rights abortion religious
fanaticism xenophobia whatever maybe and
this has been showing up in the
primaries for quite a while so over the
past years in every Republican primary
when somebody comes up from the base
they're out of way out of the yeah
Michele Bachmann Rick Santorum yeah and
the establishment has been able to crush
them get there Mitt Romney types yeah
the difference in 2016 was they couldn't
crush this time the crazy guy from the
outfield got in now the base he's got
the base behind him and he's controlling
them and he's carrying out a very
effective policy how much he understands
what he's doing I have no idea maybe
it's just megalomania but likely he's
got two constituencies he's got to keep
supporting the primary constituency is
the one of the Republican Party the very
rich the corporate sector so okay we
hand that task over to Mitch McConnell
Paul Ryan and rammed through the
legislation which stuffs pockets with
even more dollars and chefs everyone
else and so on that's going beautifully
the rich and the corporation's have
profits assuming they don't know what to
do with them trillions of dollars that
can't spend the wealthy are doing
magnificently the the tax scam the one
legislative achievement we don't have to
talk about yeah so that's one
constituency me and why you've got to
control the voting base how do you do
that throw him a little red meat build a
wall to keep out the rapists and
murderers shift you know love Israel
shift the embassy for the evangelicals
yeah one thing after another he's
carrying it off the base adores him
while they're getting shafted I mean
that's always been the Ameer markable
thing is how people could always vote
against their own that's doing very well
and what are the Democrats doing helping
him like actually focus on the Miller
investigation which was tactically crazy
was obvious from the beginning that if
anything's gonna come out of that it'll
be the Trump was by trying to build a
hotel when the Red Square yeah I think
so minor corruption yeah I'm not saying
that in retrospect I've been saying it
for a long time all right what they've
done now is probably maybe even hand
from the 20/20 election about just
instead of the real issues like hey
you're destroying the environment for
for future life you're building up your
your Nuclear Posture review is greatly
extending the likelihood of total
catastrophe you're pouring money into
the pockets of the super-rich and
destroy issuing regulations and
executive orders and legislation which
is harming
the working class and everyone else
instead of that Trump is gonna Miller's
gonna show that the Russians interfered
with the election and you helped you
know the Russians couldn't I mean if the
Russians interfered with the elections
it was undetectable
I mean it's trivial um there is after
all massive interference with the
elections yeah like they're bought yeah
okay you can predict the outcome of a
pump Ferguson's work as the main work on
this your showing you there's a spoilage
into what he called the investment
theory of politics with remarkable
precision way back right through 2016
you can predict electability for the
executive and Congress simply with the
single variable of campaign spending and
that's just the beginning is that
interference with elections yeah it
means that as for a good working League
academic political science shows most of
the population is literally
unrepresented their own representatives
pay no attention to their preferences
they listen to other boys think the
Supreme Court decision in that regard in
terms of in terms of money spent on
elections was significant ah it's
changed but it's changed some things
that already exists yet so maybe you go
back to 1895 Maracana who was the famous
campaign manager was asked once what
does it take to run a run an effective
campaign he said there are two things
the first thing is money and I forgotten
what the second one is that was 1895 of
course you know the recent decisions
Buckley v Valeo against Citizens United
have enhanced that enormous Lee but
that's goes way back well the other
thing that we talk about history and
statements and I forget whether it's
growing or gurbles who said that if you
want to if you want to get people to do
what you want them to do it doesn't
matter with Ava democrasy or
dictatorship just make them afraid and
and that seems to also in some sense
being being effect on this whole notion
of immigrants being
being that greatest danger facing the
United States the opposite of most of
American history in fact is I'm finding
it kind of amazing to see how effects
work it works and and again there's a
long history Hofstadter talked about
anti intellectualism yeah another kind
of striking feature of American culture
from way back is that although this is
the most secure country in the world by
any objective standard like efi oceans
around probably the most frightened yeah
it's a very frightened country that lies
behind partly there's a lot more but
suppose one of the things that lies
behind this kind of in crazed gun
culture and why do you have to have 25
assault rifles in your closet they're
coming after me you know I gotta protect
myself
yeah it comes in again it's an issue
that I hope we're gonna cut get when we
come back in some sense it but you know
that this recent book by John Haight and
others about the coddling of the
American mind if argued that that level
of being frightened affects people's
behavior on a micro scale as well the
notion that every time your kids leave
the house they're in danger and they
should never be in danger and never be
in risk somehow comes in to the notion
that they should never be uncomfortable
they shouldn't be uncomfortable in
school they shouldn't hear ideas they
don't want to everything is a threat and
it is true I think that I remember when
when I meant a year and in in
Switzerland when at the at CERN when my
daughter was younger she was my daughter
was I remember at eight or nine or ten
and she was really afraid of going
outside the house on her own in living
where we lived at the time and it was
remarkable to see when she was in
Switzerland that you know I would drive
my car and I'd suddenly see her and her
friends downtown and and so this notion
of every time you leave the house the
world is terrifying really does seem to
be an American kindness it's recent when
I was a kid in the 30s and early 40s
when I was I lived in Philadelphia yeah
when I was maybe 12 years old I used to
take the train by myself to New York and
spend the day walking around anarchist
bookstores my parents didn't know that
was the raba
that was there you see if you
just control is not considered yeah
anything like though but I grew up in
Canada but it was still the same for me
in Toronto I stick the the the subway
car down in Spokane but I we moved into
the suburbs when my kids were little and
this place we I mean you can't imagine a
place that's more safe kids were playing
in the streets they'd go into each
other's houses and so on you go to the
same neighborhood now you don't see a
child either they're inside looking at
the video games or they're being driven
somewhere for organized activities kids
it's been in fact studied children don't
know how to play spontaneously
everything has to be controlled they
have to be watched all the time if if
they're you know somewhere maybe in you
know Aragon a kid got kidnapped
everything in the country has to close
down yeah yeah I mean the dangers back
in the 30s and 40s were far greater but
it just wasn't an issue yeah I know it's
very interesting also business of the
Trump knows what he's doing when he
builds up fear of the rapists and
murderers and Islamic terrorists just to
give you an example a couple of weeks
ago Steve Bannon you know is yes kind of
respite and came down to Arizona where
we live in Tucson and there was a
meeting he ran a meeting at a very
luxurious gated community south of
Tucson not too far from the border
you know guards gates are very rich and
so on the perp had a lot of nice people
they were like Crisco botch this guy
who's trying to keep people from voting
yeah there was a good report of it and
kind of a independent Tucson newspaper
through Sun Sentinel had a reporter
there the goal of the meeting was to try
to raise private money to build the wall
because Congress is run by communists
you know they're not going to do
anything so all these super rich people
are pitching in money to fill the wall
but the discussions were interesting a
people were this
driving how frightened they are I mean
if there's anybody in the world safer
than them I don't know how you'd find
them yeah but these are people who are
frightened we got to protect ourselves
in fact there was one legislator there
who said I'm not only in favor of the
wall I think we ought to have a wall
from the border right along the Arizona
border against California all the way up
to the Canadian border because these
people are going to come in from
California you know yeah we've got to
protect ourselves and not only do maybe
we need an army to protect us around the
gated community but yeah and when Trump
talks to the public at least according
to the reports that come up people
resume ya know it's it really works
affected I never know what's Trump
whether it's an accident or whether he's
plant you know whether he really knows
what he's doing whether they just
latches on by luck to an issue that that
seems to resonate any and he uses oh
yeah and then pick it up he just tests
to the water and he's doing that very
but meanwhile you have to remember that
his primary constituency corporate power
yeah wealthy he's serving them with real
dedication we'd use would you say that
in terms of enemy I don't want to harp
on this too much but it in terms of the
greatest danger if there is one of Trump
being president many people feel that
the fact that he's loose can and the
fact that he does no no no no reading no
knowledge about details about the world
around or certainly doesn't read or
listen to his advisers would you say
that's a bigger danger than the fact
that effectively he's apparently
implementing underneath all the noise
the the an agenda that that that you
worry about her no I mean there's a lot
of dangers with drunk the worst one
which overwhelms everything else is the
dedication to destroy the environment
yeah yeah I mean that just swamps
everything else that ought to be a
screaming headline every day wait I'm
surprised that if if if if private money
wanted to build the wall eight point six
billion is not enough money for that
could easily be done I mean more than
that spent
elections that but but interestingly
enough when you put in perspective
talking about the environment and
talking about about progress eight point
six billion which is what he's asking
for the wall was more is more than the
entire amount the entire budget of the
National Science Foundation I mean if we
talks about what is better for our
security in the future how about the
subsidies to the fossil fuel industry
much bigger than that how about the
subsidies to the financial institutions
there are some good technical studies
IMF and others who point out that the
financial institutions which are pretty
much predatory they don't they barely
help the economy they may harm and
they're a huge part of the economy a
huge they are maintained effectively by
public subsidy by the implicit
government insurance policy which raises
their credit ratings gives them access
to cheap money when you count all of
that it's pretty much their profits I
mean compared with this the wool and the
National Science Foundation aren't even
visible yeah no that's I mean it's
interesting to think about that I mean
and similarly when we come to the
climate change and and although this is
it that's the the two things that ought
to be emphasized by the political
opposition if there were one or this
dedicated commitment to destroy the
prospects for organized human life
within a short period and the radical
intensification of the already extremely
dangerous arms continent I was gonna hit
that those I think I know that we're
from our discussions those the two
things that I think there's another
danger that we shouldn't forget I was
personally very relieved when the Miller
investigation didn't come up with much
because if they had come up with
something that really implicates Trump
we would have been in deep trouble I
mean he's a narcissistic megalomaniac
he's kind of like the magician behind
the
and The Wizard of Oz and those that's a
very thin cover if anything breaks he
could go for broke there's plenty that
he could do yeah by Oh people worried
about what you know and I don't know who
said it in fact that that that well
maybe he's James Comey not someone who's
I agree with all the time but that that
he was worried that that exactly that
would happen and it would lead to some
kind of and there be violence that would
bill he's he's already indicated his dog
whistling is worth listening to
so take his attacks on John McCain which
people are wondering why why is he
talking John McCain yes well this very
good article on this by verse Franklin
for a good analyst who's also the
leading specialist on the POWs ethology
you know there's a lot of the country
still believes that the North Koreans
are the North Vietnamese are holding all
sorts of American POWs in the terrible
thing and McCain is one of their
villains because he's part of the myth
is that he's the one who sold people out
helping keep our brave American boys
there Rambo has to go in and rescue them
and so on that's a pretty big thing in a
sector of the country a sector of the
country that Crump openly talks to when
he talks about how his bikers are tough
guys and they're gonna really cause
trouble that's who he's talking to when
he attacks McCain he's talking to them
he's throwing them the red meat this is
clever politics and very dangerous this
is a very violent country um their
militias all over probably better armed
than the National Guard and a lot of
desperate angry people people have been
hit by the stagnation of the neoliberal
period there's economic distress there's
concern that somehow that waits that the
white population is as they put it
facing genocide meaning we might not be
a majority in a couple of decades
all of this is very real and when these
dog whistling attacks on McCain and the
you know the the hints about the Mexican
rapists over coming us and destroying us
all that's talking to a sector of the
population that's very real is under a
kind of distress stemming largely back
from economic policies that right at the
top that are creating the kinds of
situation which we know or there's
something similar in Europe all all of
this converges and when you get this
again narcissistic megalomaniac who's a
clever politician sitting right at the
top of it and pulling the strings
it's it's a fragile system but it's
working and very dangerous okay well so
since we're on a lifting area and let me
join think of any buttons we haven't
pushed yet before we move on and I think
it's we probably should push this button
at least one so so let's talk about
Syria and Israel for a little bit and
see if we can alienate the part of the
public we haven't so far so Syria Israel
well on Syria is a total disaster the
countries yeah and virtually destroyed
we can look at the history but here
again I'm afraid I disagree with many of
my friends on the left on this at one of
the Trump proposals was to leave a small
contingent of troops in a sector of
northern Syria which is mostly Kurdish
correct yeah I think that's a good idea
you know anti interventionist just block
out on this we've got to take them out
they have no right to be there and so on
but think it through for a second the
Turkish army is military is carrying out
again it's done worse before serious
atrocities against Kurds in Turkey
itself and in the areas of Syria that
they
of occupied recently offering if they
move on to Roja the other mostly Kurdish
areas that will just continue what's
stopping them small contingent of US
troops which are confined to the Syrian
or areas and are not intervening
elsewhere in Syrian affairs
I don't like US troops to be anywhere
but in this case I think it's not out of
humanitarian goals whatever the goals
may be it may be helping to avert a
serious catastrophe I think those are
things that are worth thinking about not
just kind of an axiom yes get them out
gets troops home Puri you have to think
about what the meaning is it's not like
a justification for humanitarian
intervention which is always a fraud
yeah this is a matter of assessing the
actual situation that exists independent
of intentions whether it has a good
Hubble nothing to do with intentions you
know it so those we can put aside the
intentions we know I mean up until under
Obama until about 2015 the US and its
allies incidentally France England we
believed that it would be possible to
overthrow the Assad regime and we're
committed to doing so finally I think
was around 2013 2014 the US the CIA sent
advanced anti-tank missiles to the
opposition which by then is mostly jawed
Iran yeah which did stop the Syrian army
advanced predictably
the Russians intervened with more force
started sending the Air Force took out
the tow missiles sold army went on at
that point
pretty much the West accepted the fact
that like it or not this monster or any
is a monster I will probably control
most of the country and since then
whatever planning or negotiations are
taking place are mostly out of the
West's hands it's Russia Iran Syria or
pretty much running the show like it or
not and there's not a lot that
nope he was gonna do about that the even
fit sure but yeah with regard to suit at
the Israel there's a lot to say about
this but the the support what's called
the support for Israel here it's very
reminiscent of old-fashioned Stalinism
its extraordinary when you look into it
up to the level of books published by
university presses which are just full
of outlandish lies and fabrications at
denouncing anybody me of course yeah who
dares to raise a minor criticism about
the holy state the level of lying is
spectacular could go into examples but
it's my well knows I mean okay good go
on but I wasn't worth talking about that
but but the there's a kind of a
desperate effort now on the part of
those who supported thee will call
themselves supporters of Israel I don't
think that's the right term I think
their supporters of Israel's moral
degeneration and maybe ultimate
destruction but that's another story
who call themselves supporters of Israel
since the 1970s have increasingly been
finding their backs to the wall because
public opinion is changing mm-hmm
strikingly especially among younger
people polls are very clear even
personal experience is very clear so
look up till maybe 10 years ago if I
gave a talk about Israel Palestine at a
university in my own University and I
had to have police protection police had
to follow me out to my car because
meetings were broken up nobody was
worrying about free speech at
universities yeah well we'll get to that
yeah that's changed that's changed in
fact among people who identify
themselves as liberal Democrats actually
support for Palestinian rights is even
higher than Israel at this point support
for Israel has gone to the most
reactionary parts of the population
evangelical Christians and xenophobes
the Democratic Party used to be the base
for as a sport for Israel it still is
but nothing like the Republicans they
were extreme Trump of courses but what I
mean but at the same time when with a
recent discussion about you know the
Golan Heights I read it and I heard that
there was some concern but then I didn't
see any big outcry it's pretty
interesting
I mean the the Golan Heights have been
recognized internationally including the
United States as occupied territory the
u.s. signed supported the Security
Council resolutions resolutions
declaring that Israeli efforts to take
over the heights and in particular their
annexation of the heights which they did
is absolutely illegal has no basis
international law can be accepted that
was true up until Trump a couple of
weeks ago he just reversed it okay now
they're allowed to take it over anybody
talking about it no I was amazed I mean
meant people mention and then I'm sort
of sudden outcry about it after you say
well maybe it's not tactically good
might alienate somebody then the idea is
well israel needs this first defense
this is outlandish I mean the Israeli
military overwhelms everyone in the area
combined you know quite apart from the
fact that they have a big nuclear
arsenal but they're the military force
in the region yeah one of the major of
the Golan Heights it's not defense what
they want it because it's nice territory
you have its economic it's it's a very
nice area you have the ski ski low the
skis on the Mount Hermon build
agricultural communities a nice place to
visit and live they want it okay there's
there's no military threat there well
I'll always I suppose it's about and
when people say the husband owes at
their border yeah as follows not them
insignificant military force but the
only respect in which they were threat
to Israel the only respect is if Israel
attacks Lebanon they'll fight back
and that is a threat to Israel so in
fact if Israel were to proceed with its
occasionally announced plans to attack
Iran probably the first thing they do is
wipe out Lebanon just to prevent the
deterrence of Hezbollah missiles so yes
that's a threat if you like we might ask
the same question about what the Iranian
threat is supposed to be who is around
threatening I'm supposed to around had
nuclear weapons I mean where's the
threat I mean if they dared to arm a
missile with nuclear weapons the country
would be wiped out yeah yeah you know
it's it's a in fact US intelligence is
pretty clear about this if you look at
their presentations to Congress over
many years they've pointed out that
basic picture is that Iran has very low
military expenditures by the standards
of the region well the United States but
that's different it's a strategic
posture is defensive trying to set up to
ensure that it can react to aggression
sufficiently so diplomacy will take over
they say if it were to develop nuclear
weapons they would be part of its
deterrent strategy well I've always I
mean as someone who's always been
concerned about missile defense which is
which is an oxymoron in some way in so
many ways we could go into it doesn't
work first of all but but but that came
back to what you said in Europe I've
always been remains that the people say
that we're defending Europe from Iranian
missile what what possible purpose would
Iran have to to launch missiles at
Europe right yeah if they only want had
a suicidal impulse yeah yeah the country
to be worried I've never seen that
question that's and that's oh that's the
Liberals remember this is Obama yeah no
he was the one who was putting the
missile installations on the okay well
we've gone on it foreign affairs that
drop more than I might have but I think
it was important in this context but let
but let me take it back because you
raised something interesting that you
can now you're finding you're able to
give talks without police protection on
certain issues at the same time I
actually had a quote from one of your
books were which I think I used in our
last
dialogue but but which was originally I
think a quote that was set up from
Catholic priests in South America
talking about the educational system and
they said educational systems are
oriented to maintaining the existing
social and economic structures instead
of transforming them and this notion
that we started with the notion that
intellectuals elites aren't necessarily
are sort of by the party line almost
more than anyone else but I see another
issue that's really become more
pronounced since we last had our
dialogue which is this issue of free
speech and in this case free speech on
campuses you may be able to speak more
freely but one is finding more and more
two things that are remarkable
interesting and maybe is some extent
disturbing that is first of all that
that we're seeing more and more speakers
especially on the right to some extent
but but almost every subject area being
stopped from spigen camp is not but
meant by students in this case that the
notion that there was there was a there
was a lecture that was happening in a
university in the West where the speaker
was come going to speak about due
process and free speech and there were
and safe rooms were set up on campus so
the students didn't have to hear
discussions about this yet it's an issue
that seems to now be adopted by the
right that that that there if you look
at and saying who was speaking out and
again one of the try you know Trump's
executive order may be impotent but the
notion that Trump would would put an
executive order saying universities
can't get federal funding unless they
promote free speeches is kind of
interesting this notion that that the
left in some ways is is now being seen
as not promoting free speech so I
thought I we we should have that
discussion a little bit well I'd
question the notion the list but it's
certainly happening yeah and it's it's
wrong in principle and beyond that it's
just tactically insane it's the best
gift that you can give to the right yeah
if some right wings speaker tries to go
to a campus and is blocked it's a gift
it's they love it and you can see the
way the
using it this is okay weird that we're
the good guys
they're defending freedom of speech you
guys are Nazis trying to protect so if
you want if you want to give enormous
gifts to the right wing and the to the
far right to the neo-fascist that's the
way to do it exactly but that is even
broader than that I think that there's
some concern and you know two people
that I obviously am NOT a fan of Trump
I'm not a fan of Betsy DeVos I've
written about how opposed many of our
aspects but she but but there's another
aspect of this notion which comes back
to the people being afraid in the United
States this notion that words have to be
protected that words are scary that
there needs to be safe zones like
trigger warning trigger warnings that
when you when you would think and I've
always said this in the context of
science but I think it's true more
generally one of the purposes of
Education I used to say of science but
one of the purposes of Education is to
make people uncomfortable because if
you're comfortable you're not pushing
that you're you're not pushing the
boundaries of what you know understand
and if we if we I was just at a lecture
where somewhere where where people are
saying they've changed their curriculum
for because they're if they upset
students they're worried that
universities will remove them from
teaching and and that that seems to me
especially an environment where our at
least our higher educational system has
been very effective in educating
students more more so maybe than the
public school system I'm as concerned
about you I think your your the fact
that the right is usurping an issue that
will come back to haunt others is one
thing but I'm more I'm equally concerned
about the fact that people are afraid of
ideas or or discussions that make them
uncomfortable that's first of all that's
always been true but since this was
always the mainstream who who was
fighting off the wild men and the wings
nobody noticed it now we're noticing it
it was wrong then and it's wrong now
it's even worse now with the idea that
somehow like what you said you have to
have special places where students won't
hear things this is totally crazy
I mean if speaker comes in who youth
is extremely offensive first of all you
don't have to go to the talk if you
don't want exactly at the same thing to
do which sometimes is done is to use it
use the opportunity as an educational
opportunity yeah go listen to them
meanwhile set up alternative forums
where you discuss the issues you think
about them you look at the pros and cons
nothing is ever 100% obvious let's let's
go through it and come out with a
reasonable position we'll have a basis
if it's the correct outcome to oppose
their positions not just shout them down
saying well we're so scared of them we
can't even hear it exactly shot them
down play music so they can't talk even
if they're allowed on campus it's I've
had enough of that in my own experience
but that's not the reason it's wrong
whoever does it when the right wing is
targeted its tactically crazy when the
left is targeted doesn't matter because
nobody pays attention anyway yeah but
when those who have some basis in power
systems are attacked then it's
tactically ridiculous because it's
giving them an enormous gift well what I
what I never see is this recognition
well I very rarely see it of the fact
that the whole purpose of free speech is
to protect the speech of those you
detest and perhaps that's what a
democracy is supposed to in principle
but the people who have upheld that have
always been bitterly denounced on every
issue well and but you know what's I
couldn't give you many examples yeah but
I'm pretty sky mean as someone who sort
of grew up in the sixties to see that
the people that I used to think of as
progressive that are now supporting
exactly the opposite but that was the
60s yeah and remember the 60s was the
period when even the Supreme Court
really for the first time took strong
positions in support of freedom of
speech that's not American history it's
worth remembering that first of all the
First Amendment does not protect freedom
of speech it prevents prior restraint
yeah but if I give a talk
sizing the government First Amendment
permits them to put me into jail as long
as they didn't stop me from saying it in
the first place
First Amendment's a very weak barrier to
repression and in fact a freedom of
speech issues didn't arise at the court
level Supreme Court until the 20th
century and if you look at the history
it's not uplifting the first protections
of freedom of speech sort of were during
the First World War the famous dissents
of Holmes and Brundle yes notice first
of all they were dissents secondly they
were very limited so in the shank case
the first case where shank is and the
guy was being sent you don't sentenced
for having written pamphlets against the
war the dissenters Holmes voted in favor
of the of the decision they said well
you know too far was going got to have a
little freedom of speech but
nevertheless did it it's a very mixed
record up until the sixties the first
strong defense of freedom of speech by
the court was actually in 1964 that's
times V Sullivan when of his civil
rights issue yeah the state of Alabama
declared that they were being libeled by
the Martin Luther King and the civil
rights movement because you know racist
sheriffs were being intact kind of
technically they were right by the
thinking of the framers but the Supreme
Court overruled what's called sovereign
immunity yeah that this state is
protected from harmful speech which
holds in most countries incidentally
including Canada including Britain they
still have this yeah but the United
States struck it down then there was
even a further further decisions read
advert for Ohio took a very strong
position in favor freedom speech that's
1969 that's not American history yeah
so yes there is a modern Trudeau
of protection of freedom of speech but
it's it's not deeply rooted or sturdy
and when say Clarence Thomas recently
said we got to review these decisions
because that's not what the framers had
in mind he's not wrong you know if you
really look back at the history but
nevertheless it's true that among the
countries of the world the United States
is probably supreme and protection of
freedoms yeah I know that's what I grew
up in Canada and I used to do history of
candidates yeah it's amazing to see how
those protections were more Revere than
a Solomon Rushdie case huh when this
came up in Canada oh there was a
question debated about whether he was
attacking the state religion and they
finally decided he wasn't so it was okay
because it was some other religion in
fact in Britain that same case the
remember this was when he was
criticizing his long yes it went to the
House of Lords and they considered they
said well he isn't liable because he was
condemning Islam if he'd been condemning
the Anglican Church yeah it would have
been a different story
that's Britain we're not talking about
Nazi Germany yeah yeah no it's so these
are very thin reads and like in in
France for example there are laws I mean
I'm bitterly condemned for having
criticized them but there are laws in
France that grant the state the right to
determine historical truth and to punish
deviation from what they determine and
that's been used okay and French left
intellectuals supported know we got to
stop the speech we don't like yes I mean
this stuff is very thin and the United
States by and large has comparatively a
good record but the things you're
pointing out or hitting away at some of
the best things that have happened here
and unfortunately it is coming from
students young people who just aren't
thinking through what they're doing not
thinking through and have been brought
up too and I think to fear anything that
that the
a little bit uncomfortable it makes them
a little bit uncomfortable but again in
the sciences I mean the whole history of
the sciences is people challenging
common sense that's what exactly it's
what science it's all about if it wasn't
you know if we weren't uncomfortable
we're not making progress it's yeah so I
think okay good I'm glad we got that
ELISA because I'm critically concerned
about it and then it's run is being at
universities I think is seeing it in a
way I've never remembered goes on also
it's like yeah I teach at the University
of Arizona yeah right now the there's a
legislation at the state level requiring
that at the University of Arizona if a
department invites a speaker or if a
faculty member invites somebody to come
to their tour class they have to inform
the legislature yeah so if if I invite
somebody to talk on theoretical
linguistics
I gotta inform the legislature make sure
there's no communist infiltrators yeah I
know it's a yes was it when I found
something similar when I moved to
Arizona but okay let's see I wanna we I
want to come back to another book I was
the two books I wanted to mention that
in fact were books that you got me to
look at one was Daniel Ellsberg which I
think I'll come back to after the other
one was this book by Katherine Nick see
the dark dark knee age that amazing boom
it's an amazing book which shows
basically how Christianity effectively
in a way that makes Isis look tame
destroyed the classical world and and
and I bring it up because we've had this
discussion before and and I I'm known
for my concerns about religion in many
ways and I remember you saying to me the
one the first times we talked that you
didn't it wasn't what people believed
that bothered you is what they did and I
and I countered by saying that's true
but I think what they what they believe
radically affects what they do and when
I when I and and I I was thinking about
that book recently with another article
about Mike Pompeo and his how is
evangelical Christianity has affected
his role as a secretary of state and
exactly how he approaches not just the
middle
everywhere else and so I continue to
think that there's just insidious impact
of religion in this case Christian
religion but it happens obviously in the
Islamic world and so I wanted to talk to
you about it in this movie you know
that's mixed or I mean you know it's a
complicated story
Morris can't get a couple thousand years
of his yeah but if you think about it
and abroad we have morning superficial
rank and a picture Christianity in the
early days was radical pacifist and
Christians were persecuted as Nixie
points out yeah a lot of it was
purposeful martyr not yeah because the
Classical period was fairly tolerant
yeah I believe was a hollow theistic so
you know you believe not God I believe
in this God just that's the door doesn't
matter and but nevertheless there was
persecution sure when Constantine turned
Christianity into the religion of the
Roman Empire and the Cross shifted from
being a symbol of persecution to being
on the shield of the Roman Legionnaires
yeah everything changed
first of all the radical Christians it
went on a rampage as you say it makes
Isis look pretty tame yeah they
virtually destroyed the rich complex
pretty tolerant classical culture
statues paintings literature philosophy
everything had to go and they instituted
the dark ages of totalitarian as a
literal flow for millenniums yes well
you know yeah there was a totalitarian
God who not only controlled you but
looked into your mind you had to do what
he said
it's I don't want to over exaggerate
there were exceptions what it was a real
kind of totalitarian era for a
millennium and it's a God who would not
only do see why you're on earth but for
eternity yeah yeah that's good
Augustine st. Augustine's for something
like merciful terror or something like
yeah it cuz we have to have terror to
destroy
this but it's merciful because it's
saving souls you know well and and when
I looked at well I'll interrupt for a
second when I looked at because I want
to hear the completion but in that
context after I read that book I looked
around me because you see how
effectively in a few hundred years they
can completely remake the world it was a
world where there was you know
philosophy and and I mean religion was
amazing yeah and and then where where
every place became dominated by a church
took a century but we still live in that
world in a sense it when every town I go
I think I how effectively amazing they
were everywhere you go you don't mind
that cities are just full of churches
and and and it they did it very
effectively okay but let's go on mmm-hmm
this went on pretty much until you know
variations but pretty much until 1962
when pope john xxiii called the second
vatican council which is a very
important event in modern history very
important the Second Vatican Council
under Pope John tried among other things
to reinstitute the Gospels horrible
thing the Gospels have a radical
pacifist message mmm-hmm I said let's
the theme is what was called the
preferential option for the poor this
was picked up by Latin American bishops
who supported it yeah and pretty soon
priests nuns laypeople were going out
into the poorer areas countryside
starting to organize what we're called
base communities and which often
illiterate peasants would start thinking
about the Gospels listening to what
they're saying starting to get to see if
they could take some control of their
own lives not just the Latin American
particular poverty and inequalities
extraordinary and repressions
extraordinary but I know you I know you
were big fan of Latin American of the of
the depression that whole aspect of
Latin American theology but at the same
time the Gospels do sort of say you know
the you know it's okay to be poor
because and the afterlife you'll be
you'll be fine so it's an accepted late
talk about yes these activists were
doing was saying you can take care of
your lives we can listen to the right at
the preferential option for the poor but
do something about it okay that was the
important part and it was important mmm
the United States went to war against
the church yeah starting then yeah and a
lot of the recent history of Latin
America reflects that maybe by
coincidence but in 1962 Kennedy shifted
the mission of the Latin American
military from hemispheric defense it's
kind of a anachronistic holdover from
the Second World War
yeah to internal security that as a
meaning means war against the population
he sent a military mission to Colombia
where the worst atrocities were going on
then led by a green beret general which
came back with the report it recommended
paramilitary terror that's the phrase
against known communists adherence which
is a very broad category in a Latin
American context of the the director of
counter counterinsurgency for Kennedy
and Johnson Charles mate sling had a
very strong critique of this he said
that this turned tolerance of the
rapacity of the Latin American military
into support for activities that are
reminiscent of the stormtroopers of
Hitler you had government after
government falling under neo-fascist
neo-nazi military regimes a brutal
murder for plague spread all over the
hemisphere all the way to Central
America under Reagan lots of religious
martyrs including the Archbishop and all
solve adora finally 1989 the murder of
six leading Latin American intellectuals
at the University and they'll solve
other Jesuit priests and finally
finally what you have is the school of
the Americas which trains Latin American
officers has what are called talking
points we advertise our achievements one
of them is the US Army helped defeat
Liberation Theology
that's a substantial part of the history
so it says like a lot of things the
story is complicated it's interesting
that one that the Latin American priest
who became a pope wasn't it was in fact
not as far as you can see not a
Liberation Theology but in fact as far
if you I think if you look at his
history in in Latin America was the
offices part of the it's a very striking
part of the history the point was when
there was an effort to go back to the
message of the Gospels and to interpret
it as meaning do something about your
own lives the hammer came down very hard
well but now the hammers somewhere else
and I I'm I'm wonder if you're as
concerned I am I think both of us in
different ways have been attacked I
certainly when I've stated this but and
you know recently one here is that one
is there's much more it's certainly in
in domestic terms in the United States
and other words more concern among
police organizations about about
right-wing terrorism than Islamic
terrorism and in forward it's far worse
then look at the FBI records exactly and
and but here we see this incredible
connection between evangelical
Christianity and not just in Mike Pompeo
and in our foreign affairs but in in but
the white house in a way that has never
been I mean it may have been implicit
but now it's incredibly overt well it's
it's more than that it's planned yeah so
it goes back to what we were talking
about before about the parties going to
the right and the Republicans going off
into outer space they had to organize
new constituencies this starts with
Nixon on the Southern Strategy since
Democrats were associated with civil
rights Nixon and his associates figured
okay we can pick up the Southern
Democrats the southern working class on
racist drones then comes
the recognition that they can pick up
northern Catholics Catholic workers who
voted Democratic by pretending to be
imposed to abortion I stress pretending
you go back to the 60s Republican
leadership is what we call pro-choice
Reagan George HW Bush who was supposed
to have some principles the whole stream
of them were thought yeah this is none
of the government's business woman's
right the poll Wyrick you know the
Republican strategist in the mid
seventies figured out that if the
Republicans pretend to be anti-abortion
they can pick up the evangelical in the
Catholic vote pretend by now if you're a
Republican in Congress or the president
you got to be passionately anti-abortion
and principle total cynicism but it
worked they picked up a large part of
the Catholic northern working-class vote
the evangelical vote of the evangelicals
are now the primary base of trumps
electoral voting coalition and this is
connected very closely to the Israel
again the evangelicals have a very
interesting position on Jews and on
Israel they're the most extreme
anti-semites in human history their
theology if you look at it is that it's
not a hundred percent of evangelicals
were leading part of it they Scott we
got a look for Armageddon yeah the
second coming that Christ comes what
happens when Christ comes back those who
are saved go to heaven everybody else
goes to eternal perdition
what happens to the Jews yeah actually a
hundreds according to one of the
denominations a hundred and sixty
thousand can convert in time the rest go
to eternal perdition
yeah did Hitler call for them No
I mean this is the reservation structure
grandma but this is part of the support
for Israel we have to support Israel
because that's going to lead to the
battle that Armageddon between Israel
and whoever the next enemy is shifts
from time to time and after that will
come this wonderful thing
in fact the Israeli government has a
very interesting policy towards these
guys it kind of welcomes them because it
wants the support you know they want the
embassy in Jerusalem and so on but it's
afraid of them because these are crazy
lunatics who go up to try to blow up the
Temple Mount they've got to stop them
before they do it you know because they
are super anti-semites
and way beyond it like there's an
article in The Times today about
anti-semitism on the right left yeah
yeah what they call anti-semitism on the
left is say Jeremy Corbyn being critical
of policies of Israel that's any
Semitism on the left the right of course
neo Nazism Holocaust denial and so on
shooting blowing up synagogues that's
the right but they don't talk about this
which is the most extreme anti-semitism
in human history there's nothing like it
you know I mean just think it through
for a second well that's what I mean by
beliefs influence actions and that's why
that's I guess ultimately why if every
man was an island I where every person
was an island I would argue it doesn't
matter what people believe but people
but but it produces actions it affects
national policies and ultimately that's
why I think we have to be wary about the
impact of organized religion the one
thing on which we perhaps differ as I
think there are other strains that can
develop oh yeah no I look I mean the
point is that Martin Luther King is an
example I mean you can use a mere
religions been used for lots of Enso's
liberation theology yeah it's a very
interesting development because it did
lead to a war against the church with
many religious martyrs
that's a nasty forgotten yeah who's
gonna even name the Latin American
intellectuals about their brains blown
up yeah none you can name every
dissident in Eastern Europe yeah
these guys who we killed in this regard
when we talked about we talked about
dangers of say evangelical terrorism and
versus the the threat of Islamic
terrorism which which we we both argue
but I've certainly argue at one point in
other in terms of the day-to-day life of
Americans is not a big deal
we've both been attacked but
particularly I was dismayed by by by Sam
Harris's a virulent attack and to some
extent you because I know Sam and I've
worked with him in different ways but
the one statement he made that that that
concerned me it was a statement that I
was surprised when he said that Ben you
know he would prefer ben Carson someone
who clearly is so no concept of how the
world works no concept of science but he
knows how poor people ought to be
treated yeah okay yeah but he better you
know he says that science is the work of
the devil that climate change everything
is the you know that evolution is the
work of the devil
but but Sam who's a you know in
otherwise in mind many it said many
reasonable things I said he'd prefer him
as president versus you because at least
he understands the threat of his llama
k-- terrorism and I that's a statement
that concerns me so I thought I'd bring
it up because well let's take the threat
of Islamic terrorism let's look at the
history Islamic terrorism the modern
period it begins basically in Egypt
against the government of nineteen
seventies it was a it was an internal of
Middle Eastern phenomenon until
basically until the reaction to 9/11 the
reaction to 9/11 at that point Islamic
terrorism was pretty much confined to a
tribal area in the Pakistan Afghan
border the region where al-qaida was
sheltered that was the center of Islamic
terrorism what where is it now
everywhere in the world
yeah how'd that happen
we did it the invasion of Iraq yeah
intelligence agencies predicted across
the board this is going to increase
terrorism turns out by US government
records that Islamic terrorism increased
by a factor of seven after the Iraq war
yeah I smash people in the face they
react something else yeah now it's all
over the world every time you you go
after it it's like a Hydra you know yeah
great more you carry out the drone
attacks in northwest Pakistan or Yemen
somebody sees their family blown up by
something you think they like it okay
how do they react and in fact if you
want to think about this in some depth
there's another book I'd recommend great
book by William Polk who's fine a
scholar of mainly Middle East Islamic
studies but also has a strong background
in the in the government he was on the
National Security Council for Middle
East affairs right through the Cuban
Missile Crisis in fact he's the guy who
sort of organized for the negotiations
between Israel and Egypt very important
background on a very smart interesting
guy as a book called Crusaders and
jihadis that's a very interesting book
covering a thousand years of history
from the Crusades to the present and
what he points out is that this is
largely a war of the north against the
south and a large part of the south is
the Islamic South it's a war in which
the north has continually attacked the
south brutally viciously destructively
the Islamic world has tried all sorts of
ways to respond negotiations
accommodation one thing or another
everything's been smashed down finally
they've turned to Islamic terror okay
that's
yes that's real history the kind you
have to think about it's not history is
bunk well it's also but it's not it's
not untrue that in some sense from a
blue religious perspective there is a
religious justification that is used in
the Islamic world for violence you take
careful look at that so the there's been
a lot of careful study of the jihadi
sharps Scott atrum for yeah I know okay
you know what they put what he and
others point out is that the Islamic
element of it is very thin yeah yeah
most of the militant jihadists have just
have essentially no Islamic background
they picked it up yeah after the
judgment okay but the commitment comes
from other things the kind of things
that William polkas talking about and
the repression and so on or even just
things like peer pressure well what I
wanted to argue is that this nothing new
about that in some sense there are newer
religion but the Crusades were work were
Christian states but there were
political just deliberately unless worth
they were hideous terror oh exactly the
same way but it was six hundred years
earlier seven hundred years earlier well
Islam's a religion that six hundred
years younger it's not to surprise it
but but again it's not a political cause
its own its own its own history of
violence yeah of course the picture that
Pope presents is fundamentally correct
it is a north-south war thousand years
the North wins all the time
it beats back now and then and it just
gets more and more violent and
destructive
that's a persistent theme can't forget
that well let's let's let's continue
with it I want to try and conclude well
we bet you know in a few minutes we
could go on for a long time but I want
to I want to go back in terms of this
thrilling and uplifting theme we have of
violence and destruction it seems to to
the book by Daniel Ellsberg the doomsday
machine I think it's called incredibly
important book yeah be rude yeah and
some of the things in it are really
startling
um this is his discussion of things he'd
discovered when he was right on the
inside starting in the 50s and certainly
as he points out he was a hawk he
believed it well you know it's just
appalled by the things he was
discovering but one of them was that the
psyops you know they the strategic plans
for nuclear weapons called for killing
600 million people if we decision you
know yeah it was amazing marketing the
structure was such that if there was a
confrontation in Berlin we would wipe
out China yeah literally why because we
can do it you know China's vulnerable
with all these ships and missiles there
so the Russians do something in Berlin
will wipe out China you know yeah and
this was just this is not the Hawks this
is everybody right through probably
still the case then comes his discovery
that under Eisenhower the the afar
authority to use nuclear weapons was sub
delegated under Eisenhower to Admirals
and Generals but the logic was well if
the top gets decapitated somebody else
has to do it and that logic happens to
proliferate so if it goes down to
generals what if they get killed okay
you have to permit it down to lower
levels turns out it was all the way down
to pilots if you look at the memoirs in
the of the Cuban Missile Crisis people
who are flying the so-called chrome-dome
missions b-52s were all over the place
ready to wipe out the world you know the
shot of an arm the commanders of a b-52
plane it could have decided to do it now
in theory it took two of them to agree
yeah yeah suppose one of them was asleep
something yeah I mean it's just mind
boggling Sandy Cohen was unless he
points out you know Herman Kahn will
have fantasized about doomsday machines
well we have it the system is a doomsday
machine if anything goes wrong you just
blow up the world and once we've learned
about nuclear winter you know you can
debate the details but something's there
well it's it's really it's it's
particularly serious I think for
Americans who think that I mean who
become complacent about nuclear weapons
but think well probably the most
dangerous place where nuclear weapons my
abuses India Pakistan where there really
are two states that really are and war
that really hate each other that both
are nuclear States and what what is
important to point out is that is that
it's not isolated that a mere use of 200
nuclear weapons and in India and
Pakistan will produce a climate change
that will probably kill a billion people
in terms of the agriculture over the
course of a decade so there is no it's
not as if a local there's not even the
local local option you know you can't
think about it yeah and meanwhile the
Trump administration is escalating the
threat the so-called the low yield
nuclear weapons I mean you know people
can think about this you can't even
imagine what's in their minds suppose
you're the opponent and somebody
launches a missile which you say has
only low-yield nuclear weapons on it
yeah how do they know
no they're cracked with but but massive
violence that you've done you of usable
nuclear weapons is a fallacy and it's
unfortunately the notion that if they're
small enough they're they're
indistinguishable from we have to
overcome that but that's the as far as I
can see that's a myth that's happening
now and that's why they dale's per book
I think is important because it points
out people have become complacent
because we've had 75 years of not using
them against civilian populations but
and it took a look at the record yeah
we've come so close slow in control a
wonderful book about about how close
we've come to domestically and
internationally to it is not going to
last forever
I'm in their case if the case we've come
within a couple of minutes of using them
well look before we do go to a different
area
why because I know particularly I know
because your wife was interested in it
was from Brazil wanted us to talk about
Brazil a little bit let's let's talk
about it a little bit
well Brazil remember is the most
important country in the hemisphere
outside the United States not a small
country
it's been called hundred years ago yeah
called the Colossus of the south
potentially yeah so what's happened in
Brazil reason I won't go through the
whole history of course but just
recently in 2003 they elected Lula da
Silva president he's a uneducated union
leader a very remarkable person I knew
him back in the 90s follow him closely
he's very remarkable person very
effective you don't take my opinion the
World Bank published a study of Brazil
in 2016
hey 2016 on which they discussed what
they called the golden decade a unique
period in Brazil's history under Lula's
two terms 2003 to 2011 a period in which
there was remarkable improvement poverty
reduction enormous poverty reduction
large expansion of inclusiveness
marginalized but remember these are very
unequal countries were rich but
incredibly unequal enormous poverty
tremendous resources wasted inclusion of
people afro-brazilians almost half the
population indigenous people and women
brought in to educational institutions a
sense of dignity of commitment that
country just changed if they say it's a
remarkable example of the development
rarely equal at the same time lula
became probably the most respected
statesmen in the world a very respected
States
as a voice for the global self respected
everywhere I remember visiting Brazil it
seemed like yeah it seemed like the a
beacon you know it was an a remarkable
period well Brazilian elites couldn't
tolerate this and not only that he was
very supportive of establishment
institutions they didn't but interfere
with did not realize Robbie in the
country you know he didn't he paid off
the debts to the foreign investors he
satisfied the IMF he's not a radical
yeah I'm his beliefs very straight or
you just put money in the hands of poor
people that'll take care of things
that's his radicalism but the for the
Brazilian a lead who are outlandish all
the Latin American elite this is
intolerable furthermore there's an
enormous class hatred how can this
uneducated worker who doesn't even speak
proper Portuguese dare to be sitting in
the presidential palace you know we can
these people have to have humility we'll
take care of them that sort of thing
that's deeply rooted all throughout
Latin America and Brazil in particular
anyhow as soon as he after a couple of
years after he stepped down the oil
prices dropped and the commodity prices
dropped in China cutting back
development there's a lot of claims that
the improvements under his rule were
just illusory there but the World Bank
didn't agree that you look at their
analysis they say it's not true in fact
if you look more closely I've written
about this the Brazilian economist of
written about it the it was the mainly
the predatory financial institutions who
prevented any sensible reaction to this
every effort that was taken was beaten
back and it did lead to a recession that
gave the opportunity for the soft coup
that's been going on since then the
first step was to impeach his successor
Dilma Rousseff on absolutely the riser
II grounds I mean you look at them it's
not even a joke and she was in
each by a gang of thieves of a sort you
can't even describe that was the first
step then comes the next just a couple
months ago there was an election coming
up in October October 2018 the Lula was
way ahead in the polls I was pretty
clear it's going to win the election so
what they do put him in jail solitary
confinement 25-year sentence of
basically a death sentence prevented
from reading newspapers and journals and
crucially prevented from making a public
statement not like murderers and death
row this is right before the election
next step which is we should look
closely cuz it's a test run for the 2020
election here a massive campaign on the
social media which are the main source
of information for most of the
population presses of course mostly
right-wing but these are but the media
campaign is just unbelievable I mean the
the lies the fabrications the vitriol
you know the the Workers Party his party
is planning to turn every before the
boys into homosexuals it's gonna kill
religion they're gonna put out baby
bottles with penises as the nipples you
know on and on like this people believe
that you know they finally managed just
by these means you know shut up silence
the guy who's gonna probably gonna win
it's a flood the so-called information
system with grotesque lies and attacks
that can't be responded to and remember
we're going to see this soon we're
starting to see it already this is
testerone they managed to get into
office a guy who's the most outrageous
of the right-wing fanatics all over the
world I'm just illustrating this is a
guy who
when he was in the Parliament when he
voted for the impeachment of Dilma
Rousseff he dedicated his vote to her
torturer she was a guerrilla tortured by
the military regime he dedicated his
vote to her torturer the general who was
in charge of the torture he supports the
military dictatorship which was vicious
mm-hmm but with but he criticizes it too
because it didn't go far enough he said
it should it should have was too soft
they should have killed 30,000 people
like the Argentine's did the worst of
the military dictators yes he goes back
to the 19th century and criticizes the
Brazilian cavalry because they didn't do
what the Americans did wipe out the
indigenous population if they'd done
that we wouldn't have these problems
today in fact now that he's in office
now first of all he's his economics
adviser is a ultra-right Chicago boy
public ADA's his motto is literally
privatize everything sell the country
out to mostly foreign investors killed
right now they're killing the social
security system which is not that strong
but something hand everything over to
the rich and the powerful
the newest legislation has changed the
history books so that they don't
criticize the military dictatorship they
say it was necessary to protect the
country from communism he says the whole
country has been taken over but what's
called cultural Marxism including the
right-wing press University you've got a
block that science is finished we don't
support that we don't waste money on
that kind of stuff so the Brazilian
science is pretty powerful interesting
things coming in current so I mean this
is just indescribable and it's happening
in the most powerful country important
country in Latin America one of the most
important in the world with the strong
support of the United States very
powerful in fact this media campaign
and you can't prove it but it has all
the fingerprints of the people who've
been running these things elsewhere well
let's let's I want to try what it's
gonna get two linguist what you're not
gonna get to but look we've been a
sobering conversation in many ways but I
wanted to end by by talking about your
balance I mean we didn't get to talk
much about science a little bit but but
you've devoted much of your life to
writing your popular writing has been
other than interviews with you your
popular writing has been primarily on
issues that we've been talking about now
where is your your scientific writing in
linguistics has not been you know as far
as I know spend a lot of time on popular
books on linguistics okay and so I want
to and so I wanted to talk about that
balance is someone who also does science
and is written about science and and
writes about it this balance to ask you
wha whether you feel I've often people
often asked me if you felt compromised
because one takes away from the other
yeah and and I have my own answer to
that but I wanted to hear about yours
whether you felt that the the efforts
you've devoted to to exposing what you
view as fundamental problems that need
to be addressed for society has has of
course compromised potentially the time
you could have spent on linguistics and
philosophy and how you feel about that
if the world would go away I'd be much
happier just to keep to the scientific
philosophical issues that's really
intellectually exciting frankly these
issues we're now talking we've been
talking about are pretty superficial it
doesn't take much to figure them out and
understand them there's nothing profound
about it you don't have to have a PhD
and political science to talk about
these things the Guild's try to protect
themselves but the fact that it's not a
criticism of the fields I mean they're
yeah they're just too complicated yeah
so things are complicated you don't get
deep theories I mean physics is lucky if
things get too complicated just hand it
over to the chemist yeah physics is
easiest
you can't do that with human life you
know so it's but but the point is
anybody can understand these things if
they want it's not intellectually
exciting it's humanly significant and
it's there's a lot of frustration
because you know that what you're gonna
do is going to be smashed and
slaughtered in the mainstream with tons
of lies and attacks there's all kind of
evidence about this I won't go into it
so in a way it's you know it's kind of
like wasted in a sense except for the
whatever effect it may have for the
public so if it's wasted why if you do
it and it because I think it's just
critically important so like six say the
Vietnam War when Kennedy started
escalating the war
I really had I remember a personal
decision nobody cares about this am I
gonna start trying to do something about
it or can I keep to my work which was at
a very exciting period at the time it
was young person Department developing
all kind of new ideas and I knew
perfectly well from experience I have an
activist history yeah you put your one
toe in and pretty soon you're swimming
yeah you know just do a lot yeah any
better pound I just decided it's got to
be done you know it looked hopeless at
the time as I mentioned before it took
years before you could even talk about
these things but they're just too
important to let go i fact that Bertrand
Russell was asked once around the 19
late 1960s why he's wasting his time on
anti-nuclear activities when he could be
producing more serious work and
philosophy and logic and he said if I
don't work on the nuclear activities
nobody's gonna look at the philosophy of
logic well I think I mean you said it
before it looked hopeless in the Vietnam
War and ultimately it wasn't it was
really social it was really the raising
of consciousness about about by that war
that have ultimately forced the notice
that it's dual it was effective among
the population among the intellectual
classes basically zero but yet they
can't go beyond
it was a mistake no well yeah but I
nevertheless I think the lesson from
this is that we've spent two hours now
talking about largely talking about
problems that will depress people and
they're serious problems in the world
today but the fact that you chose that
you chose to devote much of your life
and time to at least talking about these
issues raising consciousness pointing
out that people could understand them
and that's the first step to action is
incredibly important and I think that's
why I feel I'm happy we were able to
spend this time and I think the world it
we're lucky that you did that and I'm
hoping that we will continue our
conversations and people who agree or
disagree will least be motivated to ask
the questions simple questions about
about the world that need to be asked if
we're gonna make if we're gonna try and
address the important challenges of the
21st century which are now global which
as you said not our just nuclear weapons
climate change we need to have these
discussions and I and literally millions
of people thank you for what you've done
thanks a lot no thanks
