I think one of the big points that Ilan
says is that language is kind of a low
bandwidth technology of communicating
between two humans do you ever look in
it that way like sometimes I feel like
if I could plug into your brain or you
could plug into someone else's brain we
might be able to come to a consensus yet
when we use these words back and forth
sometimes we seem to go away from
consensus do you ever think about that
I'm not addicted to science fiction
novels but if I was reading them I might
be addicted to it that's actually it's
just nothing to do with anything that's
understood I mean two things you can do
you can program in DARPA the defense of
the research branch of the Pentagon is
working on things like seeing if they
can pick up electrical signals from
neural activity which can be used to
direct actions like in theory could have
an airplane pilot think something and
have an instrument move
that's not inconceivable I mean it's
within the range of the limits of
understanding but trying to figure out
what the pilot is thinking about
we haven't
