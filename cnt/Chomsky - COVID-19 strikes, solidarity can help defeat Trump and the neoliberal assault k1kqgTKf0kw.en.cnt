welcome to push back I'm Erin Matt a I'm
joined today by Noam Chomsky know'm
always an honor to speak to you on
Friday International Workers day Mayday
there are gonna be some strikes at major
corporations by frontline workers
including Amazon and Whole Foods Target
instacart having lived through the Great
Depression having witnessed how people
coped and struggled and resisted what
can labor actions like this mean for a
movement a mass movement that could be
formed to respond to the corona virus
crisis and to address all of the
failings of the health and economic
system that it's shown us well
throughout modern history the labor
action has been at the forefront of
general activism and protest during the
1930s my childhood I recall very well
seeing the workers picketing factories
that's the labor movement had been
virtually crushed in the 1920s revived
and the 30s became quite militant moved
on even as far as sit-down strikes which
are a major threat to private capital it
was a sit-down strike is just one step
before saying we can run this plant
ourselves you don't eat the roses so
let's get rid of them and take it over
now that led to reaction but there was a
sympathetic administration and labor
historian Eric Loomis very important
work has reviewed a long series of cases
and shown that labor militancy and other
activism
succeeded when there was a more or less
sympathetic or least tolerant
administration but not when there was
one that was rock-solid opposed to the
and we've seen the crushing of the labor
movement again during the neoliberal
period since Reagan number three gun and
Thatcher who initiated this period began
their terms by sharp attacks on the
labor movement they knew exactly what
they were doing so did their corporate
bosses and associates and it's reduced
the labor movement to a small level but
recently there has been an upsurge in
labor actions and strikes he's calming
ones on Friday or another indication of
the Amazon strikes have already had a
significant effect a couple of months
ago major Amazon actions led to fees
this - but I think ten million dollars
or something like not much for him and
to work on dealing with the climate
crisis he's pledged to move Amazon to
zero emissions status it would never
have had the labor action visible shift
of the Democratic paradigm to the left
in the last period is the actions of
militant activism in the Sanders
campaign other actions and that can make
a big difference as for the character
run over it's actually very relevant to
that it's not not a matter of finding a
cure that's a different matter but if we
look at the corona virus and ask what it
comes from it comes from a massive
market failure colossal market failure
which is right at the heart of
capitalist logic generally intensified
by the neoliberal a hammer blow which
has hit the economy and the Society for
the last 40 years so you go back to 2003
there was a major corona virus epidemic
so I was epidemic it was handled and
contained but scientists at the time
knew perfectly will that they were very
likely to be a recurrence of one or
another variant of the corona virus and
they've been warning about it ever since
so it was common knowledge but knowledge
does not suffice somebody has to do
something with obvious candidate is the
big drug companies have huge profits
they have massive resources they're not
interested they follow capitalist logic
there's no profit to be made in
preparing for a likely catastrophe
couple years down the road and for that
matter an ante pandemic virus is not
profitable not people take it for a
short time the thing disappears and who
cares you don't make any money out of it
I think you make money on things you can
keep selling to people every year so the
drug companies are out that's capitalist
logic but then comes the neoliberal
hammer-blow
what about government why don't they
move in and do it as they've done many
times in fact basic serious research on
almost every domain is it's done in the
public domain but the government funded
institutions and so on University
research centers and others so why don't
they come in well here you get
neoliberalism every
and remembers in reagan's little speech
for this sunny smile about how a
government is not the solution
government is the problem
so we can't have government we have to
and decision-making away from government
which is under some degree of public
influence and is therefore bed I hand it
over to private corporations totally
unaccountable over the pro public
tyrannies basically following the guru
of the time Milton Friedman they have to
be committed solely to greed so we have
to have for themselves management rich
shareholders and so on that's
neoliberalism so that and we've suffered
not just we but much of the world has
been suffering from for 40 years well ok
back to 2003 government can't step in so
you have a major crisis the year after
year after that they were repeated
warnings the plaintiff indications that
it's likely then comes a third issue
particular cover Minh sandals a very so
we happen to be in a super neoliberal
ultra-right administration total fealty
to corporate sector and private wealth
no interest in anyone else
despite some superficial rhetoric so
what happened in the Trump
administration every year defunding of
the Center for Disease Control defunding
of other health-related aspects of the
government it's not profitable for the
rich and powerful elimination of major
programs which would have if somebody
working in China with China's tiny
scientists that would have left the
country was given the country some
advance notice of what's happening
result is the United States is
singularly unprepared got worse after
the news came that contrary to the
massive Yellow Peril propaganda that's
going on at China was very quick and
identifying the problem and very
forthcoming with information the first
indications that something was going on
and who on were in December they were
pneumonia like symptoms unknown etiology
China had once reported it to the World
Health Organization hence to the world
very quickly much faster than under SARS
Chinese scientists identified it as a
corona virus sequence the genome had
presented all the relevant material to
the world was rolled out by January 10th
then comes the question how countries
react there were some who reacted right
away Taiwan South Korea New Zealand
Australia Singapore they have it pretty
much under control as does China where
the severe crisis was others you're kind
of dithered and pay much attention to
these invasions but they finally got
their act together and are more reacting
in one way or another something some of
them pretty effectively some worse the
United States at the bottom of the
barrel the news could not get to the
White House intelligence agencies were
banging at the doors warning about it
and we just learned a couple days ago
that there were regular high-level daily
briefings to trump
condensed to his tiny attention span but
none of this could get through it's just
the flu just want to give away would be
a miracle I'm in charge okay meanwhile
tens of thousands of Americans are dying
when it finally got through to
probably because he could see that the
stock park stock market was collapsing
that he can see but anyway for whatever
reason it got through to him in March
two months late situations out of hand
and what's more he makes it he's
insistent on making it worse
it's astonishing to watch so in just a
couple of days ago he fired the
scientists whose it in the head who's in
charge of supervision of vaccine
development perfect guy to fire why'd he
fire him because he said something about
the quack medicines that Trump was
trying to peddle to the population so we
get rid of him actually the most
striking part is the federal budget in
February February 10th pandemic is
raging Trump releases his budget for the
coming year further defunding of the
Center for Disease Control additional
funding in subsidies for fossil fuel
industries which are creating a far
greater crisis than coronavirus we don't
have to go into the details but they are
creating a terminal crisis so we have to
subsidize them more of course more
funding for the loaded military and for
his famous wall to save us save us from
all those rapists murder reasons of our
feeling to his popular base and it goes
on in April Trump or his tactician 'he's
got the brilliant idea of telling the
government we can't help you that we
happen to have all the resources and all
the wealth what is your problem you
can't make a treaty it was a another
country to look at an arrangement to
bring in needed and ventilators we can
but it's your business that's
brilliant tactic but that means if
something goes wrong which it's almost
certain to do you can blame the
governor's well if you're my colleague
blame the blue state governors and if by
accident something happens to work we
can say look what a brilliant genius I
am that made the greatest decision in
history Shawn haunted and Hannity will
collapse over its brilliance tomorrow
it's a perfect strategy kills a lot of
people but who cares actually much worse
than this and getting nowhere near the
attention it ought to as the decision to
defund but the World Health Organization
this is part of the effort and
increasingly desperate effort on the
part of the administration to find
somebody to blame for their own crimes
so an international institution people
don't like you can blame them what's the
effect of defunding the World Health
Organization
he's not just defunding we've since
learned that the attempt is to destroy
it get rid of it
what's the effect well there's huge
numbers of people in places like Africa
who are dependent on World Health
Organization services for survival
just from the corona virus that's yet to
it and it'll be monstrous but there many
other diseases so let's pull out the rug
from under them and kill unknown numbers
of people because maybe I can prove
improves my ratings with the right-wing
public I mean that stuff is going on
almost daily in front of our eyes I mean
it's really malevolence to a degree
that's pretty hard to comprehend and
it's quite characteristic of this
sociopathic administration we can which
is in the lead and in fact unique in the
world aside from some sidekicks like
Wilson oil and Brazil the unique in the
and not just trying to do something to
deal with the climate crisis which is
extraordinary but seeking to accelerate
it doing everything possible to maximize
the use of fossil fuels and to eliminate
regulations which would constrain them
and protect the population that's the of
course on the side
the main legislation is how to stuff
well as the pockets of the wealthy with
more dollars like this tax can well
there's another thing going on which is
of enormous and measurements and that is
stuffing the judiciary from top to
bottom with ultra-right young lawyers
who will ensure that whatever the public
wants or whatever political changes take
place but no progressive legislation can
be implemented for a generation maybe
longer and of course there are other
things happening to me you know let me
ask you about one one more grave danger
under Trump because we could talk about
this issue forever and there are many
other topics I want to ask you about but
also what is happening under Trump and
this is something you've spoken about
but gets very little attention is the
dismantling of global global agreements
to limit the nuclear weapons stockpiles
of the US and Russia Trump has killed
the INF treaty
now they chemists raishin is talking
about killing the Open Skies treaty and
we also have quite likely if the current
situation proceeds on pace the
dismantling of the last remaining
limitations on the nuclear stockpile of
the New START treaty why do you think
this gets so little attention just
astonishing no matter how much you bring
it up how often you stress it ears are
just closed I mean you're absolutely
right this is on a par easily with it
coming environmental catastrophe
you can't see it in front of you every
day the way you can see a flood or a
drought or something like that but it's
there and Trump is dedicated to
destroying the entire arms control
regime the INF treaty was a Reagan
treaty Reagan Gorbachev that had to be
destroyed not only did he insist on
destroying it but to do it in a
particularly provocative way it was last
August
immediately after dismantling to get
kicking the treaty destroying it
instantly by the administration launched
missiles which violated the treaty now
that's telling the Russians
you better violate it fast and develop
weapons to destroy us and then we'll
work developing the countermeasures
which won't work of course although all
of this pours money into the pockets of
the military military industry which is
just exalting over this and maybe the
political system and candidates no
there's not talking about it but
military industries buffeted and the
open starts the Open Skies treaty that
goes back to that famous radical way to
Eisenhower so we ought to kill that one
it's also been quite effective in
reducing threats and a new start the one
that's coming up well put the Russians
have been virtually pleading for it to
be extended let the Trump administration
says no we can't do it is this a meant
taking colony that would do most of the
control over to complete nonsense but
when that one goes exactly as you say
we're done no more regulation everybody
is encouraged to build up as much as
they want actually there's something
else that can't be heard with
critically important that we ought to
think about there supposed to be a one
of the one of trumps major contributions
was to dismantle the to the joint
agreement with European countries and
Iran on the Iranian nuclear programs was
very effective while US intelligence
agreed that Iran was living up to it
entirely trust had cut back their
nuclear programs Trump had to kill it in
this case probably because Obama
initiated it so therefore he has to kill
us that's the general rule of the
administration uh no we're told there at
a nuclear weapons are a great threat
we've got to do something about okay
beside the reality of the claims but
they're there we hear him all the time
now that's leading to very likely not
only increasing tensions in the Gulf
region but they could blow up could lead
to a major war but is there a way to
deal with his problem I don't think
about it since obvious Institute a
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle
East is that a problem could have very
intensive inspections just like the JCP
the joint agreement and spectrums they
can work so what's stopping him
the Arab states strongly in favorable
light they are the ones we initiated the
proposal 25 years ago that we keep
pressing for Iran is strongly in favor
of it as an online countries that's most
of the world about a hot former non line
g77 bit cold about a hundred and thirty
countries strongly in favor of it
there's no opposition that I know of
from Europe why doesn't it get institute
because there's a country called the
United States and this one's bipartisan
every time it
up in the international relevant
international meetings the
non-proliferation trial treaty means the
u.s. kills it most recent was Obama 2015
it's coming up again in early next year
probably killed again but nobody talks
about it except in the arms control
community but why is it being killed
very simple if he instituted you have to
open up
Israel's massive nuclear weapons program
to public inspection we got to prevent
that fact the US has a special reason
for preventing us aid to Israel is
probably arguably illegal because of
Israel's nuclear weapons program
Symington amendment back in 1974 I think
well if you could go down that track not
only is our Israel's programs inspected
which is an unacceptable but you even
might have to cancel USA did Israel no
big thing
so therefore the U is one of the reasons
why the US does not officially concede
that Israel has a nuclear weapons
program
of course it's common knowledge which
can't concede it because it opens these
doors so if you think about it we're
facing major war
devastating consequences in order to
ensure that no one looks at Israel's
nuclear weapons program that's nothing
to think about this is never discussed
I'll put the main figure the point you
made is exactly correct the dismantling
of the arms control regime which is an
enormous threat to survival is just off
the record we can't get anybody to pay
attention to that's a former defense
secretary William Perry who's one of his
life on nuclear issues pretty much of
all says he's not just terrified about
the growing nuclear threat he's doubly
terrified because she can't get anyone
to pay attention to it it's very hard to
break through London if I could share my
theory and why I think it doesn't get
talked about that much at least on the
Democratic side and I'm wondering if you
agree is because after Trump won
Democrats decided made a very conscious
decision Democratic leaders to resist
him from the right when it comes to the
issue of Russia to constantly accuse him
of being soft on Russia and even a
Russian agent or a Russian conspirator
and so acknowledging any of the number
of extremely hawkish policies that Trump
in reality actually has towards Russia
such as increasing the threat of a
nuclear holocaust by tearing up these
vital arms control treaties with Russia
would undermine the conspiracy theories
and the hawkish Cold War agenda the
Democrats have embraced as their
strategy since 2016 could be and Trump's
policies go way beyond as you of course
know beyond dismantling the arms control
thing he's carrying out very provocative
military maneuvers and exercises right
on the Russian border all the way up to
the Arctic for the first time these are
highly provocative weather
sharply increasing the dangers of war
but you might be right
that's a Democratic Party talking point
let me ask you about the 2020 election
and my question touches on some of what
you've already raised which is that so
many especially foreign policy agendas
are bipartisan blind support for Israel
and I think in trying to you know talk
to people about the message that you've
been promoting for for many years now
not just in this election that the the
task on a single day which is all it
takes to vote is to defeat the worst
possible outcome so in this case voting
for a Biden and against Trump but one
obstacle to I think convincing many
progressives or at least the ones that I
know of that argument is that they see
so much convergence when it comes to
foreign policy so for example Obama and
Biden gave us the war on Libya the proxy
war in Syria it's true that they gave us
the nuclear deal with Iran but before
that they gave us the murderous
sanctions on Iran that Trump has since
reimpose so from the point of view of so
many of these policies being bipartisan
how could a Biden administration be an
improvement we're faced with a situation
in which we have a Democratic Party
candidate who has a very ugly history
you've just given some of the major
examples but is moving significantly to
the left and not because it's his choice
but because of the constant activism and
pressure that partly from the Sanders
campaign partly from other activist
campaigns it is an administration which
is you look at the party program to the
left of any preceding Democratic for
program susceptible the pressure and
that pressure can continue it can move
it further we're back to the point about
that Eric Loomis made that I described
earlier we had the alternative as a
trump administration which is rock-solid
opposed to and will totally block any
possible popular pressure not to the
left okay
furthermore an overwhelmingly
significant the Trump administration is
dedicated to the destruction of human
society on earth within a short time
that is the precise meaning of their
employers environmental policies okay I
wanna mince words that's exactly what
they mean that's absolutely not true
anything on the Democratic side not
great by any means but nowhere near that
effect much more in tune with the more
the better parts of the world on this
well that's an enormous difference
another enormous difference is things
like the dedication of the perfect
willingness a trump administration to
Acharya almost any crime you can think
of to advance electoral prospects you
want to kill a lot of people in the
Africa by killing the World Health
Organization fine do that that you want
to toss children and concentration camps
on the border do that whatever you think
of that furthermore the stuff in the
judiciary is it an overwhelmingly
significant fact that means everything's
killed for a generation at least okay
that's the McConnell strategy goes back
before Trump for and this is combined
with efforts of the
Republican governors to try to block
voting but this is enormous Georgia and
Florida efforts in Wisconsin is to kick
out african-americans and disenfranchise
them so you can maintain minority
popular rule well that's got to
intensify with the blessing of the
Supreme Court the most reactionary court
in living memory dismantling the Voting
Rights Act was a gift to those who want
to destroy the democratic process
whatever such as it is these are huge
differences yes there are commonalities
on some points but we have two parties
one of which can be influenced the other
which not and I should say the Trump
administration is unlike earlier
Republican administrations in this
respect so Richard Nixon the Ronald
Reagan were at demonstrably influenced
by mass popular protests that's not
going to happen with Trump well this is
psychopathic megalomania of a different
kind for them when he surrounded himself
with sycophants and cowards we were just
going to shine his shoes and repeat it
this is something unique in political
history it's not just the ordinary
right-wing reactionary administration
so we really have I think a very sharp
choice at this point may not like either
one but that's the world we live in we
can't pretend we live in another world
we can go on changing it you don't stop
discuss elections are coming and then we
should be clear there is a traditional
left doctrine on this which we should
adhere to seems they've been sidetracked
but let's remember what matters in
politics is constant activism every
couple of years
event comes up called an election which
have to take 15 minutes off and decide
is it worth pushing the lever and
sometimes it is sometimes it isn't if
it's worth it you push the lever and
then you go back to work
that's the left doctrine there's also an
official document that tells you the
only thing is you think about is
elections concentrate on that devote
your attention to that that once you've
pushed your lever go home and four years
from now we'll ask you to come and push
the lever again that's the official
document we should keep to the
traditional talking I should mention
that there's a new doctrine that showed
up in the last couple of years I've
never heard of it before it's now so
popular to you and used by its initials
le V live lesser evil voting I don't
know what that is it's never been on the
agenda before certainly not on the left
you don't feel if it's not worth it you
vote to a Republican when they used to
be a party just not an issue but that's
displaced the left up so it is an
enormous amount of focus and discussion
and debate on the left about the lesser
evil doctrine which is like was invented
by the people who are attacking and
there's never been such a doctrine
before there is a doctrine that says
every once in a while it's worth taking
a couple of minutes and deciding if
there's a significant distinction
between the candidates voted against the
worst one then go back to work now
that's the left Duncan and we should
keep today and in this case for those 15
minutes it's a very simple choice I like
either of them but there's great two
enormous differences affect ones is so
great that the fate of human survival
depends on
I remember when Obama was running the
first time and there was a lot of
enthusiasm for him I remember you saying
that we should elect Obama but without
illusions and the without illusions part
spoke to the need you argued for
sustained activism to pressure Obama and
that didn't happen pretty much obama won
and he told his movement to go home and
it wasn't really revived until only i
you could argue with the Occupy movement
and I guess what I wanted hearing you
speak about the possibilities to
influence a potential Biden
administration in a positive direction
I suppose one really positive thing on
that front is that Biden is not Obama
he's not nearly as smooth not nearly as
convincing an actor and not nearly as
demobilizing to people because Obama was
very good at making people think that he
was doing something with lofty rhetoric
while really carrying on with the same
policy so I'm wondering if you see the
fact that Biden is just so much less
convincing and and has a lot of flaws
he's obviously slowed down a bit with
age whether you see that as a positive
for the ability to send his
administration in a positive direction
with sustained activism it's not only a
prediction it's happened take a look at
the party program it's very heavily
influenced by the Sanders movement and
the general activism of the last couple
of years
compare the program with any preceding
one well you're I think you're right
Obama was a very smooth operator in fact
as you probably recall after right after
the 2008 election shortly after there
was a meeting of the the annual meeting
of the professional association of
advertisers they give out an award every
year to the greatest marketing campaign
of the year Obama won it overwhelmingly
way ahead of
amateurs like Apple and Google those
they could see what's happening so it
was a great marketing campaign and who
can change and all that stuff
the Aleutians lasted for maybe two years
until the the bailout I think that
crushing blow which led all the way to
trump was the bailout after the housing
collapse and financial crisis Congress
passed legislation with saying okay
bailout the perpetrators cuz it argument
that was right or wrong but they decided
on that so bailout those who caused the
crisis but give aid and support to the
victims to the people who lost their own
zone foreclosures and so on from Obama
fulfilled the first part completely
totally forgot about the second part
it's like in 2010 there was an election
in Massachusetts Ted Kennedy died by
election masters a very liberal state
the Democratic candidate with Liberal
candidate lost that one of the reasons
was that even Union voters didn't want
to vote for the Democrats and they felt
they'd been screwed Republican once and
we see now that the pressure popular
pressure following the left
Dawson constant popular pressure has
shifted the party to the left and if it
continues serving the Biden wins that
continues they can keep his feet to the
fire well it can you've seen it happen
even it was Republicans certainly here
but it's got to continue we have to go
back to the traditional left
Darkman politics is active ism
there's a break brief break to decide
whether the take off a couple of minutes
and would then you go back to work
that's the right well could that even
begin right now with Biden in terms of I
know that Bernie has endorsed biten as
he said he would do with whoever won the
primary but could Bernie's movement I
mean given that it's relatively early
it's may could Bernie's movement be
organized in a way that withhold the
endorsement of many people unless Biden
actually commits explicitly to
progressive policies such as Medicare
for all
well that's a tactic that's proposed but
it's kind of meaningless now first of
all if the if widens advisors are
bothering to think they know it's empty
at least if the people if the people who
are advocating this are serious and care
about the country they're going to vote
for Biden anyway if there's a very
simple point that a lot of people don't
seem to see but very simple if you take
a vote away from Wyden it amounts to the
same thing as adding a vote to Trump so
if you decide I'm not going to vote for
Biden that's the same as if you know
John Doe comes out of the woodwork and
says okay I'm going to vote for Trump
changes it but in fact to think it
through it's actually Tim votes for
Trump if you don't do it but it's not
going to the details it's essentially
voting for Trump so if the promise if
the threat is at all meaningful if
people mean it they're gonna vote for
Trump anyway providing anyway so why pay
attention if they don't mean it's not
worth talking to them there are people
who are willing to see the country
destroyed because they didn't get what
they wanted so it's just it's just not a
useful tactic and it's not going to
affect the party program what will
affect the party program is what as
been affecting it all along namely the
constant activism so keep demanding we
want this on the on the program we want
this empty threats don't help that it
just diminish you know the idea that
sometimes proposed is that well this
will make the Democratic Party pay
attention to us so four years from now
maybe they'll be different first of all
that's not going to happen
secondly the timescale is all wrong four
more years is crumpled we're in deep
trouble
so we got to get rid of this malignancy
now we know how to do it take a couple
minutes on November and push the lever
and meanwhile keep the pressure on and
keep the pressure on afterwards that's
the tactic that works we've seen it work
if Biden were elected I could easily see
him returning to the Iran deal that his
administration signed when it comes to
another place that is being subjected to
murderous US sanctions right now
venezuela biden has pretty much endorsed
Trump's policy of regime change and
sanctions although he may be open to
some limited relief during the
coronavirus crisis do you think that a
country like Venezuela could hang on
if these sanctions continue I think you
you know we don't know they might be
able to survive somehow
the thing that's happening to them and
that's the collapse of the oil price
whether they can hold out I don't know
but on this issue instead of
conjecturing about what might happen we
should ask what we can do I think all
the sanctions are almost all of them are
totally illegitimate and we should be
working on getting them eliminated
that's the thing to be doing
we should be protesting loudly making
the point educating
that won't happen strum but together if
Biden gets elected to get him to
eliminate all the sanctions that goes
way back to the sanctions on Cuba right
now I mean the United States has had
cruel brutal sanctions on Cuba almost
from almost as when it became
independent shortly after I was also
combined with the massive terrorist
campaign the whole world is opposed to
those sanctions they come up every year
in the United Nations General Assembly
of the United States is alone in
opposing them I mean Israel joins to the
United States but they have to so it's
basically the United States against the
world as it is on issue after issue and
what activists should be doing is
working to educate organized terror had
actions to get rid of the whole
sanctions regime that's what you do and
it can be done yeah there was a slight
success with Obama not much but some it
could be more with even under Reagan as
you touched on before their popular
protest made a difference in scaling
back the Contra war on Nicaragua
not just then is that in particular in
fact was what Reagan had to do was
Reagan was carrying out a terrorist
state of it the RIC terrorist war
against just about every country in
Central America Congress blocked some of
it he couldn't give aid directly to
Guatemala
one of the worst killers so what Reagan
had to do was organize an international
terror network of states with other
countries use individual terrorists like
Carlos the Jackal we're a guy we used
terrorist States so
when Congress blocked funding of the
Guatemalan mass murders Reagan brought
in the Argentine neo-nazis the worst of
all the Nazi regimes in Latin America
Taiwanese mercenaries Israel which was
right at the center of it corta Mullen
armies complete almost completely armed
with Israeli arms and instructors I had
to bring in the states to do well that's
much less efficient then well are just
funding them it was the way he wanted to
do so yes that was popular pressure the
same with the Contra war he couldn't he
had to find devious ways of doing it
less efficient ways which pretty awful
I'll solve it for them all even worse
but pretty awful that could have been a
lot worse
there's another thing about the pressure
on Reagan you'll recall that there were
huge enormous protests in the early 80s
against the middle of the nuclear
weapons build-up I think there's a
pretty good reason to believe that that
was part of the background for his
agreeing with Gorbachev to establish the
INF treaty in the case of Nixon there's
by now quite powerful evidence that the
mass popular protests aborted his plans
to carry out attacks maybe up to the
level of nuclear war against North
Vietnam say yes pressures didn't work
and against and with a more
accommodating administration maybe an
empty shell administration like Biden
that could work even more but they have
to be applied you can't go home after
the election I was in the Obama case you
mentioned and say it's all in good hands
no I'm finally a lot of people are
feeling demoralized right now
people have lost their income their
healthcare stuck at home in in
challenging circumstances you've
witnessed struggles all around the world
from Gaza to Central America you've
interacted very closely with people
organizing under impossible
circumstances to resist repressive
forces backed by the US hegemon I'm
wondering if just as we close you can
share some words on what you've learned
about human resiliency and the capacity
to resist from some of these places that
you've visited and worked with in
supporting freedom struggles incredible
well I've been in many such places some
of them pretty intimately Gaza southern
Colombia Kurdish areas of Turkey those
lots of parts of the world it is amazing
to see people resist one of the one of
the most amazing the real miracle is
East Timor
significant that's the scene of the
worst genocide per capita since the
Second World War it looked like a
hopeless struggle here we have it tiny
half island 600,000 people trying to
defend themselves against a huge
military power that just invaded which
is supported by the United States and
supported by Europe I mean the you can't
get a word into the media about it
nobody can hear the refugees how could
they possibly survive they did with the
help of a small group of activists here
most of whom whose names are unknown
like most of the important people in
history just to mention one Arnold Cohen
so that offers a grad student did
amazing organizing work kept this issue
alive internationally and in the United
States is joined by others somehow they
survived it's no country that's reviving
in function so again it's because people
do have this astonishing capacity to
resist and it's not only abroad I take
my childhood the depression my extended
family was
generation immigrant working-class most
unemployed the conditions were much
worse than they are now much worse but
they never gave up hope they were in
fact the period is I remember it was a
much more hopeful one then today even
though the conditions are far better put
in for them bad today but far better
than they were then
these are internal issues you can resist
if you developed the internal resources
that allow you to and we see this right
in front of us doctors and nurses on the
front line for example are carrying out
acts of amazing courage and sensitivity
and ability to fight against
overwhelming odds you look around the
country and around the world in fact you
see places where people are organizing
in communities poor communities people
just getting together to figure out ways
to bring in food help disabled persons
that things are just developing
spontaneously the labor movement is
reviving you mentioned an example the
stories all of this can continue it
makes a big difference
Noam Chomsky always a pleasure thank you
so much
you
