the point of public relations slogans
like support our troops is that they
don't mean anything they mean as much as
whether you support the people in Iowa
of course there was an issue the issue
was do you support our policy but you
don't want people to think about the
issue that's the whole point of good
propaganda you want to create a slogan
that nobody's going to be against the
Nesbo's everybody for because nobody
knows what it means because doesn't mean
anything but it's crucial value is it
diverts your attention from a question
that does mean something do you support
our policy and that's the one you're not
allowed to talk about so you have people
arguing about do I support the troops
you know of course I I don't will not
support them and so on and then you've
won that's like Americanism and harmony
we're all together you know empty
slogans that somehow join in on let's
make sure that we don't have these bad
people around who disrupt all of our
harmony with their talk about class
struggle and their rights and that sort
of business well that's all very
effective it runs right up to the day
and of course it is carefully thought
out you know the people in the public
relations industry aren't there for the
fun of it they're doing work they're
trying to instill the right values in
fact they have a conception of what a
democracy ought to be it ought to be a
system in which the specialized class
are trained in order to do their work
for the service of the Masters and the
rest of the population ought to be
deprived of any form of organization
because organization just causes trouble
they ought to be sitting alone in front
of the television set and having drilled
into their heads they lay the message
which says the only value in life is to
have more commodities or to live like
that rich middle-class family are
watching and to be have nice values like
harmony and Americanism and that's all
there is in life you may think in your
own head that there's got to be
something more in life than this but
since you're watching the tube alone you
assume I must be crazy because that's
all that's going on over
there and since there is no Organization
permitted that's absolutely crucial you
never have a way of finding out whether
you're crazy
and and you just assume it because it's
the natural thing to assume so that's
that's the ideal and great efforts are
made into trying to achieve that ideal
and there is a certain conception of
democracy behind it the conception of
democracy is the one that I mentioned
that we wildered heard are a problem
we've got to prevent their rage and
trampling we've got to distract them
they should be watching the Super Bowl
or sitcoms or you know violent movies or
something every once in a while you call
on them to chant meaningless slogans
like support our troops and you scare
they got to keep them pretty scared
because unless they're scared properly
and frightened of all kind of devils
that are going to destroy them from
outside you know or inside or somewhere
they may start to think which is very
dangerous because they're not competent
to think and therefore it's important to
distract them and marginalize them well
that's the conception of democracy and
in fact going back to the business
community the last legal victory for
labor really was 1935 the Wagner Act
after the war came the decline of unions
and in fact of a very rich working class
culture that was associated with the
unions that was destroyed and we did
move to of to a business run society at
a remarkable level this is the only
capitalist state capitalist society
industrial society which doesn't have
even the normal social contract that you
find in comparable societies so outside
of South Africa I guess this is the only
industrial society that doesn't even
have national health care that where
there's no general commitment even
minimal standards of survival for the
parts of the population that can't
follow those rules and gain things for
themselves individually unions are
virtually non-existent other forms of
popular structure or virtually
non-existent there's no political
parties no political organizations it's
a long way towards
not totally but a long way towards
towards the ideal at least structurally
the media or corporate monopoly
basically have the same point of view
the two parties or two factions of the
business party
most of the population doesn't even
bother voting because it looks
meaningless and they're just the you
know they're marginalized and properly
distracted at least that's the the goal
the
you
