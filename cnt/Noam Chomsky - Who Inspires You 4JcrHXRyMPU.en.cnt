who inspires you right now is there
anybody who's stepping up to provide
these answers
tell the truth i could never point in my
lifetime
to notable people who inspired me
so take say the civil rights movement a
very important development and
martin luther king was a very admirable
person but he didn't inspire me
what inspired me was snick workers
students mostly
young students first from black colleges
in the south
joined by others who sat in on lunch
counters and
rode freedom buses and were getting
beaten and killed and
basically laid the groundwork for a
popular movement where
martin luther king could come and be an
eloquent spokesman
it's unprecedented gathering of young
people
i cannot help thinking about a hundred
years from now
the historians will be calling this
not the peak generation but the
generation of integration
i'm sure he would have agreed that the
movement was created and led
by the young activists on the ground
most of them are gone from history
as is usually the case
