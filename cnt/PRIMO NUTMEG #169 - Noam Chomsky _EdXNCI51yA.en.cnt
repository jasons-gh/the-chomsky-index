there's no evidence of any Russian
effect on the presidential election
certainly not on the Senate or House
elections which made exactly the same
way and there's no charge of Russia's
interference and then the rest of the
story that I just mentioned about actual
interference so it's not a serious
charge
I mean there's lots of things to condemn
about Trump but not that
[Music]
so thank you again for meeting with me
and this is actually our fifth interview
over the last 15 years and I always get
nervous like it's the first time and you
know I was talking to some of your fans
online and that they said that the first
thing they wanted me to ask you is just
how are you how is everything since you
relocated to Tucson do you miss Boston
chewing it here yeah doing fine
do you miss Boston at all or do you miss
Boston at all well I've lived there for
70 years and like that there's lots of
things I like there but I'm happy to be
here that's good what do you like about
living here the lifestyle it's very
different for us
enjoy the teach very different kind of
teaching that I've ever done I've always
taught at elite universities this is a
state university teaching undergraduates
or good colleagues the social political
environment is very exciting an
interesting one my wife Valeria found a
fabulous place out in the desert right
foot of a mountain turned it into a kind
of a desert paradise which we enjoy it's
wonderful tools not chicken coop
it sounds great not Cambridge so getting
into politics the first thing I want to
ask you is about Venezuela cuz obviously
that's the big news of the day and you
know there seems to be an attempted coup
underway whether or not that that's
failed I guess is a question and what
the u.s. is going to do now under the
guise of humanitarian aid so just what's
your overall thought on the situation on
Maduro as government and the claims of a
humanitarian crisis well there's I mean
there's a lot of factors here it's worth
first of all going back a little bit
into the history
not deep into the history but Chavez
Hugo Chavez came into office in 1999
there was a short period in which the US
was kind of testing the waters seeing if
he could be controlled pretty soon it
was obviously couldn't be and in 2002
there was a military coup we should not
forget that the military coup deposed
the president disbanded Parliament
throughout the court supreme court it
was openly supported by the United
States it was lauded by the press as a
wonderful step the people that the coup
was overturned in a couple of days by a
popular uprising and pretty remarkably
the people involved in the coup even the
Venezuelan media that supported the coup
were left pretty much untouched would
that have happened here if there was a
military coup okay the at that point the
u.s. turned to kind of subversion
sabotage economic warfare the economic
the political the elite elements are
pretty rabid all through Latin America
the class hatred is extreme they didn't
like Chavez's policies and they didn't
like him he's he openly fluence his afro
indigenous background that's not the
kind of person they they don't want like
he carried out variety of programs could
describe in them but the most important
evidence about the nature of his
programs is how Venezuelans felt about
it that's the important question well we
know there's a respected polling agency
in Chile Latino borough Montreux takes
regular
investigations of attitudes and opinions
throughout Latin America every year
throughout the Chavez years Venezuela
ranked right at the top alongside
Uruguay in support for the government
and support for democracy that there
were regular elections they were
carefully monitored declared to be free
and fair Carter the quarter of the
system investigated them in others there
was a sharp reduction in poverty there
was in more inclusiveness of the
educational system improvements in
health the sort of the majority of
population like all through Latin
America is a quite very poor they were
given a kind of a voice and some sort of
dignity current observers seem to think
that they're still even the Maduro
government which is pretty bad in many
ways there's still strong support for
them just how is the Maduro government
pat well after go on after Chavez died
Maduro took over his economic policies
or machacas had economic policies that
were very poorly executed and the dora
made the much worse terrible policies
which really caused the economy to have
serious problems furthermore one of the
one of the errors that Chavez made was
to not to try to diversify the economy
it's a colonial economy that the u.s.
took over Venezuela realm a century ago
when oil was found it had been a British
protectorate of the u.s. kicked the
British out on ceremoniously took it
over support of it most dictators the
usual story
but it kept the economy almost entirely
reliant on oil and Chavez didn't change
that of the second mistake was the
technical one that during the period of
high oil prices
he used the funds for the social
programs for International Programs he
was providing cheap oil to poor
countries like Haiti
he was even providing she boiled to poor
people in Boston I don't know if you
know the rest yeah I remember that but
there were no reserves set aside and of
course when that meant that when the
price dropped after his death of the
country didn't have reserves to the
function but had to turn to
international credit markets which are
dominated by a hostile United States
that made it difficult to proceed under
the best of circumstances medoras
government was economically padilla had
terrible economic programs and also as
the opposition increased often violent
they responded with considerable
repression so it became a very dangerous
situation meanwhile the u.s. instituted
sanctions which are so extreme that even
the opposition economists criticize them
they're just strangling the country
the idea is to totally strangle the
country well you asked about a
humanitarian crisis I it's it's hard to
know the press is so hostile and has
been since the very beginning that it's
very hard to determine how reliable the
reports are there are individuals going
down who give her a different picture
maximum thought I believe just result
appraisal Amar's all the most recent one
is Ken silverstein who was a very
credible reporter as a long activist
as an experience and he just has an
article I think maybe in the Atlantic or
somewhere which gives a much more
positive picture also of popular support
for even the Maduro government despite
its serious flaws there were plenty of
problems under chavez so for example
there was an enormous amount of
corruption he himself didn't seem to be
involved but he didn't he didn't control
it or ended that were human rights
abuses not on the scale of the other of
the u.s. dependencies in the region but
serious enough I was involved and
protesting so in them so it wasn't the
idea that it was a contrary to the
claims on all sides it was not a
socialist government of the rich were
left free enriched themselves a
capitalist free wage labor continued
that were reform measures but nothing
like socialism well let me ask you just
in the context of the 2020 presidential
campaign it seems to be a point of
contention on the Left Bernie Sanders
had a sign between a couple weeks ago
where he said the people of Venezuela
are enduring a serious humanitarian
crisis the Maduro government must put
the needs of its people first allow
humanitarian aid into the country and
refrain from violence against protesters
and there are a lot of people on the
Left who took issue with this so that
they were disappointed in Bernie Sanders
one of them was Roger Waters from the
band Pink Floyd don't know if you
familiar with them but he said Bernie
are you effing kidding me
if you buy the Trump Bolton Abrams Rubio
line humanitarian intervention and
collude in the destruction of Venezuela
you cannot be a credible candidate for
president of the USA or maybe you can
maybe you're the perfect stooge for the
1% so there seems like there's a lot of
the sentiment on the left where the US
should really completely stay out of
Venezuela and even doing something about
the alleged humanitarian aid when we
some forms a weedless there's a way to
improve the humanitarian the situation
the the humanitarian situation very
simple one eliminate the sanctions the
sanctions are designed to crush the
economy starve and destroy the
population in the hope that there will
be an uprising okay the so called
humanitarian aid was an obvious farce if
they want to send humanitarian aid there
ways to do it do it through the UN you
could do it through the Red Cross you
can do it through international agencies
but it was done in such a way as to
almost guarantee that it would be
blocked it was set up so that it would
be blocked and then you could claim that
they're turning down humanitarian aid
want to send humanitarian aid there's
many international agencies that can do
it you don't have to do it in a way
which is designed purposely to ensure
that it will be blocked because it's an
attack on the sovereignty of the country
so that's simply a force again going to
the 2020 presidential election this
seems to be the concern in the left of
Bernie Sanders foreign policy there also
was the fact that he has somewhat
embraced the sort of neo McCarthy's you
cold war rhetoric against Russia and
their so-called election interference
why do you think it is that Bernie
Sanders might be adopting some of the
talking points of the
military-industrial complex there's
neoliberal slash neoconservative talking
points you think that he actually
believes that or that he necessarily
needs to adopt those positions to be a
serious candidate for president I think
that's a misleading picture I'm gonna
practically all the people in the in the
field he's the one who's been most
critical openly of u.s. foreign policy
most of them are pretty much ignoring
foreign policy issues Sanders has picked
it up even in sensitive areas so I don't
think that's I mean I don't like
everything he says I think
some things should be different but but
but by-and-large among the existing
candidates he's the one who's going
further right furthest I think and
putting forth the kind of progressive
foreign policy that's further to go I
think but the fact that he's repeating
what you read a hundred percent in the
meat in the liberal media that's not all
that surprising you know he doesn't have
intelligence agents out in the world
trying to I don't know who his foreign
policy advisors are but I don't he's not
getting the kind of picture that you and
I might think is appropriate
well somebody who is I think coming out
with the stronger peace message is Tulsi
Gabbard I don't know how familiar you
are with her but she's even quoted you
she's been very vocal about how the
neoliberals
keep pushing us into regime change Wars
and we're in a new Cold War are you
familiar at all with her campaign I've
read Tillman I think there were some
good statement but I hadn't looked in
detail at her positions one thing that
the corporate media attacked her on was
a couple years ago she was skeptical
about the claim of chemical weapons use
by Assad she also visited Syria and met
with Assad and I think that she may have
walked back that claim recently saying
that Assad did use chemical weapons of
course this does seem to be a point of
contention a British journalist Robert
Fisk at one point had said that he had
evidence that called that into question
I know the last time we spoke you said
there was evidence that Assad used
chemical weapons I just maybe wanted to
clarify that what what evidence do you
think we should look at that supports
the claim that Assad use I thought by
now I mean the original charges were a
very dubious Robert Fisk who's a very
good reporter or was questioned and
didn't say they were false but he just
said they're not well established
Seymour Hersh wrote a critical or
other other people on the scene would
left the options open but since then I
think evidence has been accumulating
from the international observers that
make it pretty clear that chemical
weapons were used you recorded several
months ago by a Kurdish news outlet
suggesting that the US should stay in
Syria to protect the Kurds is that an
accurate description of your position
I didn't quote it from a Kurdish source
as my own view I think that a small
contingent of US troops in the Kurdish
areas can not with no capacity to move
beyond barely even armed or provide a
kind of a deterrent to a very possible
Turkish assault which would extend the
massive atrocities that there have been
carrying out against Kurds so to protect
up from Turkey but not Syria it might
they're gonna have to make arrangements
with serious note or later but the
primary concern right now is a Turkish
assault which is already taking place
after all
so it's going on inside Turkey of the
Turks went into parts of Syria a friend
whether it was atrocities committed and
partially Kurdish areas if they go on to
the rest of the Kurdish areas it could
be very ugly so I think deterring that
makes sense
oh God because the way that I think it
was kind of spun was that you would be
against the u.s. pulling out of the
Civil War that's taking place in Syria
so this has nothing to do with the civil
war this is a matter of protecting the
Kurdish areas where incidentally
interesting developments have taken
place protecting them from a possible
assault by their most bitter enemy who's
been carrying out atrocities against
Kurds for many years yes if you think
that's making sense okay but as far as
the u.s. being involved in the
the war we should should we be or should
we not be involved in the civil war in
Syria well depends what you mean by
involved so should we have been giving
arms to the opposition I it's very hard
to say remember that the Assad regime is
a brutal murderous regime it happens to
be the legal government but it's
responsible for most of the atrocities
now at the very beginning you go back to
the beginning there were peaceful
protests nonviolent protests calling for
mild reforms democrata democratizing the
very harsh thort aryan systems of
economic reforms they were met with
vicious repression that set off the
civil war there were forces in Syria
kind of moderate democratic reformist
forces which we're trying to maintain
themselves but pretty quickly were
overwhelmed by the jihadi elements that
are the that were started pouring in and
that led to a very complex civil war
with many sides should the US have been
involved at that point well if there had
been not the u.s. but if there had been
any way to protect the democratic actual
democratic forces probably would have
been worth doing but there might not
have been such a way it just seems I
guess a little counterintuitive you know
because you've been so outspoken against
the u.s. acting as a as a global police
force especially in concert with me I'm
not opposed to the police either if my
house gets robbed that cold the police
okay
I'm against the police when they should
people but these
the social and political world is not an
axiom system where there are simple
rules you just followed rigorously it
doesn't make any sense life's much you
complicated for that have to ask about
the consequences of the policies you're
talking about so takes a a contingent of
US troops and rahova the Kurdish areas I
don't want to see US forces abroad I
also don't want to see Kurds massacred
okay you have to make a choice sometimes
so just moving back to tulsi gabbard for
a minute and actually this plays insist
as well because it seems as though
what's happening in syria also is at
least in part part of a proxy war
between the u.s. and russia and
something else that i don't agree with
that I think that's very misleading it
was war but Assad against much of the
population it turned out the US began
providing aid to largely jihadi forces
including anti-tank missiles tow
anti-tank missiles which did stop
Assad's army it was clear what was going
to happen and it did happen in 2015 the
Russians responded to that by
introducing military forces air forces
which overwhelmed the CIA missiles and
with the Assad army move on and pretty
much conquered the country sending arms
was just a way of escalating the calm
the kant's the conflict ensuring that
the Russians would step up the ante this
is their Oni alloy they're not going to
let it go easily
they're only based on the Mediterranean
they're gonna struggle to keep it and
bringing them in more extensively it was
hardly a it increased the violence
terror of destruction and so on again
you have to think about the consequences
of your actions well I was going to
bring up Russia just again because tulsi
gabbard
she was criticized in an NBC
see report actually just a few hours
before she officially announced that she
was running for president and I was
using information from a company called
new knowledge to say that Russia is
going to be supporting her campaign I
recently spoke with Matt Taibbi from
Rolling Stone he's really been a critic
of the sort of media hysteria about
Russia interference with the election or
alleged collusion with Donald Trump and
Matt Taibbi is a big fan of yours and
especially manufacturing consent
something he'd asked me to ask you about
is what are your overall thoughts on how
the media has reported on quote-unquote
Russia gave the accusation that Russia
has interfered in the 2016 election and
might have interfere in the 2020
election I think it's so farcical that I
barely even read the reports it's a joke
I mean if there was first of all if
there was any interference by the
Russians it's essentially undetectable
there are careful analysis of what
happened in the elections you can see
how a change the money poured in all
sorts of things there's no sign of any
Russian effect furthermore it's just
it's almost incredible from the
beginning I mean what happens in the
Senate and the house in 2016 did the
Russians interfere in the Senate
elections it went exactly the same way
furthermore the whole thing is a bad
joke for all sorts of reasons and for
one thing there are countries that do
interfere in American elections openly
publicly forcefully one of them even
sent its prime minister to address a
joint session of Congress to attack the
initiative being taken by the sitting
president is that interference that was
Benjamin Netanyahu and that's only one
part of it I mean that's large-scale
massive interference any other country
did that we have a huge scandal
furthermore does the u.s. interfere in
elections in Russia for
yes and proudly 1996 Clinton took pride
in the fact that large-scale u.s.
interference in the Russian election
swung get to his favorite Boris Yeltsin
the US goes way beyond interfering in
elections that overthrows governments
you know won't mine off to go through
the history I so talk about Russian
interference is simply a joke
furthermore the whole discussion is
completely beside the point
there is massive interference in US
elections from the US corporate sector
who pretty much buy the elections
there's extensive research Tom
Ferguson's is by far the best it's very
extensive shows very convincingly that
you can predict the outcome of an
American election in Congress an
executive with remarkable precision
simply by looking at the single variable
of campaign funding and that's just the
beginning
Ferguson's analysis goes right through
2016 includes Congress this goes back a
long time of course it's picked up a lot
under the opening of the floodgates by
the reactionary Supreme Court but it
goes back to the 19th century is that
interference in elections and that's the
bare beginning since the 1970s when the
neoliberal assault began of the number
of lobbyists in Congress has just
skyrocketed a normal representative in
Congress that may spend several hours a
day just talking to donors to try to get
funds for the next election so he's a
chance of running a meanwhile the
lobbyists are meeting with his staff of
bringing all of their huge resources
which of course overwhelmed the stuff
and pretty much writing the legislation
is that interference with
actions I mean what what's being
discussed is not even a joke OMA theall
the the electric electric the election
system is deeply corrupted great at its
core in many ways do you believe that
Donald Trump colluded with the Russian
government I have the slightest idea I
don't care
it isn't isn't an important though I
mean that if there's gonna be collusion
I think we can guess what it is
maybe he made some deal to have a Trump
Hotel put up in Moscow okay
that's the corrupt but it's the kind of
corruption that unfortunately is all
over the place but with that a quid pro
quo of that of the Russians howling of
what the quid pro quo is that he's
increased a militant military action on
the Russian border
he's created a huge military expansion
of the military budget and Russia he's
pulled out of the INF treaty which is a
major threat to Russia that what's the
quid pro quo the again it goes back to
the accusation from the corporate media
that Russia was you know had social
media trolls that they released the
emails that they possibly were working
with the WikiLeaks but now we're back to
the former question there's no evidence
of any Russian effect on the
presidential election certainly not on
the Senate or House elections which made
exactly the same way and there's no
charge of Russia's interference and then
the rest of the story that I just
mentioned about actual interference so
it's not a serious charge I mean there's
lots of things to condemn about Trump
but not that serious things very serious
things like his commitment to destroy
the environment for organizers of human
life that series not playing games with
the Russians so again going back to Matt
Taibbi question why is the media so
obsessed about quote unquote
Russian metal
we were supposed to have the pork the
sole prerogative of interfering with
other country's elections other
countries are not supposed to interfere
with ours okay
furthermore for the Democrats of this
this is a way of getting revenge
beyond that the corporate media though
they do report the major crimes barely
they certainly don't want to focus on
them so the media will run an article
now on that about the severe crisis of
global warming but at the same time of
the New York Times say will run a
thousand page
euphoric article on how opening up new
areas in the Midwest and offshore oil
drilling will propel the United States
into first place in oil production
displacing Saudi Arabia and ensure
energy independence whatever that's
supposed to mean
with not a single word about the effect
on the general environment actually a
qualification they'll occasionally say
on the article I'm thinking about which
is typical yes there will be effects in
the Midwest may harm ranchers in the
Midwest because it leads to much water
what about destroying the the prospects
of ordinary human life okay is that
product just yesterday
Exxon Mobil announced they can read it
in the business press that there sharply
expanding their investments in fossil
fuel extraction did you see a big front
page headline in the New York Times
about them that serious JPMorgan Chase
biggest bank has announced that it's
increasing investments in fossil fuels
including the most dangerous of them the
Canadian tar sands sea a front-page
headline about that
these are the take the INF treaty a
pulling out of the INF treaty Reagan
Gorbachev treaty opens the door to the
development and deployment of extremely
dangerous missiles
that's why Reagan and Gorbachev enacted
the treaty in the first place to cut
back extreme dangers in Russia in Europe
which could have easily exploded it to a
terminal war okay now that's open it's
it's reported but it's much less
exciting than maybe the Russians trolls
moderately interfered with the election
and it also seems like it's being used
as a form of social control as well
right and especially in terms of social
media and the voices that are that have
a platform there I don't know if you
heard last fall Facebook and Twitter
which are two different companies work
together to take down the paint hundreds
of pages including the freethought
project the anti media several pages
that were critical of police are police
accountability pages and this recently
happened with another page called Hinda
now they were temporarily taken off of
Facebook because Facebook said that they
didn't they weren't revealing where
their funding was coming from even
though that's not a rule that Facebook
has to me it seems very scary and we're
well ioan now that that people are so
focused and having these conversations
political dialogue on these online
platforms and these private companies
can just silence you because they think
that you might be in league with the
enemy isn't that quite disgust no there
are serious things to say about Facebook
and Google one is that they are
collecting huge amounts of data about
everybody right now as you know this
thing is pouring data into Facebook's
Google's accounts they are using that
there but they ship their business model
know is designed to sell personal and
detailed personal
Meishan to the corporate sector so that
they can both direct your consumption
habits but also control you in all sorts
of ways but one of the people who's
written about this shoshone as a buff
called surveillance capitalism which is
a technique of domination and control
which is sort of aiming towards what's
being done in China where there's in
several there's a social credit system
you get certain number of credits and
you're totally monitored there's cameras
all over faces fat face recognition
anything you do say jaywalk or whatever
that may reduce your credits and their
penalties or you may increase your
credits by doing something they like
ends up with a population that
internalizes social controls and just
obeys them oh there are companies in the
United States no much it started in
Europe I've known the United States
which have what they call microchip
parties where you convince the employees
to put in a chip and it has all sorts of
advantages you can access your credit
card that you can open your your you
don't need a key you know very nice
thing being well it allows them to
monitor everything you're doing and it's
done so Amazon for example carefully
monitors of the workers and it's hideous
work how to work warehouses so it finds
that you know there's an algorithm that
finds the shortest way from here to here
and if a worker goes a little bit out of
the way they get a warning and a
punishment and they found that they
could increase productivity that way the
UPS drivers are carefully monitored now
fewer drivers more productivity by a
careful monitoring and control that's
the most dangerous and in city
aspect of Facebook and Google I should
say also that although it's only been
reported in the business purse as far as
I know a facebook was directly involved
in manipulating elections in Europe in
Germany in the last election the
neo-fascist party if the surprising
increase of votes I'm sorry I've heard
you said before why are they in the Oh
fascist party why are they in the Oh
fascist party yeah those are their
policies take a look at them their
background is neo Nazi their actual
policies are harsh brutal of a
xenophobic Gandy immigrant anti worker
policies it's a neo fascist party okay
and a media company in the United States
a texas-based company which works for
Trump of marine lepen Netanyahu other
far-right figures got together with the
Berlin office of Facebook which agreed
to give them a detailed demographic
information about the voting population
in Germany of course they have this
massive information so that they could
micro target ads to particular
individuals playing on their prejudices
and concerns to try to get them to vote
for
AFD well we don't have a detailed study
of what happened but in fact the aft
vote went surprisingly high that looks
like a case of authentic manipulation
there's a much more serious one in
Brazil Brazil they a really horrendous
figure of the worst of all the
authoritarian figures known plaguing the
world did succeed at getting elected by
one of the means was imprisoning the
likely victor Lula da Silva was forehead
in the polls imprisoning him for 25
years essentially a death sentence
solitary confinement not allowed to get
print material not allowed to make
public statements to try to silence him
before the polls have done me the other
next move was a massive campaign on
social media what's up which is for most
of the population the poor population
they have phones that don't read
newspapers don't television incredible
campaign of venomous lies and
vilification which is almost hard to
believe when you see it but it had an
impact now people have their say yes
people started to believe it that the
opposition the Workers Party was gonna
force children to be homosexuals as well
attack religion you know all sorts of
hideous things and had an effect it was
well funded sources were probably hear
of them we can't be sure and it may be a
kind of a dry run for what we may be
seeing in future elections those are
things to be concerned about so again it
seems like these giant companies Google
Facebook Apple Amazon they work together
with the government right there there's
a benefit for that the government over
your helmet earlier I mean they're
working mainly with the corporate sector
but like it's trying to for example
that's not a power this vine is
different that's a centralized deeply
authoritarian state when the government
runs runs it controls the industrially
my product has a dominant control over
the private system that's not like here
here it's more the other way around I
guess it goes into you often hear from
right-wing libertarians when they say
that government can't really regulate
corporations because of regulatory
capture and because government to some
degree is the one empowering these
corporations to begin with so how do
people really effectively fight back
under this corporatist system that we
have well that's a strange argument it's
since government regulation only
sometimes works let's get rid of it
that's a brilliant argument yes it
sometimes works sometimes there's
regulatory captured but the real problem
is look just think about it for a minute
almost ever everybody spends most of
their life living in a totalitarian
system it's called having a job when you
have a job you're under total control of
the of the masters of the enterprise
they determined what you wear when you
go to the bathroom and what you do the
very idea of a wage contract is selling
yourself into servitude these are
private governments there are more
totalitarian than governments or but
they can't I legally murder you or they
can't legally murder you but they can
control everything that you do okay well
I gotta the right-wing libertarian are
gonna be while you're free to leave at
any time yes you're free to starve it's
exactly right you have a choice between
starving or selling yourself to a
tyranny very libertarian the right wing
libertarians whatever they believe are
actually a deep authoritarians
they're calling for subordination to
private tyrannies the worst kind of
tyrannies well I know that we're running
out of time I just want to ask you one
last question
you know because so many people look to
you again I mean people I've interviewed
Matt Taibbi from Rolling Stone have you
Mark and their enmity there's so many
journalists out there and so many people
who look to you as such you know a great
figure who has contributed so much to
dissent and seeing through propaganda
who would you like to say that we should
also look to is there anyone who you
really was working really respect who's
coming out with with new and exciting
you know descent or again kind of ending
the smoke and mirrors of corporate
propaganda breaking through corporate
propaganda yes people like Matt daya be
for example doing great work there's
lots of people doing it so you actually
read I mean you know Matt Damon I read
him not the journal a Glenn Greenwald
was doing a great job there are many
others well thank you again for your
time I appreciate it as always since
hopefully can be at some point in the
future okay thanks
