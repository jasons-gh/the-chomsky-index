how can we be heard so long as we're
nobody yet unknown economically
dependent and supposed to get somewhere
is this working yeah well first of all
nobody is nobody and if you want to have
their very good models as to what young
people can do Chiefs a great deal so
let's go back say 50 years and go to
North Carolina and the United States or
Georgia in the United States at that
point young people who were facing far
harsher difficulties than you are young
black big kids decided to sit in on
restaurants to insist on being waited in
restaurants which was illegal for blacks
at the time so a small group of young
kids college students and went and sat
in at a bar and a diner the police came
took him out throw him in jail I'm sure
it wasn't very pleasant the next day
more came back and did it again after a
couple of years it ended up really
revolutionising the country that's what
one of the things that sparked civil
rights movement they were at a lot of
more Spelman College black college they
had virtually no support from the
faculty to faculty members supported
them both were thrown out one was Howard
Zinn you may know my old friend of guide
two years ago he was a faculty member he
supported the students he was expelled
the students themselves went on a lot of
them became joined the group that became
the Freedom Riders at that point white
students for some white students from
the North came down to join them and
they rode in buses through the South
trying to register blacks couldn't
bridge a stir in it they did wasn't easy
several of them got murdered others were
beaten thrown into prisons I was down
there for demonstrations and you could
see are you watching Walla State Police
were beating people kid young kids
mostly driving them up the they were
fleeing to the steps of the federal
building where the State Police are not
allowed to go and the federal building
was lined with federal marshals sent
from Washington who were throwing them
back into the streets that's the way the
government was protecting well you know
they achieved a great deal martin luther
king who was a extremely important
person would have been the first to tell
you that he was writing the ground swell
that they developed and that's by no
means the only case picked my own
university in MIT MIT and was
practically a hundred percent funded by
the Pentagon which contrary to what a
lot of people believe means it was
extremely free the Pentagon didn't care
what you did they wanted to create the
economy of the future that was their job
it's highly undemocratic they were using
public resources on not they the
government used public resources on the
pretext of defense to develop
computers and the internet micro
electronics and so on that's the way the
high-tech economy developed but it was a
very passive place very passive a
quiescent people doing their work not
paying much attention to anything there
were about five students who decided to
try to stir the place up some of them
you may no one was Michael Albert and
now runs Z net there was steve shalom
who's a couple feet bomber a couple
others and they just kind of began
organizing groups around the campus by
1968 they had so radicalized the campus
that Mike Albert was elected student
president on a platform so radical you
can barely believe it well he was thrown
out we had to get him back in usual
things happen but the point is that
universities never been the same to this
day now it's an active a lot of
participation totally different
relationships among people and it's a
center of activism and the things like
that happen all the time there's a
tremendous amount that young people can
do in fact if you look at the what takes
a tougher square in cairo that was
mostly organized by fairly young people
i guess in their 20s mostly tech savvy
began reaching out to others they didn't
really expect much at the beginning but
they within a couple of weeks they had
half of egypt out there and they
overthrew a dictatorship a long way to
go but a major event again initiated
young people who were committed and
active and there are plenty of other
examples you can be heard or write in
linguistics you have wondered where the
language is an optimal solution do you
think there is an optimal solution in
politics as well or should we sometimes
accept the least bad option well if
there is an optimal solution I'm not
smart enough to figure out what it is
there's just too much we don't know
about human beings and about societies a
lot of bull would have to be learned by
experimentation trying things if they
work try other things and so on and in
fact this is a pretty traditional view
on the left so say take Karl Marx you
read through all of his works you find
practically nothing on post capitalist
society a couple of sentences scattered
around here and there so on a post
capitalist society you know everyone
would fish in the morning and grows
garden in the afternoon a couple of
lines like that and there was a reason
for it he believed in workers democracy
his conception was that there would be a
popular revolution working people would
take control of their own fate than
their own institutions and then they
would work out what the society ought to
be like he didn't have a prescription
and some ideas about general principles
but not a description on the other hand
there are there were people on the Left
still are Mike Albert who I mentioned is
one who think that you can give a very
detailed account of what a future
society ought to be like and they've
worked out you know detailed proposals
but you could try out right now even
within the present society well you know
between these two extremes there are
lots of approaches that people have
taken and you have to decide how much
you think you understand
and I don't think I understand very much
so I don't feel a moron marks aside and
I think these things will have to be
worked out I doubt that there's anything
that you could call an optimal solution
that people are just do different they
live in too many different ways they're
probably many possible peaks that can be
approached and life will be a lot more
interesting if this diversity in
outcomes how come we live in an open
society with a lot of information and
yet we know so little ask them so how
come we live in an open society with a
lot of information yet we know so little
actually had a little personal touch
about 25 years ago I was asked by a
publisher to write a book that finally
came out with a different publisher
called knowledge of language the reason
came out with a different publisher was
because I included in the book one
chapter that the original publisher
refused to publish it was about in part
about this question the most of the book
was about what I called Plato's problem
the problem of how we know so much with
some little information the last chapter
was about something I called Orwell's
problem this one how come we know so
little with how so much information so
those are the last and then I went on
and gave the reasons it's not very
profound the publisher wouldn't allow
that so we got a note little but the
answers straight forward it's the kind
of thing I was talking about I mean
there are concerted efforts to make sure
that you know very little and understand
very little
which is even more important even with
so much information about so when you go
to school you don't read about the first
911 you don't read about Reagan's war on
terror you do read about Solzhenitsyn
and hovel and others and about our
courage and supporting them but you
don't read about the Jesuit
intellectuals or the war against the
church or the effort to destroy the
attempt to bring back the Christianity
the Gospels I know the things you just
don't read about that there you can find
them we live in open societies can go to
library and get the information about
them but it's a research project and
that's conscious it's a continent partly
it's internalized by educated people
your kind of brought up that way
yourself so that's what you see things
and it's more convenient and so on and
if you break out of the mold there are
difficulties in our societies like ours
the difficulties are very severe but
they're there and it's easier not to
face difficulties it's easier to come to
believe what it's convenient to believe
so these various factors some some quite
conscious so there's just sort of normal
human reactions and lead to a situation
in which there's tons of information out
there but you don't know it or if you
know it didn't understand it several
people are asking you to express your
opinion on the WikiLeaks well the way it
looks I mean I
you know I'm often asked do I think
Julian Assange was a hero or a devil I
don't think either I think it's just a
person doing a civic responsibility it's
a civic responsibility to help people
know and understand what the power what
power systems are up to they don't like
it of course no matter what power system
it is they'd rather have their workings
be secret from the public but what right
do they have to keep their working
secret from the public technically
they're supposed to be our
representatives we should know
everything they're doing you can imagine
there might be some cases in which
information has to be kept within which
there isn't it there's an argument for
keeping information secret but you have
to make the argument the burden of proof
is always on a power system that says
this has to be secret maybe sometimes
they can meet it so for example take the
Pentagon Papers
