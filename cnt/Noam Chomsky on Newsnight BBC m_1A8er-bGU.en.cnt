first job see when you see all those
thousands of people demonstrating on the
streets of Egypt or Libya what do you
think well what's been happening in the
Arab world is a quite a spectacular
uprising I mean where they can't think
of anything quite comparable
incidentally it's not the only one in
the world so for example there were
70,000 people in the streets of Madison
Wisconsin a few days ago and they're
still there a lot of things are
happening in the world but specifically
in North Africa the Arab world what do
you feel about what they're campaigning
for there it's pretty clear about what
they're campaigning for Libya is
something of a special case but Tunisia
Egypt particularly Yemen and so on
they're calling for substantial regime
change and into the western-backed
dictatorships what how does that make
you feel well I think it's wonderful I
don't have a lot of problems internal
and external notice that it's been a
remarkable achievement so far but the
regime's are intact
there have been name changes but no
significant socio-economic political
changes that they make um you talked
about them demonstrating against regimes
which enjoyed the backing of the West
isn't it characteristic of these
demonstrations that the West is by and
large back the demonstrators against the
dictators and certainly not in fact
what's happened is following the a
standard game plan which has been used
over and over Marco's in the Philippines
Davila in Haiti tune in South Korea is
Suharto in Indonesia and there comes a
point when you cannot support your
favorite dictator any longer I and the
and the same thing happens every time
happening here to support them as long
as possible when the judgment is it
can't be done anymore maybe the Army's
turned against them or whatever come out
with ringing declarations about your
love of democracy and how you're on the
side of the people and then try to
preserve the regime well it's certainly
not true in the case of Libya that is it
I mean Libya has been the enemy of the
West for years and years and years it's
one of the reasons why I said Libya is a
special case it's not quite like the
others what's going on in Libya is
really a civil war you don't feel that
the Western endorsement of the
demonstrators for example in Cairo you
don't feel that proceeded from anything
other than realpolitik it wasn't infer
so it didn't happen I mean the support
was at the very end the last Tony Blair
for example right in the middle of the
demonstrations of course he's not the
government but he came out with a great
endorsement of Mubarak as a courageous
man and a good man and so on Obama at
the very Tory but by the time the
demonstrations were really overwhelming
he finally sent a mediator Frank Wisner
to talk to Mubarak the man he picked is
a lobbyist for Mubarak who left Cairo
saying he oughta stay that was at the
peak of the demonstrations now when it
became impossible to maintain that
position any longer Obama sort of made
some mild moves statement supporting
demonstrators nothing nothing much what
do you think Weston government should
have done what they should have done
yeah they should have pulled away the
support from the dictators a long time
ago they should have done what the
demonstrators have wanted them to do
there's a reason why say in Egypt
according to Western US polls about 90%
of the population regard the United
States as their main enemy there's a
reason for that so you think that the
the immediate response should have been
to withdrawal support for the
administration in in Egypt frieszo not
quiet I think that response should have
taken place a long time ago you'll
remember these these demonstrations are
bursting out now but things have been
going on for a long time so for example
in Egypt there have been
very extensive significant labor
struggles for years the January 25th
movement was led by the uprisings were
led by a group called the April 6th
group
April's those are the one you know the
tech savvy young people April sixth is a
significant day that was the date of a
major strike and support action
have planned that the mahalo textile
industries which was broken up by force
that was a couple of years ago do you
find it striking that what many of these
demonstrators appear to want is the sort
of freedoms Western freedoms that you
have often said a rather illusory well
they're a loser if we let them be
illusory in fact what's happening in
Madison Wisconsin so relevant in this
respect right in the middle of the
proteome one of the most dramatic
moments of the protest couple of weeks
ago was when a calabasa well-known labor
leader in Egypt sent a message to
Madison Wisconsin saying the people of
the workers of Egypt support the workers
of Madison in their struggle in Madison
they're trying to preserve aspects of
democracy they're under serious attack
in Egypt they're trying to gain the
rights that have been denied them the
trajectories are crossing but going in
opposite directions do you think that
the West should go as far as arming the
dissidents in Libya or Egypt Egypt
that's not even the issue doesn't even
arise in Egypt so yes no of course not
but the Libya do you think Libya's would
look again Lib is a special case Libby's
a civil war should the West intervene
militarily that's very doubtful I don't
think so
there's a long way before that question
even arises now there are first of all
the people don't want it remember that
the West is hated
for good reasons i'ma take say Libya
eastern Libya which was just pretty much
liberated that's the site of the first
post-world War one major genocide Italy
in that case that we may not remember
they do and there's a long history since
with England France I mean this current
series of uprisings actually began in
Western Sahara last November the Western
Sahara was supposed to undergo
decolonization that was former Spanish
colony was supposed to be the colonized
Morocco invaded thirty years ago the
harsh brutal invasion last November
there was a nonviolent protest tent city
in Western Sahara was broken up by
Moroccan forces pretty violently that it
was serious enough so that went to the
United Nations which is technically
responsible it was blocked by an
investigation was blocked by France
which is the main protector of Morocco
and in Tunisia France was the bad guy if
you like the West is has extremely ugly
history there we may not pay attention
but the people don't forget for the for
the powerful the histories bunk but for
the victims don't have that luxury they
remember it for example they remember
what we don't like to remember that back
in the 1950s 1958 in fact the President
Eisenhower raised with his staff the
question why there is a campaign of
hatred against us in the Arab world but
not from the governments which are
morally supportive but from the people
now the National Security Council
highest planning body that came out with
memorandum the 1958 saying there's a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States supports harsh and brutal
dictators and blocks democracy and
development and we do it because we want
to maintain control of their energy
supplies
and I went on to say that the perception
is more or less accurate and furthermore
that's what we should be doing and it
continues right to the present
so we're the last ones ought to be
intervening and there are there are
things happening that are much more I
think constructive than any possible
military intervention for example
there's a meeting right now with Brazil
India in South Africa
trying to see if they can implement some
mediation there's a Reuters report I've
seen confirmed that Gaddafi has offered
to with to leave the country
if proper circumstances can be
established to Al Jazeera Al Jazeera
which is the best one of the best news
and that's sorting and someone some
source in the opposition I mean we I'm
sorry but that's been confirmed by
people in the Hmong the rebels al
Jazeera you don't make fun of Al Jazeera
I'm not made a serious zero so very
saying that he's an unconfirmed report I
mentioned that it's an unconfirmed
report but it said it's worth pursuing
yeah and there are many things that are
worth presented for simply doing for
example the Arab press if you read it
including from London is proposing that
countries that have some respect in the
region become involved mainly Egypt and
Turkey but that would make a lot more
sense than countries that are hated for
good reasons so what do we do just do
nothing we wait and first we're not
asked to do anything mostly we've been
asked to stay away just read what is
being said mostly stay away you've got a
enough blood on your hands already there
are the the question of what to do is
not up to us we're not the only ones in
the world
so say Brazil for example is a respected
country so it's Turkey if you look at
the Arab world ask yourself which leader
is most respected
there's an answer Aragon okay that makes
sense but we have an obligation do we
not to behave responsibly yes and you're
saying that the responsible thing is to
simply not get involved there's there
may come a time when it would make sense
for the West to become involved
despite its horrendous record of
atrocities and crimes and that region to
going way back but the question is has
that time come there are others who have
a much better status and let's and may
be able to do things that would lead to
some sort of reconciliation or at least
mediation and it's very possible that
Libya is going to break up into two
stage so we know because we've seen what
you've had to say on the subject how you
regard Bush and Blass record in the
Middle East do you think Obama's no
better many ways it's worse i I've been
writing about it I started writing about
it before the election why is he worse
should go through the video in the case
of Afghanistan he's shortly escalated
the war
this is threatening a breakup of
Pakistan which could be a catastrophe
for the West in fact there's a quite an
important article that just came out by
Anatoly Evan and those Pakistan very
well whose chemical his conclusion is
that British and American soldiers are
dying in Afghanistan to make life more
dangerous for Britain in the United
States namely because of the impact on a
potential breakup of Pakistan which has
both a huge number of nuclear weapons
and a radical Islamic development both
of them supported by the West both and
continue to be Obama is continuing to
carry out actions which are threatening
this let's go to it I've already talked
about his attitude toward Egypt the
usual one follow the usual game plan
which I mentioned let's take Israel
Paola
done I mean his position is shocking he
is refused to do I mean there was just a
UN Security Council resolution a few
weeks ago in which calling on an ending
of settlement settlement expansion and
declaring the settlements illegal which
is not even controversial Obama vetoed
it alone a General Assembly resolution
shortly before was similar the United
States and Israel and a couple of
Pacific Islands opposed and this is the
record all the way through you famously
said that every American president since
the Second World War would fail in the
judgment as applied to Nuremberg and and
ethyle effectively should be hanged you
see the same applies to didn't said not
everybody was angered Nuremberg I said
if I believe them was hanged up I said
if we believed in the Nuremberg
principles every American president
would be subject to them what the
decision would be we'd have to check
notice that this is the Nuremberg
principles not the trials but Obama
would fan no better were those
principles applied to him
no he's carrying out carrying out a
major war in Afghanistan he's supporting
he's directly and I mean he's been
directly involved in aggressive and
criminal actions carried out by Israel
for example he's only been in office for
two years so he hasn't a chance to
invade anyone yet but his record is
quite consistent with what's happened
before what about the the methodology
that's talked about in in these popular
movements in in the Arab world where it
is said that it is Western technology
Facebook Twitter famously in the
internet and all the rest of it that has
enabled people to express dissent and
thereby in the case of Egypt to unseat
one leader you say to be replaced by
another who may be not congenial to the
West be they might say look and it's
perfectly in favor of the
technology that was developed actually a
lot of it at my own institution under
Pentagon funding yeah nothing wrong with
technology I use a computer I use the
Internet
do you not find that there is something
in the way that people behave that the
behavior that is enabled by this
technology that is itself rather
affirming of the principles you believe
in technology is quite neutral I mean a
hammer doesn't care whether it's used to
build a house or a bash in that of a
prisoner but then the same is true of
technology enablement of the
dissemination of information the
dissemination of shared belief that's a
good thing isn't it of course that's why
I said I think the Internet's fine thing
I think the Pentagon did a great job in
funding the development of the internet
for a decade doesn't that reflect rather
well on Western democracies if you think
the Pentagon is a great exponent of
Western democracy yet in fact the the
the original intent of the internet was
in fact to facilitate in from
communication while it was the
Internet's an interesting case while it
was basically a mostly funded by the
Pentagon in fact it was the ARPANET the
army net was the first one actually
developed where I work as long as it
after the Pentagon the Pentagon then
handed over to the National Science
Foundation during that period about 30
years the Internet was quite free it was
commercialized under methods not yet
really understood in the mid-90s since
then there have been many significant
efforts to try to constrain and control
it and right now the question of
Internet freedom is a very live issue in
the United States and elsewhere will it
be kept free and open as it was wonder
was in the state system but it has
enabled these people to know
that's been a good thing isn't it yes
it's enabled them in Wisconsin to in
fact every I'm involved in all kinds of
activism all the time
it also always takes places with the
internet the internet also gives access
to lots of information that was
otherwise unavailable and the Internet
has a downside to it could be used for
surveillance can be used for control it
can be used for propaganda it's it can
there there is a serious question about
whether the providers there's not many
of them are now in a position to use the
Internet to direct people to what they
want not what the people want that's a
serious issue that's getting even more
serious with new mergers like Comcast
and NBC so the Internet in itself is in
principle a fine development nothing
wrong with it
so our trains let's say I suppose the
telephone that says the printing press
all of these are very fine developments
in principle they can be used for
libertarians they can be used to control
and coerce and destroy and they're used
for all of those ends can I have fish it
up with a personal question you how old
now 82 why hadn't you mellowed because I
look at the world and there's too much
this things happening in the world which
should lead anyone to become indignant
outraged active and and simply engaged
I mean look we're in a position right
now where there are among the many
threats we face which go on all the time
now there are two which literally
threatened species survival that's
serious and they're both being escalated
one is the threat of nuclear war which
is quite serious and escalating and the
second is the threat of environmental
disaster which is moving in extremely
ominous directions take a look at the
the new Congress for example just about
every new congressional representative
who came in last November's a climate
denier in fact Congress has already
moved to ban funding for the most mild
environmental efforts and furthermore
unfortunately many of these people are
true believers so the head of one of the
congressional subcommittees new
Republican explained that the global
warming can't be a problem because God
promised Noah that there wouldn't be
another flood others are just supported
are supported by it but why do you care
about stupid people stupid people these
people have power and they're carrying
out actions they are carrying out the
actions which are defunding possible
efforts to do something about these
crimes furthermore they're backed by
major concentrations of power the major
business lobbies for example have
announced that they're funding big
propaganda campaigns to convince people
that this doesn't matter these are
serious issues inside which we want to
look at stupid people we find them all
over the place
for example we happen to be right in the
middle of a huge financial crisis people
have noticed and you trace that back a
lot of it comes from a fanatic religious
belief in what's called the efficient
market hypothesis it's pure fanaticism
dominated the economics profession
dominated the fed a Federal Reserve that
one consequence was that when an eight
trillion dollar housing bubble developed
totally unrelated to any fundamentals
completely off the hundred year history
of housing prices the profession and the
red central bank I said it's not
necessary to pay attention because of
efficient markets I'm is that very
different from God promised Noah
