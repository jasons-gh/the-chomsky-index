the war and peace report
i meani Goodman with Aaron Mata our
guest for the hour is MIT Institute
professor emeritus Noam Chomsky known
around the world for his political
writings we're gonna turn right now to
the issue of Russia and Ukraine
Secretary of State John Kerry's meeting
with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov
in Geneva to discuss the conflict in
Ukraine the meeting comes just days
after Kerry publicly accused Russian
officials of lying to his face about
their military support for separatists
rebels Russia and Ukraine are also
holding direct talks in Brussels to
resolve a dispute over delivery of
Russian gas the UN said today the death
toll from the nearly year-old conflict
is top six thousand a recent ceasefire
continues to hold over a shaky start
also in Russia the murder this weekend
on Friday night of the opposition leader
Boris Nemtsov a former Deputy Prime
Minister turned dissident politician
Nemtsov was shot dead Friday night near
Red Square he was going to lead a major
rally that was critical of Vladimir
Putin on Sunday it grew much larger
after his death with tens of thousands
perhaps fifty thousand people marching
past the Kremlin carrying signs reading
I am Not Afraid noam chomsky if you can
comment on what's happening in Russia
and Ukraine what's happening is quite
ugly and I think the criticisms are
mostly accurate but they're kind of
beside the point
there's a background that we have to
think about it's it's fashionable now in
the United States and Britain to condemn
Putin as some sort of distorted mind
there's an article in Psychology Today
analyzing his brain asking why so
arrogant he's been accused of having
Asperger's
irritable rat-faced man as he's
described by Timothy art garden ash and
so on this is all very reminiscent of
the early 1950s when I was a graduate
student then at that time the u.s. had
overwhelming power and it was able to
use the United Nations as a battering
ram against its enemy the Soviet Union
so Russia was of course feet doing lots
of resolutions condemning it and the
leading anthropologists in the United
States and England the developed earth
were began to analyze why the Russians
are so negative what makes them say no
at the United Nations all the time and
their proposal was that the Russians are
negative because they raised their
children and swaddling clothes and that
makes them negative no the three or four
of us at Harvard too thought this
ridiculous used to call it diaper ology
that's being re-enacted that take off on
Kremlinology and this is a being
re-enacted right now but the fact is
whatever you think about Putin okay
irritable rat-faced men with Asperger's
whatever you like the Russians have a
case and you have to understand the case
and the case is understood here by
people who bother to think so for
example there was a lead article and
foreign affairs the main establishment
journal by John Mearsheimer with the
title something like the West is
responsible for the Ukraine crisis and
he was talking about the background the
background begins with the fall of the
Soviet Union 1989 1990 there were
negotiations between President Bush
James Baker and Mikhail Gorbachev about
how to how to deal with the issues that
arose at the time a crucial question is
what happens to NATO NATO had been
advertise since its beginning as
necessary to protect Western Europe from
the Russian hordes okay and no more
Russian hordes so what happens to NATO
well we know what happened to NATO but
the crucial issue was this Gorbachev
agreed to allow Germany a unified
Germany to join NATO a hostile military
alliance it's a pretty remarkable
concession if you think about the
history of the preceding century half
century its Germany alone had
practically destroyed Russia several
times and now he was agreeing to have
Germany join a hostile military alliance
led by the only superpower but there was
a quid pro quo that Germany that NATO
would not move one inch to the east that
was the phrase that was used in the
interchanges meaning to East Germany and
on that condition they went forward NATO
immediately moved to East Germany when
Gorbachev vigorously protested naturally
he was informed by the United States
that it was only a verbal commitment it
wasn't on paper the unstated implication
is if you're naive enough to think you
could make a gentlemen's agreement with
us your problem they didn't say that I'm
saying that but the NATO moved to the
East Germany under Clinton moved right
up to Russia's borders just a couple of
weeks ago the US military equipment was
taking part in the military parade in
Estonia a couple hundred yards from the
Russian border Russia is surrounded by
the u.s. offensive weapons sometimes
they're called defense but they're all
offensive weapons and the idea that the
the new government in Ukraine that
it took over after the former government
was overthrown last December late
December it passed a resolution
overwhelmingly I think some like 308 or
something announcing its intention to
take steps to join NATO for a no Russian
leader no matter who it is could
tolerate Ukraine right at the
geostrategic
center of Russian concerns joining a
hostile military alliance I mean we can
imagine for example how the US would
have reacted say during the Cold War if
the Warsaw Pact had extended to Latin
America and Mexico and Canada were now
of planning to join the Warsaw Pact
of course that's academic because the
first step would have led the violent US
response and would have gone any further
and it's very interesting to think about
what actually happened at the Cuban
Missile Crisis which is very striking
the issue the crucial issue at the
missile crisis was the peak moment was
October 26th and 27th right the end
Khrushchev had sent a letter to Kennedy
offering to end the crisis by
simultaneous public withdrawal of
Russian missiles from Cuba and u.s.
missiles from Turkey
these were obsolete missiles for which
withdrawal order had already been given
because they were being replaced by much
more lethal US missiles and Polaris
submarines and vulnerable submarines so
that was the offer they would withdraw
the missiles we would withdraw obsolete
missiles which were already being
replaced by more lethal ones Kennedy
refused and his
his own subjective assessment whatever
that means of nuclear war was a third to
a half that's got to be the most
horrific decision in history first chef
back down that fortunately the US did
secretly say that it would withdraw the
obsolete missiles of course which didn't
need anymore but the if you take a look
at the balance of power that was assumed
to be legitimate we are you have to
establish the principle that we have a
right to surround anyone with lethal
offensive weapons that can obliterate
them in a second that they can't do
anything anywhere in their ops the same
as it would take a look at the conflict
with China over the the marathon
conflict where's it taking place I'm
just off the coast of California is it
in the Caribbean no it's off the coast
of China that's what we have to protect
what we call freedom of the seas nothing
in China's waters this is a part of the
concept that we basically own the world
and we have a right to do anything any
way we like and nobody is a right to
stand up to it now in the case of the
Ukraine the what again whatever you
think about Putin think he's the worst
monster since Hitler they still have a
case and it's a case that no Russian
leaders want to back down from that
cannot accept the Ukrainian move of the
current government to join NATO even
probably the European community there is
a very natural settlement to this issue
a strong declaration that Ukraine will
be neutralized it won't be part of any
military alliance that along with some
more or less agreed upon choices about
how about autonomy of regions you can
finesse it this way in that but those
are the basic terms of a peaceful
settlement but we have to be willing to
accept it otherwise we're moving towards
a very dangerous situation
I mentioned before that the Doomsday
Clock famous clock of the bull of
American Atomic Scientists has just been
advanced to three minutes before
midnight that's very close
midnight means were finished that is the
highest the closest it's reached since
1983 and we might remember what happened
then what happened then was that the
Reagan administration soon came into
office began highly provocative actions
it wanted to probe Russian defenses so
they simulated air and naval attacks
against Russia very publicly and openly
they wanted the Russians to know to see
how they'd respond okay it was a very
tense moment pursing two missiles were
being installed in Western Europe with
five to ten minutes flight time to
Moscow Reagan had announced the
so-called Star Wars program which is
called defense but strategic analysts on
all sides agree that it's a first-strike
weapon what's called missile defense it
was extremely tense period the Russians
were concerned was known at the time
that they were concerned but Russia
recently released archives Russian ARCA
as indicate that the concern was very
high there's an America recent US
intelligence report analyzing in detail
what the reactions were and concludes
it's words are the war scare was real we
came close to war and it's worse than
that
because right in the nineteen eighty
four right at the peak of this this is
when the Doomsday Clock was approaching
midnight right in the midst of that
Russian automated detection systems
which are much worse than ours that we
have satellite detection we can detect
missiles from takeoff they have only
radar detection line-of-sight so they
can only detect missiles when you can
kind of see them with radar
they detect that a u.s. missile attack
the protocol is for that information to
be transmitted to the high command which
then launches a preventive strike it
went to a particular individual on a
Slav Petrov he just decided not to
transmit it that's why we're alive to
talk about we have to break and come
back to Noam Chomsky professor emeritus
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
author of over a hundred books we'll be
back in a minute
