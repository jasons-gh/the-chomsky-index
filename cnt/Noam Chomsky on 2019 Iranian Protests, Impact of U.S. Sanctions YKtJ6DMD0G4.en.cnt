well also there's been a kind of there's
been a lot of protests going on in Iran
in Iran in Iran yes major major protests
of the embassy international reports
that 100% people or a hundred people
have been killed and the internet is
still shut down how how can it be said
that the US are essentially what
contributions has the u.s. made to
worsen the situation and you might I
mean first of all the US under Trump
pulled out of the joint agreement and
imposed sanctions which quite openly
secret about it
sanctions are designed to destroy the
economy totally destroy the economy
so maybe the population will rise up and
overthrow the US thanks at first with
the United States is the only country in
the world that can impose sanctions but
do you find anybody else imposing
sanctions nobody can do it you have to
be the Mafia dawn first the secondly US
sanctions are international they're not
just against the country they're against
the world so if anybody tries to violate
the US sanctions you go after them and
the US can do that very easily u.s. runs
the international financial system if
Belgium decides to ignore US sanctions
they get cut out of the international
financial system plus they get cut out
of the US market which huge market so
the Europeans or anybody else are not
going to do anything China is not
totally under US control they might
continue to buy some oil but they don't
want pushed too far either because you
don't want to irritate the Mafia Dom
that's very dangerous so the US
sanctions are very powerful and they
haven't fortunately succeeded in their
announced goal devastating the economy
so badly that the people will rise up
and the reaction
protests are primarily it seems over the
economy also it's a very harsh brutal
governments rotten government no doubt
about it
so when there's economic hardship it was
much broader so the U is overwhelmingly
involved and happy about it you know
it's not a secret
