we're back welcome to a brand new season
of going underground with me action
rattan see every Monday Wednesday and
Saturday we bring you the stories that
really matter for those of you wishing
to question more in today's special
episode Yemen has been the main target
of the global assassination campaign the
most extraordinary global terrorism
campaign in history as demonstrations
rage against TTIP in London we speak to
world renowned political dissident from
pioneering linguist Noam Chomsky about
the crisis of the West from Obama's
sabre-rattling against Russia to
western-backed killing in the Middle
East to mass austerity all this and more
on today's going underground no other
Washington agency arguably so dominates
our general election campaign as the IMF
which reviews its supervision of the
entire world's financial system this
afternoon in DC the meeting of the IMF
International Monetary and financial
Committee will be overseen by Christine
Lagarde who one interviewer recently got
to admit used to be in a notorious
prison off the coast of San Francisco
you were French tour guide at Alcatraz
prison I don't know so how does a
self-confessed former Alcatraz prison
tour guide describe her role in arguably
suppressing the Democratic wishes of the
Greek people I've got my money back
austerity may be the watchword of the
British general elections with all
parties saying they will address it but
it seems that one Washington
multilateral institution believes it can
override any democratic election be it
in Greece or Britain did the Greek
people vote to put more of their
grandchildren and great-grandchildren
into debt when they voted cereza and
will it be the same here in Britain
whatever one votes for in two and a half
weeks time demonstrations in London by
global justice now against the
transatlantic trade and investment
partnership or TTIP today may not gone a
much mainstream media attention but it's
probable that many of the activists out
protesting will have been inspired by
the work of our next guest professor
Noam Chomsky is the most cited living
academic in the world and he joins me
now from MIT in Cambridge Massachusetts
welcome norm to growing underground the
UN secretary-general is saying he wants
an immediate ceasefire in Yemen there
was a drone strike from the Obama
administration on Tuesday and thousands
are dead and wounded what lies behind
the Obama's strategy in Yemen well there
are two main prongs to the current Obama
strategy they happen to be in conflict
which causes some problems in Washington
one is the drone campaign the Yemen has
been the main target of the global
assassination campaign the most
extraordinary global terrorism campaign
in history it is officially aimed at as
in this last strike it's aimed at people
who are suspected of potentially being a
danger to the United States now that's a
pretty extreme form of terrorism but
it's accepted in the West and it's at
Yemen has been the main target of course
it's also a terror generating campaign
as is understood at the highest level
when you say attack a village and murder
somebody who you're aiming at and maybe
a couple other people are standing
around that does tend to elicit a call
for revenge and it has undoubtedly nots
not not even questionable increased what
we call terrorism so I saw the terrorism
campaign an incredibly incredible one
and also increasing terrorists we can
see the other prong is support for the
Saudi invasion the bombing of the
blockade which is barred food and other
supplies by air or by sea direct bombing
attacks also killing people regularly
and these two things happen to be
somewhat in conflict because the u.s. is
supporting the Saudi attack and the suti
attack supported by the United States is
offering space for the operations of al
Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula the main
source of what we call terror so for
example the New York Times has an
article on how al Qaeda is expanding in
Yemen conquering new cities banks so on
because of the space that's left open by
the war against the Houthi the Sunni war
who were the main enemy of al Qaeda and
are now engaged in in a war with
basically with Saudi Arabia and the
United States so these two elements of
policy both of them extremely harmful to
Yemen are also somewhat in conflict
which creates problem for planners in
Washington
you said the Houthis were this main
opponent of al Qaeda in that area even
Russia only abstained at the UN Security
Council when it came to imposing
sanctions on this hootie government why
do you think the international community
seems to be well de facto supporting the
forces of al Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula and and perhaps Isis in their
support for these
the operation well we should bear in
mind that the term international
community in fact refers to the United
States and whoever happens to be going
along with it so the international
community so-called is pretty much
tolerating or supporting US policy
Russia was not part of the international
community in this case China is probably
a passive member but it's basically the
United States Britain in France the
traditional imperial powers that's the
international community same and with
regard to Iran so we commonly read that
the international community is strongly
opposed to Iran's nuclear development
policies is dedicated to ending them and
so on that's if the international
community includes the people of the
world that's not true
so the large majority of the population
of the world are in g77 plus China the
old non-aligned movement they had their
last international conference in Tehran
where they once again vigorously
supported Iran's nuclear programs but
that's not the international community
the international community means the
Masters of the world those who go along
with them and in this case yes they're
going along with the US and its Saudi
ally albeit there's much liberal talk
here about while celebrating the Obama
administration's legacy rapprochement
with Iran with Cuba that's an
interesting the way it's described in in
the West United States and other members
of the international community that what
actually happened is that the United
States the United States first of all
for 50 years has been carrying out
crushing embargo again
Cuba condemned by the entire world you
take a look at the votes of General
Assembly Israel's with the United States
sometimes a Pacific island basically
nobody every year the United States has
also conducted a very serious terrorist
war against Cuba that began in the
Kennedy administration it lasted for
many years for a long time it was the
u.s. itself than it was us proxies in
many of them right here in the United
States in Miami have protected by the
government and it's very serious that
that has come these two policies towards
Cuba have completely isolated the United
States in the hemisphere the last
hemispheric conference the one just
before the one and Panama was in
Colombia one of the so-called US allies
it could never reach a consensus on
anything because the United States and
Canada blocked the rest of the
hemisphere on the major issues one was
admission of Cuba to the Western
Hemisphere
the other was moves to reduce the
so-called drug war which is based in the
United States and is devastating Latin
America practically every country
including Colombia wants a change in
that and the US wouldn't do it so Obama
finally realized that his government
realized that to try to they wanted to
limit the isolation of the United States
before the Panama summit which just took
place and so they took steps to reduce
not end the US attacks on Cuba that of
going on for 50 years embargo still
pretty much remains there steps towards
normalization in the West this is
described as a noble gesture of Obama's
leaving a wonderful legacy you read the
commentary and
in America it's much more accurate they
understand that the u.s. essentially
capitulated to in an effort to try to
end its extreme isolation but it has not
ended the attack on Cuba they use this
against the pink tide here in Britain
we're hearing talk again against
Argentina
of course Venezuela is on a kind of
terrorist list of the United States do
you see this as a reproach more with the
pink tide countries or a possible sign
of disaster ahead when it comes to
American policy in Latin America well
I'll take Argentina the the summit in in
Colombia that I mentioned 2012 actually
had three issues one was admission of
Cuba which the u.s. blocked second was
moves towards decriminalization of drugs
which the u.s. blocked the third was the
Falkland Malvinas war where Latin
America supports Argentina and the u.s.
blocked the steps on that this is not a
rapprochement with the you know Alba and
the other so-called pink tide and the
you Obama made that extremely clear at
right at the moment when he made some
gesture towards Cuba he also imposed new
sanctions on Venezuela very visibly and
then something curious happened there's
a strange feature of American law which
requires that when the President does
something like say imposing sanctions he
must issue a declaration saying the
country targeted as a that it's a
national emergency the country targeted
is a threat to the security in existence
of the United States all of this wildly
inflated rhetoric so Obama issued that I
think it may be about the tenth time
he's done it but it lit a fire in Latin
America there were enormous protests
not just from the pink tide countries
from everyone illness or others bitterly
denounced this and the the even though
in fact it's kind of a technicality it's
an absurdity of course but it is a
technicality but for latin america that
means something after all there is a
history long extensive history of US
intervention to impose brutal
dictatorships to back terrorist States
killing enormous massacres is a torture
a horrible record and then you may not
think about it in the West but the Latin
Americans are quite familiar with it so
when they hear these words it it lights
some you don't like some fires but that
these were the two measures that were
announced at the same time steps towards
normalization of relations with Cuba
further sanctions against Venezuela
along with this formula about a threat a
threat to the national security etc of
the United States which of course is
absurd and it has elicited a quite a
reaction so that at the Panama summit
which just took place there were quite
mixed reactions the relaxation of the
assault on Cuba was welcomed but the
expansion of the assault on Venezuela
was condemned coming up after the break
one aspect of the deal liberal assault
has been a very significant decline in
democracy days away from our general
election no M Chomsky talks to us about
the darker side of so-called Western
democracy all this in part two of going
underground
welcome back in the second part of our
interview at now I'm Chomsky we examine
the crisis of democracy at the heart of
Western neoliberalism itself we're
facing our own general election campaign
here I know the Obama administration is
on on the wane I suppose how do you
think the Obama administration views the
subservience might say it of European
countries like Britain - American
foreign policy over the over the past
five years well I think good answer to
that question was given by a senior
American diplomat at the height of the
Missile Crisis in 1962 you remember that
the United States was in secret making
decisions which could have led to the
destruction of Britain but they weren't
informing the British about what they
were doing and this high diplomat it was
probably Dean Acheson defined the
special relationship there's supposed to
be a special relationship between the
United States and Britain he said the
special relationship means that Britain
is our lieutenant the fashionable word
is partner and the British of course
like to hear the fashionable word but we
understand the real word
there are lieutenants so the obedience
is certainly welcomed and expected but
of course on the continent we are seeing
anti-austerity government now albeit
ones that have to negotiate with the IMF
do you think Washington is a little bit
more frightened by the rise of these new
movements after decades of of course
suppressing the left since it's 45 oh
sure
actually it's before 45 it started in 43
the sure in fact the the Brussels of
bureaucrats and the banks German banks
that basically run Europe they're very
frightened by it and trying in every way
to crush it as you can see the reaction
to
Ceri says the Greek government's pretty
mild proposals has been quite savage and
with the rise of podemos in Spain a more
serious threat to the European autocracy
the fear is mounting and the u.s. surely
shares that they don't want to see
independent movements develop in Europe
or in fact anywhere that might threaten
what's called stability stability means
we run the show all the major parties
here demonizing Russia is that's what is
that what's behind the onslaught
as regards propaganda against Russia let
alone military activities well that's a
mixed story Russia is carrying out
aggressive and illegal activities you
can argue about whether it's you know
what what the reasons are and so on but
it's a fact a lot of this traces back to
NATO expansion pretty much as the
Russians say and if you go back to 1990
with the collapse of the Soviet Union
Gorbachev thought that he had an
agreement to allow unified Germany to
join NATO hostile military alliance with
a quid pro quo that NATO would not
expand the phrase was one inch to the
east
well it meaning East Germany nobody was
thinking about anything else at the time
NATO at once expanded the East Germany
when Gorbachev complained he was
instructed that it wasn't written
promised it was just that most kind of a
verbal agreement of some kind then under
Clinton NATO expanded further the East
right to the borders of Russia the
Ukraine is a very serious geopolitical
concern for any Russian government quite
apart from the deep historical connect
it's of enormous geostrategic
significance for russia the new
government and you there have been hints
talked over the years that Ukraine
should join NATO which is threatening to
Russia of course and the new government
installed after the Maidan uprising has
voted overwhelmingly to take steps to
join NATO which naturally is of deep
concern to Russia there's lots of blame
on all sides but the demonization of
Russia that you're describing is really
pretty extraordinary articles appearing
in psychology journals arguing that
Putin must have brain damage and
denunciations in the liberal British
press about this of this irritable
rat-faced man there are other insulting
stuff ago he was very reminiscent of
early cold war propaganda when the
Russians were I can remember it as a
student that laughing about it that
leading anthropologists were arguing
that Russia the Russians will vote no
veto resolutions at the Security Council
aimed against them because Russians are
raised in swaddling clothes so there you
know obstreperous and disobedient and so
on I mean this is the kind of
extraordinary nonsense it should be at
best at the fringes of propaganda
systems but it's much closer to the
center and there are real issues also
there are ways of solving and it's
pretty well understood on all sides
short of war short of conflict and the
conflict could be terminal there has to
be an agreement for Ukraine to be
neutralized not part of any military
alliance and for some form of limited
autonomy and miss
self-government and within Ukraine
because of the conflicting groups and
interests there
it's a soluble problem but not by
ascending yes thanks a couple of yards
from the border of Russia what about if
anti-austerity parties in Europe start
to look for finance from Russia or
indeed China because of the lack of
support from European institutions or
the IMF well there have of course been
initial contacts between syriza and
Russia and Putin exactly what they
amount to is not clear maybe some trade
agreements or whatever but they they
elicited a lot of anger in the West the
the Western policy is to isolate and
punish Russia and any break in this is
regarded as very serious
of course European Union sanctions could
be vetoed by Greece one country can veto
them but just the breaking of discipline
is already frightening do you see any
diminution in the manufacturing of
consent I mean we didn't go to war in
Syria and the austerity seems to have
had such a huge impact on vast swathe of
the population here in Europe against
neoliberalism neoliberalism has been a
disaster everywhere and there has been
finally resistance to it actually the
major resistance and it's quite
significant is Latin America Latin
America was it was an obedient disciple
of the neoliberal principles so-called
Washington Consensus and it suffered
severely but in the last decade Latin
America has begun to break free that's
exactly the kind of thing we've seen at
the recent summons for the first time in
500 years
Latin America has begun to resist and
disentangle itself from Imperial control
last century or so that means us control
which is an event of historic
significance also the Latin American
countries are taking steps towards
integration like Onis or for example say
LOC other steps which is very
significant that's a prerequisite for
independence and they have also begun
finally to pay attention to try to
direct policy towards the shocking
internal problems of Latin America I
remember a traditional Latin American
country say Brazil you know Bolivia all
of them traditionally has been run by a
tiny elite Europeanized often white
which has which which accepts no
responsibility toward the people of the
country they're super rich living in a
mass of poverty and misery in quite rich
countries but they're or they have been
oriented to the West not to the wrong
country so the export capital import
luxury goods
don't bother with taxes don't bother
with development of the country and so
on I'm it's not 100 percent but it's
that's been the tendency and that's the
beginning of change that's the plenty of
hurdles but there have been significant
changes that's the major resistance
against neoliberalism and it has been
pretty successful not totally but pretty
successful it's now beginning in Europe
in the the more the countries that are
more harshly affected everyone's
affected but the real serious victims
like Greece and Spain yes there's a
reaction it may spread developing in the
United States too that's what the
demonstrations are about in fact right
now on the minimum wage one of the
effects of neoliberalism in the United
States has to create a situation in
which the majority of the population
have seen their incomes pretty much
stagnate for a generation
ever since the neoliberal assault began
the current demonstrations are calling
for a partially not totally but
partially overcoming this assault and
that's another kind of attack on the
neoliberal plague which has been
extremely harmful virtually everywhere
what advice would you give to those
protesting here in London against TTIP
some of whom think there's a crisis in
democracy itself many of the major
parties don't defend their interests
many people saying there's no point in
even voting in the British general
election what would you say to them well
one aspect of the neoliberal assault has
been a very significant decline in
democracy democratic functioning that's
true just about everywhere at the United
States by now is really a plutocracy
very extensive studies have shown
convincingly that a considerable
majority of the population is
essentially disenfranchised there are
representatives pay no attention to them
the lower majority and the income scale
and something similar has happened
elsewhere I don't think it means there's
no point voting there are differences
and they can expand and powerful systems
small differences can have big
consequences but there has to be a major
effort to reverse the assault on
democracy which has been going on for 30
or 40 years professor Noam Chomsky thank
you thank you
that's it for today betray us again on
Monday when we talk to a high-profile
barrister about new legislation that has
just come into force that may mean it's
better to plead guilty to crimes you
didn't commit until then you can find us
