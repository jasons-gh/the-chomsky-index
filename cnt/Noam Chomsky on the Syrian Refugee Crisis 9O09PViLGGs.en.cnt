I the bookie right words can hardly
capture the US response to the Syrian
refugee crisis oh lucky to talk about
more time in these Syrian refugee crisis
a real horror story serious collapsing
into self-destruction millions of people
are fleeing the disaster and we have had
a role in it not the entire world but
some so for example Isis the Islamic
so-called Islamic state is an outgrowth
one of the horrible outgrowths of the
u.s. sledgehammer that smashed up Iraq
that ignited among other atrocities it
ignited a sectarian conflict button
existed before which is owned tearing
the region apart if you look at the US
allies like Turkey they're contributing
massively to the crisis by attacking the
one around force that's the pursuer
actually not only defending their own
territory and constructing a remarkably
decent society in the context that it's
harder but are also fighting the Isis
forces their Iraqi associates are on the
US terrorist list Turkey's attacking
them other help US allies Qatar Saudi
Arabia are supporting it's Turkey is
supporting us other groups which even
the West regards as terrorist groups the
elements were from anyhow we have a role
how many Syrian refugees are we exactly
basically none and those who have to go
through a long vetting process to make
sure that nobody is an Islamic
terrorists pretending to be a doctor and
the fear the United States is probably
the safest country in the world it's
also the most frightened country in the
world it's just shocking
and simply with regard to the Syrians
it's it words they'll capture it with
regard to Central America Mexico
xenoverse there our role in creating the
situation from which people are fleeing
was decisive just a couple weeks ago to
the local newspaper Boston Globe had a
good story to their credit one of the
many deportations that the Obama
administration is carrying out they have
a record so far of deporting people this
happened to be a man who had been living
here for decades
Guatemalan a family business of problems
Immigration Service pounced on sent him
out of the country where was he from
it was sling from the area cement areas
were virtual genocide had been carried
out with the strong support of the
Reagan administration so he's fleeing
from our virtual genocidal activities
made a life for himself so Obama picks
him up and sends him back to the parts
of his family sends him back to a
situation and barely survived the
plurality of the peak of what was called
the refugee crisis most of the refugees
were coming from Honduras why under very
poor country horrible history will roll
in in 2009 it was beginning to escape
that had a reformist president who was
proposing some mild reforms which would
have been very help
the population he was thrown out by a
military coup the coup organized an
election which practically nobody paid
any attention to set the United States
the Obama administration legitimated had
some critical words effectively
legitimated the coup which they refused
to call it coup so that they could
continue to send arms and the election
the consequence was that Honduras which
was already in pretty horrible
conditions became a major Horror Story
the worst of the violence in the
hemisphere baby in the world
people started fleeing so what do we do
we send them back we ask Mexico to
prevent them from coming to our borders
which incidentally is just what the
European Union is doing the turkey get
turkey to keep more away from us we
caused the problems somebody else has to
solve we don't suffer in fact if you
look around the world there are
countries that generate refugees that
we're peak probably there are countries
that accept refugees like say 11 poor
country with quarter of the population
of Syrian refugees that's on top of
other refugee flows from from Palestine
from the rack for which we there are
plenty of responsibility and then there
are countries that generate refugees and
refuse to take them in like us and I
could say the same but your Europe is
consumed with the refugee crisis
including the refugees fleeing from
Africa a couple of centuries of history
relating Europe from Africa with an
attribute but now we can't handle these
and it's in the United States it's
protest but something in Europe it is -
in fact the violence against immigrants
in Europe is much beyond what it is here
people burning down houses neo-nazi
groups developing it's grotesque and you
look at the numbers there are two
countries that have a are at the peak of
having done something
Sweden in German Sweden is a country of
about eight men in people it has 40
thousand refugees half of 1% of the
population so it's groaning under a
hopeless crisis as I said Lebanon
quarter poor country twenty-five percent
of its population refugees from Syria
Jordans
similar Germany did at first absorb
refugees of the may be opinion it's
country of over eighty million people
very rich country not a very pretty
historical record which I want to go
through but can't handle it
Belgium has actually the worst record in
Africa even worse than the other
European countries and it's not ancient
history the Belgian Congo former Belgian
Congo which ought to be one of the
richest areas in the world leader in
African revival that did achieve
independence in 1960 with a very
promising young leader one of the most
promising in Africa Church Lumumba the
CIA was ordered killing but the
Belgium's got there first
and they didn't take any chances as his
body was cut up into pieces and
than sulfuric acid things like Isis the
US Belgium other Western countries
immediately supported a murderers
kleptomaniac horrible dictator ruined
the country right now the worst
atrocities in the world are being
carried out in the Congo partly usl
everyone does involved partly its
militias trying to steal the rich
mineral resources with multinationals
that over their shoulders so that we can
get the minerals that are used in
everybody's iPhone high-tech devices
many people have been killed every
possible horror story but Belgium is
groaning under the crisis of the refugee
crisis like the rest of us the whole
picture is just again I'm thinking
