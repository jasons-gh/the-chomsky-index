today on the show we have a special
guest for an extended conversation
on a wide range of issues from the war
in afghanistan to north korea
syria iran russia and the election
big tech companies and the role they
play in our lives propaganda and beyond
our guest is the legendary american
dissident and scholar
noam chomsky i'm sure that pretty much
every single one of our listeners
is familiar with chomsky but you'll
almost never see him
on major tv networks in the united
states globally yes chomsky is on tv
all the time around the world but here
in his home country
nope and if i'm not mistaken he has
never been
on nbc abc cbs or fox
he did a few interviews over the years
on pbs on the charlie rose show
and i believe he was on cnn for a couple
of minutes once
such is the fate of dissidents in the
home of the brave
here's one of the few times that noam
chomsky was actually allowed on ustv
it was way back on april 3rd 1969
when chomsky debated the famed
conservative william f buckley
the show was broadcast under the title
vietnam
and the intellectuals and it was part of
buckley's show firing line
what seems to me a very in a sense
terrifying aspect of our society
and other societies is the equanimity
and the detachment
with which sane reasonable sensible
people
can observe such events i think that's
more terrifying than the occasional
hitler or lemay or other that crops up
these people would not be able to
operate were not for the
this apathy and equanimity and therefore
i think that it's
in some sense the sane and reasonable
and tolerant people who
should who share a very serious burden
of guilt that they
very easily throw on the shoulders of
others who
seem more extreme and more violent no i
agree but
noam chomsky is one of the most popular
and influential political thinkers
in the world yet in the united states
you'll only find him on
independent alternative media outlets
look at all the pundits and
criminals who are constantly on tv today
the people with
long public careers in mass killing or
mass lying
this is part of the problem it's a big
part of the problem in this country
how different would this country be
would the world be
if noam chomsky and other principal
dissidents were regularly featured
on major news broadcasts chomsky is
currently a laureate professor in the
department of linguistics
at the university of arizona he's
professor emeritus at massachusetts
institute of technology
where he taught for more than half a
century chomsky's recent books include
global discontents conversations on the
rising threats to democracy
and requiem for the american dream the
10 principles of concentration of wealth
and
power he's also the co-author with the
late ed hermann
of the classic book manufacturing
consent the political economy of the
mass media
noam chomsky welcome to intercepted very
glad to be with you
if you watch and i know you are not a
fan of television news
but if you watch particularly msnbc
or cnn right now or you read
the major newspapers in the united
states you can come away with the
impression
that donald trump and his administration
his presidency
represent this grand departure from the
way things
are done in the united states
historically
how much of a departure is the trump
presidency from the
bipartisan washington empire consensus
the way that the u.s has been
governed throughout its history there
are some
differences and many continuities
on the domestic scene trump is
very effectively managing
both of his constituencies there's an
authentic constituency of
corporate power and private wealth
and they're being served magnificently
by the executive orders uh
legislative programs that are being
pushed through
which represent the more savage
wing of the traditional republican
policies
catering to private interests and
private wealth
and dismissing the rest as irrelevant
and easily disposed of at the same time
he's managing to maintain
the voting constituency
by pretending very effectively
to be the one person in the world who
stands up for them against the hated
elites
and this is quite an impressive con
job how long he can carry it off i don't
know
on the international scene it's actually
more interesting
uh he's being lambasted
for taking positions which
in my view are pretty reasonable
so for example in the case of korea
the two koreas last april 27th
it came out with a historic declaration
in which they laid out fairly explicit
plans
for moving towards reconciliation
integration and denuclearization of the
peninsula kim jong-un made history today
becoming the first north korean leader
to set foot
in the south since the korean war began
in 1950.
he promised a new beginning as he met
with south korea's moon jae-in
in the demilitarized zone between the
two countries the meeting marks the
first summit
between the koreas in more than a decade
they pretty much pleaded with
outsiders that means the united states
to permit them to proceed as they put it
on their own accord and so far
trump has not interfered with this very
much
calling off temporarily at least the
military
exercises which as he correctly said are
highly provocative he's been lambasted
for that but it's exactly the right
position i think
in the case of russia it's
more complex his policies have in fact
been
twofold his administration has
continued the policies of building up
the military forces on the russian
border carrying out military maneuvers
increasing the tensions in a extremely
dangerous part of the world
on the other hand he has also taken
somewhat conciliatory steps
towards reducing tensions and for that
again he's been
lambasted though i think it's the right
thing to do
on other issue matters he's
torn up important international
agreements the most significant
was the iran nuclear agreement i am
announcing today
that the united states will withdraw
from the iran nuclear deal
in a few moments i will sign a
presidential memorandum
to begin reinstating u.s nuclear
sanctions
on the iranian regime we will be
instituting the highest level
of economic sanction that's in
isolation from the entire world in this
case
and that's very serious and the most
serious of all
by far overshadowing everything else is
his pulling out of the paris
negotiations
the paris climate accord is simply the
latest example of washington
entering into an agreement that
disadvantages
the united states to the exclusive
benefit of other countries
leaving american workers who i love
and taxpayers to absorb the cost
in terms of lost jobs lower wages
shuttered factories
and vastly diminished economic
production thus as of today
the united states will cease all
implementation
of the non-binding paris accord
and the draconian financial and economic
burdens
the agreement imposes on our country
leaves the united states says the only
country in the world which is
refusing officially to take
even small steps towards dealing with a
true
existential crisis and that's combined
with the domestic programs of
rapidly increasing the use of the most
dangerous fossil fuels
cutting back regulations on
economy for for automobiles
eliminating safety protections for
workers and so on
all of that is just a race to disaster
and that's by far the most
serious of the initiatives to
undermine what's loosely called the
international order
raising questions about nato for example
is
quite a reasonable thing to do that one
might certainly
ask why nato even exists
after the collapse of the soviet union
not that there weren't
questions before there were but
the official story was that nato was in
place to defend
the west against the russian hordes
which
putting aside the validity of that claim
that was the official stand
the russian cynical blockade of berlin
had brought europe to the brink of war
it was at last clear that only a strong
alliance could deter them from further
adventures
on 4 april 1949 the north atlantic
treaty was signed by norway
denmark the netherlands belgium
luxembourg france italy portugal
the united kingdom iceland canada and
the united states
this union of 12 nations became known as
the north atlantic treaty organization
or more simply nato
after the soviet union collapsed a
fair question arose as to why nato
should
survive and what it did was in fact
expand expanded all the way to the
russian border
initially under the first bush
then extensively under clinton and by
2008 even uh offering uh
to have ukraine join data that's
an attack on russian geostrategic
interests that
no russian leader could easily accept
all of this increases threats
tensions quite unnecessarily at the same
time
nato changed its official mission to
what they call safeguard control the
international energy system pipelines
and sea lanes
and though it's unmentioned to serve as
essentially an intervention force for
the united states
we have a good indication of how the
world saw that
international order the gallup polling
agency takes international
polls of international opinion every
year in 2013
for the first time they asked an
interesting question
they asked the question which country is
the greatest threat to world peace
the united states was in first place
no one no other country was even close
far behind in second place was pakistan
that was
doubtless inflated by the indian vote
the countries that are called the
greatest threat to world peace here
in the united states like iran were
barely even mentioned
interestingly gallup never asked that
polling question again
and it was the answer was not reported
in the mainstream press
you bring up the issue of nato and of
course
right now in the united states when
vladimir putin
is discussed there is a lot of
resurrection of kind of cold war imagery
there are books being published with
backwards rs on them which isn't even in
cyrillic
it's not even actually the letter r but
there's this sort of
portrayal of putin as sort of the
bolsheviks
rising and this you know idea that
russia
is seeking to take over the united
states and russia
is responsible for donald trump being
president because they quote unquote
hacked our election what is true
and what is hyperbole propaganda
exaggeration
about russia and putin specifically
taking into account the u.s posture
toward ukraine
nato but also the issue of electoral
interference
what is true is that after the collapse
of the soviet union in 1990
1991 there was a period under yeltsin
in which the united states pretty much
dominated what was happening in russia
and the
region around russia nato was expanded
the russian economy totally collapsed
under the imposed harsh
market reforms there was a radical
collapse of the economy
a sharp increase in the mortality rate
russia was really devastated when putin
came in
he he's not a nice guy i would
not like to have dinner with him but you
can understand his policies
his policies were to try to restore
some role for russia at least in its own
region of the world which we might
recall
happened to be the traditional invasion
routes
through which russia was attacked
virtually destroyed
several times in the last century so
this is not a small
question and yes putin is trying to
restore
some degree of russian power in the
world
some degree of russian authority one
extension of that and in fact the only
one
is the russian position in syria all of
this
encroaches on the global domination
of the united states and secondarily its
allies
which is kind of taken to be the norm
the norm is
we rule everything and if someone else
tries to control their own
area that's disruptive of the
international system
which from a certain point of view it is
if you take a look at russian power as
compared with the united states it's
the risery just one indication
trump's his increase in the finch budget
practically reaches the entire
russian military budget so the idea of
russia taking over the world
is uh ludicrous what it means is that
they're
trying often in ways that
merit condemnation but nevertheless
trying to restore some degree
of russian influence in the regions
uh surrounding russia plus syria their
one mediterranean base
and to try to establish a place for
russia in the world system
far weaker than the united states weaker
than china in fact
one of russia's international problems
is
to keep from being overwhelmed by
chinese power
that's the kind of disruption of the
international order that
is attributed to russia you raised this
issue
of russia in syria of course the united
states iran
turkey qatar the list of countries
involved
actively in the just generically let's
call it the syrian war right now
you do have a debate on the left in the
united states about what a sort of just
position looks like toward the conflict
in syria and of course
you have isolationists or libertarians
or anti-imperialists who
take the position of there should be
total hands-off syria that this is a
a civil war i think the honest among
us would say that of course bashar
al-assad is
a war criminal he is a mass murderer but
he
is in a conflict with a lot of mass
murderers and a lot of war criminals
what noam chomsky do you believe is
a just position to take on
the war in syria is it that people
should defend
bashar al-assad with the idea that
it's the least bad option or that this
is a matter that should be handled by
the syrians
or is there any international
involvement
that you think makes any sense or could
be justified under both
moral principles and legal principles
well the first point to bear in mind
which you've already mentioned
is that assad is a horrible
war criminal the bulk of the atrocities
which are enormous
are his responsibility there's no
justifying assad on the other hand the
fact of the matter is that
he is essentially and pretty much in
control of syria now
thanks largely to russian partially
iranian support
the russians actually entered syria
extensively after the cia
had provided the rebel forces which are
mostly
run by jihadi elements provided them
with
advanced anti-tank missiles which were
styming the syrian army at which point
the russians came in
with the air power and overwhelmed the
opposition
the current situation is that
assad has pretty much won the war
like it or not there was in the early
stages
a democratic secular quite respectable
opposition but they were very quickly
overwhelmed by
the jihadi elements supported from the
outside
saudi arabia qatar the united states
and others there's a pending
humanitarian
catastrophe in idlib province where the
jihadis have been the place to which
they've been expelled or fled
if there's a syrian russian attack on
that it could be a
total humanitarian catastrophe there's
some indication that
the russians and the turks may have been
provided a safe area to which
maybe some civilians can flee but that
looks like a monstrosity developing if
there's a way of
countering that attack it should be
pursued by
diplomatic means the other crucial
question
is the status of the kurdish areas
rojava in my opinion it makes sense
for the united states to maintain a
presence
which would deter an attack on the
kurdish areas
they have the one part of syria which
has
succeeded in sustaining a
functioning society with many decent
elements and the idea that they should
be subjected to an attack by their
bitter enemies the turks or by the
murderous assad regime i think
is anything should be done to try to
prevent that
let me ask you about that point because
you are one of the leading people in the
world
that is consistently reminding
the world that the united states has
always adopted
a posture of certain kurds or good kurds
certain kurds are bad kurds
and the united states has poured
money and weapons into the coffers of
for instance the turkish military
explicitly to be used for an ongoing
attempt at genocide against the kurds so
i'm i'm curious how you reconcile that
with
a position that the united states would
in essence be the protector of the kurds
in the context of the syrian war the
united states
like other great powers does not pursue
humanitarian objectives it pursues
objectives determined by power
considerations and they lead to
different positions with regard to the
kurds or others at different times
so for example in the 1970s
there was a time when the united states
supported
kurds against saddam hussein shortly
after a deal was made in which they
sacrificed the kurds to saddam hussein
that led to henry kissinger's famous
comment that we shouldn't confuse
foreign policy with the
missionary activity it's entirely true
that especially in the 1990s
clinton was pouring arms into turkey
for the purpose of carrying out
massive murderous destructive attacks
against the
the kurdish population of turkey in the
southeast
enormously destructive that does not
change the fact that now
the united states could with a
relatively small presence
deter attacks against the kurds in syria
which could destroy the one part of
syria that is actually
functioning in a decent fashion we don't
expect
consistency in humanitarian terms
from a great power because those are not
the guiding principles
regarding afghanistan we're now 17 plus
years in afghanistan in the context of
9 11. shouldn't we be talking about
afghanistan as
a obviously a war that the united states
should have
never started and and secondarily that
the united states has actually been
militarily and politically defeated in
afghanistan
well my own view as you may recall back
in
at the time was that the use of military
force
in afghanistan was inappropriate and
illegitimate
there were diplomatic options they could
have been pursued
but the united states wanted to use
force
i think the perhaps the most accurate
description of what the united states
did was by
abdul haqq one of the most respected and
honored of the
afghan anti-taliban activists who in
fact was killed
in afghanistan who strongly opposed the
us bombing as
most of the afghan dissidents did and
argued that the united states was
bombing just because it wanted to show
its muscle and intimidate everyone
else and it was undermining the efforts
of the
anti-taliban afghan resistance to
solve the problem on the wrong working
their way through the rush hour that
morning
two men were about to offer the u.s
government the chance to topple the
taliban regime in afghanistan
to expel al-qaeda from its terrorist
bases
and to capture osama bin laden
[Music]
this plan had been put together by abdul
haq one of
afghanistan's most respected leaders and
was the culmination of haqq's lifetime
struggle to save his country
i think his analysis was correct we've
now gone through
17 years of failed attempts to impose
a u.s dominated system
there is an afghan peace movement it's
not enormous but it's significant
it's been there for several years we
should be
doing what we can to support it to lead
them
to find a solution internal to
afghanistan reconciling to the extent
possible
the conflicting warring factions
they're ethnically divided divided in
other terms
it's a extraordinary problem
the most we can do is to try to
facilitate
efforts among the afghans i don't think
there's much that
the united states can hope to do beyond
that
and the idea of imposing a military
solution
looks out of the question do you believe
it's accurate to say that the united
states has been militarily defeated
in afghanistan well certainly it has not
achieved any of its objectives
after a huge expenditure so give it
whatever name you like
i mean great power like the united
states never really gets defeated
it may not achieve its maximal
objectives
so for example let's take vietnam it's
almost
universally described as a u.s defeat
but if you look back at the original
planning
this goes back to the early 50s for why
the united states became involved in
vietnam
turns out it wasn't a complete defeat
the us
did not achieve its maximal objectives
of turning uh
vietnam into something like the
philippines
but it did achieve its major objective
of preventing an
independent south vietnam
from becoming a model that might be
followed by
others towards a successful independent
development
perhaps eroding the whole southeast asia
east asia order
which is what the planners were
concerned with in the early 1950s and
that was in fact stopped
power like the united states is unlikely
to face
anything like a real defeat a failure
perhaps
i wanted to also make sure to ask you
about this ongoing
slaughter in yemen recently cnn and some
of the other networks have
started showing images of u.s missile
parts
from munitions that for instance killed
an entire bus full
of school children recently this video
of shrapnel was filmed in the aftermath
of the attack
and sent to cnn by contact and sadder a
cameraman working for cnn subsequently
filmed
these images for us munitions experts
tell cnn this was a us-made mark
mk82 bomb weighing in at
500 pounds the first five digits there
are the cage number the commercial and
government entity number
this number here denotes lockheed martin
one of the top us defense contractors
but there was a dearth of that kind of
reporting when obama was waging
what started as a secret deniable
bombing campaign he kicked it off in
december of 2009 with a cluster bomb
attack that killed three dozen
women and children in the village of el
modula in yemen
and then regularly was hitting yemen
with
drone strikes but it also is often
portrayed as kind of
trump supporting the saudis when in
reality the u.s first bombed yemen
in november of 2002 this has been going
on for a
uh quite a long time what is the us
motivation for uh this
mass slaughter in yemen right now that
is primarily being carried out
by saudi warplanes that were
given to the saudis by the united states
and of course the u.s is doing all the
intelligence assistance the refueling
and the providing of munitions but what
what is the u.s
agenda in yemen as you can see the u.s
and you're quite right in tracing this
back to obama in fact even earlier
the united states wants to ensure that
yemen will be incorporated within the
system of reactionary arab states
that the u.s dominates
and largely controls that's saudi arabia
united arab emirates
which is a quite a significant military
power
by the standards of the region and quite
vicious and brutal
the houthi presumably gets some degree
of
iranian support to regard that as the
iran as the major threat in the region
is ridiculous
the u.s and secondarily britain have
been
arming and developing supporting the
military forces and actions of
saudi arabia and the uae with the
consequences
that you describe it's becoming one of
the worst humanitarian disasters in the
world the
attack on the port the united port
coalition forces are closing in
and the fighting around the airport has
blocked a key exit
out of the city making it harder to
transport much-needed food aid from
hodeidah
the country's largest port to the rest
of the country
8.4 million yemenis are already at risk
of starvation
the war has created the world's worst
humanitarian crisis
we can trace this back much farther if
you like
so back in the early 1960s there was a
war
proxy war going on in yemen
between saudi arabia and
egypt at that point egypt was the center
of
secular arab nationalism under nasser
and regarded as the main enemy by the
united states
saudi arabia was the center
of radical islam and very much like the
british
before us the united states has tended
systematically to support radical
islamism
against secular nationalism uh that war
was raging
right through the 60s it was significant
war
israel settled that problem
for the united states and saudi arabia
by smashing
secular arab nationalism in 1967
and that in fact is the major turning
point
in u.s israeli relations israel
performed a great service to the united
states and saudi it's saudi arabian ally
and the radical islamism that's centered
there
by eliminating the secular nationalist
alternative
and since then u.s relations with israel
have been
kind of unique even historically but
certainly in the modern world
and this is now another continuation of
it with
different cast of characters slightly
but yemen has been regarded as
it's the poorest of arab states uh the
most miserable in many ways
torn by all sorts of internal conflicts
and
the us continues to be committed to
trying to ensure that its
close allies the radical islamist
states saudi arabia uae
maintain control against any
adversary egypt at that time iran which
is
a very minor participant in fact not
like egypt which had a major army there
very minor participant in this case
i'm sure that you paid attention to the
reporting around
national security adviser john bolton's
speech
at the federalist society in which he
launched this
blistering attack on the international
criminal court the icc
and of course john bolton has always
been against
international law and its application to
the united states
but bolton did point something out in
that speech that i think is important
for people to
understand and it's accurate bolton
described how
in 2002 the u.s congress
by in a bipartisan fashion passed
legislation that was
known in human rights circles as the
hague invasion act
this law which enjoyed broad bipartisan
support
authorizes the president to use all
means necessary and appropriate
including force to shield our service
members and the armed forces of our
allies from icc prosecution
it also prohibits several forms of
cooperation between the united states
and the court
such radical right wingers as hillary
clinton
and joe biden and many powerful
democratic senators
they actually voted for that legislation
and yet
when bolton does his attack on the icc
it was portrayed as oh my god look at
how these trump people are so
outside of the norm but the reality
isn't it true
is that this has been the bipartisan
power consensus
from the very beginning that no
international law should actually apply
to the united states
and both republicans and democrats
including the democrats nominee in 2016
believe that the united states would
have a right to militarily intervene to
prevent a war crimes prosecution
of any of its personnel you're
absolutely correct
in europe as you say it's called the
netherlands invasion act
authorizes the president to use military
force as they put it to rescue
any american who might be brought to
trial anywhere
so you're quite correct it's unfair to
blame this position on trump
and bolton goes way back and it goes
much farther back than that
so for example uh let's go back to 1984
the united states in 1984 was ju
was by the world court was ordered
to terminate what was called unlawful
use of force
which means international terrorism
against
the state of nicaragua and to pay very
substantial
reparations ducking the world court on
the question drew
barb's two on the house floor mr speaker
many of us have known for some time
that the reagan administration's central
america policies
couldn't stand the light of day but now
the administration
is admitting as much by refusing to
accept the jurisdiction of the
international court of justice over the
cia's mining of nicaraguan ports
the administration has demonstrated that
it knows
that its policies can't withstand an
inquiry by an impartial objective
international body the us rejected the
authorization of the world court
and did so with the strong support of
liberal america so the new york times
for example
had an editorial condemning the court
as what it called a hostile forum and
therefore illegitimate
it was a hostile forum because it
condemned the united states
three years earlier the new york times
had lauded the world
court as a marvelous forum because it
supported the united states in a
claim against iran but now it was a
hostile forum and therefore illegitimate
so the u.s had no need to pay any
attention to its orders
in fact the u.s even went so far as to
veto a security council resolution
basically calling on states to observe
international law
didn't mention the united states but was
obvious what the intent was
all of this with the support of liberal
opinion
across the board now at that time the
united states was not alone
in defying the world court i think
libya and albania had also rejected
world court decisions but they later
accepted
them so the united states as far as i'm
aware is now in
splendid isolation and having rejected
a decision to the world court and that's
entirely consistent with the
2002 legislation authorizing the
executive to use military force
to block any act against americans by
the international criminal court
if that's even conceivable just
parenthetically
i don't want to get into this but i do
think it's worth just mentioning it
that when victims of the u.s torture
program
the so-called extraordinary rendition
program or people that were
taken to guantanamo or the black sites
filed lawsuits
in the united states against donald
rumsfeld
president george w bush dick cheney or
other officials
for the torture that they endured or the
kidnapping that they endured
the justice department intervened in
those cases
using something called the westfall act
which actually has to do with u.s labor
law
and even attorney general eric holder
under obama
filed briefs in these lawsuits against
bush-era accused war criminals saying
that even if they had committed
genocide that it was within the official
scope of their duties
and therefore they were removed as
defendants
in those cases and replaced by the u.s
government which has sovereign immunity
and therefore they were dismissed so
it's not just on on a level of
international
war or conflict it's also on an
individual level
with u.s officials the position of the
justice department
including under obama was that even if
donald rumsfeld was involved with
genocide it would have been within the
official scope of his duties and
therefore
he cannot be held individually
responsible for it
yeah that's a kind of a counterpart to
the fact that
the u.s did add a reservation to the
genocide
convention when it signed it finally
saying we're immune
incidentally on the torture program
there's more to be said
actually there's good studies of this by
alfred mccoy
outstanding historian who did some of
the major work among other things on
the history of torture he's a great
friend of this show and has been on
several times he also was my professor
uh when i was a briefly an undergraduate
at the university of wisconsin
okay so i don't have to lord him do you
done excellent work
but on torture he pointed out that when
the united states
signed the international torture
convention i
think it was 1984 or so the senate
rewrote the
convention to exclude the modes of
torture
that were carried out by the c.i.a and
that was then
instituted into law under clinton
so you could argue that much of the
torture carried out under the bush
administration
was actually not in violation of u.s law
as
mccoy also points out the significant
difference between the guantanamo
bagram abu ghraib torture
and earlier periods was that in earlier
periods
the u.s supervised the torture and
trained the torturers
in latin america southeast asia
but for this time the u.s
personnel were actually involved
directly in the torture instead of
supervising it and training the
torturers
so that's a slight change but from a
moral point of view not a
very significant one i do want to make
sure to get your
sense of what's happening right now
regarding the united states and
venezuela
of course you had nicolas maduro
supposedly surviving a drone strike
also these generals
mutinous generals it appears meeting
with the trump administration
to plot a coup coordinate it's unclear
exactly what's happening but it does
seem as though the united states is
trying to
once again foment either a coup or
a removal of nicolas maduro uh juco
chavez's successor
my sense of this is that the united
states would
support a coup but not that it's really
trying to instigate it
after all in the year 2002
there was a military coup in venezuela
which briefly overthrew the government
eliminated parliament
supreme court it was reversed by a
popular uprising
but during the time of the coup the
united states
openly and quite publicly supported the
military coup
as did the liberal press there was a
time
back in the 1960s 1970s
when the u.s was in fact in a position
to
implement and strongly support
military coups right throughout the
continent
this traces back to a decision
by john f kennedy in 1962
to change the mission
of the latin american military from
what was called hemispheric defense that
was a
holdover from world war ii anachronistic
from hemispheric defense to internal
security
and in the latin american context
internal security means
war by the military and paramilitaries
against the civilian population
now in 1962 the u.s was in a position
to change to shift the mission of the
latin american military
and in fact essentially to prepare
what became the first major military
coup
1964 in brazil then
others won country after another chile
uruguay finally argentina the worst of
them
strongly supported by kissinger and
reagan then on to central america but
the us just doesn't have that power
anymore
one thing that's happened in recent
years is that
latin america has to a certain extent
extricated itself from
imperial meaning recently u.s control
this shows in many ways like largely
expelling the
imf which for latin america is a branch
of the treasury department
eliminating the formal u.s military
bases
so the u.s is doubtless involved and
it will continue to support the
traditional policies but not with the
degree of power
it once had in the case of venezuela
if there were to be a military coup i
don't doubt that the us would support it
maybe
with some clicking of tongues about how
it's not a nice thing
but short of that i think the us is
likely to continue with
subversion and sabotage and support for
the
right-wing elements on the other hand it
should be pointed out that venezuela is
a
major disaster at this point
partly for external reasons but
considerably for internal reasons
this year's 30 years since you and the
great late ed hermann
published manufacturing consent the
political economy of the mass media
and i wanted to get your thoughts on the
role that
huge social media companies play in our
society
given that they are replacing a lot of
news organizations or the way that
people changing the way people consume
information google facebook twitter etc
there's a lot of talk about this there's
hearings on capitol hill
there's a lot of pleading with the
billionaires to kick
certain people off of social media
remove their accounts
what about the way that these entities
the facebooks google's twitters of the
world
have changed us as people and our
society and the way we process
disseminate absorb information
well your words process and disseminate
and absorb
are correct but not produce the
source of information remains
the major media the correspondents on
the ground
who often do excellent and courageous
and very valuable work
facebook and the rest may filter
information that they get from those
sources
and presented in ways which uh
you know much of the public finds it
easier to digest i
don't think that's a healthy development
but it does it is happening
and that means uh essentially uh
dividing much of the population much
discussion of this into cocoons into
bubbles in which they receive the
information
conducive to their own interests and
commitments if you read a major
newspaper say the new york times you get
a
certain range of opinion it's narrow
it's basically centrist to far
right but at least it's a range of
opinion
those who are more addicted to social
media
tend to turn directly to what supports
their own views not to hear other things
that's not a
good thing google facebook and the rest
those are
commercial institutions their
constituency is
basically advertisers and they would
like to
to establish the kinds of controls
over their consumers that will be
beneficial to their business model
enabled them to get advertising that
has very serious distorting effects
and we know that they provide massive
information
to the corporate system which they use
for their own
uh in their own efforts to try to shape
and
control behavior and opinion all of this
is a dangerous development the
the power of these private corporations
to
direct people in particular directions
and so on that's a
serious problem which requires
considerable thought and attention
in all of the decades of debating these
issues
and campaigning for human rights and
against
u.s wars have things changed and is it
worth it to
spend a lifetime doing what you've done
for young people that are listening
i think if we look over the years we can
see that there has been
considerable achievements in changing
public attitudes with regard to
aggression human rights civil rights and
so on
i don't take credit for the plenty of
people are involved
plenty of activists many of them young
but the changes are very significant
let's go back to the 1960s in the 1960s
kennedy escalated the war in 1961 and
62.
that's when kennedy authorized the u.s
air force to begin directly bombing
rural south vietnam authorized napalm
chemical warfare to destroy crops and
livestock organized mass
programs to drive much of the peasantry
into
what amounted to concentration camps
strategic hamlets
huge escalation what was the public
reaction
zero i at the time if i wanted to give a
talk about it i'd talk in somebody's
living room
or something like that there was no
protest in fact for years
it was difficult or even impossible to
have public meetings
in boston which is a liberal city public
meetings
were violently broken up with the
support of the press
churches were attacked and so on in fact
it wasn't until about
1967 that a large-scale opposition to
the war
developed and by that time south vietnam
had been practically destroyed
and the word expanded the rest of
indochina
well finally there was a public reaction
[Applause]
in 1981 the reagan administration came
in
and attempted to duplicate what kennedy
had done in the early
60s almost step by step you know they
intended to
essentially invade central america white
paper blaming the international
communists huge propaganda campaign and
so on
it was almost instantly aborted by
a popular opposition there was such
massive popular opposition
from popular groups from the churches
and others
that they had to back off what happened
was awful enough
but it wasn't vietnam they had to turn
to bringing in other states like
taiwan israel the argentine neo-nazis to
try to carry out the atrocities u.s
couldn't do it directly
that's very significant let's go on to
2003
when the u.s invaded iraq the worst
crime of this century
that's the first war in the history of
imperialism
in which the war was massively protested
before it was officially launched that's
never happened before
[Music]
now it's commonly said that the
opposition failed but i don't agree
that restricted the kinds of military
actions that the u.s was able to carry
out again horrible enough but nothing
like vietnam
well all of these are indications of and
there are many others of
shifts of popular attitudes towards
aggression
intervention human rights violations and
so on
which make a difference they haven't
gone far enough
but there's a considerable improvement
well noam chomsky thank you very much
for being so generous uh with your time
we really appreciate you being with us
on intercepted
good glad to be with you
