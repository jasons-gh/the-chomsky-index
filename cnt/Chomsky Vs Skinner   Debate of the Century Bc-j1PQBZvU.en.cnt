if in fact our minds were a blank slate
and experience wrote on them we would be
very impoverished creatures indeed so
the obvious hypothesis is that our
language is the result of the unfolding
of a genetically determined program well
plainly there are different languages in
fact the apparent variation of languages
is quite superficial it's certain as it
that's at certain veining Hill is that
humans are not genetically programmed to
learn one or another language so you
bring up a Japanese baby in Boston that
will speak Boston English and you bring
up my child in Japan it'll speak
Japanese and that means that the base
that from that it fought from from that
it simply follows by logic that the
basic structure of the languages must be
essentially the same our task as
scientists is to try to determine
exactly what those fundamental
principles are that cause the knowledge
of language to unfold in the manner in
which it does under particular
circumstances and incidentally I think
there is no doubt the same must be true
of other aspects of human intelligence
and systems of understanding and
interpretation and moral and aesthetic
judgment and so on
my question is a little bit separate
from the topics of today relates to your
work on linguistics so originally when
you attack Skinner's behaviorist model
of language acquisition you did it on
the basis that the poverty of stimulus
required that we had some prior faculty
in our mind that allowed us to learn
language from limited examples do you
think there's a similar argument or
account of a common human morality can
be given and you have such an account or
two of an idea of what such an account
would look like as far as the
Skinner was concerned almost 95% of it
was just running through claims that he
was making and arguing that this is
totally absurd based on nothing I mean I
did at the very end of the review say
look there's another way of looking at
this which comes out of mainstream
biology mainstream biology just takes
for granted that every capacity you know
your visual system your ability to walk
whatever it may be
is based on some genetic property I mean
that's not even discuss and that's in
linguistics that happens to be called
poverty of stimulus but it's Universal
what it means is that the kind of
creature you are is not determined by
the inputs like you can't change human
embryo into a cat embryo by changing
around the nutrition in the uterus you
know it's going to become a human being
you know that's because it's built that
way that's just a biological truism and
it's presumably a little reason to doubt
that it's also true of language I think
it is what about morality
well I think it's the same thing I think
that was pointed out by David Hume he's
he is you know the leading empiricist
that there's a lot of confusion about
what empiricism is the empiricists like
Locke and Hume and others conquering the
illusions that they believed in innate
structure and the reason is they were
not idiots I mean of course everything
that happens comes out of an ape strip
in a large part out of an age structure
well what about morality Hume couldn't
be much of a proof but he said he just
made some observations which are correct
and he said look we're constantly making
moral decisions in new situations and
they're pretty consistent and other
people pretty much comprehend them and
so on well if we're doing that it must
be that we have some principles that are
lying behind it and the principles can't
be
picked a fight induction and affect his
view nothing can it's all what he called
animal instinct it's coming from animal
instinct that's what's now called
genetic endowment so genetic endowment
is determining our capacity to gain
knowledge understanding that develop
moral principles and so on and so forth
and I think that's probably I don't see
how that could be false well the next
problem is to try to go on and find out
what they are well there's plenty of
work on that that's in fact a large part
of the content of the classical moral
philosophy and it's picked up again in
modern work for example John Rose's
famous theory of justice liquor till ago
in the New York Times
Christopher layman Holt reviewed Beyond
freedom and dignity he began with two
sentences dear to the hearts of my
publishers who were not going to allow
them to get lost under a bushel later on
no really seriously concerned about some
of the implications he tries to fault me
and he writes as follows well then what
about the most serious and best
advertised attack that has been leveled
against behaviorism in recent years
namely Noam Chomsky's attempts to
demonstrate man's innate linguistic
powers which began the Chomsky's famous
review of Skinner's book verbal behavior
Skinner says nothing explicit on the
matter in Beyond freedom and dignity
indeed Chomsky's name has never brought
up which seems disingenuous on Skinner's
part have we got him there
let me tell you about Chomsky I publish
verbal behavior in 1957 in 1958 I
received a 55 page review by someone
whom I had never heard of named Noam
Chomsky I read half a dozen pages and
saw that he had missed the point of my
book and read no further in 1959 I
received a reprint from a journal called
language reduced now the 32 pages in
type and so that it was the same review
this unknown and so I put it aside
without reading it and of course Chomsky
star rose a whole new movement welled up
in linguistics generative
transformational grammar the linguists
have this peculiar capacity to make
whatever they do seem terribly important
I remember a decade when we were all
excited about the analysis of the
phoneme and in a decade when it was
semantics backed up a bit by the logical
positivists and then came the decade of
syntax and grammar and Chomsky's review
of my book began to be widely cited and
reproduced reprinted it became much
better known than my book
and then word got around by why was I
now to answering it well by that time I
had no inclination to do so at all in
the first place if I were to answer it I
should have had to read it and I had no
intention of doing that
moreover I should have had to read up on
generative grammar which I found very
boring and I should have had to go into
the broader issues Chomsky is the
intellectual child of Roman Jakobson
and clothes baby Stros is another in
another field anthropology and they
represent a movement called
structuralism which is quite clearly not
my cup of tea it is an effort to explain
behavior in terms of the form or
topography or structure of the behavior
without appealing to any prior causes
and this seems to me hopeless task so I
actually didn't answer Chomsky
unfortunately I don't need to now
because a psychologist Kenneth
mccorkadale has done a beautiful job
taking Chomsky's review apart page by
page this has been published in the
Journal of the experimental analysis of
behavior but the whole thing got out of
hand it went way beyond linguistics it
began to be said that I was the modern
representative of John Locke back in the
17th century the British empiricist who
felt that the mind began as a clean
slate tabula rasa all knowledge came
from experience
well Chomsky was the modern intellectual
descendant of Rene Descartes the
rationalist
who believed that you had to think even
before you were aware that
existed Newsweek magazine wrote an
article along these lines several years
ago and more or less implied that I was
winning out this enraged the Chomsky
arts and a flood of letters came in at
which Newsweek thought it wise to
publish for each one in its own way
repeated a common misunderstanding of my
position one contended that I am a
stimulus response psychologist which I
am NOT
another contended that I think people
are nothing more than pigeons which I do
not the one I liked best had at least a
touch of width going back to those 17th
century progenitors the letter writer
advised Newsweek to lock up Skinner and
give Chomsky Descartes balloon but even
that is curiously mela per pull job she
doesn't want a cart long that's too much
like a tabula rasa he wants to table
d'hote arranged by some unseen hand in
the kitchen now ironically Chomsky was
later asked to give the Jon Bloch
lectures at Oxford well
I was at the University of Cambridge at
the time and the Philosopher's at Oxford
had me come over before Chomsky arrived
sort of prepare the way and then the BBC
thought it would be fun to have us
debate this issue on television I don't
know what reason Chomsky gave for
refusing I impose some qualifications
Chomsky talks a great deal if anyone
wants to disprove Alfred Adler's thesis
that a man goes into a field and think
she has some natural shortcoming I
suggest he site Noam Chomsky I said that
I would debate provided the master of
ceremonies could guarantee equal time
and I suggested that we use chest clocks
my clock would be running when I was
talking Chomsky's clock would be running
well Chomsky was talking and in this way
I plan to have the last 15 or 20 minutes
to myself sauce and others have said
that behaviorism is reductionistic and
dehumanizes man as I've pointed out at D
homunculus is man if there's if you
believe that the body is steered and run
by a little man inside then behaviorism
gets rid that little man the body is run
by its own structure the genetic
endowment of the species and his history
in contact with the environment and the
current environment I think that that is
compatible with the most noble view of
human nature as he no no dehumanizing
about it the thing that bothers me about
these references to behaviorism is being
manipulated another question brought
that up is this
Chomsky and others have repeatedly said
the behaviorism is associated with
manipulative political philosophies by
which he means I suppose fascism and as
a matter of fact I have been called
fascist belies nothing and by anything
that I've ever done its business why
does the slightest extent similar to
what happened under what I would call
fascist governments the issue is this if
you if you think that human behavior is
determined primarily by genetic
programming and this is what you mean
when you talk about the development of
human behavior Shakespeare had seven
ages Erick Erickson has ten right had
different ones depending upon when you
look at the Freud's work so on but there
are the things we are growing in the
individual they're born with a null with
a knowledge of grammar according to
Chomsky and so on you know the rules of
grammar if you think that we develop in
a sense of grow like an embryo and
Chomsky is has said Roger Brown has said
the development of language is like
embryonic growth then you're at one end
of the continue with the other end you
say that behavior is due to what happens
during the lifetime of the individual
don't deny that you start with an
organism and that is genetic but it is
pliable manipulable you can change it
then I quite clearly in that case the
manipulation is at the end of the
environmental can end of the continuum
so you can change the environment you
can't change the genetic endowment
except very slowly through some kind of
genetic program and nobody paid much
attention to eugenics these days or any
kind of effort you can't make people
speak grammatically by breeding people
with better innate correct grammar don't
work that way if you want to take people
to big grammatical you teach better
grammar schools well if those are the
two ends then you ask which is going to
be the one poletik
most associated with let's say vicious
political practices well I submit that
if you know how to change the
environment and our concern with things
like education therapy and so on you
would use those where is to bring about
the kinds of changes are important if
you on the other hand don't if you
believe this thing is all born into you
then you can't change an any reasonable
way at all and you turn into the most
violent ways the person who really
believed in the Genetic Programming of
behavior in the 20th century was out off
Hitler that's racism and Chomsky is
absolutely 180 degrees wrong about this
it isn't that racism follows that it
isn't the victim that the concentration
camp follows from a theory of innate
behavior it is that when you believe
that behavior is innate you can't think
of anything else to do but the final
solution which involves a concentration
camp when you are concerned about
changing behavior and can do so then you
don't turn to the vicious methods you
turn to better schools better forms of
therapy better incentive systems that
are rehabilitation programs and so on so
I would say just the opposite from jobs
did it that a a good practical behavior
modification makes it possible to be
humane in dealing with people whereas
the genetic approach leaves you open to
nothing for violence
I'm sure that my so-called friend Thomas
SAS would not agree with that he is a is
the ultimate in rightist
but also curiously enough we believed in
the individual as determining his own
behavior well this act is a form of
genetic determination of course we're
launching today rather spectacular and I
hope thoughtful a series of four
exchanges between men distinguished in
the social sciences were considered
foremost in their fields of study my
curiosity is to know more about what
he's done I'm going to up to you because
inevitably there scribblings will shape
the thought of tomorrow if there is only
thought tomorrow we begin today by
enquiring into the means by which men
develop morally everyone has of course
heard of the F Skinner who was
previously on this program and whose
book Beyond freedom and dignity was a
notorious bestseller in 1971 or more
exactly on a tourist book it was also a
best-seller in 1971
professor Skinner at Harvard is the
leader of the so-called behaviorist
school in psychology which explains
human action in terms of human responses
induced or discouraged by reward or pain
the Skinner's novel Walden 2 is probably
the most widely read general statement
of his ideas festively on Festinger is
well is less well known among laymen but
probably not any lesser among
professionals he is the author a very
important book called a theory of
cognitive dissonance in which he
contains moral development is something
on the order of an arbitration between
thought and conduct between which there
is non going dialectic
I'm sure this passenger will object to
this telegraphic formulation and that
form isn't petty about unity sir but
I've started begin by questioning dr.
Skinner do I do I understand you
correctly she believed that moral
attitudes in society are entirely shaped
by
factors yes that's I think the correct
statement I don't deny that they're
people who behave morally feel moral
when they're doing so but I want to know
why they behave that way
and I think you must look to the social
sanctions beginning when a child is very
small working on him throughout his
lifetime which lead him to behave in
ways which to some extent control his
own selfish impulses and make him more
responsive to the interests of others
it's been said that man is the is a
unique example of evolution because he
has evolved a moral sense I think that's
putting it the wrong way what what the
human species has done is to construct a
social environment a culture or many
cultures which are essentially
situations in which individuals come to
behave in ways which are related to the
good of others rather than their own
personal good what they make what they
feel when they're doing this is
interesting but it's a by-product I
don't think that a person behaves
morally because he is moral nor do I
think a man is marled because he behaves
morally this is the old issue of whether
whether a man is sinful because he sends
word soon seems because he was sinful
neither they he does this because of
some third factor which hasn't been
mentioned yet in their the the social
sanctions are the reasons why people
feel moral and behave morally so if we
want to do anything about this we want
to make people more likely to behave in
moral ways we should look at the
sanctions we should look at how society
arranges conditions which produces moral
behavior well how do you have certain
certain phenomena I guess you would call
it a nominal natural world a red dress
ecologist have I have observed and are
more less prepared to accept as
universals for instance well for
instance the institution of the family
yes well there's a good deal of the of
the genetic endowment here and I don't
rule out the genetic environmental
ironmen in which the species has evolved
maternal behavior is that I suppose the
kind of behavior which is important
because of its contribution to others
they the member of a group will respond
to an approaching predator by signaling
danger maybe the man who suffers he's
the one that the predator catches the
others get away he has sacrificed
himself these have these these
arrangements have survival value and the
autologous of course appointed to many
of them so that we have to some extent
an inbuilt tendency to behave in ways
which operate for the good of others as
well as for ourselves but we also
acquire in our own lifetime a great deal
of this for a very simple reason that we
behave in selfish ways we get slapped
down when we behave in ways which please
others we are loved and approved and the
first question mr. Chomsky comes from
Chris Christopher Joe how have your
ideas on universal grammar changed over
the years are you more or less convinced
of the theory now than you were
initially well there's there's a lot of
confusion about the notion universal
grammar universal grammar had a
traditional meaning but in modern
linguistics last 50 years or so it's had
a technical meaning which is not
unrelated to the traditional meaning but
it's not identical either
Universal grammar is just the name for
the theory of the genetic component of
the language faculty
I mean transparently there's some
genetic component right there's a reason
say why my granddaughter
reflexively identified some part of her
environment as language-related
which is no small trick nobody knows how
to duplicate that and then more or less
reflexively picked up the capacity that
we're all now using whereas her had to
say kitten or chimpanzee or songbird or
whatever it may be with exactly the same
inputs couldn't even take the first step
can't identify part of the environment
as language related obviously not the
later steps well there are two possible
answers to how that happens one is it's
a miracle the other is there's a she has
some specific genetic capacity that's
like the capacity that had her grow arms
and not wings let's say just some fixed
or had a mammalian visual system but not
an insect visual system now this is not
controversial for anything except human
higher mental faculties for some reason
when people investigate human higher
mental faculties they have to be insane
you know you can't accept the approach
that we take to everything else in the
world the kind of a methodological
dualism everything else in the world we
study by the standard methods of science
but when we talk about human higher
mental faculties we have become mystics
so therefore there's a controversy about
the existence of universal grammar which
is like it which means a controversy
about whether there is some genetic
property that distinguishes humans from
everybody else which leads to these two
the ability to do doing what we're now
doing but there shouldn't be any
controversy about that the only question
is what is it
well there have been theories about it
from the 1950s when these studies began
up till the present and it's a living
field so they keep changing so in that
sense yes my views about universal
grammar keep changing
I say when and walked into my office as
a graduate student and told me I was
wrong about everything so okay my views
change but in that sense sure there's
going to be constant change until the
field is disappears or is dead or
something and it's a long long way to go
these are not trivial questions at the
the sort of general tendency of change
but not every linguist would agree by
any means so it's a personal opinion at
the in the early stages when the first
question was asked seriously about 50
years ago as to how we are capable of
doing what we do all the time how are we
capable of understanding producing
expressions which have we've never heard
which may have never been uttered in the
history of the language and do it over
infinite range or various strange
properties that they have as soon as you
look at them how can we do it the only
answers seem to be that each of us has a
highly intricate computational system in
the brain which yields these very
specific results but that then poses a
paradox because it must be the case that
we all all humans have the same genetic
capacity with marginal variation the
reason is if you take a child from say a
hunter-gatherer tribe in the Amazon and
the child is raised in Cambridge Mass
it'll perfect maid has become a graduate
student studying quantum physics at MIT
with no difference from anyone else
and conversely so we all have the same
capacity and it's more or less
understood why the capacity developed
very recently in evolutionary time and
probably in some window between a
hundred thousand and fifty thousand
years ago something like that and that's
just the flick of an eye so whatever
happened never changed except extremely
marginally so we're all fundamentally
identical for all practical purposes
human genetic variation is very slight
anyway superficial differences but not
very profound foreign and outside they
an extraterrestrial observer looking at
us the way we look at frogs will say
there's only one human and one language
with minor variations so on the one hand
it's gotta be uniform on the other hand
it seemed to be the case that each
particular language had a highly
intricate and complex system of rules
computational system and they were very
different from one another and that is a
paradox in fact a serious paradox well
over the years there have been efforts
to deal with it to try to overcome the
paradox a major step was taken and here
views on universal grammar at least for
many of us did change radically was
around 1980 before you were there yeah
it's her fault when a different view of
the matter sort of crystallized at
what's called sometimes called the
principles and parameters of you the
picture that the principle that there
are fixed principles which are really
invariant nobody has to acquire them
they're part of universal grammar and
then there's a number of options that
can be taken called parameters that the
child has to pick up from experience and
they have to be pretty simple you have
to be able to pick them up from limited
evidence because that's all there is so
for example in some languages like
English the
it's called a head first language so the
variable precedes the object and a
preposition precedes the object of the
preposition and so on other languages
like say Japanese are almost the mirror
image the verb follows the object the
post positions not prepositions and so
on so languages are virtually mirror
images of each other and you have to set
the parameter a child has to set the
parameter which says am I talking
English or am I talking Japanese and
that can be to be determined from very
simple data so that's a reasonable
choice of a parameter and the hope was
that you could find some finite set of
parameters like a finite switch box
where you set the switch the child has
set the switches one way or another and
can do it on the basis of fairly simple
data and then once this enters into a
predetermined system of principles you
get things which superficially look very
different but are actually almost
identical just differing in a
superficial choices well if you could
work that out you'd have solved the
paradox the long way to work that out
but that made it possible at least to
confront the issue seriously without
facing an immediate near
self-contradiction and it set off a lot
of really rich period of research and
inquiry and nothing like it in the
thousands of years of history of study
of language in the last 25 30 years of a
wide variety of typologically different
languages new questions at a depth that
could never have been proposed before
sometimes the answers leading to new
questions and so on been a very lively
period and we also raised another
question what about the principles where
do they come from and it's in fact the
choice of parameters where do these
things come from if they're in universal
grammar if they're part of the genetic
endowment then they had to evolve
somehow
but not a lot could have evolved because
it's too recent you know you go back a
hundred thousand years there's as far as
we know nothing
humans had the same Anatomy anything
that's preserved in the fossil record is
about the same you know hundreds of
thousand years back so some small change
must have taken place in the in the
brain which somehow allowed all of this
to suddenly blossom and pretty soon
after that again in evolutionary time
like maybe a couple of tens of thousands
of years which is no time at all humans
started leaving East Africa where we all
come from as far as anyone knows so some
small group developed this system and
then spread all over the world now
they're all essentially the same but
what evolved in that short period of
time cannot have been very complex
you know wouldn't expect a series of
extensive stages like say development of
limbs millions of years
therefore what you'd predict is that
some other principle external to
language maybe some principle of nature
a principle of computational efficiency
or something like that which is not
specific to language interacted with a
small mutation which just gave rise to
the universal grammar well that sets
forth a new goal of research to ask to
see if you can determine that the
principles themselves do not have the
intricacy that they appeared to have but
are actually the result of application
of non linguistic infected none may be
non-human principles like general
principles of computational efficiency
to whatever small change took place and
the small change was probably
the capacity to carry out recursive
enumeration basically the capacity that
gives you the number system for example
to take two things two objects already
constructed in the mind and make up a
new object out of them and then keep
that process up indefinitely so you get
an infinite array of possible
expressions each with some semantic
interpretation and some mode of
externalization speech sign whatever
maybe that would be and the goal would
be to try to show that that was
essentially instantaneous once the small
mutation took place
given the this operation the recursive
enumeration operation it allows you to
create a discreet infinity of expression
structured expressions well that's at
least a feasible picture the trick is to
show that it's true true or how close it
is to true it can you cut away at the
apparent complexity of the principles
and show that they can actually be
accounted for in terms of general
principles of that hold for organisms
generally perhaps and maybe even
elsewhere in the physical world and that
are instantly are almost instantly
applied once the original move is made
through whatever small move it was to
produce the capacity for recursive
enumeration well that's a goal you know
far from being attained but last 15-20
years there's been considerable progress
towards it there's a lot of things that
it seemed twenty years ago you had to
assign to the genetic endowment have no
now been rather plausibly shown to be
possible consequences of just
application particularly the principles
of computational efficiency to a system
which had only the ability to construct
an infinite hierarchy of expressions and
that we don't know enough about the
brain to know
might happen but that could have been a
very small mutation just changing
something in somebody's genome and then
spreading through the small breeding
group so that in that respect it's it's
a goal you know and steps have been
taken towards it but you would expect
that something like that ought to be
true
just from the what's known about the
history of the evolution of Homo sapiens
in very recent times without much
opportunity for selection have had any
effect maybe a small effect but not much
so that's I think it's in that that's
the tendency of thinking at least my
thinking and some other many others on
how theories of universal grammar have
changed but the idea that there is
universal grammar that exists that can't
be controversial unless you believe in
magic for the elementary reasons that I
mentioned I thought the only difference
that I expected to see between animals
and I used to call men people was in the
field of verbal behavior and I still
think that's true I got around to doing
a book on verbal behavior or 20 years
later and published 1957 well it doesn't
simply mean that animals suddenly start
talking and that's all there is to it
the essential thing is that once verbal
behavior became possible and I think
that was due to an evolutionary process
had brought them vocal musculature under
what I would call awkward control call
it voluntary control if you like up to
that point it had been treated with
instinctive cries and so remember what
that became what it became possible to
put it crudely to use speech for to be
effective to produce results then you
could have a culture emerge in which
people began to ask each other what are
you doing while you're doing that
in other words they began to set up the
conditions that led people to look at
their own behavior and look at
themselves and their own bodily
processes when they were behaving I
regard consciousness awareness as a
social product I can't imagine how the
individual would ever become a conscious
individual unless there were other
people to provide the contingency that
lead him or her to ask questions of that
nature many people have said why does
the behaviors deal with the unconscious
well that's easy all behavior begins as
unconscious behavior but some of it
becomes conscious when you look at it
analyze it look at the external
conditions under which this behavior
occurs look at the states of your body
that you are in contact these you call
your feelings your states of mind and
you are then able to talk about these
things Oh a very large part of a culture
which makes it so helpful and enables
the individual to do so much more as a
member of a culture it would be possible
as a single individual has to do with
making use of the experience of other
people you give someone advice now what
does that mean you yourself have been in
contact with some situation and by
describing what you do and the results
you get another person can avoid all of
the exploratory behavior which led to
that discovery for example if you just
arrived in Miami you might find a good
restaurant to a process of just going
and eating here here here and here until
finally you find one which happens to be
the kind of restaurant to life if you
know someone who knows your taste that
person can say if you like good Italian
food go to Luigi's I don't know there is
a Luigi so I'm not really puffing
anybody up
that is that sentence contains two
things one a description behavior go to
a restroom and another one and some kind
of reference to a reinforcing
consequence go to that restaurant and
you will get a good Italian meal once
that has happened you don't need to
bother going all over Miami to define it
could Italian restaurant and that's a
very useful thing
the advice one person gives another the
warnings among is another the Maxim's
and proverbs which are sort of general
kinds of advice after the culture can
develop these become extremely important
and I've argued and I think I haven't
convinced myself that governmental and
scientific laws are in this nature they
describe behavior and its consequences
and hence can be used instead of the
kind of shaping behavior that have to go
on otherwise someone has said it's for
the ridiculous if to shape the behavior
of a person and you shape the behavior
of a rat or a pigeon when you can simply
tell the person what to do if I I wanted
to get a chimpanzee for example to pull
a plunger of a vending machine I know
how I would do it I could shape that
behavior fairly quickly and the front
chimp and learn to pull the plunger and
get a bit of something edible but if it
were a person I guess let me say pull
the plunger and you'll get the pack of
cigarettes or whatever it is it's going
to come out the construction on the
vending machine full plunger and press
button under pack of cigarettes these
are instructions they're advice and it
saves you the trouble of fumbling around
with all of the equipment in the whole
environment you'll find yourself you'll
find something which produces a pack of
cigarettes that is a question coordinate
valuable it does not mean that there's
nothing that there's something wrong
with the process of shaping behavior
because until you have acquired the
behavior of following instructions
nothing else is available and that is
why with animal that's about all you
have
you can teach animals an imitative
repertoire so you can teach a new
response by giving an imitative model
it's very difficult to do it if you do
it and we do it with children we used
verbal imitable descriptions of the
contingencies and imitative modeling I
told it the child watching someone get
something immediately knows what to do
but that doesn't come free it's only
after the child has learned to imitate
that that is possible that's all you
don't you don't avoid the essential
shaping process in the first place
now the cognitive psychology and the
point I made this morning it's concerned
with the way you talk about
contingencies the way you give reasons
for doing things and when I say if you
want a good Italian dinner go to the way
that I give you reasons why you should
go to the wages because you get a good
dinner when you do that then this kind
of thing is of course very commonly done
and it is it is the rational side of
human behavior but Freud saw what was
wrong with that I can say to a person
pull the plunger and you get a pack of
cigarettes
there's pulling this person that's
ruining himself gambling and I say to
him okay I can give you some great
advice stop gambling that's that now I
give your reasons for stop gambling you
stop get me you won't lose money so you
stop that's what you don't see the
contingencies are more powerful there
than the reasons the reasons our
descriptions of the contingencies but
you don't have reasons to follow the
reasons and so you go right on gambling
and that's a move that therapists face
you'll give a patient reasons for
behaving well but that isn't enough
as Freud was pretty clearly pointed this
out afraid to stay with the unconscious
reasons by unconscious reasons all he
means all III would mean and if I said
the same thing is that there are
reinforcing contingencies mostly
reinforcing consequences which are
strengthening behavior
in opposition to what appear to be the
reasons that society gives you for
behaving in a given way do you know that
if you want to get along better with
your wife you should stop nagging your
sister from planning stuff to us dead
and so on alright there's a reasons and
probably they're correct on the other
hand you're trapping reinforcing to you
to find that she's wrong in this and
complaining about there's no point about
that and so on so that is what you do
there are there are reinforcing
consequences to determine the behavior
the reasons given aren't enough and I
think main the main problem really in
therapy it seems to me one of the
problems and face to face therapy was
not not a psychotic but the neurotic
person is is to find the contingencies
of reinforcement which are the
troublemaking effects so that good
reasons which are descriptions of better
contingencies can actually work we've
come this far in the discussion and we
are supposed to be talking about where
we Haggar and yet I haven't asked you to
explain your definition of verbal
behavior and how yes first however I
want to correct you you said my book was
about verbal behavior or language now in
the book I defined a language as a
verbal culture it is people speaking
text read and so on which alter the
behavior of speakers language English
language is not saying anything not
speaking I do speak English in other
words what I say is verbal behavior has
been shaped by English as a verbal
environment when I speak French that has
been shaped by our last not the French
ever met but book-learning and so on the
languages are
the side of the reinforcing
contingencies and when you study
language you study current practices in
the verbal community which is not
speaking at all but reinforcing speaking
and that is why linguists have so often
confined themselves almost entirely to
the behavior of the listener Chomsky in
others is this exists a grammatical
sentence that's not a question about
verbal behavior it's a question about
the listener or the reader is that is a
listener or reader responding
effectively to that particular verbal
pattern and so they begin to reanalyze
the structure of the language and as is
structuralism of the worst kind
meanwhile someone has had to be speaking
and that is the product of what Lister's
have done over years of contact with the
speaker the verbal behavior is behavior
the language is the word for a verbal
environment and it is talita second has
always been studied as such by linguists
all the languages in the world
that doesn't mean all of the verbal
behavior that's been going on it means
these are the cultures which have shaped
different kinds of ripple behavior now
remember behaviors what I'm doing right
now I'm making noises and I'm making the
noises which have had certain kinds of
consequences the first time I said Dada
my father was in ecstasy I dare say and
so all sorts of goodies and so on and
ever since I went on calling him dad our
daddy actually was Papa but doesn't
matter
by the way it's not quite so easy for a
child to safe apparently so anyway my
whole repertoire has been shaped by the
kinds of consequences that are followed
and those kinds of consequences are the
planes which have created general
principles to all languages fact that
there are universal zuv met a great deal
of all languages have certain common
features of course they have they follow
there are common reasons why people have
reinforced my behaviors in these various
ways there are in all languages there
are questions what did you say or what
is that in all languages there are
negations no not that in all languages
there are things talked about our
actions talked about and so on so on
these are the universal because they are
the universals of the contingencies our
reinforcements responsible for a rebel
behavior not any one particular set such
as brief or a Latin French or English
what's the definition then a verbal
verbal behavior verbal behavior is
behaviorally differs from non verbal
behavior in the nature of its
reinforcement if I touch that glass and
pick it up I've got a glass in my hand
and
classes before the species ever acquired
rebel division if I say handed a class
please
and someone hands it to me I my opinions
my response having that class was
reinforced by someone else
now that reaching and taking that up
shapes and very specific must be in mind
where they did some victor stimuli from
my eyes and so on
nothing of that sort is involved if I
say have me the best words and so my
rebel behavior is going to be very
different it is shaping my muscles here
and different patterns but only and ways
which have produced certain consequences
in a quite different way so the behavior
shaken by sin tendencies are
reinforcements like that I have one kind
of thing the behavior of vocal behavior
shaped by consequences will be very
different and that is why my book simply
traces all of the differences between
verbal behavior and nonverbal behavior
which come from that distinction from
the fact that the reinforcers are
mediated no person ever and the tip-off
is the behavior the listener verbal
event I would say no I accept when you
are speaking along with the speaker and
we do that a great deal we hear people
sing the star-spangled banner before
overall game we were probably sang along
with what we're hearing if there are
very loyal people and when we read a
poem win over
well we are saying at saying it along
with with the speaker even though he may
be dead for several years he said it and
then reading if you are saying it
they're not just responding to it the
first time he responded to it you had no
no cues to them to lead you to say it
yourself first time you read a poem you
bored afterward but after that to be
heard isn't done is a thousand times
you're ahead of the text and the Texas
prompting that he's made forget it and
just recite the poem then UN you are the
listener to the reader who is saying is
I'm going to come back to the question
of the list of the speaker and the
listener alright you may remember that
it is probably for some time many people
would would would say I probably you you
what I would agree that the what the
listener does is every bit as
complicated as what the speaker does but
you're saying that it's a in what way is
it different except for not making noise
well the listener is responding to
stimuli example I'm a cook and I either
wring the triangular Bell which always
ready or I just call out so now what's
the difference between coming to the
Bell or coming to the sounds I made both
are a verbal though because I don't ring
bells and those people do come but on
the side of the listener it's no more
verbal and coming when the teakettle
whistles you do respond to one thing
because something else will accompany
did in the past and I don't see royalty
listeners doing things that they don't
do nonverbal environments they may not
be doing things I mean picking up a
glass and hand
to you I could do as you say whether or
not you had asked for the glass of water
but it's all the argument is often made
by psycho linguist that we're dealing
with with quotes language in two forms
the productive side the receptive side
or the comprehension side if if you as
you do speak in long complicated
academic sentences I have two quotes
process that stream of sound to make
sense of it you have been affected by
cognitive psychologists are you
processing what does that mean you're
grinding wheat its distilling oil but
what is this process you were doing
something yes and I can defy that idea I
don't start with you now to discover
that as I start with you was a small
child who was mother's dinner is ready
and you came and or if he said stop
doing that and you stopped you learn to
do you'll learn to stop doing and
response to stimuli which would be just
as much as not touching something if
it's hot or making something up when it
looks appetizing and so on you were
responding to stimuli in terms of what
has happened to you when you responded
to them in the first and that's
nonverbal behavior it happened to be
verbal stimuli because they were
produced by a speaker but that doesn't
make any difference in what you're doing
and the nature of what you're doing
well then whether we call it verbal or
not let's let's confine the term verbal
to that which is the speaker well I
think the speakers really if the
listener is very important I have a
paper that I gave last year on the
behavior of the listener I think it
needs to be looked at very closely and I
may have neglected at the bit in my book
but I was talking about verbal
behavior which is a failure of the
speaker I was assuming the kinds of
consequences that shape that behavior I
think nothing ever happens without
changing the organism and mostly the
nervous system that's the most important
part of the of the body when it comes to
changes in behavior I assume that there
are all these physiological changes
going on I would I'm not talking about a
black box that I did not invent the
expression the empty organism I don't
believe the organism is empty I want to
work as closely with physiology as
possible I think a good behavior will
account is the very best thing you can
do for the physiology by telling you
precisely what the assignment is that
what that am i answering your question
or not that's what I that's what I think
is going on but I I have no other
instruments to tell me the nature of
those changes going on the ID and I
don't say because I don't know but the
physiologist is finding instruments to
get in there and find out
