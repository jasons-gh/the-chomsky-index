hello professor Noam Chomsky how are you
today I just wanted to ask I right now
I'm studying linguistics and it's I
can't find an answer to my question and
I look in the books so I figured I trust
your expertise on grammar and language
so I was wondering do you have any
recommendations for me to be able to
talk to women better that's like a lot
of the emails I get you'd be surprised I
got one I got one a couple of days ago
actually my wife she used to save these
but I got one a couple of days ago from
some guy a teenage kid or maybe 20s or
something I guess saying I got a problem
I'm an anarchist and I don't want to get
a job in the capitalist system but my
girlfriend says she's gonna throw me out
unless I get a job so what should I do
I'm the wrong person to ask
I got out of that business 70 years ago
