well when I refer to Israel in these
remarks I generally have in mind the
United States and Israel it's important
particularly for Americans to recognize
that virtually everything that Israel
does is with the decisive support often
direct participation of the United
States
that's economic military diplomatic and
not least ideological the way the issues
are framed in the United States quite
differently from elsewhere and when
Washington draws the line Israel obeys
having no choice right now Israel is
facing a pretty severe crisis in fact
double crisis a crisis of legitimation
and a crisis of D legitimation those are
the terms they use they're both matters
of pretty serious concern the issue of
legitimation is coming to a head in the
next few months at the United Nations
Palestine is appealing to the UN to
recognize Palestine as a Palestinian
state and also to admit that Palestine
to the United Nations the US
administration is pulling every string
it can to try to prevent it but it looks
as if they may do it that could come up
as early as September if it comes to the
Security Council the United States will
almost certainly veto it as it usually
does the most recent veto was three
months ago February and that one was a
kind of an interesting one it actually
got some attention most vetoes don't for
one thing because there's so many of
them but
that's rarely recognized how isolated
the u.s. is at the UN on a whole range
of issues the the last one did get some
notice because it was a little unusual
the Obama administration vetoed a
resolution affirming Obama's official
policy that got some notice the
resolution called for an end to
settlement expansion in the West Bank
which theoretically is supposed to be
Obama's policy but the u.s. vetoed it
you want to read something embarrassing
take a look at the Ambassador Susan
Rice's explanation I thought she should
have had the dignity to resign anyway
the resolution also add another aspect
that it declared the settlements in the
West Bank illegal and of course the
Golan Heights which nobody talks about
the regarded them it declared that they
are illegal and it's important to
recognize that that's uncontroversial in
fact Israel itself recognized that back
in late 1967 it recognized that highest
legal authorities advised if the
Attorney General agreed that any
transfer of population into the occupied
territories is in violation of the core
principles of international humanitarian
law the Geneva agreements and
technically the Israeli Supreme Court
also recognizes it that they find
various ways around it was repeatedly
been recognized by the Security Council
and then most recently a few years ago
by the International Court of Justice
the world Court with the US justice in a
separate declaration affirming the
conclusion that this was technically
about the separation wall
affirming that any part of the
separation wall about 85% that's there
in order to protect Israeli settlements
is de facto and violation of
international law because the
settlements are illegal so that part's
not really controversial the other part
of the resolution was reaffirming
official US policy but Obama decided to
be to it the General Assembly in the
coming session is a little different the
United States can't veto General
Assembly resolutions so it will probably
be another one of the familiar
resolutions again not just on Israel on
a whole range of topics overwhelming
that rarely gets reported but there's
vote after vote which is you know 182
three or something like that the u.s.
Israel sometimes some Pacific island or
something like that sometimes it's even
worse sometimes 152 one the United
States I so we'll probably happen again
it probably won't get it reported
recognition of Palestine is already
quite overwhelming including important
countries like Brazil which is the most
respected influential country in the in
the South other South American countries
and quite a few others in fact the
Palestine is now recognized by about
over 100 countries including about 85 90
percent of the world's population that's
far more than recognize Kosovo but in
the case of Kosovo the admission to the
United Nations is implemented because
there's only one vote that counts in a
world that's run by force and violence
not law that's the one with the big
stick so the United States supports
Kosovo so therefore it's in whatever the
world thinks and the United States
opposes
palestine's
it's out whatever the world thinks well
those are important things to remember
the United States in fact is a declining
power for a lot of interesting reasons
many of them internally self-inflicted
but it's happening and it may not be
able to hold back the tide forever even
though it's got Canada and a good part
of Europe kind of paddling along
politely for the moment at least the in
Israel the government and political
commentators refer to the coming votes
at the United Nations as it's tsunami
that they're going to have to do
something about and they're flailing
around besides what they might do it
could be dangerous
it's a unpredictable violent state with
plenty of force behind it and it has a
doctrine goes back to the 1950s the
doctrine back to the 1950s is that if
we're pressed too far we'll go crazy mr.
gay is the Hebrew now back in the 1950s
there were a lot of ways they could do
that but by the late 60s there are it's
a powerful nuclear state they might do
all kinds of things so I hate to think
about it but one possibility is another
attack on guys oh there's bombing if
Iran you know who knows what they'll do
but something might happen I suppose
they don't know themselves but so of
course we can only speculate
that's the legitimation of that Israel
that tsunami is that took another step
forward just a couple days ago with the
unification of Hamas and Fatah under
Egyptian initiative and that's important
the fact that it was Egyptian initiative
and it went forward is a reflection of
the really quite dramatic
spectacular changes that have been
taking place in in the Arab world and
in the last couple of months the Arab
Spring as it's called and this example
the unification is one of the many
reasons why Israel in the United States
are deeply concerned about what they
correctly regard as the growing threat
of democracy in the Arab world in this
particular case from 1991 the US and
Israel have been dedicated to separating
Gaza and the West Bank breaking them
apart that's in direct violation to the
Oslo Accords sign right at the same time
which declare them to be a territorial
unity
well the unification and might impede
and might even reverse this process of
separation of the two parts of Palestine
and even more dangerous the unification
might undermine Washington and abilties
dedicated efforts to prevent any
political settlement any diplomatic
settlement of the israel-palestine
conflict that settlement the terms of
that settlement are very well understood
supported by essentially the entire
world including Iran Hamas just
reiterated its support for it virtually
everyone's a unified unification it's
tough it's been prevented for 35 years
now by the United States primarily and
of course by Israel again important to
recognize I'll come back to it well
that's the correct basically the crisis
of legitimation there's also a crisis of
D legitimation that Israel's facing and
that's the term that's used when you
read to say the Israeli press that
process of be legitimated was carried
forward last December when Human Rights
Watch which is a pretty cautious
conservative organization
Human Rights Watch quote called on the
United States to suspend financing to
Israel in an amount equivalent to the
costs of Israel spending in support of
settlements so cut back any US support
that goes to the settlements and also
called on us to monitor contributions to
Israel from tax-exempt US organizations
that violate international law including
prohibitions against discrimination now
that cuts a very casts a very wide net
for those of you who know the details of
this in the background is also a Amnesty
International had already called for an
arms embargo on Israel as it's using
arms and us arms in violation of
international law actually violation of
US law to the in the background is also
a popular movement of divestment from
anything involving the occupied
territories in the United States
crucially that includes major US
corporations like say caterpillar which
provides the equipment for the
destruction of the West Bank for illegal
construction also for straight murder
like the Richard Cory case includes
Motorola another major corporation which
is providing electronic systems for the
illegal separation wool again
uncontroversially illegal and for the
settlements all illegal and many others
and this is also extending beyond to a
broader boycotts so that's the crisis of
D legitimation alongside the crisis of
legitimation and you can see why it's
considered you know it's tsunami
something very dangerous and might
elicit unpredictable and may be a very
dangerous response well there's a good
reason why the United States fears
democracy in the Arab world to find out
why all you have to do is to take a look
at polls of Arab
of opinion they're certainly known to
planners but they're not published here
and I presume they're not published
because the press doesn't want you to
know that people think I can't think of
any other reason it's hard to think of
anything more important at this stage
with what's going on in the Arab world
than what our public opinion is I'm you
hear a lot about what the Arab dictators
say but you don't hear about what the
public thinks and that's very revealing
so what is the public the polls
incidentally are taken by the leading US
polling agencies the most prestigious
ones they're released by major
institutions you know Brookings
Institute and so on it's inconceivable
that the media don't know about them and
planners certainly do and they're
interesting so for example in Egypt the
most important country in the Arab world
about 90% of the population regard the
United States as their main enemy the
main threat that they face opposition to
US policy is so strong that about in
Egypt about 80 percent think the region
would be more secure if he ran had
nuclear weapons not just a nuclear
energy but nuclear weapons the may be
ten percent
we've already Iran as a threat and the
figures are a little different country
by country but that's roughly the story
throughout the Arab world so you can see
very clearly why the US and its allies
Israel of course and the Western Allies
that cannot tolerate democracy in the
Arab world not authentic democracy at
least the kind of democracy in which
public opinion would have some impact on
policy I mean if if it did you know the
United States Army wouldn't control the
region which has been a primary goal for
70 years but it would be driven out and
that's no small thing that's a major
major concern is with the maintain
control of the energy reserves of the
world concentrated there so of course
the US and its allies are very
frightened of democracy and the
Arab world of course they talk about
democracy other than Stalin talked about
democracy too they can't they can't
possibly accept it will do anything to
block it and if you look closely at the
policies towards the various uprisings
you see it clearly and to come back to
that if you like it should be you should
bear in mind that there's nothing new
about this this goes way back and
there's plenty of evidence about it
plenty of documentation should be on the
front pages of the newspapers certainly
should be taught in schools so let's go
back say to the 1950s in 1958 print in
then and classified since then
declassified documents internal
documents
President Eisenhower 58 raised with his
staff a problem that bothered me said he
was concerned about what he called the
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and not by the government's
which are more or less supportive but by
the people and one of the discussion to
this well right at that time the
National Security Council which is the
highest planning body that came out with
a memorandum in which they analyzed that
situation they said there's a perception
in the Arab world that the United States
supports dictatorships harsh brutal
dictatorships and blocks democracy and
development and that we do this because
we want to maintain control of their
energy resources and it went on to say
that the perception is more or less
accurate and furthermore that's what we
ought to be doing of course we want to
control it and democracy would get in
the way
well that was 1958
fast forward to 2001
that's plenty in between but I'll skip
it you'll recall that in right after
9/11 george w bush made a pathetic
speech in which he
why do they hate us Eisenhower's his
answer was they hate our freedoms
well that elicited a study by the
Pentagon Pentagon research group defense
Science Board which I don't think was
reported here but they essentially
reiterated with the National Security
Council I said in 1958 they said they
don't hate our freedoms they hate our
policies and then they went through it
essentially the same policies they
haven't changed what they should have
said is we hate their freedoms and we
hate their freedoms for a really good
reason if they're free we're not gonna
be able to carry out these policies and
we want them and we're beginning to see
that there's a doctrine it was
articulated pretty well by former
Jordanian high official Marwan washer is
the Middle East specialist special
research specialist for the Carnegie
Endowment a break during the Arab
uprisings he said that this general
principle which is that as long as
everything's quiet as long as the
population isn't is under control and
then the powerful can ignore the
population and do anything they like
let's call it the mawashi doctrine a
very very wide application actually it
applies within the United States as well
rather crucially so the mawashi our
doctrine holds and therefore we don't
care about the campaign's of hatred we
don't care that they hate us we hate
their freedoms we're good reasons we'll
ignore the polls all of this became
pretty dramatically clear here just in
the last few months with WikiLeaks
exposures the of all the WikiLeaks
exposures the one that got the most
publicity you know big headlines a lot
of you for commentary it was that the
Arabs support US policy on Iran and
that's a core US policy
isolating you know undermining Iran and
the Arab support us that was the
headline a lot of clapping and so on
well they were talking about the Arab
dictators what about the population like
I said the population about 10 percent
think Iran as a threat and a
considerable majority think the region
would be better off they had nuclear
weapons but under the washer doctrine
doesn't matter as long as they're
suppressed by the dictatorships that we
backed or somehow silenced then we can
do what we like if the Arab dictator
support us
who cares about anyone else now that's
strikingly not just the diplomatic
record that's the press that's the
intellectual community the whole
intellectual community just read the
commentary on this and see general
assumption maybe they'd like to have
Iran have nuclear weapons but as long as
the dictators are with us who cares as
long as they're quiet that's the
prevailing attitude right through the
whole educated articulate community not
just on this issue and as I said it
holds domestically as well we're
thinking about different topic well the
Arab Spring has had a number of effects
already one of them I just mentioned
that you just did move forward to bring
about the unification but the u.s. is
and is really quite concerned about but
that's only one one thing I mean a
couple of weeks ago Egypt the new Egypt
allowed Iranian ships through the Suez
Canal into the Mediterranean now that
has first time that's ever happened and
the US and Israel don't like it
Mediterranean it's our lake not anyone
else's and they broke with that the it
looks as if they're going to move to
open the Gaza border the closing of the
Gaza border participating in Israeli
siege is very unpopular in Egypt and it
looks as if Egypt is taking some steps
now to
open the border which would break the
siege and that's critical the went in
the background is another question which
is uncertain there is a treaty
egypt-israel treaty 1979 which is also
extremely unpopular in in Egypt among
the population if you read about it here
there's a lot of concern that they may
weaken it or maybe even rescinded the
way it's described here is literally you
know New York Times that the treaty is
very important because it helps preserve
stability in the region that's a very
interesting commentary because what the
treaty does is preserve instability in
the region and that's very clear and
explicit as soon as the treaty was
signed 1979 Israel recognized them it's
obvious but they of course also
recognized that with it Petrini with it
with Egypt the main Arab deterrent is
out of the game
Egypt is the main by far the main
military force the only a big organized
military force in the region so with the
Arab deterrent gone
Israel's free to proceed with its
policies elsewhere it's kind of trivial
they can expand illegal settlement of
the occupied territories and critically
they can attack their northern neighbor
Lebanon and that was recognized right
away you read Israeli strategic analysts
of maryani's and others they said
straight off look this is we didn't like
the treaty much but it has a good side
we're free to do what we like because
there's no deterrent any longer and
right away Israel and it's invasion of
Lebanon a couple years later a total
fakery about pretext and go into it if
you like and it was no small thing the
invasion of Lebanon of 1982 killed maybe
20,000 people devastated southern
Lebanon destroyed a large part of a
route
it finally got so bad that the US was
backing it all the way Reagan thought it
was great you know but they factored
however it got to the point where you
know even Thomas Friedman who and this
is going pretty far he was a reporter in
Beirut and it kind of dawned on him that
having bombs drop on you isn't a lot of
fun so he started writing critical
comments about the bombing okay now
we're at the outer limits and it was it
was becoming a really an international
scandal so Reagan kind of ordered Israel
to terminated in mid-august 1982 a lot
of Horrors happened after that like some
rush at eleven's another story but and
Israel of course had to obey they have
no choices even though Menachem Bagan
the prime minister was talking at the
time about how Hitler's hiding in his
bunker and we got to go after him that's
Yasser Arafat but the boss said no so
they stopped and men often did something
else in Cyprus to Massacre the so in
fact the the treaty contributes to
instability in the region but in the
technical terms of US political
discourse that's stability stability
means something that we like instability
is something we don't like literally so
for example you take a look at he ran
the big threat of Iran now is that
they're destabilizing the region how are
they destabilizing it they're trying to
expand their influence into neighboring
countries Afghanistan and Iraq when we
invade and occupy and destroy those
countries that's stabilization when they
try to expand their influence into the
neighboring countries that's
destabilization and that makes perfect
sense if you own the world and that's
and that is the basic assumption of US
culture we own the world if anybody's in
the way they're doing something wrong
this reaches such a level that it can
even get things like this a couple of
years ago the former editor of Foreign
Affairs and they an establishment
Journal James Chase liberal sensible
liberal commentator was writing about
the u.s. overthrow of the parliamentary
regime and in Chile installation of a
brutal dictatorship
you know she had dictatorship and he
literally said reluctantly we had to
destabilize Chile in order to bring
about stability and nobody saw that as a
contradiction and they're right it's not
we had to destabilize it in order to
bring about our rule under a
dictatorship which is by definition
stability so that's what it means when
the New York Times and others tell us
that the peace treaty is the foundation
of stability in the region it's the
foundation of our rule of the region but
the Egyptians may not go along with that
so we'll see the isolation of the US on
these issues is quite significant and
you know should be talked about in a
free society
so take say Iran again Iran is the
centerpiece of US policy this last year
was called the year of Iran and the
foreign policy journals Iran is you know
the major issue and story is that Iran
is isolated it's the international
community is isolating Iran whose the
international community well that's
another technical term like stability
the international community is of course
the United States and anybody who
happens to be going along with it and
like Israel maybe there are some
Marshall Islands that's the
International
literally so take a look at Iran the
non-aligned countries which is most of
the world have been vigorously
supporting Iran's right to develop
nuclear energy they've been doing that
for years but they're not part of the
international community the Arab world
that not only supports Iranian the right
to develop nuclear energy they actually
go so far as to support Iranian nuclear
weapons so the Arab world is not part of
the world the international community
the leading you know the leading
countries of the world like again in
Brazil the most respected country I mean
they strongly object the US policy on
Iran Turkey the major regional power
they object the US policy in fact Turkey
and Brazil recently just worked out a
deal to handle the uranium enrichment
the policy the US quickly shot it down
because they don't want anything getting
out of their hands so they're not part
of the international community in fact
the international community in this case
is the United States Israel Canada large
parts of Europe that's the international
community that's pretty isolated
incidentally we might ask what is this
Iranian threat that we're so worried
about actually the Iranian government's
a rotten government
it's a terrible threat to its own
population but unfortunately it's not
unique in that regard including our
friends and that's not the threat just
we support governments which are
horrible threats to their population so
what's the threat well actually there's
an authoritative answer to that which
again would be front page news and a
free press every year the Pentagon and
US intelligence provide an analysis of
the global security situation to
Congress the last one about a year ago
of course had a section on the Iranian
threat big section so what's the Iranian
threat well you can look it up on the
internet and find out
they point out that the Iranian threat
is not a military threat Iranian
military expenditures are very low even
by the standards of the region I mean
minuscule was compared with the US of
course they say they go into Iranian
military doctrine and they say Iranian
military doctrine is strictly defensive
it's designed to deter an invasion long
enough so that diplomacy can sit in they
say a very limited capacity to deploy
force they say they talk about the
nuclear the possibility of developing a
nuclear capacity they say if Iran is
developing a nuclear capacity it would
be part of their deterrence strategy
deterring the us-israeli attack and if
any country needs a deterrent it's Iran
just take a look at the geography it's
completely surrounded by a military
bases of a hostile violent superpower
and it's constantly under threat the
threat of attack given violation of the
UN Charter if anyone who cares about
that nobody sane once you ran to have a
nuclear weapon I don't think despite
what our of opinion is but it's possible
that they're developing a nuclear
capability we don't know and if so yeah
it's likely part of the deterrent
strategy the chances they use it are
almost zero they'd be vaporized in 30
seconds if they mounted a missile but so
that's that's part of the threat a
deterrent a deterrent and they do an
Iranian deterrent and would limit what
the US and Israel can do you know if
you've got to be careful if somebody can
attack you with nuclear weapons so puts
a limit on the US and Israeli
aggressiveness and violence and that's a
threat and the other one the other
threat which they go into is what I
already mentioned they're destabilizing
the region by trying to expand
commercial cultural and other relations
with their neighbors
that's the Iranian threat and on this
the u.s. is quite isolated
the real us consorted tolerate with
dismay turkeys disobedience but there's
another country that's much more
worrisome that's China China doesn't
take any nonsense China is regarded as a
great threat by the United States
because they refuse to be pushed around
there since China is look we've been
here for three thousand years fending
off the barbarians okay you want to make
noises that's your business and that's
really frightening like if you say the
Mafia had done and somebody says I'm not
gonna pay any attention to you and you
can't do anything about you're in
trouble
and that's the problem with China
they're not Chinese aggression it's just
disobedience this name in fact and if
you look at the Washington
pronouncements there's a kind of a touch
of desperation in them so the State
Department recently on Iran issued
warnings to China saying if you want to
be admitted into the international
community you know us then you have to
meet here you have to meet your
international responsibilities and your
international responsibilities are to
obey US sanctions have no validity
whatsoever except that the u.s. is a
powerful state and you can smash people
up but China is observing UN sanctions
which are mostly toothless and the u.s.
is condemning them for that they say
yeah there they're not meeting their
international responsibilities China
just laughs they don't care if the u.s.
is unhappy that they're not obeying
meaningless US sanctions that's in fact
this as in many other cases the u.s. is
most of the world's just refusing to go
along well that's part of the reason why
the u.s. is in fact a declining power
but there's much more to it than that
however that's not the topic let's
return to Israel Palestine specifically
the there mentioned a few crucial
of recent history this lot to talk about
the most important real turning point
was 1967 was in 1967 with the 1967 war
that the us-israel relations were
solidified and pretty much the current
forum a big change from before and a new
framework was established in the region
so what happened in 67 well in the
background was a war that was going on
between radical Islamism and secular
nationalism in the Arab world that
radical Islamism is centered in Saudi
Arabia
the most extreme fundamentalist Arab
state most extra hobb is the most
extreme form of Islam the supporters of
jihad the missionary movement and so on
that's centered in Saudi Arabia so
that's radical Islam the core of it at
that time secular nationalism was
centered in Egypt matters Egypt
there was a war going on between Saudi
Arabia and Egypt that kind of a proxy
war in the Yemen and it was serious the
United States and Britain have
traditionally supported radical Islam
almost always Saudi Arabia and Pakistan
you know supported the formation of
commas it's very consistent US has been
a very strong written to a very strong
supporter of radical Islamism and as a
reason because if they consider it a
barrier to secular nationalism and
secular nationalism is the real threat
not only in the Middle East but
everywhere for example secular
nationalism might involve a move towards
real independence and towards taking
over the resources of the region and
using them for its own population
instead of for the west and for you know
the ruling gangsters and that's a threat
so very consistently the US and is and
Britain have supported radical Islam
Israel
who in 67 Israel effectively destroyed
secular nationalism that was the main
outcome of the war and defended Saudi
Arabia defended radical Islam and that
was a big plus for US policy and
relations with Israel changed almost
totally at that time militarily
diplomatically ideologically you know
all kinds of ways
well that was continues but the after
that in 1970 a couple years later the
Jordan us-backed dictatorship in Jordan
was carrying out a real massacre of
Palestinians Black September was called
it looked for a while as though Syria
might intervene to prevent the massacre
US was pretty upset about that at the
u.s. at the time was completely bogged
down in Southeast Asia - just invaded
Cambodia you know things were totally
impossible couldn't do anything it
called on Israel to react the Israel
mobilized it's quite formidable military
forces Syria backed off now that was
considered a positive step in protecting
the Hashemite monarchy and also the
Saudi Arabian monarchy and in fact the
u.s. aid is real quite rueful directly
which ruled that year and so I continued
in the Nixon Nixon was president and the
there was a Nixon Doctrine so-called and
the Nixon Doctrine was that the way that
the US ought to have surrogate States
carrying out the dirty work couldn't do
everything by ourselves anymore and in
the Middle East there had to be what
we're called cops on the beat the cops
on the beat that keeps the place under
control had to be non our they do a
better job killing Arabs so Pakistan
Iran which was then under the Shah a
turkey Israel there the cops on the beat
at police headquarters of course is in
Washington and there's a branch office
in London that's essentially their way
to run the region and Israel was joined
as one of the cops on the beat at that
time and that's stayed pretty much like
that the 19 he became critical in 1971
it was one of the most important moments
in Israel's history I think in 1971 the
president of new president of Egypt
president said that offered Israel a
full peace treaty full history nothing
for the Palestinians the Palestinian
issue hadn't really reached the
international agenda then so
Palestinians some words about refugees
the quid pro quo was that Israel was to
withdraw from Arab territory and in fact
Egypt only cared about Egyptian
territory the occupied Sinai actually
Jordan came along a year later with a
similar proposal withdraw from the West
Bank
well Israel had a choice at that point a
crucial choice and they made a fateful
decision I think they could have had
total almost total security a peace
treaty with Egypt and Jordan nothing for
the Palestinians Syrians out of the game
that's essentially as much security as
you can get in this world the
alternative but and they had to decide
that we want security or doing one
expansion well the primary expansion at
that time was into Egypt it was into the
Egyptian Sinai Israel at that time was
driving thousands tens of thousands of
Bedouin farmers out of the Sinai they
were laying plans to build a big city I
meet them on the ocean they had people a
lot of settlements and so on and they
decided they'd rather have expansion
than security question is what would be
us do as always in the u.s. went along
with them Kissinger support
that is what he called stalemate in his
memoirs
no no negotiations just force well that
had a lot of consequences that one
consequence that led to the 73 war which
is a very close thing for Israel another
is it set the stage for what amounts to
have time to go into the details but
since then there's been an essentially
permanent choice of accepting expansion
over security Israel could have security
right now Oh
accepting the international consensus
but they weren't expansion and now it's
primarily into the West Bank and the
illegally annexed Golan Heights which
people don't talk about the Security
Council declared it illegal but the u.s.
didn't care so Israel doesn't the and
that that remains the situation well
that was 71 72 in January 1976 the major
Arab states Egypt Syria and Jordan
neighboring states I've brought a
resolution to the Security Council
calling for a two-state settlement but
then the Palestinian issue had reached
the international agenda so they called
for a two-state settlement on the
international border they recognized the
international border so-called green
line and then the resolution added the
standard wording of the major diplomatic
documents when 242 recognition of the
rights of every state in the region to
live in peace and security within secure
and recognized borders it's basically
the resolution the u.s. vetoed vetoed a
similar resolution in 1980 the Security
Council's ruled out shifted to the
General Assembly and then you get these
annual votes with you know fifty one two
three and so on
year after year the most recent one is
February the next one will be this
winter session very likely well that's
meanwhile settlement expansion continued
in the Oslo agreements came along in
1993 but a total disaster for the
Palestinians quite predictively the I
don't say it in retrospect wrote about
it immediately because it was obvious
the pace of settlement increased
steadily right through the 90s not to
the peak year with your 2020 was last
year Gaza was closed off separated from
the West Bank and violation of the Oslo
treaty and that's been us Israeli policy
since I'll quote
Amira Hass one of Israel's leading
journalists wonderful journalists and
also the main their main specialist on
Gaza she's lived there for years she
writes that the total separation of the
Gaza Strip from the West Bank is one of
the greatest achievements of Israeli
politics whose overarching objective is
to prevent a solution based on
international decisions and
understandings and instead dictate an
arrangement based on Israel's military
superiority and the u.s. backs it
that's very bitter it means that
students in Gaza for example can't go a
couple of miles the universities in the
West Bank
patients who have to go to a Jerusalem
hospital pretty much barred people can't
visit their families a couple of
kilometers away and meanwhile repression
intensified and Gaza was reduced to
misery well in 2005 became the famous
disengagement Israel had about 7,000
settlers illegally in Gaza
using a large part of the meager
resources and land maybe 30 40 percent
and defended by a big mass of the
Israeli army and general Sauron the most
Prime Minister the most hawkish Israeli
leader he recognized rationally that
just made no sense to keep the small
number of Jewish settlers and Gaza which
by then had been utterly devastated used
to be a pretty wealthy place but totally
destroyed by then so that was pointless
it made a lot more sense to take them
out and send them to settle illegally in
the West Bank
I wish the Israel wants so that was the
disengagement
but you couldn't present it that way so
a farce was enacted a really comical
first if Israel they could have just
done it very easily they could have just
said you know on August 4 first the IDF
the Army is gonna withdrawal from Gaza
and at that point the seven or eight
thousand settlers would have climbed
into the lorries that were provided for
them and be taken from there illegally
subsidized homes and Gaza there are
illegally subsidized homes in the West
Bank and I would have been the end of it
but that was no good you had to have a
PR operation so what they staged staged
this correct was a confrontation so you
get front-page newspapers pictures you
know of a little boy pleading with the
army not to destroy his home and so on
and then the cries of never again you
know Holocaust we have to stay in West
Bank forever and it was such a
transparent force that it was it was
ridiculed in Israel and what made it
even more of a farce was it as a replay
of something that was done a couple
years earlier when they had to withdraw
from Yummie finally they seemed at the
Sinai but it passed the Western press
accepted it and that's a model for what
could happen in the West Bank if the
u.s. takes a stand well that was the
that was the disengagement the best
description of what happened next was
from one of Israel the two of Israel's
leading
historian you desert all and lucky their
elders may diplomatic correspondent they
write that after Israel withdrew its
forces from Gaza in August 2005 the
ruined territory was not released for
even a single day from Israel's military
grip or from the price of the occupation
that the inhabitants pay every day
Israel left behind scorched earth
devastated services and people with
neither a present nor a future the
settlements were destroyed and an
ungenerous move by an unenlightened
occupier which in fact continues to
control the territory and kill and her
assets inhabitants by means of its
formidable military might which can be
exercised with extreme savagery thanks
to us thanks to firm US support and
participation
well the attacks continued that was
August 2005 the Israeli US attacks
continued they escalated in January 2006
and in January the Palestinians
considered did carry out a major crime
that may be the worst crime they were
carried out they had a free election and
they voted the wrong way that's the
newspapers within days the United States
announced harsh punishment of the
Palestinians Israel - of course you're
kind of went along as usual so and in
fact be pretty what they're telling old
are described picked up significantly
then I won't run through all the details
but there were repeated escalations in
June 2007 Hamas which won the election
and what's described is that what's
described as this and that in June of
2007 there was a civil war in which
Hamas drove out
the us favorites and that sure that
they're just a gang of terrorists that
would actually happened is really not
contested the u.s. tried to initiate a
military coup to overthrow the results
of the elections that standard operating
procedure u.s. does that all over the
world so they tried a military coup it
was run by a cut-off strongman's man on
the crew who was preempted by some US
and they drove out Palestinian Authority
and they did take over well that's the
Hamas crime not that they're nice people
it's a harsh brutal organization I
wouldn't want to live under their rule
but that's a separate story the and of
course the attacks then escalated again
the siege tightened in June 2008 there
was a truce call between Israel and
Hamas and it's very very important
actually 2008 there's a ceasefire
basically so no unless Rockets Israel II
call off the siege notice a siege is an
act of war Israel of all countries
insists on that Israel has launched two
major Wars 56 and 67 on grounds that it
was very partially blocked from the
outside world
very partially through the Straits of
Tiran that total siege is of course an
active war so the terms of the truce
were Israel would call off the siege
Hamas would stop rockets well Hamas
lived up to that hundred percent you can
read it in the official us Raley records
they concede that during the period of
the truce that wasn't a single Hamas
rocket Israel never accepted the truce
maintained the siege that was June 2008
in November 2008 the day of the US
election you know when everybody's
paying attention to that Israel invaded
Gaza
troops that have killed half a dozen
Hamas militants meaningless pretext and
then rocket firing started again and it
went up and back there were all the
deaths as usual or Palestinian but it
did continue until December in late
December Hamas offered to renew the
truth the Israeli cabinet considered it
and rejected it they had a choice then
they could have had a truce no rockets
they would have had to weaken the siege
but they decided to reject it and
instead invaded Gaza with us support
that was the December 2008 January 2009
invasion which you know about or should
the u.s. supported the invasion as
always us weapons us intervene at the UN
to prevent the ceasefire Obama was had
been elected but he hadn't taken office
but he wouldn't say a thing about it his
line was there's only one president so I
can't say anything president is Bush he
was saying things about all kind of
other topics like Pakistan in terrorism
stormed couldn't say anything about this
the u.s. attack on Gaza which was
destroying the attack was very carefully
calibrated so that it would end hours
before the inauguration I did that save
Obama the necessity to say anything
about it now he was the one president
but it had stopped so he could give the
usual story about let's forget about the
past and look forward to the future and
so on
very convenient story for those who
pulled the club's others don't like it
much so that right after that Obama gave
his first in effect only major speech on
Israel Palestine and it was an
interesting one he made one good move he
appointed George Mitchell as his
negotiator as a sensible move however he
immediately undercut it by making it
clear that
would have no authority the way he did
that was clever clever enough so that
the press and commentators could pretend
they didn't our stand it what he said
was take a look at it but you know
January 28th something like then in 2009
roughly he said I said there's now a
great chance for peace we got to move
forward for peace you know peace process
he says there's a constructive plan on
the table the Arab Peace plan said
finally the Arabs have come along with
the plan actually they came along with
it in 1976 but let's forget about that
but now the Arabs have come along with a
plan and their plan calls for
normalization of relations with Israel
and he called on the Arab states to move
forward with their plan and normalized
relations with Israel you know Obama is
an intelligent literate person you can
read our degrees and so on he knows
perfectly well that that's not what the
plan said the plan reiterated the
international consensus on a two-state
settlement and went even beyond it it
said once that's established we should
move on to normalize relations with
Israel well omitted carefully omitted
the guts of the plan and said normalized
relations with Israel that's his way of
telling the world where I'm going to do
anything we're going to block peace
which is exactly what it meant and
exactly what happened settlement
expansion continued Obama claimed to be
opposed to it but he made it very clear
to Israel that the opposition didn't
mean anything it was asked as
spokespeople were asked its press
conferences are you going to do anything
if Israel violates your demand to end
settlement expansion he said no this is
just symbolic
in other words mr. Netanyahu go ahead
and do whatever you like he was asked
specifically are you going to do what
the first George Bush did first George
Bush did impose very mild sanctions when
if Israel violated it
demand that they not expand sanctions
Clinton but Bush said the Bush Obama
Swift from said explicit you know we're
not going to do that we're not gonna do
what Bush did just symbolic so it's a
clear statement go ahead and expand the
settlements which is exactly how it was
understood meanwhile George Mitchell was
kind of displaced by Dennis Ross the
Ross comes straight out of a pact he is
it was Clinton's negotiator his position
as he says is there's a nice symmetry
between Israel and Palestine Israel
Israel has needs
if Palestine only has wants so therefore
we can dismiss them
that's the neutral negotiator he's now
the leading adviser
then comes a series of steps up to the
veto of the UN resolution last February
the Arab League meanwhile they do talk
they actually have voices they don't say
much they do say some things like a
couple of months ago they called for two
no-fly zones you heard about one of them
they called for a no-fly zone in Libya
and the big uproar about that great
no-fly zone in Libya we got a bomb Libya
because the Arabs demanded they also at
the same time called for a no-fly zone
over Gaza not a word you know actually
you can read about it you can read about
it in the London Financial Times of the
main International Business Journal some
around the corners in the United States
you could read about it but no national
press that no-fly zone over Gaza didn't
conform to US policies so therefore that
one though didn't exist the let's go on
to what the options are now what are the
options today well and there's a lot of
commentary about this of course and the
way it's usually phrased is that they're
really two options the one is the
two-state settlement which has been the
international consensus for 35 years you
know you can argue about this in that
detail but the basic framework of it is
understood now that's one and the other
option that's
is that Israel should take it all over
take over the whole territory and then
there'll be a civil rights struggle what
kind of an anti-apartheid struggle and
actually that's a position which is
argued for by a lot of supporters of the
Palestinians they say that even better
than two states I think we could have an
idea for that struggle that's a real
delusion those are not the two options
there's a third option the third option
is that Israel and the US will continue
doing exactly what they're doing right
now what they're doing right now is
implementing a version of what used to
be called the show run plan after
general show wrong you know big
expansionist and namely Israel takes
what once in the West Bank and we know
what it wants not a secret it wants
everything behind the separation wall
which is in fact an annexation wool
that's parable land water resources
the nice suburbs if the Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv it's a big highway system
connecting them and so on so I'll take
that
they'll take what's called Jerusalem
which is far bigger than anything that
was ever called Jerusalem they've
illegally expanded Jerusalem illegally
annexed it over security council orders
so they'll take Jerusalem which cuts out
a big piece of the West Bank
they'll take the Jordan Valley from
which Palestinians are being mostly
evicted and settlements are being set up
now that imprisons what's left it's
separated from Gaza and so no outlet of
the sea or anything like that and then
they're cutting the corridors through
what's left the big corridor that goes
east of Greater Jerusalem goes almost to
Jericho essentially bisects the West
Bank a big town while that domain being
built there mostly under Clinton that
would started in the seventies another
corridor up north
it goes through arielle another
another one above that to me and still
another town it's essentially you know
breaks the remaining parts of the West
Bank up into almost non contiguous and
unviable Canton's a big infrastructure
projects too so that you know Israelis
and his American visitors can drive
through the whole area
you know never even seeing a Palestinian
maybe some figure on a hill you know but
it goes or something tourist office
probably funds and you know looks good
but that's it and the Palestinians can
just rot not entirely so like in
Ramallah
the US and in fact Europe or Europe
mainly are funding a kind of an island
of affluence so you live in Ramallah you
know if nice restaurants concerts and so
on that's a standard neo-colonial
program you go to any third world
country any miserable colony you can
find islands of affluence and you know
glamour or and so and beyond what we
have that's for the elites and that
shuts them out and meanwhile the rest
just collapses no they can leave if they
want well that's the third option and
that's the one that's being implemented
so we don't have to speculate it about
it it's being implemented you're paying
for it or your parents if you're not old
enough to pay taxes and that's what's
going on before our eyes so that's the
real option and the choice is that or
two states there is no third option at
this point you can think of the longer
term
down the road there will be something
better but it's got to be a first step
in the first step is to States there's
no other proposal it's now argued very
commonly that that's impossible this
settlements have gone so far that it's
impossible
well the world doesn't agree that's why
you had the February resolution world
thinks it's possible the Palestinians
think it's possible both both factions
fought off and become us which again
reiterated its support for it
so I think there's reason to believe it
is possible what's crucial is as always
what the US will do if the u.s. acts if
the u.s. joins the world it'll be
possible and Israel will go along
because there are many choices and we
can do things about it like we can stop
participating in the crimes that's not a
major unimaginable action
stop stop participating in the crimes
along with let's say Human Rights Watch
and Amnesty International and others are
calling for that would make a difference
now there's a lot of it's very common
now these days to draw analogies between
Israel and South Africa most of them are
pretty dubious in my view but there's
some which are reasonable and
instructive okay five minutes some of
you I'm used to that when when my kids
were little and they asked questions
which is very real and I'd never
discussed probably because it's real in
around 1960 the South African government
nationalist government recognized that
they're becoming an international pariah
and the South African foreign minister
called in the American ambassador we
have the documents now and he talked to
them he said look we're getting voted
down by everyone in the UN everyone's
opposed to us and so on but you and I
both know that there's only one vote in
the UN yours so as long as you're with
us we don't really care what the rest of
the world thinks and that's pretty much
what happened if you look through the
company following decades and by the
1974 type movement did develop by around
1980 American corporations were pulling
out that Congress was passing sanctions
the UN had already declared an embargo
nobody was supporting apartheid it was
overwhelming opposition but the only
person was supporting apartheid was
Ronald Reagan and his administration
they were strong supporters of apartheid
and they continued to support it in the
framework of what they of the war on
terror war on terror was declared by
Reagan that Bush and they had to defend
the African nationalist apartheid regime
against the terrorists in Nelson Mandela
and the African National Congress and I
made it literally in 1988 the White
House declared the ANC Mandela's ANC to
be one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world so of course we had
to support the white nationalist regime
in fact Mandela himself only got off the
list about two years ago so now he can
come to the United States without a
special special arrangement and that
continued until around 1990 at that
point US policy changed we don't have
all the documents being guess why
Mandela was let out of robin's Island a
couple years later forgot it was gone
it's not a nice situation pretty rotten
situation in many ways but at least
apartheid was dismantled which is a big
victory now that's not the only time
that that's happened in this case after
case that when the boss lays down the
law people have to do something and
that's you know that's actually an
optimistic conclusion for us it means
that it's really very much in our hands
if we take the right kinds of actions if
we're capable of if our own society is
democratic enough so that popular
opinion makes a difference which it
should be and if it isn't we have a lot
to worry about not just this then plenty
of things we can do to change that to
compel the United States to join the
world on this issue as well as others
and in that case this israel-palestine a
conflict can be certainly mitigated not
solved but mitigated and they said on
the basis to a much more favorable
outcome that's the
