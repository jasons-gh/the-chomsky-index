this will be going to Homeland Security
well it's good to see you again after
quite a long time too long yeah how are
things in in Arizona very well let's
talk about Iran but in particular
locating it in the area of u.s. foreign
policy post-1945 the grand area strategy
is laid out and Iran takes on enormous
significance because of its obvious oil
wealth at first right after the it was
taken for granted than the grand
strategy planning that the United States
would dominate the Middle East
Eisenhower called the strategically most
important area of the world the basic
idea of the the early stage of the
ground strategy early stages of the war
were the the US would take over what
they called the ground area of course
the Western Hemisphere the former
British Empire and the Far East and they
assumed that that that Germany would
probably win the war so
the two major powers a german-based a
lot of Eurasia the United States with
this ground area by the time the
Russians it was clear that the Russians
would defeat Germany after the
Stalingrad and then the great tank
battle and course the planning would
include as much as possible of course
maintain Middle East at that time there
was a conflict over Iran right at the
end of the Second World War the Russians
supported separation movement in the
north controlled it they wanted to
maintain control the Russians were
essentially expelled it was under the
control of Britain and a client state of
the there was however in nationalist
movement and the the Iranian leader
Randy and oil British obviously didn't
want that but they tried to stop this
development they were their post-war
Straits they were unable to do it cold
in the United States which basically
took the prime role in carrying out a
implementing a military coup which
deposed the parliamentary regime and
installed the Shah was a loyal client
Iran remained one of the sort of pillars
of control of the Middle East as long as
the Shah
remained in power Shaw had very close
relations with Israel they were not
formal because theoretically the Islamic
states were
the show was over Iran it was strongly
supported the Iraqi invasion finally
even pretty much intervening directly to
protect Iraqi shipping and the Gulf
Arany the u.s. missile cruisers shut
down
irani an airliner killing 290 people
commercial airspace and finally that the
US intervention pretty much convinced
the Iranians to if not capitulated
accept accept an arrangement for less
than they hoped after the aggression it
was a very murderous war Saddam was
using chemical weapons in fact tried to
blame around for but finally
there was finally a peace agreement you
was at once turned to sanctions against
Iran and severe threat so this was no
the first Bush bush number one his
administration invited Iraqi nuclear
engineers to the United States for
advanced training in nuclear weapons
production which of course is a serious
threat to Iran
kind of ironic that when the was loyal
client stage officials made it very
clear weapons and at that Kissinger
Rumsfeld Cheney were pressuring American
universities primarily MIT bring Iranian
nuclear engineers to the United States
for training the sanctions against Iran
harsher more intense there were
negotiations about dealing with the
Iranian nuclear programs u.s. according
to US intelligence after 2003 there was
no evidence that Iran Iran was
they had nuclear weapons programs but
probably they were developing what's
called a nuclear capability which many
countries have that is the capacity to
produce nuclear weapons if the occasion
arises and finally that led to the as
Iran was rapidly increasing its
capacities of more centrifuges and so on
Obama finally agreed to the agreement
around nuclear deal informally called in
2015
since then according to US intelligence
Iran has completely there's no
indication of any Iranian violation the
Trump administration just pulled out of
it and is now sharply escalated the
sanctions against us nations are
designed to try to reduce the US has
extraterritorial influence it forces
other countries to adopt accept US
sanctions under threat that they will be
excluded
the US market and in particular from
financial markets which are dominated by
the United States so the United States
as the world's leading enforces its own
others at the moment is the best way to
approach the major threats to its worst
client Saudi Arabia with strong us
support in fact creating what the UN has
described as the worst humanitarian
crisis in the world
it was blames it on Iran but it's pretty
clear I think if there is a
confrontation with Iran the first
victims will be living which will simply
be wiped out willing to face the danger
so that you know it's very likely that
the first step a prior to direct
conflict with Iran would be essentially
to wipe out those missiles
so what is strategy in the region
developed a guerrilla force Israel was
occupying to in violation of UN orders
the situation that turned them into a
terrorist force since then it's it
serves a trend in interest it sent
fighters to Syria large part of the
support for the technically that's quite
legal that was the recognized government
rotten government
on moral ground say he should leave us
was openly trying to overthrow the
government secret finally go into that
but finally it became clear control
serious still unresolved the Kurdish
areas and others but it's pretty much
won the war which means that Russia and
Iran have the dominant role in Syria in
Iraq there is a majority and the US
invasion of Iraq pretty much handed the
country over to Iran the Sunni
dictatorship but of course with the
Sunni
Isis came pretty close to conquering in
Iraq it was the Shiite militias and
support the u.s. participated in the
United States but I think Iran strategy
is pretty straightforward
it's expand their influence as they can
in the region as far as their military
posture is concerned I don't see any
reason to question the analysis of US
intelligence seems pretty accurate there
are presentations to conkers point out
that Iran has very low military
expenditures by the standards in the
region much much less than the other
countries
of course Israel that it's a military
doctrine is essentially defensive
designed to deter an invasion initiated
according to US intelligence if if it
would be part of their deterrent
strategy that's the real Iranian threat
it has a deterrent strategy and for the
states that want to be free to rampage
in the region
the deterrence is an existential threat
you don't want to be deterred what you'd
like that's primarily the us-israel want
to be free to act forcefully in the
region without any deterrent to be
accurate that's the real Iranian threat
that's what called the State Department
calls a successful defiance that's the
term the State Department used to
explain back in the early sixties why we
cannot tolerate the Castro regime
because of its successful defiance of
the United States that's absolutely
[Music]
and it was the idea of taking matters
into your own hands to others in the
region when the US was beginning to
world the first concern was to make sure
that the Western Hemisphere was totally
under control and in February 1945 the
u.s. called
the main theme of the end of the country
should be the fish to take a case that
was discussed Brazil major country could
produce the US government resources
that's the usual exception but for the
others they can't succumb to this idea
that only six point three percent of its
population our real task in the coming
period is to devise a pattern of
relationships which will permit us to
maintain this position of disparity then
I was nineteen forty eight I was
interested to discover that two years
later he made a statement about Latin
America to the effect the protection of
our raw materials it's a direct quote in
the rest of the world particularly in
Latin America would trump concern over
what he called police repression he was
he was considered too soft for this
world it's kind of interesting that his
estimate of of the u.s. having fifty
percent of the world's resources is
probably exaggerated now that more
careful work has been done the
statistics aren't great for that period
but there are studies it was probably
less than that however it may be true
today it's in the modern contemporary
period of
the globalization global supply chains
and so on national accounts meaning the
countries share of GDP global GDP is let
much less relevant than it used to be a
much more relevant measure of a
country's power is the wealth controlled
by locally by domestically based
multinational corporations and there
what you find is that US corporations
own about 50% of world wealth now there
are good statistics there's a very very
good studies of this by politically
converted good political economist sean
kenji stars several articles extensive
details and as he points out this is a
degree of control of the international
economy that has absolutely no parallel
counterpart in history in fact so that's
this may be it'll be interesting to see
what the impact is of trumps
wreckingball on all of this which is
breaking the system of global supply
chains that have been carefully
developed over the years so far it's
just harming the global economy getting
back to Iran you mentioned you know
global discontents that any are courting
any concern about Iranian weapons of
mass destruction could be alleviated by
the single means of heating Iran's call
to establish a weapons of mass
destruction free zone in the Middle East
this is almost on the level of Sammys
assets but barely known or reported on
well it's not a secret
and it's not just around school this
proposal for nuclear weapons free zone
in the Middle East and extended to WMD
free zone that actually comes from the
Arab states Egypt and others initiated
that back in the early 90s they called
for a nuclear weapons free zone in the
Middle East there are such zones have
been established in several parts of the
world it's kind of interesting to look
at them they aren't in effect because
the United States the theoretically one
for the Middle East would be extremely
important the Arab states pushed for
this for a long time the non-aligned
countries
g77 that's countries have called for
strongly strongly called for your pretty
much supports almost total global
support for them it would of course end
adding to it an inspection regime that
would essentially eliminate any concern
over nuclear weapons of mass destruction
there's only one problem
u.s. won't allow it if they were this
comes up regularly at the regular review
sessions of the non-proliferation treaty
most recent 2015 and everybody knows
exactly why nobody will say of course
professional journals if there were such
an agreement Israel's nuclear weapons
would come under international
inspection the United States would be
compelled to formally acknowledge that
Israel has nuclear weapons of course it
knows that it does everybody does but
uniformly acknowledging for a good
reason
if you formally acknowledge it US aid
Israel has determining under the under
US law find ways around that does become
a problem and that would mean that
Israel's weapons would have to be
inspected not just and that's
intolerable so we can't allow that
so therefore it's also worth is another
thing he can only read in some is that
the US has a special commitment to this
a unique commitment along with Britain
the reason is that when the US and its
British were planning an invasion of
Iraq they sought desperately to seek
some legal cover for it so it wouldn't
look like just a direct aggression and
they appealed to a UN Security Council
resolution in 1991 which called on
Saddam Hussein to end his nuclear
weapons programs which in fact he had
done but the pretext was he had done it
so he'd violated that resolution so
therefore that was supposed to give some
legitimacy to the invasion well if you
bother reading that UN resolution you
get down to article 14 it commits the
signers of the resolution
leaving the united states of burden to
work for a nuclear weapons free zone in
the Middle East so the US and Britain
have a unique responsibility to do this
try to find any discussion of this and
of course it could resolve whatever
problem one thinks there is
and according to US intelligence is
essentially none
the real problem is pretty much with US
intelligence describes of the Iranian
posture of the deterrence that is a real
danger constantly regarded as an
existential threat to Israel in the
United States which can tolerate
deterrence formalistic foreign policy
such as the United States has for
example lee fong writing in the
intercept reports the large large armed
large weapons manufacturers like
Lockheed Martin and Raytheon have told
their investors that escalating conflict
with Iran could be good for business
good for the preeminent in the military
force military
the rest of the world it's almost as
larger than the u.s. in the military
budget increase is greater than the
entire military budget so that's that's
the u.s. but I think is just ensuring
the world if you take a plane to get
into New York it's like
the American Society of Civil Engineers
gives the United States regularly the
lowest ranking infrastructure has
enormous resources this is the richest
country in world history its advantages
they're just incomparable and
agricultural resources mineral resources
a huge territory homogeneous you can fly
3,000 miles and think you're in the same
place where you started there's nothing
like that anywhere in the world but in
fact there are successes like a military
force a good deal of economy largely
which is actually increasing that's just
last several years in the United States
the major factor in this appears to be
what he called deaths of distress the
his work but two major economic a study
carefully the mortality figures it turns
out that in the cohort roughly 25 to 50
the age of whites white working-class
there's an increase in deaths what they
go
estimated that about 150,000 the reason
presumably it's generally the economic
stagnation since Reagan in fact this is
the group that entered the workforce
around the early eighties that has led
to a sharp a small slowdown what it was
before but there is growth but very
highly highly concentrated the wealth
was become extremely highly concentrated
right now the latest figures 0.1% of the
population holds 20% of the country's
wealth the top 1% holds roughly 40
percent half the population has negative
net worth meaning that there has been
stagnation pretty much for naturally
this leads to anger resentment
desperation similar things are happening
in Europe the austerity programs that's
the background for what's misleading the
United States it's quite striking the
deaths of despair phenomenon seems to be
a specific us
characteristic matched in other
countries and remember this is again B
there is no country in the world that
has like the advantages in the that's
pretty misleading when you use actual
Labor Department statistics turns out
that the actual unemployment rate is
over seven percent when you take into
account the large number of people have
just dropped out of the workforce the
labor force participation is
considerably below what it was about
20-30 years ago there's stagnation of
wages since the year 2000 there has been
a steady decline in just median there
are many kind of third-world
characteristics which are extremely
striking and the most in the richest
most powerful country with incomparable
advantages but in terms of guns it seems
the u.s. is an outlier we have four
percent of the world's population with
40 percent of the of the globe's guns in
this country well there's an interesting
history
after the Civil War there was it was
society and farmers had guns but they
were happened is the first major
advertising campaign was created Cowboys
were sort of the dregs of society people
who couldn't get a job anywhere push
something but this image doesn't have a
Winchester rifle
I mean this was early 20th century were
the period in which the industry was
that stage of the capitalist economy was
necessary to fabricate probably the gun
the gun propaganda was probably the
beginning of it and then I mean it goes
on the pushing up to the recent period
since 2008 Supreme Court decision the
Heller decision what they call second
Amendment rights have just become holy
writ they're the most important rights
that exist our sacred right to have guns
established by the Supreme Court
overturning a century as president take
a look at the Second Amendment that says
in order to have a that was interpreted
pretty much
reverse that he has it's a very scholar
he was a very good scholar he's supposed
to be an originalist you know he pay
attention to the intentions of the
founders says are--but decisions
interesting you know all kind of
references to obscure 17th century
documents strikingly he never mentions
once the reasons why the founders wanted
people to have guns which are not
obscure one reason was that the British
were coming the British were the big
enemy then they were the most powerful
state in the world the United States
didn't have a stand that barely had a
standing army if the British were going
to come again which in fact they did
have militias to fight them off so we
have to have well ordered militias the
second reason was it was a slave Society
this was a period where there were slave
rebellions taking place all through the
Caribbean slavery was growing massively
after the Revolution at the time of the
American Revolution I think there were a
couple hundred thousand slaves by a
couple decades later it was maybe four
million huge expansion of slavery the
most vicious system of slavery in
history and there was deep concern
slaves black slaves often outnumbered
whites you had to have armed militias to
keep them under control there was
another reason the United States from
the is maybe one of the rarer countries
in the history we just been at war in
fact virtually every year since its
founding you can hardly find a single
year when the United States wasn't a war
the one of the there were two
you know you look back at the American
Revolution the textbook story is
taxation without representation which is
not false but far from the whole story
two major factors in the Revolution were
that the British were imposing a
restriction on expansion of settlement
beyond the Appalachian Mountains into
what was called Indian country the
British were blocking that the settlers
wanted to expand to the west not just
people who move into the western areas
over the mountains British were blocking
that and the Ward the settlers could
expand the other reason was slavery in
1772 he was a very important famous
ruling leading slavery is so odious this
word was that it cannot be tolerated
within Britain could be tolerated in the
colonies like well the US colonies were
essentially part of Britain these slave
Society though they could see the the
United States stays within the British
system it's going to be a real threat to
slavery
well that was ended by the revolution
but not going back to the guns you
needed them to control to keep off the
British you needed them to control the
slaves you needed them to kill Indians
if you're gonna attack the Indian
nations they were nations of course
you're going to attack the many nations
to the west of the country
guns and militias ultimately was
replaced later by a standing army but
you take a look at the reasons for the
founders not a single one of them
applies in the completely missing second
amendments totally irrelevant to the but
it's become Holy Writ so you have this
huge everybody's been through it spread
all over the world totally fabricated
picture of the West but it was very
successful in creating a gun culture
it's now been I've become sanctified by
the reactionary Supreme Court the
immigrants are coming across the border
you know in the garage just in case
they're coming it's a very frightening
the country it's a safe probably the
safest country in the world and probably
the most afraid talk about the First
Amendment just mentioned the Second
Amendment in terms of press freedom and
journalism a trade which has come under
attack from the self-styled extremely
stable genius in the White House
as the enemy of the people what do you
talk about that and also the Assange
case a major contribution of the First
Amendment actually doesn't guarantee the
right of free speech what it says is
that the state cannot take pre-emptive
action to prevent speech doesn't say it
can't punish it okay so under the First
Amendment literally you can be punished
for things you say doesn't block that
the fact it wasn't until thee
it was nevertheless a step forward in
many ways did break through with all of
its flaws the American Revolution was a
progressive in many respects but at the
time even the phrase We the People
implementation but the very idea was a
breakthrough and the First Amendment was
also a step forward however really
wasn't until the 20th century that First
Amendment issues became really became on
the agenda first with the dissenting
opinions in cases and first around the
First World War a little bit later and
it's worth looking at how power of these
dissents were the first major one in the
shank case in 1917 was a case of
somebody who
Ward saying you don't have to serve that
wasn't dissenting opinion however the
dissenter Holmes voted in favor of it in
favor of the punishment it was very
narrow at first in fact the real steps
towards establishing a strong protection
of freedom of speech we're actually in
the 1960s a major case was time see
Sullivan the the state of Alabama
claimed what's called sovereign immunity
and you can't attack the state with
words
it's a principle that holds in most
countries this was published by the
civil rights movement Kings movement
which denounced the sheriff and Alabama
for racist activities to walk it went to
the Supreme Court it was in the time
since the Supreme Court for the first
time basically
struck down the doctrines so a community
said you can credit you can't attack the
state with words of course it had been
done but now it became legal there was a
stronger decision a couple of years
later we rounded burden the Ohio 1969
where the court ruled that speech should
be free up to participation in an
eminent criminal action so for example
if you and I go into a store with the
intent to rob it and you have a gun and
I say shoot
that's a very strong protection freedom
speech
nothing like it anywhere as far as I
know and in practice the US has not a
stellar record that will be better maybe
even the best record in protection of
freedom of speech that's a ton freedom
of press and that is indeed under attack
when the press is denounced as the enemy
of the people and you've organized your
rabid support base to attack the press
and so on
that's a serious threat and Julian
Assange case Assange was threatened the
real threat for us from the very
beginning the reason the embassy to the
United States has been to expose secret
documents quite interesting the press
has reported them of course
so he's performing the journalistic
responsibility of informing the public
about things that the state power would
rather keep secret it seems to be the
very
should be doing what the journals like
you know expose the story of the
massacre when the Woodward and
Bernstein's exposed to Nixon's crimes
that was you know that's considered very
praiseworthy times published excerpts of
the Pentagon Papers and so on so he is
essentially doing that you can question
his judgment should he have done this at
this time should be have done something
else lost person he can make but the
basic story is that WikiLeaks was
producing materials the state power
wanted suppressed but that the public
should know talk about the present
occupant of the White House in some ways
his boorish and grotesque behavior is a
pretty easy target
you know people can feel very virtuous
about denouncing Trump but Public
Citizen says every day we witness a
further slide to authoritarianism under
Trump are you concerned about that
withstand the figure who is defying
subpoenas to find congressional orders
and so on I think Trump is in many ways
underestimated he's highly skilled
politician he's got two major
constituencies that one is the actual
constituency the standard constituency
of the Republican Party actually of both
parties but much more of the Republicans
private wealth corporate power you've
got to keep them satisfied
then there's the voting base now here
what's happened to the Republicans over
the years is pretty interesting actually
during the neoliberal period that both
parties have shifted to the right
by the 1970s the Democrats had pretty
much abandoned the working class the
last gesture of support for the working
class was the humphrey-hawkins bill 1970
gauge full employment bill which Carter
watered down so it didn't really mean
anything but if since then the Democrats
have simply handed the working class
over to their main class enemy some
little changes here and there but it's
very substantial the Democrats have
become what used to be called moderate
Republicans the Republicans meanwhile
have just one office the edge I think
there's a lot of merit to the analysis
they've just become a radical insurgency
you see it almost daily a couple days
ago Mitch McConnell said if they have a
chance to appoint someone else to the
Supreme Court an election year when it
was Obama I said no election year you
can't do it they've simply abandoned any
pretense of being a parliamentary party
we're just you can't but meanwhile we're
gonna support private wealth corporate
power with utter dedication you can't
get votes that way there's not enough
people want to say fine let's do that so
what the Republicans have had to do
since the 1970s is to kind of try to
cobble together voting constituency on
some grounds other than their actual
policies and it's been very interesting
to watch it
it started with Nixon on his Southern
Strategy civil rights movement alienated
southern racists the Nixon team pretty
openly said we can pick up votes by
being racist it didn't use the word but
essentially by catering to the racist
elements of the South that are opposed
to the civil rights movement I was then
picked up by one of the chief Republican
strategists Paul Varberg he noticed in
the mid seventies that Republicans could
get lots of votes if they pretended
stress pretended to be opposed to
abortion the Republican Party had been
almost completely pro-choice Reagan
George Bush
Goldwater all of them their position in
the 60s was things like abortion the
state has nothing to say about them
they're between a woman Republicans can
get the votes of northern Catholics
workers evangelical Christians who were
a huge population if they pretend to be
in favor of instantly you know they all
became passionately opposed that's one
of the leading planks
since the Reagan years the neoliberal
programs well we can tell people look
we're screwing you so you have to find
some scapegoat who's responsible for it
in the case of Reagan who was an
outbreak racist it was you know the
black welfare queens the black woman
driving up a limousine to the Wilford
now it's immigrants the immigrants are
coming to steal your jobs or China is
gonna take your jobs I mean it's kind of
amazing to watch it work I was for
example I forget the immigrants I mean
that's so transparent we don't talk
about it I mean there's almost a hundred
percent agreement that China has taken
their jobs I was trying to take their
jobs
I'm just China have a gun to the heads
of the CEO of Apple and GM and Microsoft
and say you've gotta send jobs here I
mean it's the corporate managers who are
deciding to do it so if you don't want
the jobs to go to China you should be
saying well the corporate managers
shouldn't have the right to make that
decision so should have them who should
have the right well believe in democracy
the people who work on the enterprise
where are we so the logical argument
about China stealing our jobs goes
straight to workers control of
enterprises the main theme of the
American working class and the early
somehow you don't read about that so
China's taking our jobs immigrants
taking our jobs welfare mothers are
stealing from you you have to have guns
abortion is gonna have abortion and so
on they've had to cobble together a kind
of a voting constituency including these
sectors and also the relatively affluent
Trump voters are mostly pretty affluent
and they of course you're gonna vote
Republican for their own reasons you
know well now what's happened in the
past roughly 15 years is you take a look
at every primary Republican primary when
somebody comes up from the base popular
base they are so crazy that the
Republican establishment wasn't able to
tolerate them and was able to beat him
down people like Michelle Bachman
Rick Santorum and so on the difference
in 2016 is they couldn't beat him down
he was a skillful politician and he
managed to take over not only to win the
nomination but to put the entire pocket
party in his pocket to a remarkable
extent and amazingly he's been able to
maintain the support of people that he
is shafting at every turn with this
pretense of being the guy who's standing
up to you it's very interesting to watch
it there was an interesting interesting
article a couple days ago in the New
York Times a long study of the Middle
West Midwest farmers these are not poor
farmers or the family garden in your
backyard these farmers but but they're
suffering from the trade war they have
losing their market for soybeans and so
on but they're still supporting Trump
and the reason is
we gotta stop chinese practices it's
unfair to us what won't go into that the
Trump says he's in for he supports us if
I want the main person they quotes as
Trump said farmers or marvelous people I
love you and I'm gonna vote for you know
so a little sweet talk and some also
some a little bit of cash doesn't hurt
so there's no sixteen billion dollars
sent to farmers in the Midwest to try to
compensate for their trade losses where
does that sixteen billion dollars come
from well comes in the trade war the
trade war the tariffs are simply a tax
on consumers that's what a tariff is a
tariff work the way it spells itself out
and ends up with higher prices for
consumers and it's not small the New
York Fed just estimated the annual tax
by as about $800 per family pretty
substantial tax in big tax increase
under Trump which helps pay off his
constituency it's a pretty nice game but
they're carrying it off very effectively
he's he and Steve Patton and the rest
pretending to be the tribunes of the
people you know defending the American
worker from all these attacks and the
Democrats have abandoned the party
they've pretty much abandoned
Klaus in fact many working people voted
for Obama believing is a nice rhetoric
about hope and change but within about
two years that was shattered by the 2010
Trump comes along and says I'm your
defender I'm gonna protect you from not
many foreign enemies but the people who
are stealing your jobs okay let's give
them a chance the fact that he's
countering it off is very successful and
the Democrats are building healthy I'm
going to take this laser-like focus on
the report Russia gave was obvious in
the beginning very much yeah they'll
find that he's a crook okay we knew that
already
but they're not going to find any real
collusion with the Russians
they didn't we're not going to find any
significant Russian impact on the
election campaign funding by the wealthy
that's the real interference with
elections whatever the Russians might
have tried to do
the piece of straw on a haystack and of
course it's nothing it's compared with
you as interference with Russian
elections within other countries we just
overthrow the government but so that the
Democrats just focused everything all
their hopes on somehow Miller's gonna
save us and let's not look at his
policies the policies are murderers I
mean Trump's climate policy may
literally be a virtual death knell for
the species I'm it's not a small thing
strategy review which relates the threat
of nuclear war significantly that's
another discussion the tax scam which
was just a gift to the rich and the
corporation's a double gift for one
thing had poured a lot of money into
their pockets for secondly it created a
huge deficit which can be used as a
justification for cutting down social
spending these things are on a being go
on and on none of this is being
discussed let's talk about the fact that
maybe some somebody in the Trump
campaign talked to a Russian oligarch I
mean it's as if the Democrats are
working for him
you know like paid agents of the Trump
campaign Maureen gala for the New York
Times says her head hurts exact quote is
my head hurts puzzling over whether
Trump is just a big blowhard whose
fellating around or a sinister genius
laying traps to get himself impeached to
emanate to animate the base ahead of the
election in a way it's I mean he's a
narcissistic megalomaniac that's pretty
obvious
he is extremely skillful in carrying off
the primary tasks that a narcissistic
megalomaniac custon achieve one is
maintaining the support of wealth and
corporate power which he's doing that's
what the that's handed over to McConnell
Ryan and the rest they make sure that
that works and it's working brilliantly
corporate profits are going through the
roof you know it's fantastic
wages are pretty much stagnating what
more can you ask but the other thing is
he has to keep his voting base energized
and he's doing very well
impeachment is another case if the
Democrats move to impeachment I think
they're gonna shoot themselves in the
foot so you'd agree with Pelosi strategy
with Nancy Pelosi strategy well I don't
I don't know what's in her mind but I
think trying to head off impeachment is
a good policy for the Democrats you can
see exactly what's going to happen I
suppose the house impeaches goes to the
Senate the Senate is in Trump's pocket
bill exonerating then what happens
Trump starts making speeches about how
I'll exonerated the deep state and the
treacherous Democrats are trying to
destroy the guy who's standing up for
you against your enemies just like what
happened to the Miller report they were
just walking into a trap I mean if you
want to be concerned they want to
overturn Trump on the basis
his actual crimes the thing to look at
is not Congress it's the New York State
Attorney General's Office which is
carrying out apparently careful
investigations of Trump's fraudulent
Billings over decades which I'm sure are
gonna pile up crime after crime maybe
enough to send him to prison after he's
out of office that's probably where it's
all going to come out but that's but but
you know that's in general terms that's
a minor issue I don't he's not my
favorite person as you can see but as
compared with the crimes he may have
committed and you know the fraud in New
York with his hotels and so on that's a
very minor as compared with the fact
that he's Maxim he's escalating the race
to disaster this is the most important
decision in human history we've got a
couple of years to try to deal some hell
with a an environmental crisis can be
controlled it's not easy but it can be
done you waste a couple of years by
trying to escalate the crisis you might
just push us over the edge and in fact I
don't know if you've looked at this one
of the most amazing documents in human
history that came out of the Trump
administration the from a part of the
bureaucracy naturally it was a 500-page
the environmental assessment study done
by the transportation administration the
point of which was to concur to argue
that there's note that we should not
impose new emissions controls on cars
and trucks and they had a very sound
argument the argument is look we're
going off the cliff anyway and car
emissions and don't make that much of a
difference so who cares their estimate
was that by the end of this
century global temperatures will have
risen four degrees centigrade four
degrees centigrade that's way beyond
what the scientific consensus says will
make life unlivable so what they're
saying is we're finished throw it on
anyhow by the end of the century
everything will be destroyed so I
stopped arriving can you think of
anything like this in human history ever
I mean that Hitler wasn't saying let's
destroy the world of course they're
assuming that everyone is as criminally
insane as we are and that nobody's going
to do anything about it but you know all
of this passes without anybody paying
attention let's worry about whether
Russia had some minor influence on the
election
I mean it's looking at this from you
know outer space you think they're
insane one nice question what's going on
with the young people in Congress like
Ocasio Cortez in Ilhan Omar Rashida to
live Ayana Presley and others and teen
activists like Greta tunberg of Sweden
Haven Coleman of Denver Colorado young
people involved in the extinction
rebellion and the sunrise rebellion
great people which is after all a small
group of young people succeeded offices
got some support from especially Ocasio
Cortes
a wonderful job they managed to put on
the agenda the green New Deal
now of course it immediately got
denounced as crazy the sudden the other
thing but it's a great achievement there
has to be some kind of green New Deal
if we're gonna survive and they managed
to move it from obscurity to the
legislative agenda along with Ed Markey
the senator from Massachusetts that's a
real achievement and there are very
solid substantive proposals as to how
you could implement these proposals the
most detailed and persuasive I know of
by Robert Pollin
economist at UMass Amherst these groups
have that's a remarkable achievement in
fact it's a kind of civil it's it's the
hope for survival of any kind of
civilized life this is not a small thing
I mean the human species is facing
questions which have never risen before
his organized human life want to survive
in any recognizable form I mean we were
approaching the level of global warming
of roughly a hundred and twenty five
thousand years ago when sea levels were
about the 25 feet higher than they are
now you don't have to have much of an
imagination to know what that means well
shall we race towards it the way the
Trump administration and the Republican
Party wants us to do should we do
something about it the way sunrise
movement an extinction rebellion
Cascio Cortez wants to do that's the
decision that has to be made so it's
good that you bring that up because
that's of extraordinary importance thank
you very much for your time
