"Countries have reacted to this in many ways -- some very successfully, some
more or less successfully.
One is at the bottom
of the barrel.
That's us," says renowned linguist and political dissident Noam Chomsky of
the COVID-19 crisis sweeping the globe.
"The U.S. is the only major  country that cannot even provide data to the
World Health Organization, because it's so dysfunctional."
Chomsky says the fault lies with neoliberal, capitalist logic guiding the for-profit healthcare
system, compounded by the current "sociopathic" administration at the helm in D.C.
"We have a freak show in Washington -- a totally dysfunctional government, which is
causing enormous problems."
