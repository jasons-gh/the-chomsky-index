the war and peace report
i meani goodman as we return to MIT
professor Noam Chomsky world renowned
political dissident linguist and author
last week he spoke before over 800
people in the whole of the United
Nations General Assembly before
ambassadors and the public alike on the
issue of the of Israel and Palestine
after his speech I conducted a public
interview with Professor Chomsky what do
you think is the most the single most
important action the United States can
take and what about its role over the
years what is its interest here well one
important action that the United States
could take is to live up to its own laws
of course it would be nice if it lifts
up the international law but maybe
that's too much to ask but live up to
its own laws
and there there are several and here
incidentally I have in mind advice to
activists also who I think ought to be
organizing and educating in this
direction there are two crucial cases
one of them is the what's called the
Leahy law
Patrick lay senator lay introduced
legislation called the lay law which
bars sending weapons to any military
units which are involved in consistent
human rights violations there is the
slightest doubt that the Israeli army is
involved in massive human rights
violations which means that all dispatch
of us arms to Israel is in violation of
US law I think that's significant the US
should be called upon by its own
citizens to and by others to adhere to
US law which also happens to conform the
international law in this case as
Amnesty International for example for
years has been calling for an arms
embargo against Israel for this reason
these are all steps that can be taken
the second is the tax-exempt status that
is given to organizations in the United
States which are directly involved in
the occupation and in a significant
attacks on human and civil rights within
Israel itself like the Jewish National
Fund take a look at its Charter with the
State of Israel which commits it to
acting for the benefit of people of
Jewish race religion and origin within
Israel one of the consequences of that
is that by a complex array of laws and
administrative practices the fund pretty
much administers about 90% of the land
of the country with real consequences
for who can live places via tax exempt
status also for their activities in the
West Bank which are strictly criminal I
think that's also straight in violation
of US law those are important things and
I think the US should be pressured
internationally and domestically to
abandon its virtual unique role
unilateral role in blocking a political
settlement for the past 40 years ever
since the first veto in January 1976
that should be a major issue in the
media in convocations like this in the
United Nations and domestic politics and
government politics and so on
the roll
the role of the media can you talk about
that and particularly in the United
States and do you think that the opinion
in the United States public opinion is
shifting on this issue well the role of
the media are somewhat shifting from a
uniform support for virtually everything
that Israel does to and of course
silence about the u.s. role that's not
just in the case of Israel that's
innumerable other cases as well but
slowly shifting but nevertheless went
about say Operation protective edge and
one can read in news reporting news
reporting in the New York Times major
journal a criticism of Hamas is assault
on Israel during protective edge Hamas
is assault on Israel not exactly what
happened but that's what people are
reading and that's the way it's depicted
Israel is over and over it's pointed out
look poor Israel is under attack it has
the right of self-defense
everyone agrees to that actually I agree
to everyone has a right of self-defense
but that's not the question
the question is do you have a right of
self-defense by force by violence the
answer is no for anyone whether it's an
individual or a state unless you have
exhausted peaceful means if you won't
even permit peaceful means which is the
case here then you have no right of
self-defense by violence but try to find
a word about that in the meeting all you
find is
self-defense when President Obama rarely
says anything about what's happening
it's usually if my daughters were being
attacked by rockets I would do anything
to stop it he's referring not to the
palestinian hundreds of Palestinian
children who are being killed and
slaughtered but to the children in the
Israeli taunus they wrote which are
which is under attack by Qasim missiles
and remember that Israel knows exactly
how to stop those missiles namely live
up to a ceasefire for the first time and
then they would stop as in the past even
when Israel didn't live up to a
ceasefire that framework and of course
the frame the rest of the framework is
the United States is an honest broker
trying hard to bring the two
recalcitrant sides together doing its
best than this noble endeavor has
nothing to do with the case the u.s. is
as some of the US negotiators have
occasionally acknowledged Israel's
lawyer if there were serious
negotiations going on
they would be led by some neutral party
maybe Brazil which has some
international respect and they would
bring together the two sides on the one
side Israel and the United States on the
other side the Palestinians those would
be possible realistic negotiations but
the chances of anyone in the media
either I won't even say pointing it out
even thinking about it is minuscule the
indoctrination is so deep that really
elementary facts like these and they are
elementary are almost incomprehensible
but to get back to your the last point
you mentioned it's very important
opinion in the United States is shifting
not as fast as in most of the world not
as fast as in Europe it's not reaching
the point where you could get a vote in
Congress anything like the British
Parliament a couple days ago but it is
changing mostly among younger people and
changing substantially I'll just
illustrate with personal experience
aiming as the same experience
until pretty recently when I gave talks
on these topics as I've been doing for
40 years I literally had to have police
protection even at my own University MIT
police would insist them walking me back
to my car because of threats they picked
up meetings were broken up and so on
that's all gone just a couple of days
ago I had a talk on these topics at MIT
a meeting wasn't broken up no police
protection maybe five or six hundred
students were there all enthusiastic
engaged committed concerned wanting to
do something about it that's happening
all over the country all over the
country Palestinian solidarity is one of
the biggest issues on campus enormous
change in the last few years that's the
way things tend to change it often
starts with younger people gradually it
gets to the rest of the population
efforts of the kind I mentioned say
trying to get the United States
government to live up to its own laws
those could be undertaken on a
substantial scale domestically and with
support from international institutions
and that could lead the further changes
I think that the for example the two
things that I mentioned would have a
considerable appeal to much of the
American public why should they be
funding military units that are carrying
out massive human rights violations why
should they be permitting a tax
exemption meaning we pay for it that's
what a tax exemption means why should we
be paying compelled to pay for
violations of fundamental human rights
in another country and even in occupied
territories where it's criminal I think
that can appeal to the American
population and can lead to the kinds of
changes we've seen in other cases final
question before we open it up to each of
you your thoughts on the BDS movement
the boycott divest sanctions movement
well the BDS is a set of tactics right
these are tactics that you employed when
you think they're going to be effective
and in ways that you think will be
effective tactics are not principles
they're not actions that you undertake
no matter what because you think they're
right but tactics are undertaken if
you're serious because you think they're
going to help the victims that's how you
adjust your tactics not because I think
they're right in principle but because I
think they will be beneficial that
oughta be second nature to activists
also second nature should be a crucial
distinction between proposing and
advocating I can propose now that we
should all live in peace and love each
other I just proposed it that's not a
serious proposal it becomes a serious
proposal when it is becomes advocacy
commit is given I sketch out a path for
getting from here to there then it
becomes serious otherwise it's empty
words
that's crucial and related to this well
when you took a take a look at the BDS
movement which is separate incidentally
from BDS tactics let me make that clear
so when the European Union issued its
directive or when the that I mentioned
or when say the Gates Foundation
withdraws investment in security
operations that are being carried out
not only in the occupied territories but
elsewhere that's very important but
that's not the BDS movement that's BDS
tactics actually BD tactics boycott
divestment tactics that's important the
BDS movement itself has been an impetus
to these developments and in many ways a
positive one but I think it has failed
and should reflect on its so far
unwillingness to face what are crucial
questions for activists what's going to
help the victims and what's going to
harm them what is a proposal and what is
real advocacy you have to think that
through and it hasn't been sufficiently
done so if you take a look at the
principles of the VDS movement there
three the very slightly in wording but
basically three one is actions should be
directed against the occupation that has
been extremely successful in many ways
and it makes sense
it also helps educate the Western
populations who are being appealed to to
participate enables so it's an opening
to discuss investigate organize about
the participation in the occupation it's
very successful a second principle is
that media's actions should be continued
until Israel allows the refugees to
return that has had no success and to
the extent that it's been tried it's
been negative it just leads to a
backlash no basis has been laid for it
among the population
it is simply interpreted as saying oh
you want to destroy the State of Israel
we're not going to destroy a state you
cannot undertake actions which you think
are principled when the work real in the
real world they're going to have a
harmful effect on the victims there's a
third category having to do with civil
rights within Israel and there are
things that could be done here one of
the ones I mentioned in fact the tax
rate status for u.s. organizations that
are engaged in civil rights by and human
rights violations and remember a tax
exemption means I pay for that's what a
tax exemption is well that's an action
to be undertaken others that have been
undertaken have had a backlashes which
are harmful and I won't run through the
record but these are the kinds of
questions that always have to be asked
when you're involved in serious activism
if you care about the victims not just
feeling good but caring about the
victims that's critically important MIT
