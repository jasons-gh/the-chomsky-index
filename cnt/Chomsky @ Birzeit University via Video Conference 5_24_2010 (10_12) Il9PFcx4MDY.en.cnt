I'd like to ask you professor Chomsky
how will you you would respond to those
who appreciate very much your critical
analysis like my previous comment
mentioned your transient and critical
analysis of a us and Israeli policy
while at the same time not offering much
in terms of hope in other words that
your message could be a message of
despair to both Palestinians and also
all other people in the world who are
trying to resist Israeli control and
domination so in other words and really
notwithstanding your rather oblique
comments towards the very end I would
really like to know how would you
respond to that do you give us hope or
are you giving us a message of despair
thank you i could hear that well it's
innocent you know i don't want to draw
the analogy too closely there are plenty
of differences but it's a bit what 20
anti-apartheid activists said in the
late 1980s can you give us a message of
hope there was a message of hope who
turned out the message of hope was that
the United States rejoin the world and
when did the apartheid system collapsed
what came out of it is not very
beautiful of there plenty of problems in
South Africa but nevertheless overcoming
apartheid was quite a significant event
and then moving on to a peaceful to
estate settlement in accordance with the
with the world opinion and international
law well that would be a step forward to
so yeah and that's a possibility it came
close to realization at taba things have
changed but not materially and
possibility now is it a good solution
not my opinion since childhood just make
a personal comment in the 1940s when I
was a teenager I was a Zionist youth
leader active Zionist youth leader
opposed to a Jewish state that was part
of the Zionist movement at the time
opposition to a Jewish state alone
groups I was associated with we're
committed to by nationalist Eric Jewish
community based on arab-jewish
working-class cooperation socialist
institutions and so on and it wasn't a
wild dream and it's not a wild dream
today but it has order to get there I
think it's a better solution that you
have to go in stages this what you're
saying I'd like everyone to live in
peace that's fine I'd like everyone
living piece to it because a serious
proposal when you explain how we get
from here to there and in this case to
get to what in my view has always been a
better settlement requires moving stages
and I don't see any proposal on the
table other than one I mentioned first
stage from state settlement and we all
know what that means there's been
international consensus on that for 35
years pretty much which was almost
reached at taba so that's the first
stage and it can be reached if the u.s.
changed its policy beyond once what
would the effects be well I suspect that
the effects would be to would lessen the
cycle of violence they would lessen the
level of hostility that people would
begin to be able to act on their own
interests as human beings not as just
representatives of an ethnic nationalist
group and they would see it as often
happens
ask them their interests require closer
integration anyone who's familiar with
the territory those the drawing a line
through it doesn't make any sense
wherever line is it's just too closely
integrated so I suspect that people
would begin to move towards commercial
cultural social other arrangements and
gradually would move maybe toward some
kind of Federation and possibly close a
closer integration and also integration
into the region I want state smart
permanent institutions they have no
inherent legitimacy another a particular
pretty bad way of organizing the world
they've been imposed over the world by
savagery I mean Europe was the most
savage place in the world for centuries
while they're trying to impose a
nation-state system which just doesn't
fit people's wives another two diverse
the complex a nation-state system forces
them into a rigid structure that has
nothing to do with their interests which
is why it's so violent and yorba took
centuries over if you look over the rest
of the world practically every major
conflict going on as a result of
European imperialism and its effort to
impose state systems we don't belong
that cuts through borders you know
breaks groups this separates groups from
one another let x a what's now called
aflac afghanistan-pakistan the Imperial
line that the British grew the durand
line separates people who are identical
the question are the same on both sides
of the border they don't accept the
border and or should they I'm just about
every quarter in the world is like that
well okay they can be overcome through
Europe effect has been moving towards
eroding the borders I think that's very
healthy of this region Middle East
region could also do so and there is
after all a model wasn't a very
attractive model in many ways but it had
some of the right properties and we
Ottoman Empire nobody wants to restore
the Ottoman Empire brutality corruption
everything else but it was right in some
ways it didn't have borders you could go
from Cairo to Istanbul to Baghdad and so
on without passing any checkpoints and
the groups were could run their own
affairs you know the Greeks could run
their affairs and their own part of the
city and so on and it's a pretty
sensible way for people to live in other
institutions were a different world but
I think it could move in that direction
too but you can't it doesn't make any
sense to propose these things unless you
give a way to get there and I don't know
of any way or any suggestion of any way
except a two-state settlement and I
think that is within reach scum closed
several times can be reached today we
know how and I think that's about as
hopeful as it was to oppose apartheid in
the 1988 and opposing the part I turned
out to be the right position a couple of
years later it was gone and I think that
could be true here too
