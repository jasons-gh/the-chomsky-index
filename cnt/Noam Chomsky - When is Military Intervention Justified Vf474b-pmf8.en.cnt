when do you think is it right to
intervene
in the affairs of another nation i think
there are conditions under which that
would be possible i mean one
basic condition is that other that
non-violent
you mean violent intervention that
non-violent means have been
exhausted that's one condition a second
condition is that the
people of the country in which you're
intervening support the intervention
under those conditions and you can think
of others intervention would be
justified
however we don't ever apply those
conditions xa
south africa under apartheid there's no
doubt that the overwhelming majority of
the population would have
favored intervention probably military
intervention
uh the other means had been tried for
decades
did anybody think of a forceful
intervention
of course not nor did i or take a recent
case east timor
during the 1999 there were very large
scale atrocities going on
uh the population undoubtedly would have
been delighted in military intervention
well britain and the united states did
intervene namely by supporting indonesia
i didn't i think of uh moving
to do something else of course not in
fact britain was sending uh
jets to indonesia even after the uh uh
australian led peacekeeping forces
entered that's the way the great powers
intervened
is there ever a value or a case or a
situation
that requires military intervention by
one country
in the affairs of another yes there are
there are mechanisms for it uh the
united nations charter provides
mechanisms for it there is a quote i
read from 1999 where it seems
you say that a standard argument is that
we had to do something
we could not stand by as atrocities
continue that's never true
one choice always is to follow the
hippocratic principle
first do no harm if you can think of no
way to adhere to that principle
then do nothing well that's trivial i
mean
just as it is for a doctor if it which
is what it was for if the only thing you
can think of
is harming the patient then you do
nothing but let's take a
case and a very distressing case in
rwanda
people knew that there was about to be a
massacre it was in progress
who to militiaman murdered eight hundred
thousand people
do nothing because there certainly would
have been a military intervention would
have had to be involved
follow the logic of it if if intervening
in rwanda
would have caused harm then it's better
not to do it
if intervening in rwanda would have been
helpful then
yes you do it but it's just trivial
meaning there would have been to be
many people killed to save the greater
good but the question is the balance of
effect
same with a doctor if a doctor gives you
an inoculation it's going to hurt
okay but that's not what they have a
hippocratic oath doesn't say don't give
an inoculation
it says if what you're going to do is
going to cause harm
more harm than good then don't do it
that's the crucial thing more harmful
but that's exactly what the hippocratic
oath is exactly what i quoted
if the only thing you can think of doing
is making things worse
then don't do it so essentially what
you're saying is that sometimes the
morally reprehensible wrong thing
is not to intervene militarily sometimes
if if military intervention would be
beneficial yes of course and it was
in the case of rwanda it's not clear
that military intervention was needed a
small military force might very well
have prevented these events incidentally
we like to look at it in 1994 but i was
writing about that in
1979 but there's an issue in kosovo
very interesting eliminating chapter
ignition ask you about that because
the conventional wisdom is that there
was
in prospect developing possibly genocide
certainly ethnic cleansing certainly
atrocities certainly massacres happening
the nato bombed and the serbs stopped
their campaign against the alliance
you say your crimes only happened after
sorry you're
you're right you're right that is the
conventional story and it's a total
fabrication
uh we have immense evidence about this
two huge state department compilations
of documents
trying to justify the bombing uh british
parliamentary inquiry which went into it
you say
i don't say i don't say they say
the overwhelming evidence documentation
up to the sky
all says the same thing and you say
that's the fact
well since that's the entire western
documentation
uh but it's not the entire western
documentation for example the
organization for security and
cooperation in europe
went back did a verification of what
actually happened its conclusion was
that the serb campaign against the
albanians was a well rehearsed strategy
their intent to apply mass killing as an
instrument of terror coercion
or punishment against kosovo albanians
was already in evidence
in 1998 the year before the bombing they
didn't say that
what they said is they had sorry they
had they said they had contingency plans
to carry out atrocities if
they were under attack if you look at
the newspapers from the time clearly
people like mary robinson who was our
former irish president
were saying there were massacres there
needed to be an investigation there
needed to be action this was before
what we know what she was saying what
she was saying and we have the osce
record
entire record thick record what it says
is
kosovo was an ugly place uh there were
more than others so there was evidence
of killing in progress and of a campaign
and i'll tell you how much there was
from the british government the american
government the osce the kvm
monitors and so on they said in the
preceding year there were about 2 000
people
killed according to the british
government
most of them killed by kla guerrillas
there were no changes
up until the withdrawal of the monitors
by the west
then came the bombing the bombing led to
massive atrocities which were
anticipated
