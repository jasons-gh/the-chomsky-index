he wrote because the masses are
notoriously short-sighted and generally
cannot see danger until it's at their
throats our statesmen are forced to
deceive them into an awareness of their
own long-run interests deception of the
people may in fact become increasingly
necessary unless we're willing to give
our leaders in Washington a freer hand
and in 1981 as the United States was
launching a new crusade for freedom
Samuel Huntington the fessor of
Government at Harvard said in a private
but published discussion and interchange
you may have to sell intervention or
other military action in such a way as
to create the misimpression
that it is the Soviet Union that you're
fighting that's what the United States
has been doing ever since the Truman
Doctrine the basic problem is this the
idea is that if you have a society in
which the voice of the people is heard
you got to make sure that that voice
says the right thing in totalitarian
societies it's not a big problem
you got a club in your hand and if
people don't behave the right way you
hit them with a club or threaten them
with it so it doesn't really matter much
what they think what matters is what
they do and that you control by force
but as the capacity of the state to
control by force erodes it's necessary
to control what people think and in fact
I think you find much more sophisticated
concern for Thought control precisely as
the society becomes more free according
to this alternative view the media do
indeed fulfill a societal purpose but a
very different one their societal
purpose is to inculcate and defend the
economic and social and political agenda
of the privileged groups that dominate
the domestic society we are privileged
to see in here a presentation by one of
America's foremost intellectuals Noam
Chomsky as he evaluates the American
power structure and the mass media right
now on all
turn achieve views
[Music]

I've talked to some people who live in
other countries who have traveled widely
and they say that Americans are the most
heavily indoctrinated and propagandize
people that they have ever encountered
in their travels well why should this be
if this is the land of the free press
and democracy one of America's leading
intellectuals Noam Chomsky discusses
this in his book which he co-authored
called manufacturing consent and we're
very fortunate to have dr. Chomsky to
give us an address on the subject of why
Americans are so manipulated and
controlled and how far back in our
history this goes dr. Chomsky is a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology specializing in
linguistics the title is particularly
the subtitle manufacturer consent in a
Democratic Society is a bit paradoxical
manufacturers consent refers to
indoctrination and indoctrination is
inconsistent with a Democratic Society
so you can't have manufacture of consent
in a Democratic Society and there's in
fact a standard view on this matter
which does make it inconsistent the
standard view is expressed for example
by Supreme Court justice Powell when he
speaks of what he calls the societal
purpose of the First Amendment enabling
the public to assert meaningful control
over the political process that's pre
obvious idea it the idea is that a
democracy functions to the extent that
people have free access to I to
information and opinion and of course
the opportunity to act on it
well that sounds obvious in fact perhaps
almost tautological but it's worth
bearing
mind that there is a contrary view in
fact a very well-represented contrary
view in fact the country review is
probably the dominant view among people
who actually have written and thought
about the nature of modern democracy and
this contrary view can be traced right
back to the origins of modern democracy
in the 17th century English revolution
as in the case of most revolutions may
be virtually all that was a
multi-dimensional affair with a civil
war between the supporters of the king
and the supporters of parliament but
then a big popular movement was against
all of them and didn't want and was
trying to end had a very populist
radical Democratic character to it and
was defeated the Democrats were defeated
within about 20 years by 1660 and you
read their pamphlets they were saying
that we've lost the only question now is
who's slaves the poor shall be king or
Parliament many revolutions have the
same consequence maybe all so far till
one yet to come in the course of that
struggle there was a great deal of
concern over the fact that the general
population was gaining the opportunity
and the even the idea of becoming
involved directly in shaping their own
affairs
and that led to great concerns John
Locke wrote that day laborers and
tradesmen the spinsters and dairymaids
must be told what to believe the
greatest part cannot know and therefore
they must believe one of the
contemporary historians man named
Clement Walker wrote at the time that
the deep concern of the liberal elements
we're talking about now over the fact
that these guys with their little
printing presses putting out pamphlets
and you know agitating and the army and
that sort of thing we're beginning to
reveal
the mysteries of government and he said
if they do that they will make people so
curious and arrogant that they will
never find humility enough to submit to
a civil rule that has to be stopped
and the same idea comes right up to the
modern period without running through
American Revolution you can find it and
so on in the modern period you find
major thinkers picking up the same
themes for example Reinhold Niebuhr
who's a much respected moralist and
political thinker and very very
influential and among modern political
leaders wrote that rationality belongs
to the cool observers but because of the
stupidity of the average man he follows
not reason but faith and the naive faith
of the proletarian requires necessary
illusion and emotionally potent
oversimplifications which have to be
provided by myth makers to keep the
ordinary person on the right course
walter Lippmann who was the Dean of
American journalists wrote about what he
called the manufacture of consent that's
where that phrase comes from and he said
that the manufacture of consent has
become a self-conscious art and a
regular organ of popular government in a
revolution in the practice of democracy
and this he thought was appropriate
because the common interests very
largely elude public opinion entirely
and can be managed only by a specialized
class whose personal interests reach
beyond the locality that would be
neighbors
cool observers that was right after
World War one and the timing is
important during World War one John
Dewey's circle of liberal intellectuals
were extremely impressed with in their
words and their perception with having
imposed their will upon a reluctant and
indifferent majority with the aid of
propaganda fabrications about hun
atrocities and jingoistic
oversimplifications the point was that
as usual the population was pacifistic
and didn't want to go to war any point
in it
in fact Woodrow Wilson won the 1916
election on the slogan peace without
victory a mandate which he predictably
interpreted as meaning victory without
peace very quickly and with the aid of
the intellectuals they felt at least
maybe they were exaggerating their own
contribution that they had whipped the
population into a war fever and American
Historians also joined enthusiastically
in the cause they formed the National
Board for historical service the founder
of it said that what was needed with
what he called historical engineering a
method to serve the state by explaining
the issues of the war so that we might
better win it the Wilson administration
established the first official
government propaganda agency in the
United States called the Creole
Commission Commission on Public
Information which was a straight
propaganda agency to try to turn this
reluctant and indifferent majority into
a willingness to fight the war and
succumb the jingoistic fanaticism that's
actually a predecessor of a much more
ambitious program developed during the
Reagan administration the Reagan's
office of Latin American public
diplomacy theoretically under the State
Department but actually apparently run
by the National Security Council that
was an illegal operation as the
Congressional General Accounting Office
later concluded in a study of it a legal
operation which had the intent of
intimidating critics and the controlling
debate and discussion over Central
America its goals as they put it were to
demonize the Sandinistas and of course
to build up support for the US client
states the u.s. terror states in the
region that was exposed during the
iran-contra hearings by one of the very
few journalists who actually did some
work on the hearings did some
journalistic work instead of just
repeating the handouts Alfonso HRD of
the Miami Herald exposed this and when
he exposed the exposure later came out a
lot more details on congressional
hearings when he exposed that he went to
high administration officials to ask
them to talk about it and they described
the these propaganda efforts as a
spectacular success one of them
described the efforts as the kind of
operation that you would carry out an
enemy territory it's a very evocative
phrase and it expresses the attitude of
the Reaganite political leaders and in
fact of state leaders generally towards
their own populations they're an enemy
it's the domestic enemy that you have to
control and marginalize and you want to
make sure that they don't become so
curious and arrogant that they won't
find humility enough to submit to a
civil rule the out of the creel
commission but going back to World War
one there were a number of consequences
one of the members of the creel
Commission was a man who went on to
become the leading figure and sort of
patron saint of the modern public
relations industry Edward Bernays he
later wrote about what he called the
engineering of consent which he said was
the essence of democracy it said and the
public relations industry is devoted in
the words of its own to major industry
that which was devoted to controlling
what they call the public mind educating
the American people about the economic
facts of life to ensure a favorable
climate for business and a proper
understanding of the common interests
the public mind won AT&T executive
observed eighty years ago the public
mind is the only serious danger facing
the company and it's got to be
controlled Edward Bernays went on to
carry out such operations as demonizing
the democratic capitalist government of
Guatemala working for the United Fruit
Company when the United States was
planning to overthrow it as it did in
1954 turning the country into a
charnel-house which has remained ever
since there's also an academic twist to
all of this in fact it's a major theme
in the academic social sciences
going back at least 50 years or more one
of the most prominent modern American
political scientists Harold Lasswell
who's a leading figure in communications
and such things he wrote the article on
propaganda in the international
encyclopedia of social sciences which
was published in 1933 and in it he says
that we should not succumb the
Democratic dogmatism about men being the
best judges of their own interests they
are not the best judges are the elites
us smart guys the cool observers and we
must therefore be ensured the means to
impose our will for the common good of
course this he said will require a whole
tech new technique of control largely
through propaganda because of the
ignorance and superstition of the masses
same theme all the way through the basic
problem is this the idea is that if you
have a society in which the voice of the
people is heard you got to make sure
that that voice says the right thing in
totalitarian societies it's not a big
problem
you got a club in your hand and if
people don't behave the right way you
hit them with a club or threaten them
with it so it doesn't really matter much
what they think what matters is what
they do and that you control by force
but as the capacity of the state to
control by force erodes it's necessary
to control what people think and in fact
I think you find much more sophisticated
concern for thought control precisely as
the society becomes more free I don't
think it's surprising that the
sophisticated discussion things like the
public relations industry and the
academic side of it and you know the
journalistic side and all this kinds of
things have been sampling I suspect if
one did a comparative study you'd find
that they developed primarily in
relatively free societies ours is a very
free society in the sense that the state
has by comparative standards very
limited resources to control by force
and I think it's undoubtedly in fact the
most sophisticated in the terms of in
the reliance on
makes of indoctrination and control
public relations industry in particular
as a American creation you'll notice of
course the close similarity to Leninist
ideology to Bolshevism which also
assumes that the radical intellectuals
are the specialized class the Vanguard
may have got to lead the stupid and
ignorant masses to a better society in
fact the two conceptions are very much
alike I think that's probably one of the
reasons why there's been historically
such an easy transition from one to
another the move from being Leninist
enthusiast to a you know a passionate
supporter of state capitalism and you
know working for American aims that
takes place overnight it's been going on
for years it's called the God that
failed transition and it happens very
simply I mean in the early stages it had
some authenticity to it when people like
Ignacio Salona and others were making
this transition but in recent years has
become just a farce
I mean technique of opportunism and the
transition is very easy I think because
there isn't much of a difference in
ideological change it's just a matter of
where you think power lies if you think
there's going to be a popular revolution
and you can ride that revolution to
state power and then wield the whip over
the masses you're a Leninist enthusiast
if you see that that's not going to
happen and power lies in the state
capitalist institutions which you have
to serve as a manager an ideological
manager you do that but it's basically a
very similar position and in fact in the
last century or so since there's been
more or less identifiable secular
intelligencia I think you find typically
that they fall into one or the other of
these two categories they associate
themselves with one or the other system
of power and hierarchy and subordination
in fact what I just said is almost a
tautology it's only if you submit to
those systems that you're counted as a
respectable intellectual for obvious
reasons well coming up to more modern
times and the post Second World War
period
did character fine again deep concern
over the need to control and deceive the
public to control the public mind
presidential historian Thomas Bailey
wrote in 1948 at the time when we were
sort of setting off on a new war that
cold war he wrote because the masses are
notoriously short-sighted and generally
cannot see danger until it's at their
throats our statesmen are forced to
deceive them into an awareness of their
own long-run interests deception of the
people may in fact become increasingly
necessary unless we're willing to give
our leaders in Washington a freer hand
and in 1981 as the United States was
launching a new crusade for freedom
Samuel Huntington the professor of
government at Harvard said in a private
but published discussion and interchange
you may have to sell intervention or
other military action in such a way as
to create the misimpression but it is
the Soviet Union that you're fighting
that's what the United States has been
doing ever since the Truman Doctrine
which is quite accurate and gives a
certain insight into the nature of the
Cold War in particular into the nature
of the war against Nicaragua which is
what he specifically had in mind
well these concerns over controlling the
public mind tend to rise to the surface
particularly after periods of Wars and
turmoil like the 17th century Revolution
the Civil War or like the First World
War when Woodrow Wilson launched the
major Red Scare which is the major
example in modern American history all
of American history of state repression
that was really large-scale and
effective in destroying unions and
destroying independent politics and
eliminating independent thought and so
on and the same thing happened after
World War two with the phenomenon that's
mislabeled McCarthyism it's mislabeled
because it was actually initiated by the
Liberal Democrats in the late 1940s
McCarthy just came along at the tail end
of it
and vulgarized it a little the reason
for this is and is that periods of wars
and turmoil have a tendency to arouse
people from apathy and to make them
think and to make them organize often so
that's why you get things like the Red
Scare and McCarthyism right after
periods of war and turmoil and the same
thing happened after the Vietnam War
which had the same effect after the
Vietnam War elites were concerned about
what they called a crisis of democracy
in fact one of the most interesting
books on this topic are one of the most
interesting books on most of the
insightful books I think on modern on
the modern democratic system is called
the crisis of democracy it's a study the
only book-length study published by the
trilateral commission so important group
put together by David Rockefeller in
1973 and it represents the more or less
liberal internationalists from the three
major centers of modern capitalism the
United States Western Europe and Japan
hence trilateral and remember this is
the Liberals this is the group out of
which Jimmy Carter and most of his
administration came the quite what's the
crisis of democracy that they're
concerned with in all of the democratic
societies well the crisis is that during
the 1960's large groups of people who
are normally passive and apathetic began
to try to enter the political arena to
press their demands and that's a crisis
which has to be overcome the naive might
call that democracy but that's because
they don't understand the sophisticated
understand that that's a crisis of
democracy the American spokesmen again
Samuel Huntington wrote in his report
that Harry Truman had been able to
govern the country with the cooperation
of a relatively small number of Wall
Street lawyers and bankers in those days
there was no crisis of democracy things
were working just right but in the 1960s
you got all this turmoil I mean young
people and women
labor and all kinds of weird people who
were supposed to be sitting quietly in
the corners began to get involved and
caused this crisis I mean the same
crisis that arose in the 17th century
and there repeatedly arises when people
begin to try to take advantage of the
formal opportunities that exist among
the terrible things that were happening
during the 60s causing this crisis they
said was that you had this group of
people who they called value-oriented
intellectuals people who are concerned
with things like truth and justice and
all that sort of nonsense and they're
opposed to the good guys the
technocratic and policy oriented
intellectuals they called the commissar
that ones who just do the job you know
which had these value Airy and
intellectuals and they were doing all
sorts of horrible things like under my D
legitimizing the institutions that are
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young like schools and universities
remember this is an internal discussion
so they kind of let their hair down
there are general proposal at the end of
all of this these lengthy and thoughtful
discussions was that what we need is
more moderation in democracy to mitigate
the excess of democracy and overcome the
crisis in plain terms what that means is
that the public has to be reduced to
their proper state of apathy and
obedience and driven from the public
arena if democracy is to survive and the
appropriate sense with the specialized
class you know the cool observers smart
guys the technocratic and policy or an
intellectuals doing our job in the
interests of the people who have real
power
that's the liberal side I won't go into
what the reactionary side says about the
matter well to summarize there is a
standard view of democracy and it's the
view of Justice Powell the public should
assert or the review that he expressed
at least the the view that the public
ought to assert meaningful control over
the political process and there's a
contrary view the contrary view is the
public's a dangerous enemy and it has to
be controlled for its own good
course the way you control children like
you don't let a three-year-old run
across the street the first view is the
rhetorical view the second view is the
view that's actually held and you can
see that it's actually held when a
crisis of democracy erupts and the
unwashed masses begin to try to enter
into the political arena and have to be
somehow repressed either by force as in
the Red Scare or by other means in order
to overcome the crisis of democracy well
with regard to the media play a big role
in this and with regard to the media too
there is a standard view the standard
view for example is expressed again by
justice Powell and same discussion when
he claims that it's the crucial role of
the media to affect the societal purpose
of the First Amendment that is to allow
the public to assert control of the
political process standard view was also
expressed by Judge Gurfein in an
important decision the Pentagon Papers
decision when he permitted the New York
Times to publish the Pentagon Papers and
he said we have a cantankerous press an
obstinate press a ubiquitous press and
it must be suffered by those in
authority in order to preserve the even
greater values of freedom of expression
and the right of the people to know
that's one view that's the standard view
and given that view we then have a
debate the debate is over whether the
quit over whether the media have gone
too far in their defiance of Authority
and their adversarial stance the
right-wing claims they've gone too far
they're overcome by a liberal bias we've
got to do something about it
the Liberals as in the trilateral
commission or in fact agree they in the
same study they say that the media
threatened government authority by their
adversarial stance and they've got to be
curved
if they can't curb themselves the
government is going to move in to curve
curb them the executive director of
Freedom House Leonard Sussman asked
whether free institutions must be a must
free institutions be overthrown by the
very freedom they sustain rhetorical
question meaning we got to do something
about
this excess freedom that the press is
using to attack the government he was
writing about the Freedom House study of
the coverage of the Tet Offensive which
became a sort of a classic allegedly
showing that the press lost the war in
Vietnam by unfair criticism of the
government during the Tet Offensive it's
an interesting if there's no time to
talk about it I may try to get back to
it if not maybe get through the
discussion very interesting study was
total fraud falsified the data you know
whole thing was faked when you actually
correct the errors it turns out that the
press that the real charge of Freedom
House was that the press although
completely supportive of the government
policy and working completely within the
framework of government propaganda
nevertheless was too pessimistic they
said they didn't tell you by what
standards it was too pessimistic the
obvious standard is to compare it with
say internal US intelligence assessments
which we have thanks to the Pentagon
Papers and it turns out the press was
more optimistic than US intelligence
because they were believing the public
statement they know about the private
statements so Freedom House's complaint
reduces to the fact that the press
though those totally supportive of the
propaganda didn't do it in an upbeat
enough fashion I wouldn't have surprised
George Orwell that that should be the
criticism of the press produced by an
organization called Freedom House but
that's become the that's become the
standard since everyone refers to that
as the study that proves that the press
was too adversarial well that's the
debate then then the defenders of the
press say no we're not through adversary
or maybe we are too adversarial but you
got to tolerate us even though we're
cantankerous and so on that's
essentially the issue well outside of
that debate between those who say the
press is too adversarial and must be
curbed and those who say well yes the
presses can't anchor isn't impossible
but we just have to suffer that
manageress of freedom outside the
spectrum of that debate which
constitutes virtually the entire
mainstream discussion virtually the
entire discussion
outside the debate there is another
position the other position challenges
the factual consumption that's taken for
granted in the debate according to this
alternative view the media do indeed
fulfill a societal purpose but a very
different one their societal purpose is
to inculcate and defend the economic and
social and political agenda of the
privileged groups that dominate the
domestic society and they do this in all
sorts of ways they do it by selection of
topics by distribution of concern by the
way they frame issues by filtering of
information by emphasis and tone by
simple fabrication sometimes but
crucially by the bounding of debate to
make sure that it doesn't go outside of
certain limits the bounding both in the
news columns and in the opinion columns
because of course the news columns
themselves embody all sorts of
assumptions and ideological
presuppositions and so on to the
according to this alternative view to
the extent that there is a liberal bias
it serves primarily to bound thinkable
thought that is to instill the
unchallengeable assumptions which in
fact reflect this rather narrow elite
consensus so the liberal bias performs a
real function it says thus far and no
further as far as you can go and I go as
far how far I go is still accepting the
basic presuppositions as unchallengeable
now within those bounds there's ample
controversy and it reflects the tactical
divisions among elites over how to
achieve generally shared aims but these
limits are very rarely transcendent so
the media thus function in accordance
with what my co-author Edward Herrmann
and I have called a propaganda model in
a recent book that's another view well
the property propaganda model has a lot
of predictions has a lot of predictions
about how the press is going to behave
but it also has a further prediction the
further prediction is that no matter how
well confirmed the propaganda model is
it cannot be taken seriously and
therefore must be effectively excluded
from mainstream discussion
that actually follows from the model
itself the reason is that the model if
you think it through the model rejects
certain principles that are serviceable
to power that is it falls outside the
spectrum defined by the presupposition
that the media are adversarial and
cantankerous perhaps excessively so now
that presupposition is a useful one it's
serviceable to the interests of
established institutions to believe that
what you're reading is actually
criticism if it's in fact support that's
a technique that's a sophisticated
technique of indoctrination and of
course it's very serviceable to the
media themselves nice to think that
you're you know pride yourself on being
an independent that courageous adversary
of power and since those assumptions are
serviceable they're going to be upheld
according to the propaganda model and no
serious challenge will be permitted
so that prediction indeed is very
readily confirmed the propaganda model
has never taken seriously it can't be
considered notice that the propaganda
model has a rather disconcerting
featured to it plainly as a matter of
logic it's either valid or invalid if
it's invalid you can dismiss it if it's
valid you must dismiss it because it's
saying the wrong thing so one way or
another it's got to be dismissed by its
very nature and notice that truth is no
defense it's very much like the
traditional doctrine of seditious libel
the doctrine that it's you can't it's
libelous it's a crime to criticize state
authorities because that undermines
power doctrine it runs up to pretty
modern times and truth was never a
defense against the dish's libel in fact
truth simply heightened the enormous
enormity of the crime of calling
authority into disrepute and the same is
true here well of course the basic the
basic questions are factual are the
standard assumptions correct that is is
it true that the press is independent
cantankerous adversarial maybe
excessively so or are the assumptions of
the propaganda model correct that's
factual question
and that's the main topic but I'm barely
going to be able to get into it but
before though I won't try to really you
know no no hope in a few minutes of
providing real evidence one way or
another let me just talk a little bit
about the the way you would deal with
this problems of methodological
questions first notice three comments
one the propaganda model has a certain
prior plausibility to it that is if
you'd simply accept uncontroversial
free-market assumptions quite
uncontroversial assumptions about how
society works your let almost
automatically to the propaganda model
you can see that pretty simply simply
ask yourself what the media are now
notice here I'm talking about what some
might call the agenda-setting media the
media that set the frame that others
adapt to and that's pretty narrow group
it's primarily the New York Times in the
Washington Post and the three television
channels and a couple of others it's not
much else those set the framework that
everyone else pretty well adapts to
within anything like the mainstream so
we're talking about the agenda-setting
media and ask yourself what they are
well what they are is very large
corporations in fact they're integrated
with often owned by even larger
conglomerates now like other businesses
they have a product that they sell to a
market the market is advertisers other
businesses and the product is audiences
the media don't finance themselves on
their audiences in fact the audiences
are usually a loss more you subscribe
the more the newspaper loses money and
of course the television set you know
they might anything when you turn it on
they make their money from advertisers
advertising rates go up if you have a
the right kind of audience instantly a
relatively privileged audience raises
advertising rates so what the media are
just as an institution is major
corporations selling relatively
privileged audiences to other businesses
well what would you expect to come out
of such a system you expect to come out
something that reflects the interests of
the sellers the
and the product wouldn't be very
surprising in fact it would be amazing
if it weren't true quite apart from that
there are many other things pressing in
the same direction there are after all
centers of power in the society the
state the corporate sector others and
they can impose punishments for things
go wrong and we will offer rewards if
things go right you gain by adapting to
them less costly and so on
furthermore the top managerial positions
in the media editors and colonists and
so on
if you make it into those positions
you're part of the privileged elite part
of the very top in fact though that's
where your associations are and your
perceptions and your friends and people
you play golf with and everything else
and it wouldn't be very surprising again
if you reflected the same interests and
it goes on if you think through we
discuss this in our book a lot but if
you think through it there are just many
pressures which lead immediately to the
assumption that the propaganda model is
highly plausible even without any
evidence it's at least it's got prior
plausibility in fact it would be rather
surprising if it weren't true on
uncontroversial assumptions that's point
one point two is it has a lot of elite
advocacy that's what I started with
pointing out that it represents a
position that intellectual elites have
thought the media ought to observe and
the whole system of education and so on
ought to serve that's the position since
the 17th century probably the dominant
position it's necessary to manufacture
consent for the general good because of
the stupidity the average man and so on
we have to put aside these democratic
dogmatism so we have a position that has
prior plausibility and elite advocacy
and a third point is it's generally
accepted by the public there is very
striking that the debate over the media
is determined by the intellectuals and
they're the most indoctrinated sector of
the society and for them the only debate
is over whether the meteor to
adversarial or not but there are polls
you ask the public what do you think
about the media and the poll public
generally thinks the media are too
conformist
and to subordinate the power in other
words they automatically accept
something like the propaganda mode so
here we have three facts a position that
has prior plausibility a lead advocacy
and rather general public support well
that doesn't prove that it's valid of
course but it does suggest that it ought
to be part of the discussion it's not
part of the discussion exactly as the
model predicts now by now turning the
factual matter there are by now
thousands of pages of documentation
detailed close documentation on the
propaganda model and it's been tested in
just about every conceivable way it
subjected to the harshest tests we can
think of I think by now it's one of the
best confirmed theses of the social
sciences if there's any serious
challenge to it I've never seen it it's
generally just ignore it or else
caricatured so what you have is this
very well confirmed thesis not proven
very well confirmed thesis no serious
challenge to it to my knowledge it has
prior plausibility the model is
plausible and on controversial
assumptions advocated by elites
generally supported by the public but
it's not part of the discussion exactly
in accord with its predictions it's off
the agenda well the next task and the
interesting one would be to look at
actual details as I say there's plenty
of things you can look at in print and
deed thousands of pages and more coming
out and I'm not going to I almost
hesitate to give examples because
they're misleading any set of examples
will be misleading because I think it's
predictions are essentially universally
confirmed with only statistical error so
giving examples is misleading because
you might argue plausibly that the
examples are not properly selected I'd
be a reasonable response and that's why
you have to look at a range of tests to
make sure they are properly selected
like let the people who think that the
media are adversarial pick their own
grounds
that's the harshest test that the model
can face so let them pick the grounds
well they've picked their grounds things
like the coverage the Tet Offensive and
so on and it turns out that everything
you go to Tet Offensive
Watergate iran-contra hearings you take
a look at them they show precisely the
subvert subservience of the press to
establish power compare paired
historical examples from in history
doesn't run controlled experiments but
it runs things that are reasonably close
for example you find similar times and
similar periods when a true that you can
find atrocities of roughly the same
scale carried out by official enemies or
by ourselves and our clients and look at
the comparative coverage or good deeds
like elections carried out by our
clients and our enemies and look at the
comparative coverage all of these tests
and in fact every other one I've ever
been able we've ever been able to
concoct leads to the same conclusion the
propaganda model is quite valid as a
very good first approximation to the way
of a media function just to give a few
examples and I stress again they're
misleading because they're few take say
the question of freedom of press
that's a picket because it's obviously a
matter that the press is naturally much
concerned about and in fact the press
has been very much concerned about
freedom of the press and the last deck
let's just keep to the last decade in
the last decade there's been plenty of
material in the press about freedom of
the press mainly in Latin America and
ask your friends to name one newspaper
in Latin America that has raised freedom
of press issues which newspaper in Latin
America has been suppressed unfairly by
a state and therefore we have to defend
it well you know 99 people out of 100
will name la prensa in Nicaragua and the
reason they will name it is because
there have been massive coverage of the
tribulations of La Prensa and Nicaragua
there was a study by in Harper's
Magazine by Francisco Goldman a media
analyst who found that the New York
Times alone was giving something like 5
references a month that's more than one
a week to the tribulations of La Prensa
and Nicaragua that's
probably more coverage than all freedom
of the press issues throughout the rest
of the world combined probably much more
in fact well that's an interesting
choice we can take a look at it
not not only coverage but also
enthusiastic support I mean Lee for
example in 1986 in June 1986 there was a
interesting series of events the World
Court condemned the United States for
its unlawful use of force and violation
of treaties in its war against Nicaragua
and called upon the United States to
desist from these crimes Congress
responded to this by voting a hundred
million dollars in aid to increase to
accelerate the unlawful use of force the
Reagan administration announced that
this is for real this is a real war and
there was enthusiastic coverage that the
world Court decision was simply
dismissed as an annoying bit of nonsense
Peter ignored or falsified but anyway
dismissed it's the quick that was the
criminal not the United States the in
response to this virtual declaration of
war as the Reagan administration
described it the Nicaraguan government
suspended La Prensa and that led the
virtual hysteria in the United States
the Neiman fellows that journalism
fellows at Harvard off immediately gave
the owner of La Prensa Violeta Chamorro
an award the Washington Post had a big
editorial saying she deserves ten awards
no that's a newspaper of Valor and that
was the head of the that was the heading
the Murray Kempton the left liberal
columnist in the New York Review issued
a plea to people to provide funds for La
Prensa to keep its equipment going that
those funds could be added to the rather
substantial CIA subvention till the
prints ever since 1979 and on and on
well
what is La Prensa the prince has an
interesting newspaper is probably unique
in history it's often believed that La
Prensa is the newspaper that
courageously opposed this the Somoza
dictatorship and if you read the press
that's what you would believe well it
does have the same name as that
newspaper but that's about where it ends
in 1980 the right after the tendinous
tea revolution the owners of La Prensa
fired the editor and 80% of the staff
left with him because the staff and the
editor refused to support their Pro
contra policy well the editor and the
staff formed another newspaper on the
wave of the audio and if a newspaper is
constituted of its editor and its staff
that's the old La Prensa if a newspaper
is constituted of the money that's
behind it well of course the new the
princess the old la princess who just
decide how to decide know what a
newspaper is is it the staff and the
editor or is it the owners and the
equipment this you'll never read about
but it's a fact now the new la prensa
supports the overthrow of the government
by foreign power and does it quite
openly and it's funded by the foreign
power that is trying to overthrow the
government now that's pretty unusual in
fact I can't think of any remote
parallel in history the Western
democracies so for example during the
Second World War
England did not permit Nazi Germany to
put to fund and run a major newspaper in
London and the United States did not
permit Japan say to dominate you know to
invest in and run a major newspaper
coming out of New York in fact may not
be oh that far England and the United
States imposed harsh censorship they
wouldn't even let tiny little dissident
newspapers go through the mails or
appear and so on there's no power
there's no remote parallel in Western
history to this as far as I can see this
incidentally is never mentioned in media
commentary well nevertheless a true
civil libertarian will defend La Prensa
from harassment even though this is
unique in human history this
fact because of your real civil
libertarian you think that the United
States should have allowed Japan and
Germany to dominate the American media
during the Second World War
you're a real civil libertarian but we
now ask why and that we now make the
obvious question I mean we asked whether
the you know the great excitement
virtual hysteria of American
intellectuals over La Prensa is reflects
their libertarian passions or whether
it's because they believe or whether
it's because they're serving power as a
propaganda model predicts that's a fair
question and there's a test there's an
obvious test and we all know how to
apply it it's a test that we apply all
the time when we look at our enemies so
for example suppose you take a look at
the productions of the East German Peace
group or the World Peace Council which
is sort of communist front organization
you read their publicity there and
you'll see that they have a lot of
criticisms the United States often very
valid criticisms in fact their critical
discussion of repression in the United
States and in u.s. dependencies not only
is often valid but it's often the kind
of thing that's not reported here well
do we honor them for that no of course
not we regard them with contempt and the
reason is because we apply a very simple
and obvious test we ask what do they say
about the repression and atrocities for
which they're responsible whether they
say about Soviet repression and
atrocities and as soon as we find out
the answer to that question we just
simply dismiss them with contempt
rightly you begin by talking about your
own responsibility and then sort of you
know on a footnote somewhere you can
talk about the bad things done by other
guys at least if you regard yourself as
a moral agent you know somebody worthy
of minimal respect and attention we
understand that in the case of our
enemies and we might have enough honesty
to apply the same test to ourselves so
let's try it we can now apply the test
we have this tremendous libertarian
passion over La Prensa the first
newspaper in history to be funded by a
foreign power calling for the overthrow
of the government
in which it appeared in which it's
published and remember this is not a
major power it's not like the United
States which was never under threat
during the Second World War
there's a poor third-world country which
is barely able to survive the attack of
the superpower so that we have that and
we can ask how the same press has
reacted to other examples of repression
during the same period in fact in the
same area well there are test cases so
let's try a few let's take out Salvador
right nearby except the US client there
once was an independent press in El
Salvador two small newspapers
electronica on El Independiente two
small newspapers they were not supported
by a foreign power trying to overthrow
the government they were not
particularly left-wing they were
independent run by businessmen they sort
of challenged the distribution of power
you know they said maybe we should have
some land reform or something like that
well they're not around anymore they're
not around because the government that
we armed fun train and support centered
security forces to destroy them one
newspaper was eliminated by the simple
device of taking an editor and a
photojournalist who were in a son
Salvador restaurant taking them out
security forces went in took them
outside cut him to pieces with machetes
and left them in a ditch at that point
the owner fled that took care of one
newspaper the second newspaper too
little harder took several bombings
three assassination attempts on the
editor
finally the army surrounded the premises
with tanks and then broke in and smashed
the place up and destroyed it they had
previously a machine-gunning attack had
killed a newsboy at that point the
editor fled that took care of the second
newspaper
well that was eight years ago so we can
now ask how much attention did that
receive that's an example of a violation
of freedom of the press little more
severe than the harassment of La Prensa
well doesn't answer to that you can
check the New York Times for example it
has never received one word of mention
in the New York Times news columns it
has never received one editorial mention
in all of these years and the same is
true the other media it simply doesn't
matter
these are atrocities committed by our
clients the guys we pay and trained to
do that sort of thing so all of a sudden
they are concerned for freedom of the
press disappears
or let's take another us client in fact
the major u.s. client Israel which
receives by far the major US aid and is
again not a small country under attack
by a superpower well here here - history
has set up some interesting tests the
same at exactly the same time that
Nicaragua suspended La Prensa after the
virtual declaration of war in violation
of the World Court proceedings at the
very same time Israel closed down closed
down permanently to Jerusalem newspapers
Arab newspapers of course closed down to
Jerusalem newspapers on the charge that
the security forces had claimed that
they were supported by a terrorist group
by a hostile group well that went all
the way to the Supreme Court and Supreme
Court judge that that was legitimate
because in it as it explained in its
judgment no state will ever permit a
business no matter how legitimate it is
that's supported by hostile elements and
although we have freedom of speech in
Israel it does not extend to activities
that might threaten the security of the
state
well how much cover that's much more
severe than what happened in a laprincia
case how much coverage did that get well
actually that did get one mention in the
US press it was mentioned in a letter of
mine in the Boston Globe commenting on
the hypocrisy of the Niemen fellows
notice that the they did not give a
prize to these editors in fact that was
never even reported after the Central
America Peace Accords la prensa was
opened the week right at the time it was
opened Israel closed a Nazareth
newspaper that's inside Israel closed a
Nazareth newspaper permanently on
grounds that it had it was supported
again by hostile elements the editor
again went to Supreme Court pleaded that
everything had appeared in the newspaper
passed through a censorship that was
disregarded on the grounds that if the
state says it's supported by hostile
elements that's all that's required you
never need any evidence when the state
comes along and says security reasons
the courts just accept it
they also closed
a news office and Nablus on the grounds
that the editor who would our event who
was already in jail in fact he was in
jail for having alleged not without
charge without legal charge on the claim
that he had contact with hostile
elements his wife had been running a
newspapers claimed that she'd maintained
those contacts they closed the press
office
well how much coverage did that get in
the u.s. press answered as far as I can
find zero in both cases well I hear to
hear some real controlled experiments
that history was kind enough to set up
for us I picked the week of the
suspension of the prints on the week of
the opening of La Prensa I picked a case
and I'll Salvador just to round it off
let's take our other client state
Guatemala and let's come up to more
recent times Guatemala we the United
States enthusiastically supported a vast
outbreak of terror and violence in
Guatemala in the early 80s the
Reaganites were positively passionate in
their enthusiasm for this maybe a
hundred thousand people were slaughtered
something like that maybe something
roughly that neighborhood however after
sufficient massacre had been carried out
they had what's called a democratic
election and they're supposed to be a
democracy in Guatemala that's what they
tell us well one of the piss period of
us-backed slaughter they didn't have any
censorship the problems the press were
taken care of simply by murdering
journalists about 50 journalists were
murdered including you know television
journalists right in the middle of
broadcast and so on and for some reason
you didn't need any censorship when that
was going on in fact I was never barely
discussed you find bare mention of it in
the press well after the return of
democracy which we pride ourselves on
one of the editors who had fled and was
living in Mexico decided to return and
he opened a small newspaper about a year
ago last February called la epoca again
it wasn't calling for the overthrow the
government wasn't supported by a foreign
power it was just a kind of a left
liberal journal small left liberal
journal when he came back to Guatemala
there were immediately death threats
from the death squads which are just
adjunct to the security forces
warning him that he was either going to
be killed or flee he wasn't allowed to
run that newspaper he nevertheless made
ahead and the newspaper published a
couple of issues and then in July 15
armed men broke into the offices fire
bombed them kidnapped the night watchman
and destroyed the premises the next day
the editor
Brian Barrera held a press conference to
which no one came except some people
from the European press and said that
plainly there's no possibility for a
free expression in Guatemala he then
received another death threat warning
and he better get out of the country
he'd be killed he was taken to the
airport by a European ambassador to make
sure that he could get out alive and he
fled back to Mexico
well how much coverage that get answer
zero nothing in the New York Times
nothing in the Washington Post
that's just last year now it's not that
they didn't know about it we know
perfectly well that they knew about it
first of all because it was on the
international it was on the wires and so
on and so forth but also because they
themselves referred to it obliquely
later about a month later there was an
article in The New York Times on some
cultural conference in Guatemala back in
the arts pages and the correspondent
went there had some remark buried in
there about la epoca the tripping point
is just doesn't matter I mean that's
it's not just harassment and suppression
it's it's you know destruction and
physical disruption and murder but it's
carried out by our clients so it doesn't
matter well those are the kinds of
things you find when you look that's the
end of this alternative views but Noam
Chomsky we'll be back next time and
he'll conclude his speech and take
questions from the audience we'd like to
thank Paula Kowski and Jim Dickerson who
provided us with the tape of the speech
of Noam Chomsky as it was recorded in
Eau Claire Wisconsin and also lore
