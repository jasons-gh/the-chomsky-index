so I was interested in one comment you
made about kind of conscious and
unconscious processes and how the kind
of a functional aspect of your proposal
is more or less non conscious whereas
there's a conscious component which is
like our everyday lived experience which
is not kind of gonna be able to
introspect upon this functional system
so I was wondering more on a
philosophical know what how exactly
we're supposed to think about phenomenal
experience and kind of conscious
experience in terms of its relationship
to functional relationships like you are
specifically your linguistic proposal
but then also other domain specific
proposals like perception there are
those who don't believe that perception
is amove is you know module modular
domain specific that it's embodied or
something to that effect
so I'm gonna feed any proposed
reflections on this kind of research now
and how this relates to kind of our
phenomenal lived experience well it's a
visual perception which is relatively
uncontroversial I'll take the one
example that I gave the rigidity
principle okay we when you're looking at
the sequence of the kissters gothic
presentations you perceive a rigid
object in motion you can't prevent
yourself from perceiving that that's
what you perceive period what you're
actually the stimuli that are actually
reaching your your your eyes your retina
are just a series of as few as three or
four presentations on Atticus disco you
know screen with lights of each of which
has several dots on it well you have no
way of introspecting into them your
phenomenal experience is a rigid object
in motion but the stimuli that are
the retina are a very small number of
presentations of the few dots
you can't introspect into that they in
fact it's a that's why it's a discovery
you know it's kind of like the discovery
of the chemical structure of you know
coal or something
you can't introspect into it so the
phenomenal descriptions you know that
they're useful but they're useful as
data they tell you very little about
what's going on so it's kind of like
everything else in the world where you
have data but it didn't a my show what's
going on that requires that's why you
have to take courses in physics and
chemistry and so on yeah course the data
isn't transparent and it's hard for
people to deal with but the same is true
of our conscious lives I mean we tend to
take for granted kind of like just
normal that that we can understand
everything about ourselves that we don't
understand anything about ourselves
that's the crucial step that the human
sciences really have not taken yet for
the most part that was taken in the
Natural Sciences around the 17th century
just the willingness to be puzzled about
things that look obvious like what could
be more obvious than if I let go of a
cup it goes down instead of up well you
know Galileo was willing to be puzzled
about that that's why you take physics
courses before that all you had to be
told as things are going to their
natural place and it's a big
psychological step even in studying the
external world even greater in studying
ourselves because there we sort of feel
that we know everything what's conscious
must be what there is and in this in
philosophy modern philosophy it's kind
of a principle that happen to be John
Searle who I was quoting but it's a
widely accepted principle that nothing
can be a mental process unless it's
accessible to consciousness and as I
mentioned if you look over the
intellectual history it's very hard
to find anyone who departed from this
