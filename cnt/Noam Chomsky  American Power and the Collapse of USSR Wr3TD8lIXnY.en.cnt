to noam chomsky another consequence of
the collapse of the deterrent is that
there is no space left for independent
independence and non-alignment and in
fact the non line movement essentially
collapsed at that point the one
indication of the of the collapse of
this concern is the very sharp decline
in foreign aid in the decade that
followed in the United States declined a
virtually zero there's no longer any
need for it for essentially propaganda
purposes and the effects of this were
recognized very quickly so President
mchottie of Malaysia for example pointed
out right away he said paradoxically the
greatest catastrophe for us who had
always been anti communist is the defeat
of communism the end of the Cold War has
deprived us of the only leverage we had
the option to defect now we can turn to
no one and there is furthermore no
deterrent and those fears were expressed
very clearly throughout the South the
Gulf War which followed very quickly it
was bitterly condemned throughout the
south as needless show of force designed
to demonstrate that what we say goes
recall George Bush's words as the bombs
from the missiles were falling in this
case too there's good reason to suppose
that then that there were peaceful
alternatives diplomatic alternatives
were available and is in fact good
reason to suppose that the Bush
administration was feared that they
might be become difficult to suppress
media cooperated nicely the general mood
in the south at that time was captured
rather well by Cardinal arns Cardinal
Pell other east Ahrendts of San Paulo
Brazil he said that correctly that in
the Arab countries the rich sided with
the US government while the millions of
poor condemned this military aggression
joining the
nor in a rocky opposition he could have
added throughout the third world he
continued there is hatred and fear when
will they decide to invade us and on
what pretext well the reaction of the
bombing of Serbia was very much the same
throughout the world again there's quite
compelling evidence that peaceful
options were available that might have
spared plenty of misery but it was
bitterly condemned throughout the world
even in US allies us client states like
Israel leading military analysts simply
dismissed it as a show of return to the
gunboat diplomacy of the last century
cloaked by the same his hypocrisy well
Americans are very carefully protected
from any of this we're protected from
world opinion and protected from
critical discussion so you have to
really work to find out any of these
things but we don't do ourselves any
favors by keeping you these restrictions
and we also do ourselves no favors by
ignoring the public documents that
explain very clearly the thinking of
planners about the world that they're
creating and they have overwhelming
power to create they understand very
well as we should that the world is
what's called tri-polar in economic
terms that is there are roughly
comparable centers of economic power in
Asia Europe and North America but the
world is radically unipolar in the
capacity to destroy to resort to
violence and destroy the United States
already out spends the next 15 countries
for what's called defense and defense as
always means offense and it's far ahead
in military technology and the current
plans as you all know are too sharply
increase that disparity that includes
extending the arms race into space which
means demolishing the Outer Space Treaty
that's been observed for since nineteen
sixty seven ballistic missile defense is
only a small part of this and even that
is
understood to be an offensive weapon not
a defensive weapon it's understood by
adversaries it's understood by strategic
analysts here so the RAND Corporation
for example describes the DMD as an
enabler of action not a shield a
strategic analysts say the same thing in
fact they applaud the program typically
as a means to establish us global
hegemony and they explain yeah that
that's what the world needs quoted since
I've just been warned to shut up but
it's interesting comments which have
many they just mimic many predecessors
you know all of this totally familiar
for hundreds of years they they're also
they explained very clearly that the far
broader program of militarization of
space that's also explained very clearly
and quite intelligently and perfectly
public documents no reason not to know
them the they point out that this the
Space Command that this is the natural
next step in expanding state power so
armies and then navies were established
in order to protect commercial interests
and investment and the next from it
obvious frontier is space for the same
reasons to protect commercial interest
and investment however they point out
there's gonna be a difference this time
the British had a huge Navy for that
purpose but it was possible to counter
Germany could develop a navy don't have
to talk about the consequences this case
is going to be different now this arms
race is going to have only one
competitor running and just like now and
there will be a soul hegemon the United
States is going to be so awesomely
powerful that there won't be any counter
force that's first of all necessary for
just plain technical reasons the whole
space floor system is based on
satellites and satellites are very easy
to shoot down and not like missiles as
they have to make sure that no what no
adversary has the poor man's weapon
anti-satellite weapons and that required
overwhelming dominance of space which is
understood and intended and there's
another reason the other reason is that
what they call globalization is expected
to lead to a widening divide between the
haves and have-nots that's an assessment
that's shared by us intelligent and
others notice that's contrary to the
theories that you're supposed to believe
in but it's quite in accord with
practice and it's going to be necessary
they conclude reasonably to control the
unruly elements how you do that well by
inspiring fear or by actual use of
highly destructive killing machines
launched from space laser weapons
probably nuclear-powered on a hair
trigger automated alert system which is
a virtual guarantee of what are called
normal accidents meaning the kinds of
accidents that will always take place
unpredictably in complex systems it's
recognized that these programs
significantly increase the danger of the
unimaginable catastrophe but that too is
entirely rational support important to
recognize that it's important it's
entirely rational within the framework
of prevailing institutions and ideology
the principle is that hegemony just
ranks a lot higher than survival that's
ample precedent for that right through
the Cold War easy to give examples and
well before the only difference is that
by now the stakes are far higher the
survival of the species and that's no
exaggeration well these are some of the
prospects if current tendencies persist
but there is no reason at all for this
to happen there is good news that good
news is that the reigning system of
authority is very fragile and they know
it there's a major effort right now as
you're aware to exploit the current mood
of anguish and fear in order to ram
through harsh regressive dangerous
programs militarization of space is only
one and in order to attends being used
to deflect the mass popular movements
that have been taking
shape and unprecedented and highly
encouraging ways but there's no reason
at all to succumb to those efforts
there's every reason not to there are
plenty of choices and options available
what's needed as always is a will and
dedication to pursue them professor Noam
Chomsky he teaches linguistics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and his latest book home and many is 911
