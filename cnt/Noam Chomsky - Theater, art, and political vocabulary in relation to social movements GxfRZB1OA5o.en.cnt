lots of ways to do it in fact you know
99% and 1% wasn't in the media a year
ago now it's routine discussion if
people are thinking about things in a
different way than they did before just
in a very few months of the Occupy
movement actually there's some polls on
it which maybe you've seen there was a
like a pupil which asked people has been
asking people at various times what do
you think about inequality and concern
over inequality shut up very fast after
September just from the effect of I
assume it's the effect of the Occupy
movement which has just permeated a lot
of mainstream discourse now that can be
co-opting to you know so sure powerful
systems will try to incorporate what
they see is working and turn it to their
own needs whether it's human rights or
you name it of course that's what
they'll try to do now so for example
after the 2008 election which generated
a lot of enthusiasm there was a right
after the election there was a annual
conference of the advertisers
Association whatever they call
themselves and every year they give a
prize for the best marketing campaign of
the year and that year they gave it to
Obama he beat out Apple computers and if
you take a look at the business press
right afterwards which was interesting
they quoting you know executive CEOs and
so on and they're very excited about it
they said this is a new model for how we
can behave in the to the public and in
the boardroom and so on we can use this
model that worked so well at deluding
people in the 2008 election so sure no
they don't hear an it but they learn
lessons from it the use of human rights
is quite an interesting case but it's
true of just you know like take say
there was a huge anti-nuclear movement
in the early 1980s it was like 80
demonstrations millions of people try to
get rid of nuclear weapons and the
Reagan administration cleverly co-opted
it they came out said yeah great idea
were all with you against nuclear
weapons
let's have Star Wars that's how they got
the Star Wars thing through and they
diffused the movement made it sound as
if it was opposed to nuclear weapons but
of course they're gonna do that and
tenure changed the discourse sure I mean
look I don't know what I mentioned about
the meeting with Lula we were quoting
from but it was kind of interesting so
for example this was before he was
elected and he was quite popular his if
you looked at pinion polls he was
highest in the opinion polls but he
never won an election mostly it was
because they were of corruption you know
the election was bought off the last
minute there's a huge flood of
propaganda the you know advertising and
so on but I asked him at one point did
he think he ever would be able to win an
election if there wasn't corruption and
so on
he said he didn't think would be
possible and the reason was he said what
he said is I know the mentality of the
peasant that's what I come from and when
they go into the voting booth and they
ask themselves that could somebody like
me run a country they'll say no it has
to be one of those rich white guys so
even if they want me they're gonna vote
for those other people couple years
later he won the mentality changed and
it's changed all over latin america
indigenous people you know poor people
it's just a radical change so of course
it can be done and I the kind of thing
that he took me to see in the suburb
which you mentioned this is one of the
ways in which can be done and there are
plenty of others I'm in the in Bolivia
the around the same time about ten years
ago the mobilization on the effort to
privatize water led to him
revolution in the country the first time
you know hundreds of years that the
indigenous population has been able to
enter the political arena and take over
political power that's it's kind of
interesting the way that governments are
reacting the government's and the
corporation still want to privatize
water but they learn that the Bolivian
method that is dangerous because it led
to a frankly a revolution they threw out
the big corporations and so on so what
that I was in southern Colombia recently
visiting the villages and there they
what the what the government of Colombia
is apparently trying to do is to pick
the villages off or the region's off one
at a time
so if you come into some poor remote
endangered villages and you give them a
line about how great the water will be
if we just don't buy your land up there
where the virgin forest is you can maybe
get them to accept it although
strikingly they're resisting the
organizing and resisting but these
things you know class will from the
point of view of the rich and powerful
class war never stops it's permanent
they're involved in a constant bitter
class war very self-conscious they want
everybody else not to participate but
they're always taking carrying it out
that's why they're rich and powerful
