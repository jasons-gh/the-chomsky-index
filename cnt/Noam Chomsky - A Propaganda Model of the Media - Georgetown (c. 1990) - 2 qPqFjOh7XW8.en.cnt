and it's also necessary to bear in mind
the ideological fanaticism that colors
intelligence reports quite typically
everyone I've every intelligence agency
I've ever seen and also the higher-level
interpretations of them there's a lot of
Mythology about intelligence and it's
quickly dissipated if you take the
trouble to read the declassified
documents so it's quite possible that US
intelligence actually believes what the
Ambassador is saying despite its
manifest an absurdity
well what's the meaning of these two
u.s. proposed demands demand number one
that there be no international
conference well the meaning that's
obvious the point is the whole world
outside of Israel in the United States
is in favor of a diplomatic settlement
so therefore if there is an
international conference it's just going
to mean bringing people somebody in
who's going to put pressure on for a
diplomatic settlement and therefore
there can't be a diplomatic
international conference because the
United States is opposed to a diplomatic
settlement that's the only meaning of
that of any of that now in what the
United States proposes that is direct
negotiations between Israel the PLO even
if Israel will be willing to accept the
farce in such negotiations there's no
pressures at all and therefore Israel
can say get lost if they want and that's
the end of the negotiations but if you
have an international conference it's a
problem because the rest of the world is
all interested in a settlement you won't
they would do that
so no international conference that's
point one what about point two call off
this terrorism against the State of
Israel determined in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip well there the US
position is quite straight forward if
the Intifada is brought to a halt
then matters will revert to the
situation that prevailed before at that
time the United States cheerfully
supported and lavishly funded Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and a Gaza
Strip and it's regular repression and
humiliation of the Palestinian
population and it steps towards
integration of those territories within
Israel and meanwhile the media praised
the
occupation and hail the occupiers as a
society in which moral sensitivity is a
principle of political life I'm quoting
New York Times right after the
sub-recipient massacres and that's what
we'll go back to if the Intifada is
called off well that's the meaning of
the two u.s. proposals and therefore I
guess it's kind of understandable that
they were never mentioned or printed in
the US press to my knowledge I've never
seen a single reference to them although
they're certainly there and everybody
certainly knew about them because
everyone reads The Jerusalem Post well
notice that that tends rather strongly
to support its factor a Ben's conclusion
wanted more details but there's plenty
more to support it as well well let's
turn back to December 1988 when Arafah
finally capitulated to his stern mentors
in Washington and he said the magic
words agreeing to the long-standing u.s.
demands and this stunning triumph of
American diplomacy as the press puts it
notice that up until up until December
14th including the editorials that
appeared on that day up until December
14th the editorials and news columns the
media were uniformly condemning Arafah
for his ambiguity for repeating the old
RF at hedges as in New York Times put it
and on December 15 the next day in fact
on the evening of December 14 everything
was different
Arafat had capitulated in this December
14th press conference in Geneva and
while we still naturally have to be wary
at least there's some progress that's
the story so how do we know that our
effect capitulated on December 14th well
that's easy
George Shultz appeared on television and
in his lugubrious voice announced that
RFI did capitulated so that fixes those
facts it's therefore it is so and the
media snap to attention like a trained
dog on command now an inquiry lasting
about two minutes would have sufficed to
show that at the famous
conference our thoughts words remained
as far from the US demands as they had
ever been and those differences are
quite substantive if Arafah had
capitulated and had said the magic words
then the palestinians would have
abandoned everything which is exactly
why the US government and the media now
insists that that is what has happened
that means in the world of necessary
illusion the one that works
they have abandon everything if they
ever make any demands again that shows
their backing off on their premises
which we've invented for them that was
what an inquiry of two minutes would
have shown an inquiry of 20 minutes
maybe would have shown that Arafat
basically repeated positions that he had
stated sometimes more clearly and
explicitly for the past 13 years but
throughout this period and still today
Washington has rejected that position in
December for reasons to which I'll
return in a moment
Washington decided to say that Arafah
had capitulated so therefore he had in
the world of necessary illusion the
facts in a moment let me just mention to
you something I heard last night from a
overseas phone call from a well-known
American correspondent in the television
media told me an interesting story he's
read an article on the Jay right up this
stuff and he told me that the and I kind
of check this yet but he told me that
the television stations on the evening
of December 14th did not run slots from
Geneva
you know usually what happens is a
television reporter reports something
and makes a little 90 seconds that they
send over the satellite nestra see on
the 77 o'clock news Courtney what he
told me that didn't happen in that case
rather there were live discussions
between New York New York I guess and
the reporters you know in which they
discussed it he said the reason is that
when the reporters went to the press
conference then you hear anything
different than before they knew
horrified has repeated what he always
said free
and it was just as far from the us
demands as ever so they put together
these little brief nothing statements
and we're getting ready to send them
across on the satellite when they were
informed from New York by telephone that
the State Department had announced that
things were different than what they had
seen and therefore they should kill
those stories and then since there was
no time to make up new stories and send
them across they would have to just be
interviewed live well I heard that from
a rather well-placed
television source and as I said maybe to
check it but the nice research project
for somebody well let's let's proceed I
want to I'll come back to what actually
happened that that famous discussion of
of our efforts but let's first put it
into a little bit of a little bit of
background because that's the only way
you can understand what's happened so if
you bear with me for a minute on mention
a little bit of the relevant history
let's I'm just gonna look at the
diplomacy after the 1967 war bigger
story than that but for reasons of time
let's stay there well there's an
official story about this the official
story about the diplomacy since the 1967
war is first the United States has been
pursuing the peace process now notice
there's a comment to make here notice
that that's not a fact that's a
tautology there's a tautology because
the word peace process has a very
special meaning in US political
discourse Manan dictionary that means
process leading for peace but that's not
the way the word is used like most terms
of political discourse it really has two
meanings one the actual meaning and the
other the meaning that's used for
ideological warfare now the actual
meaning of the word peace process is
process aiming towards peace the
ideological meaning and the one that's
universally used in the media and in
scholarship is that the peace process
refers to whatever the United States
happens to be doing
at the moment now that's a useful
meaning that's a useful check this out
if you like
it follows and it's impossible to find
the phrase like the United States is
undermining the peace process because
that's that's not any false it's self
contradictory you know so therefore
there's no point in saying it and notice
that you can reach that conclusion
without having to bother with the ugly
complicated world of fact where you have
to look at the documents or anything
like that you just know it's true by
definition you know like two plus two
equals four I mean domain work to figure
it out so it's very convenient usage
actually I mentioned this fact in a talk
with University of Washington in Seattle
a couple of months ago and there happens
to be a very good media project there
and somebody in the media project
weeks later saying that he'd done a
computer tech check and through the New
York Times from 1983 that was January
1989 picking out the phrase peace
process and he'd found out 850 articles
referring the peace process and there
wasn't one in which the United States
was in any way opposed to the peace
process notice again we don't get
statistical error if this is correct
that's pretty remarkable because during
the 80s the United States was deeply
committed to undermining and blocking
the peace process in Central America and
in the Middle East to mention just to
but if this brief data analysis correct
there's in one statement for that effect
and I predict that you won't find it in
the scholarly literature either so the
United States point number one one
writed states has been pursuing the
peace process but that's tautology now
point number two what about the Arabs
well official line is the Arabs have
been opposed to peace they've been
committed solely to the destruction of
Israel although there was a break in
1977 President Sadat of Egypt understood
his evil ways and he broke ranks and he
became a man of peace and now in
December 1988
maybe our
has made his first halting moves to
follow Sadat in that direction but apart
from that and of course you know our
friends saying and so on apart from that
the Arabs all are opposed to peace and
just wanna murder Jews and so on and so
forth with regard to Israel the official
line is that the Israeli Labour Party
which ruled the country up till 77
followed a policy of what the New York
Times calls healthy pragmatism and still
does but the Likud the other major
political groupings especially under the
Emir is kind of recalcitrant continuing
with the story under labor and still
today because of their healthy
pragmatism Israel makes forthcoming
offers proposes a fair peaceful
settlement but the Arabs always refused
now that's the official line endlessly
repeated over and over again well let's
break the rules and turn to the
irrelevant reality here we have a return
to the documentary record and let me
urge you to look at it first we'll begin
with Israel there happens to be as far
as I know only one detailed diplomatic
record of particularly the labor parties
includes the year 66 7 to 77 written by
a top-level Labour Party functionary of
beylin it's in Hebrew but very can
translate it's worth reading it's
detailed almost day-to-day record of
cabinet meetings of the Labour
government the basic principle to which
it keeps is stated by current president
crime Hertzog is a dove and it says the
Palestinians cannot be participants in
any way in a land that has been
consecrated through our people for
thousands of years land includes the
occupied territories and it pretty well
keeps to that now if you look you
discover that Israel has made two
diplomatic initiatives during this
period when it was governor
healthy pragmatism and none since under
labor the first diplomatic initiative
was in June 19th 1967 June 19 weeks
after the war there was a split cabinet
vote 11 to 10 and they it's what vote
was sent to the United States privately
and that's the first initiative that
proposed tentatively a settlement with
Syria and Egypt but with Israel keeping
the Gaza Strip and the no mention at all
of the West Bank no settlement Jordan
Israel keeps the Gaza Strip passively
assumed keeps the West Bank but makes a
settlement with Syria and Egypt apart
from that
Abba Eban in diplomatic dub describes
this as the most dramatic initiative in
Israel's history before or since
well that dramatic initiative West at
which notice means that keep the West
Bank in the Gaza Strip that was replaced
in August 1968 by another proposal
what's called the alone plan which is
the official labor party position up
until the present and up till recently
that has meant Israel keeps the Gaza
Strip and the Golan Heights and in those
days much of the Sinai and with regard
to the West Bank
it keeps about 40% of it about what it
needs essentially keeps everything
except the areas of heavy concentration
of Arab population problem is what they
call the demographic problem too many
Arabs in a Jewish state so is route the
ideas Israel should keep the resources
keep the territories it needs keep
access to the water and keep the markets
keep the labor force but not has to
administer the population that's the
healthy pragmatism that the New York
Times advocates those are the only two
proposals in reality now turning to the
Arabs well starting in things started to
shift in the late 60s but let's take
February 1971 not 77 February 1971
February 1971 president said out of
Egypt newly
I just become president made a offered a
full peace treaty to Israel for pastry
no reservations I'm a nationally
recognized borders meaning pre gen on 67
borders with all the structure of UN 242
guarantees right to live in peace etc
full access to the canal the Straits etc
and offering nothing to the Palestinians
Palestine as the even mentioned that
there's refugees in accordance with you
went to 42 in fact so that's proposal of
February 71 was virtually identical to
official US policy as expressed by
Secretary of State William Rogers and
the Rogers plan shortly before a couple
weeks later Jordan made a similar
proposal Israel responded the Sadat's
proposal it accepted it officially as a
genuine peace offer and refused it in
internal discussion we read that they
refused it because they felt if they
held out they could get a better
territorial settlement the United States
in the United States there was a split
symbolized by Rogers and Kissinger with
each representing major interests and
conceptions the split was over whether
to accept the diplomatic settlement now
offered fully by Egypt in terms of
official US policy or whether to reject
it
Kissinger's approach as he explains in
his memoirs was to push for what he
called stalemate meaning keeping things
frozen and since then he went out in the
internal bureaucratic conflict and since
then stalemate has prevailed and still
does
well that was February 1971 I stressed
not 77 not when Sadat fluted Israel and
made a less forthcoming offer than in
February 1971 because in his 77 proposal
in Jerusalem which established him as an
official man of peace he expressed what
by then was the general international
consensus that there should be a
Palestinian state in the occupied
territories I'll come back in a moment
to why the second
one is permitted to enter history the
reason why the first one is not
permitted to enter history is obvious
tells the wrong story says the United
States was opposed to the peace process
and since that's a logical contradiction
it must be that the events didn't happen
so therefore they never mentioned except
them footnote in some arcane monograph
somewhere and they didn't happen for
this perfectly obvious reason
well that was February 71 let's move on
to January 1976 in January 1976 the UN
Security Council debated a resolution
calling for a full-scale political
settlement I'm the internationally
recognized pre June 67 borders with
recognition of the rights of all states
in the region their right to live in
peace and security
territorial guarantees security
guarantees in fact all of the wording of
UN 242 explicitly verbatim not
paraphrases but verbatim and the
Palestinians but now UN 242 extended in
terms of the broad international
consensus of the mid-70s to include a
Palestinian state in the West Bank in
the Gaza Strip
notice that that resolution incorporates
UN 242 but now extends it to include a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip the UN 242 was a
resolution to talk about a settlement
among states it was totally
rejectionists offered nothing to the
Palestinians well I was January 1976 who
was for it well the resolution was
introduced by Syria Jordan and Egypt the
three confrontation States it was openly
backed by the PLO publicly and openly
backed by the PLO in fact according to
hon Hertzog now president and UN
representative for ambassador for Israel
according to him it was prepared by the
PLO there we can just take Israel's word
for it but the fact that they supported
it is not anybody's worried that's on
the public record and you can read it in
the New York Times the United States
vetoed the resolution so it's down the
memory hole
exist because if it exists it shows the
United States was blocking the peace
process which is a logical contradiction
so therefore it doesn't exist either and
in fact when you look at the reports of
the peace process books about the peace
process you know articles by Thomas
Friedman a New York Times about the
peace process these things aren't there
because they don't exist
the can't logical contradiction in fact
from 1976 there have been repeated
offers I'm gonna run through the details
there have been repeated initiatives
from the Arab states from Arafat from
the PLO calling for negotiations leading
the mutual recognition it's all down a
memory hole sometimes they were very
sometimes they were explicit that's all
been on the memory hole does mat exist
the New York Times which has a special
responsibility remember it's the
newspaper of record it creates history
history is what's in the New York Times
archives no not what's in the San
Francisco herald-examiner archives
that's not where historians go have
archives
so therefore the San Francisco Herald
examiner is able to reprint to print
these facts but the New York Times has a
much heavier responsibility on its
shoulders and then I haven't print them
or even allow letters to appear which
refer to them so for example repeatedly
for take one case in April May 1984 when
our thought was running around Europe
and Asia making very public statements
calling for a negotiations leading the
mutual recognition The Times
refused to print to report the facts and
refused to reprint letters referring to
it and as even somebody who has a letter
from the foreign editor The Times
explaining why his letter is not being
published that ban on admitting those
facts continued in the New York Times
until March 1988 when the first hint was
allowed come back to that any now
throughout these years more and more
proposals or initiatives recall that
this is just the world of reality and
therefore irrelevant in the world of
necessary
illusion nothing happened except Sadat
in 1977 and maybe RF out in December
1988 if you can take him seriously well
let's turn to the United States now
keeping to the world is irrelevant
reality in 1969 December 1969 Secretary
of State William Rogers proposed the
Rogers plan which was official US policy
know is very much like this about
propose a virtually identical with the
February 71 said not proposal what I
just mentioned
as I said Kissinger was then National
Security Advisor with opposed he was in
favor of stalemate maintaining things
the way they were there was a kind of a
logic behind it and the logic was the
Nixon Doctrine Israel's what Secretary
of Layard Secretary of Defense Laird
called cop on the beat a local cop on
the beat to represent US interests in
the region it was becoming a US client
state worldwide there was a kind of
logic Israel was what's called a
strategic asset therefore we keep things
the way they are furthermore it was
assumed that there was no big problem
from the Arabs intelligence in one of
its quite standard in fact knew your
uniform colossal failures assumed that
the Arabs couldn't figure out which
ended a gun to hold war is not the Arabs
game as the head of Israeli military
intelligence put it
Yehoshua Karka be then a super-big hawk
now a big Doug because he changed these
tactical assessments and on that
assumption that war is not the Arabs
game it didn't really matter much what
kind of bluster they carried out I mean
they get maneuver in the Sinai if they
wanted do all that stuff but you don't
take it seriously Henry Kissinger was
being bombarded with reports from the
u.s. ambassadors in the field and from
the American oil companies and so on
explaining that his refusal rejection of
any diplomatic options was going to lead
the war since oh that's just gonna be
forced to go to war but everybody
laughed because war is not the Arab game
well along came the 1973 war and
surprisingly war world
the Arabs game in fact it was a very
serious affair and the United States
understands that states do understand
violence maybe not much else but they
certainly understand violence of the
efficacy of violence and you could see
that Israel's capacity to dominate the
region by force was not so clear Egypt
had to be taken seriously as a result US
policy adjusted in 1973 u.s. and that
adjusted to the obvious fallback
position since Egypt wasn't just a
basket case and couldn't be ignored we
should therefore take it seriously we
should accept Sadat's longstanding
offers to attorney gypped into a US
client state and we should exclude Egypt
from the conflict Egypt is the major
Arab military force the major arab
deterrent if we can exclude it from the
conflict then israel is free with
mounting US support to move to integrate
the occupied territories and to attack
its northern neighbor that's Camp David
the meaning of what happened from 1973
to 1978 is precisely that its efforts to
exclude Egypt from the conflict so that
Israel is then free to do exactly those
things that was obvious of time I should
say and it's now conceded in retrospect
that that's what happened but what else
could happen and it's just in the logic
of the situation think about it this
plane I presume that when the secret
documents are Declassified 28 30 years
we'll see that people were thinking
about anyway even if they weren't
perfectly transparent that that was a
logical situation as I say it's now well
then comes
I don't have to bother with the people
you know anything about the record
you'll know just what happened us
support for Israel shot up reached about
50% of total world aid in the late
Carter early Reagan period Israeli
attacks on Lebanon increased there was
invasion in 1978 there was an extend
extension of the heavy bombardment in
1979 an ad finally an outright invasion
in 82 the United States supported that
invasion the Republicans supported it
enthusiastically the Democrats supported
it ecstatically there was almost total
support for what the New York Times
called the liberation of Lebanon at the
time but the consequences were not what
was expected
first Israel failed on the ground
militarily very crucial fact which the
Israeli military is well aware of they
were unable to displace Syria the Syrian
army from fixed positions they won the
technological war in win the ground war
and they know it they couldn't pierce
the Beirut Damascus highway for weeks
very well aware of that they were unable
to establish what defense minister
Sharan called the new order in Lebanon
and in the subsequent period they were
actually driven out of Southern much of
southern Lebanon by quite unanticipated
local resistance the Costas got to pie
and they had to pull out of everything
except that they call their security
zone
well again States understand violence
and the United States adjusted once
again it was however assumed that at
least the occupied territories could be
controlled by force
maybe war wasn't the Arabs game and
maybe those crazy Shiites and Lebanon
duels are your things but we don't have
to worry about the people in the
occupied territory resistance do wasn't
their game that was the assumption well
December 1987 came along let me
instantly go back to why Sadat's offer
in 1977 can enter history see in 1977 so
that could be a man of peace because US
policy had changed since US policy had
changed it was possible to recognize
since we're trying to exclude Egypt from
the conflict it's possible to recognize
that Sadat is offering to be excluded
conflict therefore set-off became a man
of peace on the other hand before u.s.
policy had changed in 1971 it couldn't
be making those proposals because the
United States subjecting to them that we
didn't make that's the reason why the
official story is his trip to Jerusalem
was winning made himself a man of peace
well coming back to 1987 then we get in
December the Intifada and over the next
couple of months we get rising violence
and refreshing it but failure the
violence is I mean making life very
miserable for people and it's very
brutal and to tell you about that but it
hasn't succeeded in putting it down so
there's got to be a policy judgment or
at least the beginnings of the policy
adjustment and along with the beginnings
of policy adjustment call an outcome an
opening in the Free Press
so now by early 1988 it begins to be
possible to concede that the
Palestinians are making various kinds of
offers in fact the kind of in making
food since certainly since January 76
and as I say in March 1988 the New York
Times finally allowed little peek at it
well 3 1988 the all of this continues
the violence is failing to stop the
uprising therefore there's more and more
openings the opie efforts diplomatic
efforts were also becoming more
insistent in November 1988 the
Palestinian National Council met in
Algiers and the PMC did propose
something new namely they declared a
Palestinian state that's what they call
the crowning achievement of the meeting
however that's totally unacceptable to
the United States so therefore it's off
the media agenda that's not discuss they
were also willing to discuss some
modalities for achieving it and that
begins to relate to a US government
interest so therefore that's allowed to
be on the agenda and there's some
recognition that those things are going
on but we inadequate RF went to stop him
and repeat at the same points still
inadequate he
to come to Geneva to New York to speak
at the UN General Assembly meeting the
State Department refused instantly there
was virtually unanimous approval of this
accept on technical grounds everyone
agreed that the PLO had not said the
magic words I mean all the way up to
Anthony Lewis still the old are up that
head just not saying it yet you gotta be
harsher the refusal to allow the UN to
meet in Geneva was flatly illegal caused
a big uproar around the world the UN met
in Geneva where our HUD repeated what he
had been saying all along the United
States still rejected it and carries us
up to December 14th by this point the
United States was in in a totally
untenable position the US government
position was being very broadly
supported at home in fact virtually
unanimously but the United States
government was becoming an object of
international ridicule you can't control
the world as easily as he can control
the Free Press and the intellectual
community it was becoming an object of
international ridicule the not only well
first of all because of the refusal to
allow our effort to speak in New York we
call that the reason given the reason
was it would be a security threat to the
United States it's interesting that
everybody accepted that nobody asked you
know what's he gonna do I'm gonna hijack
a taxicab or you know take over the
Pentagon I mean exactly what's the
security for it but the point is nothing
is too absurd to be accepted if it
satisfies needs however outside the
United States you can't get away with
that so easily the State Department was
in an untenable position therefore they
made the natural move of any great power
especially a super you know the dominant
world superpower the one that controls
the world information system they simply
decided to announce that RFI to
capitulate and accepted our terms that
was the only way out and then comes the
delaying action which I described now
final factual question to look at is
what happened on December 14th of the
famous press conference
well it's very clear as I say it'll take
you two minutes to figure it out if you
can bother to check the State Department
had articulated three explicit demands
and they were in writing in words read
them in the New York Times in the
Washington Post and verbatim it said
these words must be stated verbatim
without qualification those are the
magic words and the three things were
one acceptance of UN 242 without
qualifications to acceptance of Israel's
right to exist and the government
insisted that that was the crucial one
fact
National Security Adviser Powell
actually went on television every
newspaper and said that's the crucial
one you got to repeat that and the third
was renunciation of terrorism sorry
rejection of terrorism that was the word
rejection of terrorism without
qualifications and our thoughts still as
of December 13th had not met those three
demands and again the far as I know the
whole American press virtually I mean
one exception that I saw was in fact a
column by William raspberry and the
Washington Post
but that apart I couldn't find one
exception including Anthony Lewis and
everyone else for saying still withhold
our I thought hedge he's got to accept
these three positions well let's look
into them
first accept UN 242 without
qualifications
what's the qualification the
qualification of the PLO has accepted
you into 43 years in fact it endorsed it
as I said already in January 1976 13
years earlier in the very words of UN
242 but it had always added a
qualification the qualification was it
called for those UN resolutions which
talk about the right of national
self-determination of Palestinians
called for a Palestinian state as
explicitly in January 76 and that
qualification is unacceptable what did
Allah fide say in Geneva
he repeated UN 242 with
the same qualification explicitly they
said we accept the right of all states
in the region to live in peace including
the new state of Palestine and Israel
Sam qualification in fact it's a less
clear endorsement of UN 242 than in
January 76 because then the PLO
supported the actual wording of 242
whereas here he just paraphrased it so
the first claim that Arafat said the
magic words and that one is just flat
false what about the right to exist
nothing there Arafat did not endorse
Israel's abstract right to exist and
that's an interesting proposal the
phrase right to exist was invented by
Henry Kissinger in 1975 in an effort to
block the danger of a political
settlement and because he knew perfectly
well that nobody's ever going to accept
the abstract right to exist of Israel or
any other state there's no such concept
in international affairs the United
States does not accept the abstract
right of the Soviet Union to exist fact
we celebrate captive nations week every
a year to say that secret documents talk
about dismembering of the Soviet Union
and so on I presume that Mexico does not
accept the abstract right of the United
States to exist within its current
borders that includes half of Mexico and
so on there is no such notion as right
to exist does exist what there is is the
right to live in peace and security that
is the right to be free of terrorism and
aggression
so we endorse that in the case of the
Soviet Union if the PLO were to endorse
Israel's right to exist it would be not
only accepting the existence of Israel
but accepting the legitimacy of
everything that had ever happened to the
Palestinians and then off
to do that or should they that would be
something unique in the world affairs
that's why the term was invented and
contrary to what everything you read
says if you look at our effect
statements we did not accept it the
phrase he presented was right to exist
in peace and security but that's just a
paraphrase of 242 that's just a
repetition of the old story what about
the third point the rejection of
terrorism in all its forms well in many
ways that's the most interesting of the
three and that's one that really tells
you something about the importance of a
well-controlled press alpha and the PLO
had repeatedly rejected terrorism in all
its forms over the years in fact they'd
repeatedly and once again in November in
Algiers endorsed the UN resolutions on
terrorism paraphrasing them and saying
they endorsed me but the United States
doesn't accept that and again this is
across the board I'm not talking all the
way up to the critics like say Anthony
Lewis and so on it's still the old RF up
edge so what's the old off about hedging
on terrorism well here comes a fact
which you have to look at the documents
to discover because they won't credit in
the newspapers what's the hedge well the
UN resolutions on terrorism are accepted
virtually by the entire world the last
vote at the United Nations was a hundred
and fifty three to two with one
abstention the abstention was Honduras
the two were the United States and
Israel and South Africa also opposes it
if they cut their stake if they voted so
there's the entire world you know all of
NATO all the allies and so on and the
United States is off the spectrum what's
the issue well the issue is a paragraph
in the resolutions which say nothing in
this resolution shall prejudice the
rights of people to struggle for
self-determination against racist and
colonialist regimes and foreign
occupation that's that's the paragraph
well South Africa in the United States
are opposed
so lawfully the entire American press is
opposed
the Liberals and in fact on toll archive
joins us in South Africa off the
spectrum of world opinion it's just the
old FUD hedge again and plainly you
can't have that he's weaseling out of it
again that's the position of American
liberalism remember that's the general
position when you bother to disentangle
all of this and see what's at stake now
of course nobody's going to tell you
that it won't be an editorial on the New
York Times about it and there won't be
an op-ed in The Washington Post about it
but if you take the trouble to look at
the documents you'll notice that's
precisely what's at stake and in that
point to the third point to our effort
repeated the old RFID hitch they were
not going to give up the right to resist
occupation the so where we stood on
December 14th is exactly where we stood
on December 13 reporters didn't bother
reporting anything if my story is for
what I heard it's correct but the facts
are plain George shorts however
announced that the facts are the
opposite of what they are and that's all
it takes
so from then on or we read about is the
seismic change of attitude the stunning
achievement are thought accepted our
terms the magic words and notice that
the issues are substantive if our ephod
had indeed accepted the u.s. position he
would have abandoned the right of
national self-determination that is the
qualification to 242 he would have
accepted the legitimacy of everything
that's happened to the Palestinians not
just the fact of it that's the second
point the right to exist and he would
have renounced the right to support
people in a liberated village who throw
stones when the Israeli army comes in to
try to smash up the popular committees
we renounced that right plainly he
didn't do that and be had done that I
would have abandoned everything which is
why the United States claims that he did
it well then comes the delaying action
that this piperidine is happy about
now if Robin is right with kind of the
technical judgment if Ravine is correct
there will be returned for the prior
status quo with us support and media
support that is if it's possible but
economic measures to put down the Dakota
harsh military and economic measures
again suppose that the peace now
skeptics are correct and it'll won't be
possible to put it down by violence and
pressure well then there's gonna be
another adjustment of US policy will be
show ourselves to be a kinder gentler
nation and we'll adjust to the new
realities exactly as in the early case
earlier cases 1973 in 1982 and all of
this will have media clause that's
guaranteed either way as the record
quite simply demonstrates well notice
finally that what US citizens decide to
do with it decide do anything at all
could make quite a large difference that
however is another topic important one
on this topic on the present topic if
you take a look at the record and you
check the accuracy of what I've just
sketched out as I again very much urge
that you do illuminating I think I think
what you'll find is a very dramatic
example extending now over 20 years of
how necessary illusions can be crafted
and of the terrible human consequences
that can ensue
and it's also necessary to bear in mind
the ideological fanaticism that colors
intelligence reports quite typically
everyone I've every Intelligence Agency
versine and also the higher-level
interpretations of them a lot of
Mythology about intelligence and it's
quickly dissipated if you take trouble
to read the declassified documents so
it's quite possible that US intelligence
actually believes what the Ambassador is
saying despite its manifest absurdity
well what's the meaning of these two
u.s. proposed demands demand number one
that there be no international
conference well the meaning that's
obvious the point is the whole world
outside of Israel in the United States
is in favor of a diplomatic settlement
so therefore if there is an
international conference it's just going
to mean bringing people somebody in
who's going to put pressure on for a
diplomatic settlement and therefore
there can't be a diplomatic
international conference because the
United States is opposed to a diplomatic
settlement that's the only meaning of
that of any of that now in what the
United States proposes that is direct
negotiations between Israel the PLO even
if Israel will be willing to accept the
forest in such negotiations there's no
pressures at all and therefore Israel
can say get lost if they want and that's
the end of the negotiations but if you
have an international conference it's a
problem because the rest of the world is
all interested in a settlement and what
they would do that
so no international conference that's
point one what about point to call off
this terrorism against the State of
Israel the terms in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip well they're the u.s.
position is quite straight forward if
the Intifada is brought to a halt
then matters will revert to the
situation that prevailed before and at
that time the United States cheerfully
supported and lavishly funded Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and it's regular repression and
humiliation of the Palestinian
population and it steps towards
integration of those there
tory's within israel and meanwhile the
media praised the benign occupation and
hailed the occupiers as a society in
which moral sensitivity is a principle
of political life I'm quoting New York
Times right after the subarray shakeela
massacres and that's what we'll go back
to if the Intifada is called off well
that's the meaning of the two US
proposals and therefore I guess it's
kind of understandable that they were
never mentioned or printed in the US
press to my knowledge I've never seen a
single reference to them although they
are certainly there and everybody
certainly knew about them because
everyone reads The Jerusalem Post well
notice that that tends rather strongly
to support its factura Ben's conclusion
won't go on to more details but there's
plenty more to support it as well well
let's turn back to December 1988 when
Arafah finally capitulated to his stern
mentors in Washington and he said the
magic words agreeing to the
long-standing US commands and this
stunning triumph of American diplomacy
as the press puts it notice that up
until up until December 14th including
the editorials that appeared on that day
up until December 14th the editorials
and news columns the media were
uniformly condemning our effort for his
ambiguity for repeating the old are I
thought hedges as the New York Times put
it and on December 15 the next day in
fact on the evening of December 14
everything was different
Arafat had capitulated in this December
14th press conference in Geneva and
while we still naturally have to be wary
at least there's some progress that's
the story so how do we know that our
effect capitulated on December 14th well
that's easy George Shultz appeared on
television and in his lugubrious voice
announced that our I thought it
capitulated so that fixes those facts
it's therefore it is so and the media
snap to attention like a trained dog
command now an inquiry lasting about two
minutes would have sufficed to show that
at the famous press conference our
thoughts words remained as far from the
us demands as they had ever been and
those differences are quite substantive
if Arafah had capitulated and had said
the magic words
then the Palestinians would have
abandoned everything which is exactly
why the US government and the media now
insists that that is what has happened
that means in the world if necessary
illusion the one that works they have
abandoned everything if they ever make
any demands again that shows their
backing off on their promises which
we've invented for them that was what an
inquiry of two minutes would have shown
an inquiry of 20 minutes maybe would
have shown that Arafat basically
repeated positions that he had stated
sometimes more clearly and explicitly
for the past 13 years but throughout
this period and still today Washington
has rejected that position in December
for reasons to which I'll return in a
moment
Washington decided to say that Arafah
had capitulated so therefore he had in
the world of necessary illusion back to
the facts a moment let me just mention
to you something I heard last night from
a overseas phone call from a well-known
American correspondent in the television
media told me an interesting story he
had read an article on the Jay right up
this death and he told me that the heat
and I kind of checked this yet but he
told me that the television stations on
the evening of December 14 did not run
slots from Geneva
you know usually what happens is a
television reporter reports something
and makes a little 90 seconds that they
send over the satellite message to see
on the 77 o'clock news according what he
told me that didn't happen in that case
rather there were live discussions
between New York or
new york i guess and the reporters you
know Peter Jennings Barrie Dunsmore and
so on in which they discussed it and he
said the reason is that when the
reporters went to the press conference
then you hear anything different than
before they knew horrified has repeated
what he always said for years
and it was just as far from the us
demands as ever so they put together
these little brief nothing statements
and we're getting ready to send them
across on the satellite when they were
informed from New York by telephone that
the State Department had announced that
things were different than what they had
seen and therefore they should kill
those stories and happen and since it
was no time to make up new stories and
send them across they would have to just
the interviewed live well I heard that
from a rather well place television
source and as I said maybe check it but
the nice research project for somebody
well let's let's proceed I want to I'll
come back to what actually happened that
that famous discussion of our efforts
but let's first that put it into a
little bit of a little bit of background
because that's the only way you can
understand what's happened so if you
bear with me for a minute on mention a
little bit of the relevant history let's
I'm just gonna look at the diplomacy
after the 1967 war
bigger story than that but for reading
the time let's stay there well there's
an official story about this the
official story about the diplomacy since
the 1967 war is first the United States
has been pursuing the peace process now
notice that a comment to make here
notice that that's not a fact that's a
tautology there's a tautology because
the word peace process has a very
special meaning in US political
discourse mechanic dictionary that means
process leading for peace but that's not
the way the word is used like most terms
of political discourse it really has two
meanings one the actual meaning and the
earlier the meaning that's used
for ideological warfare now the actual
meaning of the word peace process is
process aiming towards peace the
ideological meaning and the one that's
universally used in the media and in
scholarship is that the peace process
refers to whatever the United States
happens to be doing at the moment
now that's a useful meaning that's a
useful check this out if you like it
follows in so it's impossible to find a
phrase like the United States is
undermining the peace process because
that's that's not only false it's self
contradictory you know so therefore
there's no point in saying it and notice
that you can reach that conclusion
without having to bother with the ugly
complicated world of fact where we have
to look at the documents or anything
like that you just notice true by
definition you know like two plus two
equals four and then finding a work to
figure it out so it's very convenient
usage actually I mentioned this fact in
a talk that University of Washington in
Seattle a couple months ago and there
happens to be a very good media project
there and somebody in the media project
weeks later saying that he'd done a
computer tech check and through the New
York Times from 1980 through 1989
picking out the phrase peace process and
he'd found that the articles referring
the peace process and there wasn't one
in which the United States was in any
way opposed to the peace process notice
again we don't need to get statistical
error if this is correct that's pretty
remarkable because during the 80s the
United States was deeply committed to
undermining and blocking the peace
process in Central America and in the
Middle East to mention just to but if
this brief data analysis correct there's
one statement to that effect and I
predict that you won't find it in the
scholarly literature either so the
United States point number one the
United States has been pursuing the
peace process but that's the tautology
now point number two what about the
Arabs well
official line is the Arabs have been
opposed to peace they've been committed
solely to the destruction of Israel
although there was a break in 1977
president Sadat of Egypt understood his
evil ways and he broke ranks and he
became a man of peace and now in
December 1988
maybe Arafah has made his first halting
moves to follow Sadat in that direction
but apart from that and of course you
know our friends same and so on apart
from that the Arabs all are opposed to
peace and just wanna murder Jews and so
on and so forth with regard to Israel
the official line is that the Israeli
Labor Party which ruled the country up
till 77 followed a policy of what the
New York Times calls healthy pragmatism
and still does but the Likud the other
major political groupings especially
under yet Samir is kind of recalcitrant
continuing with the story under labor
and still today because of their healthy
pragmatism Israel makes forthcoming
offers proposes a fair peaceful
settlement but the Arabs always refused
now that's the official line endlessly
repeated over and over again well let's
break the rules and turn to the
irrelevant reality here we have a return
to the documentary record and let me
urge you to look at it first we'll begin
with Israel there happens to be as far
as I know only one detailed diplomatic
record of particularly the Labour Party
includes the year 66 7 to 77 written by
a top-level Labour Party functionary of
beylin it's in Hebrew but very no Hebrew
no freakin translators worth reading
it's detailed almost day-to-day record
of cabinet meetings of the Labour
government the basic principle to which
it keeps is stated by current president
Ken Hertzog is it does and it says the
Palestinians cannot be participants in
any way in a land that has been
consecrated through our people for
thousands of years land and
the occupied territories and it pretty
well keeps to that now if you look you
discover that Israel has made two
diplomatic initiatives during this
period when it was governed by healthy
pragmatism and none since under Labour
the first diplomatic initiative was in
June 19th 1967 June 1906
weeks after the war there was a split
cabinet vote 11 to 10 and they it's what
vote was sent to the United States
privately and that's the first
initiative that proposed candidate Lee a
settlement with Syria and Egypt but with
Israel keeping the Gaza Strip and the
MOU mention at all of the West Bank no
settlement Jordan Israel keeps the Gaza
Strip passively assumed keeps the West
Bank but makes a settlement with Syria
and Egypt depart from that Abba Eban in
diplomatic tho describes this as the
most dramatic initiative in Israel's
history before or since
well that dramatic initiative West at
which notice means that keep the West
Bank and Gaza Strip that was replaced in
August 1968 by another proposal what's
called the alone plan which is the
official labor party position up till
the present and up till recently that
has meant Israel keeps the Gaza Strip
and the Golan Heights and in those days
much of the Sinai and with regard to the
West Bank
it keeps about forty percent of it about
what it needs essentially keeps
everything except the areas of heavy
concentration of Arab population problem
is what they call the demographic
problem too many Arabs in a Jewish state
so Israel the ideas Israel should keep
the resources keep the territories it
needs keep access to the water and keep
the markets people over force but not
have to administer the population that's
the healthy pragmatism that the New York
Times advocates those are the only two
proposals in reality now turning to the
Arabs well starting and things started
to shift in the late 60s but let's take
February 19 said
not 77 February 1971 February 1971
president said out of Egypt newly become
president made a offered a full peace
treaty to Israel for a pastry no
reservations I'm a nationally recognized
borders meaning pre June 67 borders with
all the structure of UN 242 guarantees
right to live in peace etc full access
to the canal the Straits etc and
offering nothing to the Palestinians
past 90 I mentioned that those refugees
in accordance with UN 242 in fact
so that's proposal of February 71 was
virtually identical to official US
policy as expressed by Secretary of
State William Rogers and the Rogers plan
shortly before a couple of weeks later
Jordan made a similar proposal Israel
responded the Sadat's proposal it
accepted it officially as a genuine
peace offer and refused it in internal
discussion we read that they refused it
because they felt that they held out
they could get a better territorial
settlement the United States in the
United States there was a split
symbolized by Rogers and Kissinger with
each representing major interests and
conceptions the split was over whether
to accept the diplomatic settlement now
offered fully by Egypt in terms of
official US policy or whether to reject
it
Kissinger's approach as he explains in
his memoirs was to push for what he
called stalemate meaning keeping things
frozen and since then he went out in the
internal bureaucratic conflict and since
then stalemate has prevailed and still
does well that was February 1971 I
stress not 77
not when Sadat fluted Israel and made a
less forthcoming offer than in February
19
the one because in his 77 proposal in
Jerusalem which established him as an
official man of peace he expressed what
by then was the general international
consensus that there should be a
Palestinian state in the occupied
territories I'll come back in a moment
to why the second one is permitted to
enter history the reason why the first
one is not permitted to enter history is
obvious tells the wrong story says the
United States was opposed to the peace
process and since that's a logical
contradiction it must be that the events
didn't happen so therefore they never
mentioned accept them in a footnote in
some arcane monograph somewhere and they
didn't happen for this perfectly obvious
reason well that was February 71 let's
move on to January 1976 in January 1976
the UN Security Council debated a
resolution calling for a full-scale
political settlement I'm the
internationally recognized 3 June 67
borders with recognition of the rights
of all states in the region their right
to live in peace and security
territorial guarantees security
guarantees in fact all the wording of UN
242 explicitly verbatim not paraphrases
but verbatim and the Palestinians but
now you went to 42 extended in terms of
the broad international consensus of the
mid-70s to include a Palestinian state
in the West Bank in the Gaza Strip
notice that that resolution incorporates
UN 242 but now extends it to include a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip the UN 242 was a
resolution we'll talk about a settlement
among states it was totally rejectionist
offered nothing to the Palestinians well
I was January 1976 who was for it well
the resolution was introduced by Syria
and Egypt the three confrontation states
it was openly backed by the PLO publicly
and openly backed by the PLO in fact
according to Haim Hertzog now president
and UN representative for ambassador for
Israel according to him it was prepared
by the PLO there we can just take
Israel's word for it but the fact that
they supported it is not anybody's
worried that's on the public record and
you can read it in the New York Times
the United States vetoed the resolution
so it's down the memory hole can't exist
because if it exists it shows the United
States was blocking the peace process
which is a logical contradiction so
therefore it doesn't exist either and in
fact when you look at the reports of the
peace process books about the peace
process you know articles by Thomas
Friedman a New York Times about the
peace process these things aren't there
they don't exist
they can't logical contradiction in fact
20 1976 there have been repeated offers
I'm not going to run through the details
there have been repeated initiatives
from the Arab states from Arafat from
the PLO calling for negotiations leading
the mutual recognition so down in the
memory hood
sometimes they were very sometimes they
were explicit that's all down the memory
hole does not exist the New York Times
which has a special responsibility
remember it's the newspaper of record it
creates history history is what's in the
New York Times archives you know not
what's in the San Francisco
herald-examiner archives that's not
where historians go have archives
so therefore the San Francisco Herald
examiner is able to reprint to print
these facts but the New York Times has a
much heavier responsibility on its
shoulders and then I haven't print them
or even allow letters to appear which
refer to them so for example repeatedly
for pick one case in April May 1984 when
I was running around Europe and Asia and
making very public statements trolling
for negotiations leading the mutual
recognition The Times
refused to print to report the facts and
refused to reprint
letters referring to it and there's even
somebody who has a letter from the
foreign editor The Times
explaining why his letter is not being
published that ban on admitting those
facts continued in the New York Times
until March 1988 when the first hint was
allowed come back to that any mail
throughout these years more and more
proposals or initiatives recall that
this is just the world of reality and
therefore it's irrelevant in the world
of necessary illusion nothing happened
except Sadat and 1977 and maybe RF out
in December 1988 if you can take them
seriously well let's turn to the united
states now keeping to the world is
irrelevant reality in 1969 December 1969
Secretary of State William Rogers
proposed the Rogers plan which was
official US policy no is very much like
the Sadat propose a virtually identical
with the February 71 Sadat proposal what
I just mentioned as I said Kissinger who
was then national security adviser with
opposed he was in favor of stalemate
maintaining things the way they were
there was a kind of a logic behind it
and the logic was the Nixon Doctrine
Israel's what secretary of Laird
Secretary of Defense Laird called cop on
the beat a local cop on the beat to
represent US interests in the region it
was becoming a US client state worldwide
there was a kind of logic Israel was
what's called a strategic asset
therefore we keep things the way they
are furthermore it was assumed that
there was no big problem from the Arabs
intelligence in one of its quite
standard in fact near uniform colossal
failures assumed that the Arabs couldn't
figure out which ended a gun to hold war
is not the Arabs game as the head of
Israeli military intelligence put it yo
chef a car cubby then a suit big Hawk
now a big dog because he changed his
tactical assessments and on that
assumption that war is not the Arabs
game it didn't really matter much what
kind of bluster they care
I mean they get maneuver in the Sinai if
they want it and do all that stuff but
you'd have to take it seriously Henry
Kissinger was being bombarded with
reports from the u.s. ambassadors in the
field and from the American oil
companies and so on explained that his
refusal rejection of any diplomatic
options was going to lead the war so
that's just gonna be forced to go to war
but everybody left
because war is not the Arab name well
along came the 1973 war and surprisingly
war was the Arabs game in fact it was a
very serious affair and the United
States understands that states do
understand violence maybe not much else
but they certainly understand violence
of the efficacy of violence and you can
see that Israel's capacity to dominate
the region by force was not so clear
Egypt had to be taken seriously as a
result US policy adjusted in 1973 u.s.
and that adjusted to the obvious
fallback position since Egypt wasn't
just a basket case and couldn't be
ignored we should therefore take it
seriously we should accept Sadat's
longstanding offers to attorney Justin
to a US client state and we should
exclude Egypt from the conflict Egypt is
the major Arab military force is the
major Arab deterrent if we can exclude
it from the conflict then Israel is free
with mounting US support to move to
integrate the occupied territories and
to attack its northern neighbor that's
Camp David the meaning of what happened
from 1973 to 1978 is precisely that its
efforts to exclude a Egypt from the
conflict so that Israel is then free to
do exactly those things that was obvious
at the time I should say and it's now
conceded in retrospect that that's what
happened but what else could happen and
it's just in the logic of the situation
I think you better explain I presume
that when the secret documents are
Declassified in 20 30 years we'll see
that people were thinking about anyway
even if they weren't perfectly
transparent that that was the logic of
the situation as I say it's now accepted
well then comes I don't have to bother
with the details you know anything about
the record you'll know it's just what
happened us support for Israel shot up
reached about 50% of total world aid in
the late Carter early Reagan period
Israeli attacks on Lebanon increased it
was an invasion in 1978 there was an
extend extension of the heavy
bombardment in 1979 and 80 finally an
outright invasion in 82 the United
States supported that invasion the
Republican supported it enthusiastically
the Democrats supported it ecstatically
there was almost total support for what
the New York Times called the liberation
of Lebanon at the time but the
consequences were not what was expected
first Israel failed on the ground
militarily very crucial fact which the
Israeli military is well aware oh they
were unable to displace Syria the Syrian
army from fixed positions they won the
technological wars they didn't win the
ground war and they know it they
couldn't pierce the Beirut Damascus
highway for weeks very well aware of
that they were unable to establish what
defense minister Sharon called the new
order in Lebanon and in the subsequent
period they were actually driven out of
Southern much of southern Lebanon by
quite unanticipated local resistance the
Costas got too high and they had to pull
out of everything except what they call
their security zone
well again states understand violence
and the United States adjusted once
again it was however assumed that at
least the occupied territories could be
controlled by force maybe war wasn't the
Arabs game and maybe those crazy Shiites
in Lebanon
weird things but we aren't to worry
about the people in the occupied
territories resistance still isn't there
game that was the assumption well
December 1987 came along
let me instantly go back to why Sadat's
offer in 1977 can enter history see in
1977 so that could be a man of peace
because US policy had changed since US
policy had changed it was possible to
recognize since we're trying to exclude
Egypt from the conflict it's possible to
recognize that Sadat is offering to be
excluded from the conflict therefore
said that became a man of peace on the
other hand before US policy had changed
in 1971 it couldn't be making those
proposals because the United States is
objecting to them that we didn't make
that's the reason why the official story
is his trip to Jerusalem was winning
made himself a man of peace well coming
back to 1987 then we get in December the
Intifada and over the next couple of
months we get rising violence and
refreshing it but failure the violence
is I mean making life very miserable for
people and it's very brutal and to tell
you about that but it hasn't succeeded
in putting it down so there's got to be
a policy judgment or at least the
beginnings of the policy adjustment and
along with the beginnings of policy
adjustment call an outcome an opening in
the Free Press
so now by early 1988 it begins to be
possible to concede that the
Palestinians are making various kinds of
offers in fact the kind of in making
food since certainly since January 76
and as I say in March 1988 the New York
Times finally allowed little peek at it
well 3 1988 the all of this continues
the violence is failing to stop the
uprising therefore there's more and more
openings the Oakleigh efforts diplomatic
efforts were also becoming more
insistent in November 1988
in a national council met you now cheers
and the pmc did propose something new
namely they declared a Palestinian state
that's what they called the crowning
achievement of the meeting however
that's totally unacceptable to the
United States so therefore it's off the
media agenda that's not discuss they
were also willing to discuss some
modalities for achieving it and that
begins to relate to a US government
interest so therefore that's allowed to
be on the agenda and there's some
recognition that those things are going
on though inadequate our went to
Stockholm and repeat at the same points
still inadequate he was then going to
come to Geneva
to New York to speak at the UN General
Assembly meeting the State Department
refused instantly there was virtually
unanimous approval of this except on
technical grounds everyone agreed that
the PLO had not said the magic words I
mean all the way up to Anthony Lewis
still we old are up that hits not saying
it yet you gotta be harsher the refusal
to allow the UN to meet in Geneva was
flatly illegal caused a big uproar
around the world the UN met in Geneva
where are repeated what he had been
saying all along the United States still
rejected it and carries us up to
December 14th by this point the United
States was in in a totally untenable
position the US government position was
being very broadly supported at home in
fact virtually unanimously but the
United States government was becoming an
object of international ridicule you
can't control the world as easily as you
can control the Free Press and the
intellectual community it was becoming
an object of international ridicule the
not only were first of all because of
the refusal to allow our effort to speak
in New York recall that the reason given
the reason was it would be a security
threat to the United States it's
interesting that everybody accepted that
nobody asked you know what's he gonna do
I'm gonna hijack a taxicab or you know
take over the Pentagon
I mean exactly what's the security for
it but the point is nothing is too
absurd to be accepted if it satisfies me
however outside the United States you
can't get away with that so easily the
State Department was in an untenable
position therefore they made the natural
move of any great power especially a
super you know the dominant world
superpower the one that controls the
world information system they simply
decided to announce that RFID
capitulated and accepted our terms that
was the only way out and then comes the
delaying action which I described no
final factual question to look at is
what happened on December 14th that the
famous press conference well it's very
clear as I say it'll take you two
minutes to figure it out if you bother
to check the State Department had
articulated three explicit demands and
they were in writing and words read them
in the New York Times in the Washington
Post and verbatim it said these words
must be stated verbatim without
qualification those are the magic words
and the three things were one acceptance
of UN 242 without qualifications to
acceptance of Israel's right to exist
and the government insisted that that
was the crucial one fact National
Security Advisor Powell actually went on
television or the newspaper and said
that's the crucial one you've got to
repeat that and the third was
renunciation of terrorism sorry
rejection of terrorism that was the word
rejection of terrorism without
qualifications and our thoughts still as
of December 13th had not met those three
demands and again the far as I know the
whole American press virtually I mean
one exception that I saw was in fact a
column by William raspberry and the
Washington Post
but that apart I couldn't find one
exception including Anthony Lewis and
everyone else for saying still withhold
our I thought heads you've got to accept
these three positions well let's look
into them first accept UN 242 without
qualifications what's the qualification
the qualification to the PLO that's
accepted you into 42 P years
in fact it endorsed it as I said already
in January 1976 13 years earlier in the
very words of UN 242 but it had always
added a qualification the qualification
was it called for those UN resolutions
which talk about the right of national
self-determination of Palestinians that
is an effective quote for a Palestinian
state as explicitly in January 76 and
that qualification is unacceptable what
did I say in Geneva
he repeated UN 242 with the same
qualification explicitly they said we
accept the right of all states in the
region to live in peace including the
new state of Palestine and Israel Sam
qualification in fact it's a less clear
endorsement of UN 242 than in January 76
because then the PLO supported the
actual wording of 242 whereas here he
just paraphrased it so the first claim
that Arafat said the magic words than
that one it's just flat false what about
the right to exist nothing there
Rafa did not endorse Israel's abstract
right to exist and that's an interesting
proposal the phrase right to exist was
invented by Henry Kissinger in 1975 in
an effort to block the danger of the
political settlement and because he knew
perfectly well that nobody's ever going
to accept the abstract right to exist of
Israel or any other state there's no
such concept in international affairs
the United States does not accept the
abstract right of the Soviet Union to
exist in fact we celebrate captive
nations week every year to say that
secret documents talk about this
membrane of the Soviet Union and so on I
presume that Mexico does not accept the
abstract right of the United States to
exist within its current borders that
would include the half of Mexico and so
on there is no such notion as right to
exist them exist
what there is is the right to live in
peace and security that is the right to
be free of terrorism and aggression
so we endorse that in the case
Soviet Union if the PLO were to endorse
Israel's right to exist it would be not
only accepting the existence of Israel
but accepting the legitimacy of
everything that had ever happened to the
Palestinians and they're not likely to
do that nor should they that would be
something unique in the world affairs
that's why the term was invented and
contrary to what everything you read
says if you look at our effect
statements we did not accept it the
phrase he presented was right to exist
in peace and security but that's just a
paraphrase in 242 that's just a
repetition of the old story what about
the Third Point the rejection of
terrorism in all its forms well in many
ways that's the most interesting of the
three and that's one that really tells
you something about the importance of a
well-controlled press RF and the PLO had
repeatedly rejected terrorism in all its
forms over the years in fact they'd
repeatedly and once again in November in
Algiers endorsed the UN resolutions on
terrorism paraphrasing them and saying
the endorses but the United States
doesn't accept that and again this is
across the board I'm not talking all the
way up to the critics like say Anthony
Lewis and so on it's still the old RF up
edge so what's the old off I'd hedge on
terrorism well here comes a fact which
you have to look at the documents to
discover because they won't credit in
the newspapers what's the hedge well the
UN resolutions on terrorism are accepted
virtually by the entire world the last
vote at the United Nations was a hundred
and fifty three to two with one
abstention the abstention was Honduras
the two were the United States and
Israel and South Africa also opposes it
if they compare their what is at stake
if they voted no so there's the entire
world you know all of NATO all the
allies and so on and the United States
is off the spectrum what's the issue
well the issue is a paragraph in the
resolutions which say nothing in this
resolution shall prejudice the rights of
people to struggle for
self-determination
against racist and colonialist regimes
and foreign occupation that's that's the
paragraph well South Africa in the
United States are opposed so literally
the entire American press is opposed
including all the Liberals and in fact
on tour arkhat joins us and South Africa
off the spectrum of world opinion it's
just the old are fat hedge again and
plainly you can't have that
it's weaseling out of it again that's
the position of American liberalism
remember that's the general position
when you bother to disentangle all of
this and see what's at stake of course
nobody's going to tell you that there
won't be an editorial on the New York
Times about it and it won't be an op-ed
in the Washington Post about it but if
you take the trouble to look at the
documents you'll notice that's precisely
what's at stake and in that point to the
third point to RF I've repeated the old
ri5 hitch they were not going to give up
the right to the sir where we stood on
December 14th is exactly where we stood
on December 13 reporters didn't bother
reporting anything of my stories what I
heard is correct but the facts are plain
George Shultz however announced that the
facts are the opposite of what they are
and that's all it takes
so from then on or we read about as the
seismic change of attitude the stunning
achievement or I thought accepted our
terms the magic words and notice that
the issues are substantive if Arafat had
indeed accepted the u.s. position he
would have abandoned the right of
national self-determination that is the
qualification the 242 he would have
accepted the legitimacy of everything
that's happened to the Palestinians not
just the fact of it that's the second
point the right to exist and he would
have renounced the right to support
people in a liberated village who throw
stones when the Israeli army comes in to
try to smash up the popular committees
we renounced that right claim they
didn't do that and he had done that I
would have abandoned everything which is
why the United States
that he did it well then comes the
delaying action that this ravine is
happy about
now if Robin is right we'll turn to the
tactical judgment if ravine is correct
there will be returned to the prior
status quo with us support and media
support that is if it's possible by
partial economic measures to put down
the photo partial military and economic
measures again suppose that the peace
now skeptics are correct and it won't be
possible to put it down by violence and
pressure well then there's gonna be
another adjustment of US policy will be
show ourselves to be a kinder gentler
nation and will adjust to the new
realities exactly as in the early case
earlier cases 1973 in 1982 and all of
this will have media clause that's
guaranteed either way as the record
quite simply demonstrates well notice
finally that what US citizens decide to
do if they decide to do anything at all
could make quite a large difference that
however is another topic important one
on this topic on the present topic if
you take a look at the record and you
check the accuracy of what I've just
sketched out as I again very much urge
did you do illuminating I think I think
what you'll find is a very dramatic
example extending now over 20 years of
how necessary illusions can be crafted
and of the terrible human consequences
that can ensue
