what is your analysis of the obsession
of the balance of your question what are
the implications regarding military
spending in corporate welfare well
you'll notice that the guys who want to
balance the budget want to raise
military spending so they say the
Heritage Foundation which crafts policy
for the right-wing Republicans and has
all sorts of blather about the free
market but they're calling for
increasing the military later okay
in fact after right after the 1994
election you know the big so-called
conservative landslide which actually
amounted to a shift of about 2% in the
vote in contested positions the right
after that first move that Clinton makes
appear we're gonna have a Conservative
government balances eliminate the
government Clinton's first move
within weeks was to raise military
spending beyond what had been allocated
and then Engrish came along with a
congressional majority and raised it
even further okay then the Heritage came
along with this budget proposal said
that even higher so the idea is that
military spending has to go up and why
does military spending have to go up the
Martians or something it doesn't have
anything to do with that but I mean
military spending goes up or state
action depending on budget is
approximately actually higher in real
terms than it was under the Nixon
administration it's roughly at Cold War
levels which tells me something means
it's there for some other purposes
but the story that was there for the
Cold War is must be fraud because it
stays the same
and that's not should be a new insight
because there's obvious all along
I mean it's therefore basically
who are their purposes which remain real
there are intervention forces that's
true
they are mostly directed at the Persian
Gulf region which has always been the
case and after 1989 when the Cold War
protects disappeared the government came
clean
you know like Bush's 1990 submission to
Congress on the budget it said we have
to keep the Pentagon budget high and so
that that's interesting reading because
they couldn't you know I could use the
qolt were critics anymore the Russians
weren't coming so it's interesting to
read it's a public document they say
well if pentagon budget high for two
major reasons and they're the right
crazy one because we need these massive
intervention forces aimed at the Middle
East where I'm now quoting where the
threat to our interests could not be
laid at the Kremlin's door okay in other
words all the lies over the best years
we throw away
no Kremlin anymore the threats to our
interests didn't come from them which
was of course always up is it comes from
the people of the region who have a
really weird idea they think that the
wealth and you got to eat that idea
their heads so we have a whole system of
control to do this including a huge
intervention system which goes all the
way to the Indian Ocean
just in case the local system and
control doesn't work out so we have to
keep that the other thing he says is we
have to maintain the defense industrial
base that was the defense industrial
base what's the whole economic system we
have to maintain the industrial system
which has been relying on the whole
Pentagon system that
it's NASA Department of Energy and so on
it's been relying it as the funnel of
the transfers public resources of the
private power so you take a look at the
dynamic sectors of the economy
you know like engineer tell you
computers electronics all together the
internet fiber optic satellites no
aeronautical industry obviously just
look through the whole thing and the
research development innovation
entrepreneurial ideas and so on that
mostly comes out of the state system and
then when something works you know you
have it a reprieve that power actually
dramatic case right now is the internet
wave the future where'd that come from
pure safety funding right out of the
Pentagon starts what was the art Minette
the military in that then taken over by
the National Science Foundation so
public funds so it created the whole
thing business simply wasn't interested
as late as 1994 Bill Gates was unwilling
even to come to a conference on the
Internet as you can see any commercial
possibilities in it so the state should
keep paying its takings people you know
it's no entity of the state that means
the taxpayers should be paying for it
finally they finally sort of broke into
their minds that they can this
with it it's a huge technique for you
know expect huge advertising revenues
and control people and shopping service
and this and then so now it's been
dealing over in 1996 Telecommunications
Act gave it over to private interests
and now they're figuring out a way to
commercialize it everybody else out yeah
that's the way the system works oh sure
you need Pentagon spending now what
about the balancing of the budget well
that's not going to cut back I'm
certainly English is nikole going to
call for an end to the Pentagon spending
if you call for an end to federal
subsidies his rigid constituents start
selling gratis
he brings more federal subsidies in his
district than any suburban district in
the country outside the federal system
so he's the champion welfare freak in
the country and he's not gonna kill that
and furthermore he's smart enough to
understand that that's true of the whole
system so it works so the federal
subsidies to wealthy sectors mostly
through the Pentagon system they're not
going to change so what's the balancing
of the budget well that means cut off
any part of the federal system that
works for people okay so like food for
hungry children that if they cut the
cycle of dependency that's the big talk
you know like Ingrid is sparing lectures
that seven-year-old kids on how they
have to learn responsibility and break
out of the cycle of dependency but he
doesn't give that electric to his
wealthy supervision
I think they lived on the cycle
independent they can talk about their
conservative values and all that but
only as long as they're feeding at the
public trough no they get into the
market so you know balancing the budget
is a technique of it's a way you know
it's a weapon of social control which is
designed to ensure that the document
minority is protected against the
majority even more radically than usual
because public funds that go more and
more only to them overwhelmingly to them
almost all to them no Vale could live on
the labor markets don't know if they can
survive
that's what balancing the budget is
about actually as a program to balancing
the budget makes no sense at all I mean
no Enterprise lives with a balanced
budget I mean like a household or
business they all live on debt you know
almost everything unless you're a hermit
somewhere living in the woods just that
every household is on deck like it'll
work if you borrow money to send your
kids to college
certainly businesses are constantly
living on that you know you borrow money
to invest and so on that's the way any
live system works the purpose of
preventing the federal government from
doing this is to prevent it from doing
things that might be culpable there's
the plane people okay but meanwhile you
want to make sure you know that the
parts that go to the rich they continue
I was in a hotel this morning so they
have cable television I turned on the
CNN I can usually stand it for about
three minutes
in three minutes that I was able to
stand that this morning they had a
little section on tax reform which was
debate so it's very well balanced I mean
it and somebody from the Heritage
Foundation was maybe closer to thirty
guy who was about in the same ballpark
that was the debate on tax reform and
the proposal was they were just
different on which way of changing
things so that they could become more
aggressive and would be the best it's
like the guy from the Cato Institute
said let's have a sales tax that's
radically regressive you know it takes a
huge amount from the poor or a much less
from the rich so that's really good the
other theory and so on techniques of
social privilege and meanwhile you keep
a powerful nanny state that's important
you can't get along without that at the
extent to which corporations rely on
that is often not realized if you're
interested me the best technical visit
very good technical study of this by two
British economist just came out the
technical study hundred transnationals
and the Fortune quiz and they point out
among other things that a personal the
point they're not really globalized
they're part of the globalization is
mostly mythology they're very nationally
based and furthermore they relied very
heavily on their own governments the
government were there rooting that their
conclusion
is that the top-100 unfortunate list of
transnational although they say
benefited from industrial policies of
their own government and over 20 were
able to survive as business enterprises
because of take over or bailed out by
their own government that's over 20 out
of a hundred that includes incidentally
English's favorite cash tell Lockheed I
which is the biggest employer in his
district which was bailed out by the
Nixon administration with several
billion dollar loan otherwise it
wouldn't exist in fact the whole thing
exists only by government subsidy when
it got into trouble
bail them out well no that's the way the
system works it's a free market for the
poor and it never has been
