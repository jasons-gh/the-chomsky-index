hello and welcome to the origins podcast
I'm Lawrence Krauss what's left to say
about Noam Chomsky he's known throughout
the world as perhaps the most important
living public intellectual and his
writing has been cited more than almost
any author in their arts and humanities
over recent decades and he's literally
the father of modern linguistics Noam
served as a role model for me since I
took a class from him in u.s. foreign
policy while doing my PhD in physics at
MIT and I watched him speak throughout
Cambridge with generosity and
intelligence we did a dialogue on stage
three years ago for the origins project
and we discussed a host of things from
language and consciousness to politics
that was before Donald Trump and brexit
and all that however and I was happy to
have the opportunity to update our
dialogue as always he was incisive
informative provocative and brilliant as
well as providing a unique treatment of
issues when simply does not hear
discussed in the US media making it
incredibly important to hear from him

gnome it's great to have you back here
we you and I had one of my favorite
conversations before the public I think
three years ago now it's three years I
think it seems a it's hard to believe
but I it by knowing that it was before
Trump was elected so I because it seems
that's what what's amazing in three
short years it seems like so much has
happened in some we BT and be 880 that's
right exactly
and it but that's not just all trumpet I
mean all the things up is that what's
happened in North Korea and Syria and
Israel and Venezuela Brazil all over oh
it's just amazing that what seems to
have happened in those four years and
even in our own countries there's
there's free speech debates there's all
sorts of things
and I want to want to talk about some of
that but at the same time the more
things change the more they remain the
same so there's all sorts of new issues
but but the underlying causes and impact
may not be so different I wanted to in
you know when I was thinking about that
I I was looking at what we said to each
other and then I was reminded of a book
I had been reading recently which is an
old book for the 1960s by Richard
Hofstadter called anti-intellectualism
in America and and it was interesting
for me to read that because it was
written in response to McCarthyism was
written in 1961 or so and I thought I'd
begin to put this in context in a quote
at the beginning of that book from 1961
where he quoted Emerson who wrote let us
honestly state the facts our America has
a bad name for superficial --mess great
men great nations have not been bolsters
and buffoons
but perceivers of the terror of life and
have manned themselves to face it so I
thought I'd ask you to comment on that
on that and then and then we can move
into recent politics
well Emerson was a very interesting
thinker but in many respects he
unfortunately illustrated the things
that he's
criticizing I agree so take for example
something not irrelevant today his
attitude toward the Civil War at the
very beginning he was a pacifist in fact
he was in a sense in favor of the war he
thought it would break down the states
it would break down state power so maybe
would be beneficial after the Battle of
Bull Run he became a enthusiastic super
patriot very much the way intellectuals
do all the time as soon as the conflict
begins
we're enthusiastic for our own side and
the fact if you look back at the
transcendentalist his group some of the
most distinguished intellectuals in the
United States certainly maybe anywhere
one didn't go along with the tide
Nathaniel Hawthorne and he was kind of
excluded in fact there's a very
interesting article you might want to
read if you have heard in the Atlantic
Monthly Hawthorne towards the end of the
war about 1964 1864 1864 decided to just
travel through the south to sea but then
the outcome of the war was reasonably
clear and he wrote an article which was
supportive of the north you know but
skeptical for example he interviewed
prison southern prisoners of war in a
fairly sympathetic way he said look
these are just rural farmers and they're
not war criminals they were brought up
to defend their homes and so on we
should treat them decently anyway the
interesting thing about the article is
not only his commentary which is
interesting but the interpolations the
editors agreed to have it published but
only if they were allowed and this is a
liberal of the liberal intellectual
journals if they were allowed to
interpolate comments criticizing what he
wrote along the way
so there you have Hawthorne's moderately
sympathetic view to people who are
defeated in suffering and the liberal
intellectuals interpolating so no you
have to be a super patriot you can't say
these things it's very instructive about
intellectual history in many ways in
fact if you look at the history of
intellectuals it works very much like
this so shortly after this period came
the Dreyfus trial
which actually is the first time that
the word intellectual starts being used
in its modern sense and it's very
interesting that we today we honor the
Dreyfus orts Emal's Oleum sister not
then they were bitterly attacked by the
Immortals of the Academie Francaise how
dare you
mere writers and artists criticize our
ground institutions you know the state
so on fast for a Zola actually had to
flee the country yeah sure let's go
forward to not long before we met late
60s 66 67 roughly then McGeorge Bundy a
former Harvard Dean of leading
intellectual national security adviser
for Kennedy in Johnson had an article in
foreign affairs the main establishment
journal in which he said he discussed
the criticism of the Vietnam War he said
yes there are legitimate criticisms
about the tactics and so on and then
there are what he called the wild men in
the wings of people like hofferman Zola
who are not only criticizing the tactics
but are raising questions about our
motives I assume you were one of the
wildman' in the wings absolutely very
far and this is a theme that runs
through basically all of history
you go back to classical Greece who
drank the hemlock and the guy who was
corrupting the youth of Athens by asking
too many questions yeah right
the prison that's and so it's
interesting to raise the question rumors
it was a very distinguished honorable
figure but not immune well no III liked
that coat because of the many sided
aspects of it because of his background
and also this notion of course great
nations have not been bolsters and
buffoons which serve resonates in some
ways in the current times but this and
this idea of whether anti
intellectualism it has been prevalent
and to what extent it's good or bad it's
a good question
and yet for example Lee there are
several kinds of intellectuals there's
the wild men on the wings and there are
the what are sometimes called the
stenographers of power yeah and one has
to make up one's own mind but I think
you can certainly have different
attitudes towards them well you know I
and we were talking about lunch that I
learned from you when the first time we
met when it was when I was sitting in of
course in American foreign policy when I
was a student at MIT a shocking fact
which to me just surprised me because
I'd always kind of revered academia and
I've it's been a part of my life ever
since but the realization that in some
ways during the Vietnam War the last
group to accept the immorality of that
war was were the academics which which i
aiways thought maybe because i knew a
vet you but I'd always thought somehow
the academics were leading it but it was
the students it was the public maybe you
can go into a little bit well I would
broaden it beyond academics to the
general intellectual community with some
exceptions they're always or they've
journals all those and yeah Nathanial
hopefully no Chomsky's another Splinter
a by and large it's true in fact you get
a kind of a vivid picture of it but
first of all remember that opposition to
the war was very late in coming the the
war actually started in the early 50s by
1960 maybe 60 or 70 thousand people had
been killed in South Vietnam just by
repressed the repressive government we
were supporting at Kennedy escalated the
war and
1961 and 62 authorized the US Air Force
to start bombing rural South Vietnam
under South Vietnamese markings but
nobody was fooled authorized napalm
began and this was very serious chemical
warfare to destroy crops and livestock
to try to drive the rural population
into concentrated areas would called
strategic Hamlet's where they were being
protected against the guerrillas who the
US government knew very well they were
supporting we know this from internal
documents that have been released was no
protest none then in fact just to give
you an example when 1965 I guess I would
a four six 64 65 I happened to be
spending a year at Harvard as a visiting
fellow on cognitive science senator 19
February 1965 the war in South Vietnam
had already half destroyed the country
but the u.s. escalated the war to the
north and the individual who was
primarily responsible for this was
McGeorge Bundy nationals you recall
after play coolants yeah a couple of
students Bundy was being invited had
been invited to be the commencement
speaker at the June commencement for
Harvard and a couple of students
initiated a very mild petition asking
whether it's right to invite someone
who's just launched the war against
another country without provocation
since I was there they asked me to see
if I could get some faculty signatures
virtually impossible that was 1965 by
that time the war was already far
advanced in fact in October 1965 there
was an international day of protest
you were probably an elementary school
at the time yeah we're still in
elementary school and in Canada that was
awesome Asia but it wasn't international
Dave yeah it's interesting because you
know 60 so this was 65 yeah cuz one
thinks of the protest is being later of
course but already and maybe the
American media maybe you're gonna get
well what happened is interesting I'm
talking about Boston yeah the most
liberal city in the country yeah we
decided to try to have a demonstration
in Boston to join the international
demonstrations we went to the Boston
Common you know that chartered place
ever I was supposed to be one of the
speakers totally broken up by counter
demonstrators mostly students
incidentally I'm just coming to smash up
this demonstration of the Boston Globe
maybe the most liberal paper in the
country you look at the front page the
next day was denouncing the
demonstrators how dare you very much
like the Immortals of the Academy Hall
says how dare you attack our noble
institutions and so on this is October
1965 by then there was another
international day of protest in May in
March I think 1966 that we decided we
can't have a public meeting we'll have a
meeting in the church or on gin Street
Church Church was attacked at that time
Vietnam had literally almost been
destroyed at that just to give in a
Bernard fall who was the most respected
military historian Vietnam expert no
dove incidentally but cared about the
Vietnamese he wrote at that time that he
doubted that Vietnam would survive as a
cultural and historical entity under the
most serious attack that had ever been
launched against an area that size were
words roughly like that I think that was
at the point when we in liberal city of
Boston we couldn't have a demonstration
in a church without being attacked
well after that finally
opposition movement developed mostly
young people students and so on but
let's fast forward up to 1975 when the
war ended sends the war formally ended
of course everyone had to write about it
yeah act what what did it mean and you
look across the spectrum of public
opinion expressions public media major
media and they kind of break up into the
Hawks and the doves so roughly the Hawks
saying we were stabbed in the back we
didn't fight hard enough if we'd fought
harder we could have won yeah so on the
doves are always much more interesting
they set the kind of limits of possible
fought yeah this far but not only know
immediately so you go way to the end say
Anthony Lewis New York Times strong
critic of the war yeah Marion a very
interesting article he said the war
begun he said with blundering efforts to
do good blundering because it didn't
work to do good because that's a
tautology yeah you don't give arguments
for that that's kind of like saying two
plus two equals four yeah he's another
wild man in the wings yeah they said by
1969 it was clear that it was a disaster
we could not bring democracy to Vietnam
at a cost acceptable to ourselves so it
was really a terrible mistake now up to
the present about as far as you can go
to the critical side is to say it was a
mistake very interestingly at that point
a public opinion was being carefully
sampled the Chicago Council on Foreign
Relations does extensive studies of
public opinion very scholarly they're
1965-66 roughly then their report also
of course asked questions what would you
think about the Vietnam War and the
answers are interesting about 70% of the
population said it was not a mistake
it was fundamentally wrong
immoral now that question kept being
asked for another 15 years or so up to
about roughly 1990 the answers were all
approximately the same they stopped
asking it after a while yeah the last
time they asked at the distinguished
Social Sciences serious social scientist
who was in charge of the surveys John
really asked the question and comments
of what do people mean when they say
this and he said well what they mean is
too many American lives were being lost
well that's possible yeah would have
been possible to find out y ask another
question exactly but the other possible
answer namely they meant what they were
saying it's just totally discounted you
know this is the history of
intellectuals well you know okay well
and we'll come back to that cuz I want
to circle around to that eventually in a
different context but let let's and one
of the reasons I was happy to start with
historical perspective is of course it's
always it's always good to to look at
the present in that context I was just
reading a what is now one of my favorite
quotes of Mark Twain who said that
history may not repeat itself but it
sure rhymes a lot and I want to talk
about the in that context what's
happening around the world both what's
really happening and the perceptions of
what's really happening from
domestically to foreign I mean we could
talk for hours about that but we'll see
if we can limit this okay but let's pick
let's pick what's going on um
you pick your favorite we could start
with you know Venezuela we could start
with North Korea we could start with
Israel or Trump I want to I want to sort
of sort of go through these and see what
what what we're hearing and and and
what's really there because this notion
of American exceptionalism which is
seems to be so prevalent part of it is
the notion which which again brings me
back to when I when I first met you to
this notion that somehow the United
States is different because we always
want to do good other countries have
been imperial powers but their
intentions were not to do good and I
remember us saying at the time that if
you asked a five-year-old is it likely
that America's foreign policy is
governed by anything different than
anyone else throughout all of history
they'd say it's unlikely
but somehow the perception is that
intentionality is that the United States
really is altruistic and there and its
interventions around the world which may
been hadn't had bad consequences were
really well intended but they were
misplaced and I and I kind of still get
I still kind of see that and in the
interpretation of much much of what's
going on so well blonde or efforts to do
good yeah yeah and notice that the
five-year-old who you invented yeah read
with seventy percent of the population
at the end of the Vietnam War so so
let's take today's newspaper yeah okay
there's a article by David Sanger and
our York Times the leading one of the
leading security analysts yeah
an article about how to deal with the
Russian aggression the new new forms of
Russian aggression and intervention and
there's some interesting lines in it so
for example that this sentence not just
somewhere in the middle nothing special
saying it's about time for these quoting
somebody correct positively is saying
it's time for NATO to enhance its
defensive capacities at the Russian
border
does that strike anyone as funny I mean
is the Warsaw Pact
enhancing its defensive actions at the
Mexico border yeah yeah well no we're
exceptional if we happen to have forces
at the Russian border that's because its
defensive if we have ABM installations
at the Russian border which to actually
have dual use capacity of course and the
article in the bullet and the Atomic
Scientists the lead article by Theodore
Postol recent pointing that oh yeah even
if their defensive that's a first strike
weapon of course it's one of the
concerns yes both of those are fine I
can concern we have them there as
President Obama said in order to protect
Europe from irani and missiles which
don't exist exactly it always amazed me
about this notion
we were protecting her from missiles
zone exist which it just so happens that
it's offensive yes you had the Russian
border at the Russian border they it so
happens they're pointing at the
potentially at them yeah exactly if I
were but you won't see a comment about
this I'm sure because it's it's kind of
common sense sir and then well I mean
you know the first when you say that of
course one thinks about whether was
whether maybe putting missiles in Cuba
might have been defensive well in fact
it was we there's very good scholarship
on this but no and it's pretty well
agreed by mainstream scholarship what
the reasons were for her stuff to make
this very reckless move there were
basically two one was just what you said
the United States was carrying out a
major terrorist war against Cuba a very
serious terrorist and if the Russians
may not have known the details but they
certainly roughly news going on
certainly Cuba did in August 1962
Kennedy issued a national security
memorandum which called on the terrorist
operations operation Mongoose to be
enhanced leading to an effort to create
an insurrection in Cuba which would lead
the US intervention in October 1962 well
that's when the missiles went in I don't
think Castro and Khrushchev read the
internal law I like you could see what
was happening on the groan that's one
reason
there was another in the first Jeff when
he took took office recognized something
pretty obvious that the Russia could not
compete economically yeah the United
States the United States far more
advanced yeah in fact Western Europe
alone counterbalanced rush easily yeah
let alone the United States and Canada
so what he urged was a reduction a
mutual reduction in offensive weapons
in order to allow Russia to move towards
economic development the Kennedy
administration considered this rejected
it and instead though they knew they
were way ahead militarily launched the
biggest arms buildup in history I was a
very young de shortly after this one of
the reasons for four chefs placing the
missiles in Cuba was to try to somehow
minimally balance this notice
incidentally that there was a crucial
issue that almost led to nuclear war the
United States had was surrounding Russia
with missiles with nuclear weapons of
course that's like our defensive
behavior at the Russian border yeah
including missiles and Turkey
Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Kennedy
actually didn't know about this he made
some comment atomic Bundy saying it
would it's as if we had missiles and
Turkey and Bundy said we'll mr.
president
turned out they were obsolete missiles a
withdrawal order was already in process
because they were being replaced by
essentially invulnerable Polaris
submarines that's a much more lethal and
vulnerable so they were being replaced
they're obsolete Hersh Jeff put missiles
in Cuba to sort of try to know her
nearer balance yet to compensate
slightly for the overwhelming us
advantage and its refusal to not only
refusal to go along with his offer to
reduce missiles but weapons but even
enhancing them through the crisis as you
recall this issue of the missiles in
Turkey became critical yeah October 27th
peak moment of the crisis first chef
actually wrote a letter to Kennedy
saying let's get out of this before we
blow the world will remove the missiles
from Cuba you remove the missiles from
Turkey will do it publicly and it'll all
be over
at that time Kennedy's subjective
estimate of the probability of nuclear
war was reported to be about a half
third to a half you know utterly
outlandish yeah he refused this is
considered his and then for shift
basically back down yeah
so they made a kind of a secret
agreement but nothing public yeah we a
secret agreement meaning is we have a
right to keep in on the Russian border
obsolete missiles which we're replacing
by even more lethal ones but they don't
have a right to have anything anywhere
near us it's very similar today so we
have the right to enhance our defensive
capabilities on the Russian border which
are already enormous but if the Russians
dare to send anything to Venezuela we're
gonna blow the world up history rhymes
exactly it's it's useful to think about
it yeah we'll get in fact I was it's a
nice segue I'm glad you cuz I was gonna
go to Venezuela but at the same time
it's also worth mentioning that in terms
that the United States also was very by
that point it it it I think it it it had
subsided but the United States
especially during the period of extreme
military superiority were very seriously
considered for strikes as in order to
never renounce truce yeah we've never
announced for a strikes most people
don't realize that we still have that
we've never said we won't strike first
but what we've but at the time there
were serious discussions of a real first
strike in order to before Russia or the
Soviet then Soviet Union was able to
catch up and all these it then
Ellsberg's book which I'm sure well
that's later on my list yeah yeah in
fact I read it because use I want to
come back to that so we'll come back so
I think you made the perfect segue
because I wanted to hit Venezuela in
this concept I mean here we are doing
trying to quote-unquote at least if you
read the papers do good in Venezuela
we're end and whether it's blundering or
not so so I would like to hear your
perspective of our of our doing goodness
in Venezuela
what we're doing in Venezuela is
imposing extraordinarily harsh sanctions
which are cutting off virtually the
entire income of the country and
strangling the population the
populations opposed to the sanctions of
the leading economist of the opposition
and serious economist Francisco
Rodriguez one of the most serious
commentators on this he's opposed to the
sanctions he says they're turning a
serious problem into an utter
catastrophe of what we keep doing it
because we're trying to do good we want
to put into power our own guy quite oh
nothing much is known about him except
that he's a strong supporter of the
neo-fascist bolson ro who was just
installed next door Rosella yeah so
they're all kind of criticism of the
Maduro government which are quite
legitimate yeah I was gonna say why
should criticize I mean that government
is nothing it's very repressive it's
carrying out horrible economic policies
a lot wrong with it but why do we have
the right to impose the government of
our choice by strangling the population
into submission well there's nothing new
that I mean we try that so we try and do
it around right I mean I'm doing the
same thing in Iran I mean the idea is
the POW who's getting hurt by by
sanctions in Iran well the population
but what again what right do we have to
do that in fact you guys the same
question about China it's taken for
granted across the board I can't find an
exception that it's legitimate for the
United States and Europe in fact mostly
the United States to try to impede
China's economic development oh they're
moving forward they're trying to move
forward with a particular form of
economic development say we don't like
the way they're doing it so we'll try to
block their and economic development is
that legitimate in fact there are other
questions the sticking point in the
negotiations right now according to
trump as intellectual property rights
they are not observing intellectual
property rights what that means is
exorbitant patent restrictions radically
opposed to free trade that built into
the World Trade Organization system to
protect us corporations so we want Bill
Gates to be the richest man in the world
so therefore there's a essentially
monopoly for Windows a pharmaceutical
prices have to go out of sight so
therefore this huge patent restrictions
on for pharmaceuticals suppose China
decided not to observe them who suffers
well Bill Gates will have a little less
money users of computers will be able to
find better programs and windows
pharmaceutical corporations instead of
having you know trillions of dollars
we'll only have a few trillions people
will be able to buy cheaper drugs
I mean it's argued that this would cut
back innovation but if you look into it
that's not the way innovation takes
place takes a Windows I mean I don't
have to tell you the development of
computers software or internet and so on
that was all a textbook most of it at
taxpayer expense for decades it's never
the same with pharmaceuticals huge
there's a good reason why if you'd walk
around MIT you see a pharmacy you see
Pfizer
yeah yeah all the artists they're all
they were kind of feeding off the the
creative scientific work done at the
laboratories uh mostly at government
expense if he'd gone back there were 50
years ago you would have seen Raytheon I
was an error rate those are the big
that's because of electronics was kind
of the cutting edge of the economy ya
know it's biology so yeah but and this
is at every research university in the
country not just MIT sure so so going
back to China and the intellectual
property why should they observe the
intellectual property rights which
rammed through
the United States and other rich
countries and now let's look a little
history
how did England develop by stealing
technology from more advanced countries
like India or the Low Countries even
Ireland they haven't had the United
States developed by stealing technology
from India from England that's why we
got a textile industry steel industry
and so on of course it wasn't called
stealing then it was just that's the way
it developed every single developed
countries developed that way then comes
something that economic historians call
us taking away the ladder at first you
climb the ladder then you kick it away
so nobody else can do it well that's
kind of what lies behind all of this
lies behind the effort to try to impede
Chinese economic development by things
like demanding intellectual property
rights do you see any discussion of this
not in the mainstream media that I can
of course you can find some yeah yeah
Dean Baker yeah good economist he writes
about it but it's basically out of off
the agenda now I one would assume that
well since American isn't exceptional
except sometimes maybe exceptionally bad
in certain cases but but what what's
happened but is that is reverse
happening I mean and as and how does he
nice states respond I mean I assume
other countries are trying to do the
same thing the United States impede
economic progress it's rational there's
a couple of things wrong with the
concept of American exceptionalism the
one is the facts you know yeah okay yeah
the other is it's not American yeah
every great power has had the same
exceptionalism Britain when it was
virtually genocide all over the world
was praising itself on its magnificence
sure I mean they all had the civilized
mission well the French Minister of War
was calling on the army to exterminate
the population of Algeria if we had
records from Mattila the hunt and he
would probably be just overwhelmed with
good
the fact that every country's thought
that they've been the unique source of
goodness and because of there's nothing
exceptional about our mother well but
since it is an exceptional what about is
diversity giving examples are our other
countries I mean other countries are
trying to assumedly impede American
economic progress and what's the
response here how can they impede
American economic well well I guess that
I mean let me let me just let me give
you I'm not an economist my ignorance is
gonna show here but I'm assuming you
should know better than to judge
specialists but I mean it's to some
extent China can impede American
progress by being able to produce the
same goods and services much more
cheaply but MIT was producing them in
China US corporations who want a funk my
work in China if US corporations don't
like Chinese rules they can invest
somewhere else but there's an article in
today's New York Times that said exactly
that right it was the response to some
of the pressure and Trump one might say
is I don't know if you saw this article
but it was basically saying there's some
impact to what's going on and some
companies are stopping having made
things in China but what they're doing
is not bringing back the United States
are just finding another place to do it
yeah which is that but but the idea that
it's unfair for China to impose
technology transfer restrictions or
partial ownership restrictions on say
Boeing is it's not a question of
national policy if Boeing doesn't like
that nobody's forcing them to invest
there yeah okay
so what right do we have to punish them
for trying to do then well quite apart
from the fact that the whole his that's
how we develop how England develop Oh
everybody develop let's hit some other
hot-button issue won't spend the whole
time in foreign policy because I want to
I want our last I like I want to cover a
broad area okay and I want to do it
around books actually so I started with
Emerson just for fun but but let's hit
North Korea I think I'd like to talk
about North Korea Syria a little bit and
maybe Brazil because we're talking about
and it's and interesting enough I think
because it's something that I haven't
read about before and so there may be my
ignorant but anyway so what about North
Korea
well actually that Trump is not my
favorite person yeah you know yeah but
on North Korea basically I think he's
doing the right things and he's attacked
for it on all sides but whenever he does
something more or less right why I don't
know maybe he's shooting arrows ran the
blood is my son I try to re now and then
I'll get it whatever the reasons are but
let's take a look at North Korea on just
the recent history April 27th I think it
was 2017 the two Koreas met an issue as
negotiated and issued a very serious
document a historic document Panmunjom
that declaration were very serious it
affects a good article about it and
foreign affairs of all places yeah for
the first time they not only made
rhetorical commitments towards
denuclearization towards integration
there and as foreign affairs pointed out
made concrete proposals here we'll do it
step-by-step and then it said the two
Koreas will do this on their own accord
incursio lee yeah on their own accord
meaning leave us alone we know who
they're talking to
yeah okay Trump is the one leading
figure for whatever reason who's more or
less observed this the Singapore summit
for which Trump was bitterly denounced
by the Liberals the Conservatives by
everyone he basically said will you guys
go ahead on your own accord
yeah I mean even took steps towards
reducing what he recognized to be
provocative military operations American
military operations in South Korea
remember what's going on and these
operations the u.s. is flying nuclear
capable aircraft
right at the border of a country that
the u.s. wiped out literally wiped out
yeah back in the early 50s I mean by the
time the war settled into a kind of a
stalemate what was happening was the
eustress is bombing massively they
couldn't find any more targets you read
the official Air Force history they
describe how well we nothing a bomb will
just bomb the dams which is a huge war
crime yeah yeah and then it discusses
how it's interesting to read how
euphoric they were about bombing this
huge dam and a massive flood of waters
as whomping all this area and Asian's a
little bit of racism yeah depend on rice
and where they're fleeing and they're
screaming and so on this is the country
that we're now flying nuclear on bombers
right on their border so yes it is
provocative and the Trump said well
let's let's cut back some of this I mean
I'm not saying what he said was
wonderful but the right direction
well we accept what he says and what he
does are not always exactly the same and
and you know the one thing it's usually
to me that after all this bluster the
foreign policy is somewhat coming back
to what might have been considered more
realistic I mean either the last the
last dialogue broke off because once
again the United States said unless
you're totally disarmed we're not going
to we're not going to reduce actions at
which it just seems to me to be
completely unrealistic oh that's oh I
think you know I don't know the inside
story yeah it looks like Pompeo and bold
yeah I mean it seems as if Trump's
instinct was to say we'll go ahead he
was kind of pushed and remember he's
under attack from all sides yeah the
liberals attack him even more sharply
than this sharply as the Hawks but as I
say of all the major political actors
here he seems on this issue anything to
be the one who's closest to being what I
would regard as taking the same position
letting the two Koreas proceed on their
own accord as they've asked and I think
that that's what's going on pinning I
guess agrees that that's what if it's
gonna if this quote-unquote crisis is
gonna resolve
itself it's gonna happen to some extent
internally if we allow it to be the case
that's the weight that's mean only hope
North Korea's or ours cannot help ya and
North Korea I think really recognizes
that a greater alliances with South
Korea will be beneficial debt and South
Korea well I some president moon is
following a pretty reasonable path well
let's say okay since we since you
mentioned the T word let's let's start
let's we'll come back to foreign but
let's talk about Trump because of course
that's all anyone seems to talk about
and discussions of Trump dominate all
everything else we don't hear about any
other issues and I wonder what we maybe
we could talk about that a little bit
well Trump is a very effective con man
isn't doing it gotta praise him for his
achievements yeah narrow set of skills
but he's using them very effectively
he's got the major media completely
wrapped around his little finger he
manipulates them totally one crazy thing
after another they talk about that then
they say it doesn't make any sense and
everybody's forgotten because he's on to
the next one so one day it's let's
eliminate the whole health system
everybody attacks that two days later
says let's stop all traffic across the
Mexican border which of course we shut
down the economy everyone points that
out and then the next day it'll be
something else meanwhile he's carrying
out a very effective job you probably
saw the article in The New York Times a
couple days ago about how he's totally
taken over the Republican Party yeah and
top the bottom there's no his party and
remember two years ago the Republican
establishment hated him yeah okay now
he's taken over the whole party and he's
caring he's carrying out something
pretty set of all this should not be
much of a surprise if you look back for
the last 10 or 15 years
even little beyond during the neoliberal
period since basically Reagan both
parties have shifted to the right
the Democrats are kind of what used to
be called moderate Republican house the
Republicans have just gone off the edge
yeah uh Norman Ornstein Thomas man of
American enterprises to describe them
plausibly as a radical insurgency which
is given up parliamentary polls yeah I
mean the health care plan that now is
what and Reagan's time would have been
way off yeah yeah look if you read
Eisenhower no he sounds like Bernie
Sanders we've gone so forth literally
okay so what what's happened either
Barry all Republicans are so I'm in both
parties or essentially business parties
but the Republicans just with abject
subordination to Wilson corporate power
kanka votes that way so they've been
forced to try to mobilize constituencies
which in the past weren't really major
political constituencies and to try to
get them to be the base of the party on
what are called ridiculously cultural
issues so gun rights abortion religious
fanaticism xenophobia whatever maybe and
this has been showing up in the
primaries for quite a while so over the
past years in every Republican primary
when somebody comes up from the base
they're out of way out of the out yeah
Michele Bachmann Rick Santorum yeah and
the establishment has been able to crush
them get there Mitt Romney types yeah
the difference in 2016 was they couldn't
crush this time the crazy guy from the
outfield got in now the base he's got
the base behind him and he's controlling
them and he's carrying out a very
effective policy how much he understands
what he's doing I have no idea yeah it's
megalomania but likely he's got two
constituencies he's got to keep
supporting him the primary constituency
is the one of the Republican Party
the very rich the corporate sector so
okay we hand that task over to Mitch
McConnell Paul Ryan and REM through the
legislation which stuffs pockets with
even more dollars and chefs everyone
else and so on that's going beautifully
the rich and the corporation's have
profits zooming they don't know what to
do with them trillions of dollars they
can't spend the wealthy are doing
magnificently that the tax scam the one
legislative achievement we don't have to
talk about it yeah so that's one
constituency me and why you've got to
control the voting base how do you do
that throw him a little red meat build a
wall to keep out the rapists and
murderers shift you know love Israel
shift the embassy for the evangelicals
yeah one thing after another he's
carrying it off the base adores him
while they're getting shafted I mean
that's always been the Ameer markable
thing is how people could always vote
against their own so it's doing very
well and what are the Democrats doing
helping him like actually focus on the
Miller investigation which was
tactically crazy was obvious from the
beginning that if anything's gonna come
out of that it'll be the Trump was by
trying to build a hotel when the Red
Square yeah I think so minor corruption
yeah I'm not saying that in retrospect
I've been saying it for a long time all
right what they've done now is probably
maybe even hand from the 20/20 election
but just instead of the real issues like
hey you're destroying the environment
for for future life you're building up
your your Nuclear Posture review is
greatly extending the likelihood of
total catastrophe you're pouring money
into the pockets of the super-rich and
issuing regulations and executive orders
and legislation which is harming the
working class and everyone else instead
of that Trump is gonna Miller's gonna
show that the Russians interfered with
the election and you helped you know the
Russians couldn't I mean if the Russians
interfered with the elections it was
undetectable
I mean it's trivial um there is after
all massive interference with the
election yeah like they're bought yeah
okay you can predict the outcome of a
pump Ferguson's work as the main work on
this your showing you there's this
relation to what he called the
investment theory of politics with
remarkable precision way back right
through 2016 you can predict
electability for the executive and
Congress simply with the single variable
of campaign spending and that's just the
beginning
is that interference with elections yeah
it means that as for a good working lead
academic political science shows most of
the population is literally
unrepresented their own representatives
pay no attention to their preferences
they listen to other voices think the
Supreme Court decision in that regard in
terms of in terms of money spent on
elections was significant or not it's
changed but it's changed some things
that already exists yeah it's or maybe
you go back to 1895 marcano
who was the famous campaign manager was
asked once what does it take to run a
run an effective campaign he said there
are two things the first thing is money
and I forgotten what the second one is
that was 1895 of course you know the
recent decisions Buckley v Valeo in
citizens united have enhanced that
enormous Lee but it's goes way back well
the other thing that we talked about
history and statements and I forget
whether it's growing your gurbles who
said that if you want to if you want to
get people to do what you want them to
do it doesn't matter with Ava demmick
democracy or dictatorship just make them
afraid
and and that seems to also in some sense
being being effect on this whole notion
of immigrants being being that greatest
danger facing the United States the
opposite of most of American history in
fact is is I'm finding it kind of
amazing to see how effects work it works
and and again there's a long history
Hofstadter talked about anti
intellectualism yeah another kind of
striking feature of American culture
from way back is that although this is
the most secure country in the world by
any objective standard locking our
oceans around probably the most
frightened yeah it's a very frightened
country that lies behind partly there's
a lot more but suppose one of the things
that lies behind this kind of in crazed
gun culture and why do you have to have
25 assault rifles in your closet they're
coming after me you know I gotta protect
myself
yeah it comes in again it's an issue
that hope we're gonna cut get when we
come back in some sense it but you know
that this recent book by John hate and
others about the coddling of the
American mind if argued that that level
of being frightened affects people's
behavior on a micro scale as well the
notion that every time your kids leave
the house they're in danger and they
should never be in danger and never be
in risk somehow comes into the notion
that they should never be uncomfortable
they shouldn't be uncomfortable in
school they shouldn't hear ideas they
don't want everything as a threat and it
is true I think that I remember when
when I I spent a year and in in
Switzerland when at the at CERN when my
daughter was younger she was my daughter
was I remember at eight or nine or ten
and she was really afraid of going
outside the house on her own in living
where we lived at the time and it was
remarkable to see when she was in
Switzerland that you know I would drive
my car and I'd suddenly see her and her
friends downtown and and so this notion
of every time you leave the house the
world is terrifying really does seem to
be an American kindness it's recent when
I was a kid in the 30s and early 40s
when I was I lived in Philadelphia yeah
when I was maybe 12 years old I used to
take the train by myself to New York and
the day walking around anarchist
bookstores yeah my parents didn't know
that was the Abba Matt was there you see
if they just control it was not
considered yeah anything like when I
grew up in Canada but it was still the
same for me in Toronto I stick the the
the subway car down in 20 minutes
clogging when I we moved into the
suburbs when my kids were little and
this place we I mean you can't imagine a
place that's more safe kids were playing
in the streets they'd go into each
other's houses and so on you go to the
same neighborhood now you don't see a
child either they were inside looking at
the video games or they're being driven
somewhere for organized activities kids
it's been in fact studied children don't
know how to play spontaneously
everything has to be controlled they
have to be watched all the time if if
they're you know somewhere maybe in you
know Aragon kid got kidnapped everything
in the country has to close down yeah
yeah I mean the dangers back in the 30s
and 40s were far greater but it just
wasn't an issue yeah I know it's very
interesting this business of the Trump
knows what he's doing when he builds up
fear of the rapists and murderers and
Islamic terrorists just to give an
example a couple of weeks ago Steve
Bannon you know is yes kind of Rasputin
came down to Arizona where we live in
Tucson and there was a meeting he ran a
meeting at a very luxurious gated
community south of Tucson not too far
from the border you know guards gates
are very rich and so on the perp had a
lot of nice people they were like Crisco
botch this guy who's trying to keep
people from voting yeah there was a good
report of it and a kind of a independent
Tucson newspaper through sun-sentinel
had a reporter there the goal of the
meeting was to try to raise private
money to build the wall because Congress
is run by communists you know they are
not doing
so all these super-rich people are
pitching in money to fill the wall but
the discussions were interesting a
people were describing how frightened
they are I mean if there's anybody in
the world safer than them I don't know
how you'd find them yeah but these are
people who are frightened we got to
protect ourselves in fact there was one
legislator there who said I'm not only
in favor of the wall I think we ought to
have a wall from the border right along
the Arizona border against California
all the way up to the Canadian border
because these people are going to come
in from California you know yeah we've
got to protect ourselves and not only do
maybe we need an army to protect us
around the gated community but yeah and
when Trump talks to the public at least
according to the reports that come up
people resume ya know it's it really
works affected I never know what's Trump
whether it's an accident or whether he's
plant you know whether he really knows
what he's doing whether they just
latches on by luck to an issue that that
seems to resonate any and he uses oh
yeah and then pick it up he just tests
to the water and he's doing that very
but meanwhile you have to remember that
his primary constituency corporate power
yeah wealthy he's serving them with real
dedication we would you say that in
terms of enemy I don't want to harp on
this too much but it in terms of the
greatest danger if there is one of Trump
being president many people feel that
the fact that he's loose can and the
fact that he does no no no no reading no
knowledge about details about the world
around or certainly doesn't read or
listen to his advisers would you say
that's a bigger danger than the fact
that effectively he's apparently
implementing underneath all the noise
the the an agenda that that that you
worry about her no I mean there's a lot
of dangers with drunk the worst one
which overwhelms everything else is the
dedication to destroy the environment
yeah yeah I mean that just swamps
everything else that ought to be a
screaming headline everyday wait I'm
surprised that if
if-if-if private money wanted to build
the wall eight point six billion is not
enough money for that could easily be
done I mean more than that spent on
Elections that but but interestingly
enough when you put in perspective
talking about the environment talking
about about progress eight point six
billion which is what he's asking for
the wall was more is more than the
entire amount the entire budget of the
National Science Foundation
I mean if when talks about what is
better for our security in the future
now how about the subsidies to the
fossil fuel industry much bigger than
that how about the subsidies to the
financial institutions there's some good
technical studies IMF and others who
point out that the financial
institutions which are pretty much
predatory they don't they barely help
the economy they may harm it and they're
a huge part of the economy a huge as
they are maintained effectively by
public subsidy by the implicit
government insurance policy which raises
their credit ratings gives them access
to cheap money when you count all of
that it's pretty much their profits I
mean compared with this the wool and the
National Science Foundation aren't even
visible ya know that's I mean it's
interesting to think about that I mean
and similarly when we come to the
climate change and and all those this is
it that's the the two things that oughta
be emphasized by the political
opposition if there were one or this
dedicated commitment to destroy the
prospects for organized human life
within a short period and the radical
intensification of the already extremely
dangerous arms continent is gonna hit
that that those I think I know that
we're from our discussions those that
said I think there's another danger that
we shouldn't forget I was personally
very relieved when the Miller
investigation didn't come up with much
because if they had come up with
something that really implicates Trump
we would have been in deep trouble
I mean he's a narcissistic megalomaniac
he's kind of like the magician behind
the curtain and The Wizard of Oz and
those that's a very thin cover if
anything breaks he could go for broke
there's plenty that he could do people
worried about what you know and I don't
know who said it in fact that that that
well Mabel is James Comey not someone
who's I Oh agree with all the time but
that that he was worried that that
exactly that would happen and it would
lead to some kind of and there be
violence that would bill he's he's
already indicated his dog whistling is
worth listening to
so take his attacks on John McCain which
people are wondering why why is he
talking John McCain yes well this very
good article on this by verse Franklin
for a good analyst who's also the
leading specialist on the POWs ethology
you know there's a lot of the country
still believes that the North Koreans
are the North Vietnamese are holding all
sorts of American POWs in the terrible
thing and McCain is one of their
villains because he's part of the myth
is that he's the one who sold people out
helping keep our brave American boys
there
Rambo has to go in and rescue them and
so on that's a pretty big thing in a
sector of the country a sector of the
country that Trump openly talks to when
he talks about how his bikers are tough
guys and they're gonna really cause
trouble that's how he's talking to when
he attacks McCain he's talking to them
he's throwing them the red meat this is
clever politics and very dangerous this
is a very violent country um their
militias all over probably better armed
than the National Guard you know Laura
desperate angry people people have been
hit by the stagnation of the neoliberal
period there's economic distress there's
concern that
somehow that weights that the white
population is as they put it facing
genocide meaning we might not be a
majority in a couple of decades all of
this is very real and when these dog
whistling attacks on McCain and the you
know the the hints about the Mexican
rapists over coming us and destroying us
all of us talking to a sector of the
population that's very real is under a
kind of distress stemming largely back
from economic policies that right at the
top that are creating the kinds of
situation which we know are there's
something similar in Europe all all of
this converges and when you get this
again narcissistic megalomaniac who's a
clever politician sitting right at the
top of it and pulling the strings it's
it's a fragile system but it's working
and very dangerous okay well so since
we're on a lifting area and let me join
think of any buttons we haven't pushed
yet before we move on and I think it's
we probably should push this button at
least one so let's talk about Syria and
Israel for a little bit and see if we
can alienate the part of the public we
haven't so far so Syria Israel well on
Syria is a total disaster the country's
yeah been virtually destroyed we can
look at the history but here again I'm
afraid I disagree with many many of my
friends on the left on this at one of
the Trump proposals was a to leave a
small contingent of troops in a sector
of northern Syria which is mostly
Kurdish correct yeah I think that's a
good idea
you know anti interventionist just block
out on this we've got to take him out
they have no right to be there and so on
but think it through for a second the
Turkish army is military is carrying out
again it's done worse before serious
atrocities against Kurds in Turkey
itself and in the areas of Syria that
they have occupied recently offering if
they move on to Roja the other mostly
Kurdish areas that will just continue
what's stopping them small contingent of
US troops which are confined to the
Syrian or areas and are not intervening
elsewhere in Syrian affairs
I don't like US troops to be anywhere
but in this case I think it's not out of
humanitarian goals whatever the goals
may be it may be helping to avert a
serious catastrophe I think those are
things that are worth thinking about not
just kind of an axiom yes get them out
gets troops home period you have to
think about what the meaning is it's not
like a justification for humanitarian
intervention which is always a fraud
yeah this is a matter of assessing the
actual situation that exists independent
of intentions whether it has a good
health nothing to do with intentions you
know it's those we can put aside though
the intentions we know I mean up until
under Obama until about 2015 the US and
its allies incidentally France England
we believed that it would be possible to
overthrow the Assad regime and we're
committed to doing so finally I think
was around 2013-2014 the u.s. the CIA
sent
advanced anti-tank missiles to the
opposition which by then is mostly jihad
Iran which did stop the Syrian army
advance predictably the Russians
intervened with more force started
sending the air force took out the tow
missiles sold army went on at that point
pretty much the West accepted the fact
that like it or not this monster Rennie
is a monster I will probably control
most of the country and since then
whatever planning or negotiations
taking place are mostly out of the
West's hands it's Russia Iran Syria or
pretty much running the show like it or
not and there's not a lot that no US can
do about that the even if it should but
yeah with regard to suit at the Israel
there's a lot to say about this but the
the support what's called the support
for Israel here it's very reminiscent of
old-fashioned Stalinism
it's extraordinary when you look into it
up to the level of books published by
university presses which are just full
of outlandish lies and fabrications at
denouncing anybody me of course yeah who
dares to raise a minor criticism about
the holy state the level of lying is
spectacular could go into examples but
it's my weather let me okay good go on
but I was not even worth talking about
that but but the there's a kind of a
desperate effort now on the part of
those who supported the will call
themselves supporters of Israel I don't
think that's the right term I think
their supporters of Israel's moral
degeneration and maybe ultimate
destruction but that's another story who
call themselves supporters of Israel
since the 1970s have increasingly been
finding their backs to the wall because
public opinion is changing mm-hmm
strikingly especially among younger
people polls are very clear even
personal experience is very clear so
look up till maybe 10 years ago if I
gave a talk about Israel Palestine at a
university in my own University and I
had that police protection that police
had to follow me out to my car because
meetings were broken up nobody was
worrying about free speech at
universities yeah well we'll get to that
yeah that's changed that's changed in
fact among people who identify
themselves as Liberal Democrats actually
support for Palestinian rights is even
higher than
at this point support for Israel has
gone to the most reactionary parts of
the population evangelical Christians
and xenophobes the Democratic Party used
to be the base for as a sport for Israel
it still is but nothing like the
Republicans they were extreme Trump of
courses but what I mean but at the same
time when with a recent discussion about
you know the Golan Heights I read it and
I heard that there was some concern but
then I didn't see any big outcry it's
pretty interesting
I mean the the Golan Heights have been
recognized internationally including the
United States as occupied territory the
u.s. signed supported the Security
Council resolutions resolutions
declaring that Israeli efforts to take
over the heights and in particular their
annexation of the heights which they did
is absolutely illegal has no basis
international law can be accepted that
was true up until Trump a couple of
weeks ago he just reversed it okay now
they're allowed to take it over anybody
talking about it no I was amazed I mean
meant people mentioned and then I'm sort
of sudden outcry about it after you say
well maybe it's not tactically good
might alienate somebody then the idea is
well israel needs this first defense
this is outlandish I mean the Israeli
military overwhelms everyone in the area
combined you know quite apart from the
fact that they have a big nuclear
arsenal but they're the military force
in the region yeah one of the major of
the Golan Heights it's not defense what
they want it because it's nice territory
you have its economic it's it's a very
nice area you have the ski ski low the
skis on the Mount Hermon build
agricultural communities a nice place to
visit and live they want it okay there's
there's no military threat there well
I'll always I suppose it's about and
when people say the husband owes that
their border yeah as follows not them in
significant military force
but the only respect in which they were
threat to Israel the only respect is if
Israel attacks Lebanon they'll fight
back and that is a threat to Israel so
in fact if Israel were to proceed with
its occasionally announced plans to
attack Iran probably the first thing
they do is wipe out Lebanon just to
prevent the deterrence of Hezbollah or
missiles so yes that's a threat if you
like we might ask the same question
about what the Iranian threat is
supposed to be who is around threatening
I'm supposed to Iran had nuclear weapons
I mean where's the threat I mean if they
dared to arm a missile with nuclear
weapons the country to be wiped out yeah
yeah you know it's it's a in fact US
intelligence is pretty clear about this
if you look at their presentations to
Congress over many years they've pointed
out that basic picture is that Iran has
very low military expenditures by the
standards of the region alone the United
States but that's different its
strategic posture is defensive trying to
set up to ensure that it can react to
aggression sufficiently so diplomacy
will take over they say if it were to
develop nuclear weapons they would be
part of its deterrent strategy well I've
always mean as someone who's always been
concerned about missile defense which is
which is an oxymoron in some way in so
many ways we could go into it doesn't
work first of all but but but that came
back to what you said in Europe I've
always been remains that the people say
that we're defending Europe from Iranian
missile what what possible purpose would
Iran have to to launch missiles at
Europe right if they only want had a
suicidal impulse yeah yeah of course the
country would be worried I've never seen
that question that's and that's oh
that's the Liberals remember this is
Obama yeah no he was the one who was
putting the missile installations on the
okay well we've gone on it foreign
affairs to drop more than I might have
but I think it was important in this
context but let but let me take it back
because you raised something interesting
that you can now you're fine and you're
able to give talks
police protection on certain issues at
the same time I actually had a quote
from one of your books were which I
think I used in our last dialogue but
but which was originally I think a quote
that was set up from Catholic priests in
South America talking about the
educational system and they said
educational systems are oriented to
maintaining the existing social and
economic structures instead of
transforming them and this notion that
we started with the notion that
intellectuals and leads aren't
necessarily are sort of by the party
line almost more than anyone else but I
see another issue that's really become
more pronounced since we last had our
dialogue which is this issue of free
speech and in this case free speech on
campuses you may be able to speak more
freely but one is finding more and more
to things that are remarkable
interesting and maybe is some extent
disturbing that is first of all that
that we're seeing more and more speakers
especially on the right to some extent
but but almost every subject area being
stopped from spigen camp is not but
meant by students in this case that the
notion that there was there was a there
was a lecture that was happening in a
university in the West where the speaker
was coming to speak about due process
and free speech and there were and safe
rooms were set up on campus so the
students didn't have to hear discussions
about this yet it's an issue that seems
to now be adopted by the right that that
that there if you look at and saying who
was speaking out and again one of the
try you know Trump's executive order may
be impotent but the notion that Trump
would would put an executive order
saying universities can't get federal
funding unless they promote free
speeches is kind of interesting this
notion that that the left in some ways
is is now being seen as not promoting
free speech so I thought I we we should
have that discussion a little bit
well I'd question the notion the list
but it's certainly happening yeah and
it's it's wrong in principle and beyond
that it's just tactically insane
it's the best gift that you can give to
the right yeah if some
right wing's speaker tries to go to a
campus and is blocked it's a gift
that's they love it and you can see the
way they're using it this is oh okay
weird that we're the good guys you're
defending freedom of speech you guys are
Nazis trying to protect so if you want
if you want to give enormous gifts to
the right-wing and the far right to the
neo-fascist that's the way to do it
exactly but it's even broader than that
I think that there's some concern and
you know two people that I obviously am
NOT a fan of Trump I'm not a fan of
Betsy DeVos I've written about how
opposed many of our aspects but she but
but there's another aspect of this
notion which comes back to the people
being afraid in the United States this
notion that words have to be protected
with it yeah that words are scary that
there needs to be safe zones that
trigger warning trigger warnings that
when you when you would think and I've
always said this in the context of
science but I think it's true more
generally one of the purposes of
Education I used to say to science but
one of the purposes of Education is to
make people uncomfortable
because if you're comfortable you're not
pushing that you're you're not pushing
the boundaries of what you know
understand and if we if we I was just at
a lecture where somewhere where where
people are saying they've changed their
curriculum for because they're if they
upset students they're worried that
universities will remove them from
teaching and and that that seems to me
especially an environment where our at
least our higher educational system has
been very effective in educating
students more more so maybe than the
public school system I'm as concerned
about you I think your your the fact
that the right is usurping an issue that
will come back to haunt others is one
thing but I'm more I'm equally concerned
about the fact that people are afraid of
ideas or or discussions that make them
uncomfortable that's first of all that's
always been true but census was always
the mainstream who was fighting off the
wild men in the wings nobody noticed it
now we're noticing it
uh-uh it was wrong then and it's wrong
now it's even worse No
the idea that somehow like what you said
you have to have special places where
students won't hear things this is
totally crazy
I mean if a speaker comes in who you
think is extremely offensive first of
all you don't have to go to the talk if
you don't want exactly at the same thing
to do which sometimes is done is to use
it use the opportunity as an educational
opportunity yeah go listen to them
meanwhile set up alternative forums
where you discuss the issues you think
about them you look at the pros and cons
nothing is ever 100% obvious let's let's
go through it let's come out with a
reasonable position we'll have a basis
if it's the correct outcome to oppose
their positions not just shout them down
saying well we're so scared of them we
can't even hear it exactly shout them
down play music so they can't talk even
if they're allowed on campus it's I've
had enough of that in my own experience
but that's not the reason it's wrong
whoever does it when the right wing is
targeted its tactically crazy when the
left is targeted doesn't matter because
nobody pays attention anyway yeah but
when those who have some basis in power
systems are attacked then it's
tactically ridiculous because it's
giving them an enormous gift well what I
what I never see is this recognition
well I very rarely see it of the fact
that the whole purpose of free speech is
to protect the speech of those you
detest and perhaps that's what a
democracy is supposed to in principle
but the people who have upheld that have
always been bitterly denounced on every
issue well and but you know what's I
couldn't give you many examples yeah but
I'm pretty sure I mean as someone who
sort of grew up in the 60s to see that
the people that I used to think of as
progressive that are now supporting
exactly the opposite but that was the
60s yeah and remember the 60s was the
period when even the Supreme Court
really for the first time took strong
positions in support of freedom of
speech that's not American history it's
worth remembering that first of all the
first
does not protect freedom of speech it
prevents prior restraint yeah but if I
give a talk criticizing the government
First Amendment permits them to put me
into jail as long as they didn't stop me
from saying it in the first place
First Amendment's a very weak barrier to
repression and in fact a freedom of
speech issues didn't arise at the court
level Supreme Court until the twentieth
century and if you look at the history
it's not uplifting the first protections
of freedom of speech sort of were during
the First World War the famous dissents
of Homs and Burundi yes
notice first of all they were dissents
secondly they were very limited so in
the shank case the first case where
shank is and the guy was being sent you
know sentenced for having written
pamphlets against the war the dissenters
homes voted in favor of the of the
decision they said well you know too far
was going gotta have a little freedom
speech but nevertheless did it it's a
very mixed record up until the sixties
the first strong defense of freedom
speech by the court was actually in 1964
that's times V Sullivan and when there
was civil rights issue when the state of
Alabama declared that they were being
libeled by the Martin Luther King and
the civil rights movement because you
know racist sheriffs were being attacked
kind of technically they were right by
the thinking of the framers but the
Supreme Court overruled what's called
sovereign immunity yeah that this state
is protected from harmful speech which
holds in most countries incidentally
including Canada including Britain they
still have this yeah but the United
States struck it down then there was
even a further further decisions
relative Berg the Ohio took a very
strong position in faith
freedom speech that's 1969 that's not
American history
yeah so yes there is a modern tradition
of protection of freedom of speech but
it's it's not deeply rooted or sturdy
and when say Clarence Thomas recently
said we got to review these decisions
because that's not what the framers had
in mind he's not wrong you know if you
really look back at the history but
nevertheless it's true that among the
countries of the world the United States
is probably supreme and protection of
freedoms yeah I know that's what I grew
up in Canada and I used to do history of
candidates yeah it's amazing to see how
those protections were more over here
than a Solomon Rushdie case yeah when
this came up in Canada there was a
question debated about whether he was
attacking the state religion and they
finally decided he wasn't so it was okay
because it was some other religion in
fact in Britain that same case there
were remember this was when he was
criticizing his long yes it went to the
House of Lords and they considered they
said well he isn't liable because he was
condemning Islam if he'd been condemning
the Anglican Church yeah it would have
been a different story
that's Britain we're not talking about
Nazi Germany yeah yeah I know it so
these are very thin reads and like in in
France for example there are laws
I mean I'm bitterly condemned for having
criticized them but there are laws in
France that grant the state the right to
determine historical truth and to punish
deviation from what they determine and
that's been used okay and French left
intellectuals supported no we've got to
stop the speech we don't like yeah I
mean this stuff is very thin and the
United States by and large has
comparatively a good record but the
things you're pointing out or hitting
away at some of the best things that
have happened here and unfortunately it
is coming from
students young people who just aren't
thinking through what they're doing not
thinking through and have been brought
up too and I think to fear anything that
that that a little bit uncomfortable it
makes them a little bit uncomfortable
but again in the sciences I mean the
whole history of the sciences is people
challenging common sense that's what
exactly it's what science it's all about
if it wasn't you know if we weren't
uncomfortable we're not making progress
it's yeah so I think okay good I'm glad
we got that ELISA because I'm critically
concerned about it and anyone who's
being at universities I think is seeing
it in a way I've never remembered goes
on also it's like yeah I teach at the
University of Arizona yeah right now the
there's a legislation at the state level
requiring that at the University of
Arizona if a department invites a
speaker of a or if a faculty member
invites somebody to come to their class
they have to inform the legislature yeah
so if if I invite somebody to talk on
theoretical linguistics
I gotta inform the legislature make sure
there's no communist infiltrators yeah
no it's a yes was that when I found
something similar when I moved to
Arizona okay let's see I wanna we I want
to come back to another book I was the
two books I wanted to mention that in
fact were books that you got me to look
at one was Daniel Ellsberg which I think
I'll come back to after the other one
was this book by Katherine Nixie the
Dark Age the amazing boom it's an
amazing book which shows basically how
Christianity effectively in a way that
makes Isis look tame destroyed the
classical world and and and I bring it
up because we've had this discussion
before and and I I'm known for my
concerns about religion in many ways and
I remember you saying to me that one of
the first times we talked that you
didn't it wasn't what people believed
that bothered you is what they did and I
and I countered by saying that's true
but I think what they what they believe
radically affects what they do and when
I when I and and I I was thinking about
that book recently with another article
of
Mike Pompeo and his how is evangelical
Christianity has affected his role as a
secretary of state and exactly how he
approaches not just the Middle East
everywhere else and so I continue to
think that there's just insidious impact
of of religion in this case Christian
religion but it happens obviously in the
Islamic world and so I wanted to talk to
you about it in this movie you know it's
mixed story I mean you know it's a
complicated story Morris can't get a
couple thousand years of his yeah but
yeah if you think about it and abroad
we have morning superficial he ran a
picture the Christianity in the early
days was radical pacifist and Christians
were persecuted as Nixie points out yeah
a lot of it was purposeful martyr yeah
because the Classical period was fairly
tolerant unbelief was a hollow theistic
so you know you believe not God I
believe in this cause that's the door
doesn't matter and but nevertheless
there was persecution sure when
Constantine turned Christianity into the
religion of the Roman Empire and the
Cross shifted from being a symbol of
persecution to being on the shield of
the roman legionnaires
yeah everything changed first of all the
radical Christians it went on a rampage
as you say it makes Isis look pretty
tame yeah they virtually destroyed the
rich complex pretty tolerant classical
culture statues paintings literature
philosophy everything had to go and they
instituted a dark ages of
totalitarianism literally for a
millennium yes well you know yeah there
was a totalitarian God who not only
controlled you but looked into your mind
you had to do what he said it's I don't
want to over exaggerate there were
exceptions but it was a real kind of
totalitarian era for a millennium and
it's a God who who would not only
punishes you while you're on earth but
for eternity yeah
I forget Augustine st. Augustine's
phrase something like merciful terror or
something like yeah it cuz we have to
have terror to destroy all of this but
it's merciful because it's saving souls
you know well and and when I looked at
well I'll interrupt for a second when I
looked at because I want to hear the
completion but in that context after I
read that book I looked around me
because you see how effectively in a few
hundred years they can completely remake
the world it was a world where there was
you know philosophy and and you mean
religion was amazing yeah and and then
where where every place became dominated
by a church took a century but we still
live in that world in a sense it went
every town I go I think how effectively
amazing they were everywhere you go you
don't mind that cities are just full of
churches and and and it they did it very
effectively ok but let's go on this went
on pretty much until you know variations
but pretty much until 1962 when pope
john xxiii called the second vatican
council which was a very important event
in modern history very important the
Second Vatican Council under Pope John
tried among other things to reinstitute
the Gospels horrible thing the Gospels
have a radical pacifist message mm-hmm I
said let's the theme is what was called
the preferential option for the poor
this was picked up by Latin American
bishops who supported it yeah and pretty
soon priests nuns and lay people were
going out into the poorer areas
countryside starting to organize what
we're called base communities and which
often illiterate peasants would start
thinking about the Gospels listening to
what they're saying starting to get to
see if they could take some control of
the room why it's not just the Latin
American particular poverty and
inequalities extraordinary and
repressions extraordinary but I know you
I know you were big fan of Latin
American of the of the depression
aspect of Latin American theology but at
the same time the Gospels do sort of say
you know the you know it's okay to be
poor because and the afterlife you'll be
you'll be fine so it says except they
don't talk about yeah these activists
were doing was saying you can take care
of your lives we can listen to the right
at the preferential option for the poor
but do something about it okay that was
the important part and it was important
mmm the United States went to war
against the church yeah starting then
yeah and a lot of the recent history of
Latin America reflects that maybe by
coincidence but in 1962 Kennedy shifted
the mission of the Latin American
military from hemispheric defense it's
kind of a anachronistic holdover from
the Second World War
yeah to internal security that as a
meaning means war against the population
he sent military mission to Colombia
where the worst atrocities were going on
then led by a green beret general which
came back with the report it it
recommended paramilitary terror that's
the phrase against known communists
adherence which is a very broad category
in a Latin American context of the the
director of counter counterinsurgency
for Kennedy and Johnson Charles mate
sling had a very strong critique of this
he said that this turned tolerance of
the rapacity of the Latin American
military into support for activities
that are reminiscent of the
stormtroopers of Hitler you had
government after government falling
under neo-fascist
neo-nazi military regimes a brutal
murder for plague spread all over the
hemisphere all the way to Central
America under Reagan lots of religious
martyrs including the archbishop and
also all the door finally
nineteen
89 the murder of six leading Latin
American intellectuals at the University
and they'll solve other Jesuit priests
and finally finally what you have is the
School of the Americas which trains
Latin American officers has what are
called talking points we advertise our
achievements one of them is the US Army
helped defeat Liberation Theology that's
a substantial part of the history so it
says like a lot of things the story's
complicated it's interesting that one
that the Latin American priest who
became a pope wasn't it was in fact not
as far as you can see not a Liberation
Theology but in fact as far if you I
think if you look at his history in in
Latin America was the offices part of
the it's a very striking part of the
history the point was when there was an
effort to go back to the message of the
Gospels and to interpret it as meaning
do something about your own lives the
hammer came down very hard well but now
the hammer is somewhere else and I I'm
I'm wonder if you're as concerned I am I
think both of us in different ways have
been attacked I certainly when I've
stated this but and you know recently
one here is that one is there's much
more it's certainly in in domestic terms
in the United States and other words
more concern among police organizations
about about right-wing terrorism than
Islamic terrorism and in forward it's
far worse then look at the FBI records
exactly and and but here we see this
incredible connection between
evangelical Christianity and not just in
Mike Pompeo and in our foreign affairs
but in in but the White House in a way
that has never been I mean it may have
been implicit but now it's incredibly
overt well it's it's more than that it's
planned yeah so it goes back to what we
were talking about before about the
parties going to the right and the
Republicans going off into outer space
they had to organize new constituencies
this starts with Nixon on the Southern
Strategy since
Democrats were associated with Civil
Rights Nixon and his associates figured
okay we can pick up the Southern
Democrats the southern working class on
racist drones then comes the recognition
that they can pick up northern Catholics
Catholic workers who voted Democratic by
pretending to be an opposed to abortion
I stress pretending you go back to the
60s Republican leadership is what we
call pro-choice Reagan George HW Bush
who was supposed to have some principles
the whole stream of them were thought
yeah this is none of the government's
business woman's right the pole Wyrick
you know the Republican strategist in
the mid seventies figured out that if
the Republicans pretend to be
anti-abortion they can pick up the
evangelical in the Catholic vote pretend
by now if you're a Republican in
Congress or the president you got to be
passionately anti-abortion and principle
total cynicism but it worked they picked
up a large part of the Catholic Northern
working class vote the evangelical vote
of the evangelicals are now the primary
base of trumps electoral voting
coalition and this is connected very
closely to the Israel again
the evangelicals have a very interesting
position on Jews and on Israel they're
the most extreme anti-semites in human
history their theology if you look at it
is that it's not a hundred percent of
events but a leading part of it there's
got it we got a look for Armageddon yeah
the second coming that Christ comes what
happens when Christ comes back those who
are saved go to heaven everybody else
goes to eternal perdition
and what happens to the Jews yeah
actually a hundreds according to one of
the denominations a hundred and sixty
thousand can convert in time the rest go
to eternal perdition yeah
did Hitler call for them no I mean this
is the reservation structure but this is
part of the support for Israel we have
to support Israel because that's going
to lead to the battle that Armageddon
between Israel and whoever the next
enemy is shifts from time to time and
after that we'll come this wonderful
thing in fact the Israeli government has
a very interesting policy towards these
guys it kind of welcomes them because it
wants the support you know they want the
embassy in Jerusalem and so on but it's
afraid of them because these are crazy
lunatics would go up to try to blow up
the Temple Mount they've got to stop
them before they do it you know because
they are super anti-semites and way
beyond it like there's an article in The
Times today about anti-semitism on the
right left yeah yeah what they call
anti-semitism on the left is say Jeremy
Corbyn being critical of policies of
Israel that's anti-semitism on the left
the right of course neo Nazism Holocaust
denial and so on shooting blowing up
synagogues that's the right but they
don't talk about this which is the most
extreme anti-semitism in human history
there's nothing like it
I mean just think it through for a
second well that's what I mean by
beliefs influenced actions and that's
why that's I guess ultimately why if
every man was an island I where every
person was an island I would argue it
doesn't matter what people believe but
but but it produces actions it affects
national policies and ultimately that's
why I think we have to be wary about the
impact of organized religion the one
thing on which we perhaps differ as I
think there are other strains that can
develop oh yeah no I look I mean the
point is that the Kings an example I
mean you can use every religion has been
used for lots of Enso's liberation
theology yeah it's a very interesting
development because it did lead to a war
against
Church with many religious martyrs
that's a nasty forgotten yeah men who
can even name the Latin American
intellectuals wet their brains blown up
yeah none then you can name every
dissident in Eastern Europe you have not
these guys who we killed in this regard
when we talk about we talk about dangers
of say evangelical terrorism and versus
the the threat of Islamic terrorism
which which we we both argue but I've
certainly argue at one point another in
terms of the day-to-day life of
Americans is not a big deal we've both
been attacked but particularly I was
dismayed by but by Sam Harris's a
virulent attack and to some extent you
because I know Sam and I've worked with
him in different ways but the one
statement he made that that that
concerned me it was a statement that I
was surprised when he said that Ben you
know he would prefer ben Carson someone
who clearly is so no concept of how the
world works no concept of science but he
knows how poor people ought to be
treated yeah okay yeah but he better you
know he says that science is the work of
the devil that climate change everything
is the you know that evolution is the
work of the devil but but Sam who's a
you know in otherwise in mind many it
said many reasonable things I said he'd
prefer him as president versus you
because at least he understands the
threat of his Lama k-- terrorism and I
that's a statement that concerns me so I
thought I'd bring it up because well
let's take the threat of Islamic
terrorism let's look at the history
Islamic terrorism the modern period it
begins basically in Egypt against the
government of 1970s it was a it was an
internal of middle-eastern phenomenon
until basically until the reaction to
9/11 the reaction to 9/11 at that point
Islamic terrorism was pretty much
confined to a tribal area in
and the Pakistan Afghan border the
region where al-qaida was sheltered that
was the center of Islamic terrorism what
where is it now everywhere in the world
yeah how'd that happened we did it the
invasion of Iraq
yeah intelligence agencies predicted
across the board this is going to
increase terrorism turns out by US
government records that Islamic
terrorism increased by a factor of seven
after the Iraq war yeah I smash people
in the face they react something else
yeah now it's all over the world every
time you you go after it it's like a
Hydra you know yeah great more you carry
out the drone attacks in northwest
Pakistan or Yemen somebody sees their
family blown up by something you think
they like it okay how do they react and
in fact if you want to think about this
in some depth there's another book I'd
recommend great book by William Polk
who's fine a scholar of mainly Middle
East Islamic studies but also has a
strong background in the in the
government he was on the National
Security Council for Middle East affairs
right through the Cuban Missile Crisis
in fact he's the guy who sort of
organized for the negotiations between
Israel and Egypt very important
background on a very smart interesting
guy as a book called Crusaders and
jihadis that's a very interesting book
covering a thousand years of history
from the Crusades to the present and
what he points out is that this is
largely a war of the north against the
south and a large part of the south is
the Islamic South it's a war in which
the north has continually attacked the
south brutally viciously destructively
the Islamic world has tried all sorts of
ways to respond negotiations
accommodation
one thing or another everything's been
smashed down and finally they've turned
to Islamic terror okay
that's his that's real history the kind
you have to think about it's not history
is bunk well it's also but it's not it's
not untrue that in some sense from a
blue religious perspective there is a
religious justification that is used in
the Islamic world for violence you take
a careful look at that so the there's
been a lot of careful study of the
jihadi sharps Scott atrum for yeah I
know okay you know what they put what he
and others point out is that the Islamic
element of it is very thin yeah yeah
most of the militant jihadists have just
have essentially no Islamic background
they picked it up yeah after the
judgment okay but the commitment comes
from other things the kind of things
that William polkas talking about and
the repression and so on or even just
things like peer pressure well what I
wanted to argue is that this nothing new
about that in some sense there are newer
religion but the Crusades were work were
Christians but there were political just
deliberately unless worth
they were hideous terror oh exactly the
same way but it was six hundred years
earlier seven hundred years earlier well
Islam's a religion that six hundred
years younger it's not to surprise it
but but again it's not a political cause
its own its own its own history of
violence yeah of course the picture that
Pope presents is fundamentally correct
it is a north-south war thousand years
the North wins all the time
it beats back now and then and it just
gets more and more violent and
destructive
that's a persistent theme can't forget
that well let's let's let's continue
with it I want to try and conclude well
we bet you know in a few minutes we
could go on for a long time but I want
to I want to go back in terms of this
thrilling and uplifting theme we have of
violence and destruction it seems to to
the book by Daniel Ellsberg
the doomsday machine I think it's called
emeliza incredibly important book yeah
beer in yeah and some of the things in
it are really startling this is his
discussion of things he discovered when
he was right on the inside starting in
the 50s and certainly as he points out
he was a hawk he believed it will you
know it's just appalled by the things he
was discovering one of them was that the
psyops you know the the strategic plans
for nuclear weapons called for killing
600 million people if we decision you
know yeah it was amazing hardening the
structure was such that if there was a
confrontation in Berlin we would wipe
out China yeah literally why because we
can do it you know China's vulnerable we
call these ships and missiles there so
it's the Russians do something in Berlin
will wipe out China you know yeah and
and this was just this is not the Hawks
this is everybody right through probably
still the case then comes his discovery
that under Eisenhower the the afar
authority to use nuclear weapons was sub
delegated under Eisenhower to Admirals
and Generals but the logic was well if
the top gets decapitated somebody else
has to do it and that logic happens to
proliferate so if it goes down to
generals what if they get killed okay
you have to permit it down to lower
levels turns out it was all the way down
to pilots if you look at the memoirs in
the of the Cuban Missile Crisis people
who are flying the so-called chrome-dome
missions b-52s were all over the place
ready to wipe out the world you know
what the shot of an arm the commanders
of a b-52 plane it could have decided to
do it no in theory it took two of them
to agree yeah yeah suppose one of them
was asleep yeah I mean
it's just mind-boggling Stanley Kubrick
was unless he points out you know herman
con una fantasized about doomsday
machines will we have it the system is a
doomsday machine if anything goes wrong
you just blow up the world and once
we've learned about nuclear winter you
know you can debate the details but
something's there well it's it's really
it's it's particularly serious I think
for Americans who think that I mean who
become complacent about nuclear weapons
but think well probably the most
dangerous place where nuclear weapons my
abuses India Pakistan where there really
are two states that really are and war
that really hate each other that both
are nuclear States and what what is
important to point out is that is that
it's not isolated that a mere use of two
hundred nuclear weapons in in Indian
Pakistan will produce a climate change
that will probably kill a billion people
in terms of the agriculture over the
course of a decade so there is no it's
as if elope there's not even the local
local option you know you can't think
about it yeah and meanwhile the Trump
administration is escalating the threat
the so called the low-yield nuclear
weapons I mean you know people can think
about this you can't even imagine what's
in their minds I suppose you're the
opponent and somebody launches a missile
which you say has only low-yield nuclear
weapons on it yeah how do they know no
they're gonna react with life but
massive violence are you've done the
idea of you of usable nuclear weapons is
a fallacy and it's unfortunately the
notion that if they're small enough
they're they're indistinguishable from
we have to overcome that but that's the
as far as I can see that's a myth that's
happening now and that's why the algebra
book I think is important because it
points that people have become
complacent because we've had 75 years of
not using them against civilian
populations but and it took a look at
the record yeah we've come so close in
control a wonderful book about about how
close we've come to domestically and
internationally to its most basic is not
gonna last forever
I'm in the case after case we've come
within a couple of minutes of using them
well look before we do go to a different
area because I know particular I know
because your wife was interested in
who's from Brazil wanted us to talk
about Brazil a little bit let's let's
talk about it a little bit
well Brazil remember is the most
important country in the hemisphere
outside the United States not a small
country
it's been called hundred years ago yeah
called the colossus of the south
potentially yeah so what's happened in
brazil brazil go through the whole
history of course but just recently in
2003 they elected lula da silva
president he's a uneducated union leader
a very remarkable person i knew him back
in the 90s for him closely he's very
remarkable person very effective you
don't take my opinion the World Bank
published a study of Brazil in 2016
hey 2016 on which they discussed what
they called the golden decade a unique
period in Brazil's history under Lula's
two terms 2003 to 2011 a period in which
there was remarkable improvement poverty
reduction
enormous poverty reduction large
expansion of inclusiveness marginalized
but remember these are very unequal
countries were rich but incredibly
unequal enormous poverty tremendous
resources wasted inclusion of people
afro-brazilians almost half the
population indigenous people and women
brought in to educational institutions a
sense of dignity of commitment that
country just changed if they say it's a
remarkable example of the development
rarely equal at the same time Lula
became probably the most respected
statesmen in the world
a very respected stay
and as a voice for the global self
respected everywhere I remember visiting
Brazil it seemed like yeah it seemed
like the beacon you know it was on a
remarkable period
well Brazilian elites couldn't tolerate
this and not only the first lady was
very supportive of establishment
institutions they didn't but interfere
with didn't I well I saw be in the
country yeah he didn't he paid off the
debts to the foreign investors he
satisfied the IMF he's not a radical
yeah I'm his beliefs very straight or
you just put money in the hands of poor
people that'll take care of things
that's his radicalism but the for the
Brazilian a lead who are outlandish all
the Latin American elite this is
intolerable furthermore there's an
enormous class hatred how can this
uneducated worker who doesn't even speak
proper Portuguese dare to be sitting in
the presidential palace you know we can
these people have to have humility will
take care of them that sort of thing
that's deeply rooted all throughout
Latin America in Brazil in particular
anyhow as soon as he after a couple of
years after he stepped down the oil
prices dropped and the commodity prices
dropped in China cutting back
development there's a lot of claims that
the improvements under his rule were
just illusory there but the World Bank
didn't agree that you look at their
analysis they say it's not true in fact
if you look more closely I've written
about this the Brazilian economists have
written about it it was the mainly the
predatory financial institutions who
prevented any sensible reaction to this
every effort that was taken was beaten
back and it did lead to a recession that
gave the opportunity for the soft coup
that's been going on since then the
first step was to impeach his successor
Dilma Rousseff on absolutely the riser
II grounds I mean you look at them it's
not even a joke and she was in
by a gang of thieves of a sort you can't
even describe that was the first step
then comes the next just a couple months
ago there was an election coming up in
October October 2018 the Lula was way
ahead in the polls I was pretty clear
it's gonna win the election so what they
do put him in jail solitary confinement
25-year sentence of basically a death
sentence prevented from reading
newspapers and journals and crucially
prevented from making a public statement
not like murderers and death row this is
right before the election next step
which is we should look closely because
it's a test run for the 2020 election
here a massive campaign on the social
media which are the main source of
information for most of the population
presses of course mostly right-wing but
these are but the media campaign is just
unbelievable I mean the the lies the
fabrications the vitriol you know the
the Workers Party his party is planning
to turn every before the boys into
homosexuals it's gonna kill religion
they're gonna put out baby bottles with
penises as the nipples you know on and
on like this people believe that you
know they finally managed just by these
means you know shut up silence the guy
who's gonna probably gonna win it's a
flood the so-called information system
with grotesque lies and attacks that
can't be responded to and remember we're
going to see this soon we're starting to
see it already this is destron they
managed to get into office a guy who's
the most outrageous of the right-wing
fanatics all over the world of just
illustrate this is a guy who
when he was in the Parliament when he
voted for the impeachment of Dilma
Rousseff he dedicated his vote to her
torturer she was a guerrilla tortured by
the military regime he dedicated his
vote to her torturer the general who was
in charge of the torture he supports the
military dictatorship which was vicious
mm-hmm but with but he criticizes it too
because it didn't go far enough he said
it should it should have was too soft
they should have killed 30,000 people
like the Argentine's did the worst of
the military dictators yeah he goes back
to the 19th century and criticizes the
Brazilian cavalry because they didn't do
what the Americans did wipe out the
indigenous population if they'd done
that we wouldn't have these problems
today in fact now that he's in office
now first of all he's his economics
adviser as a ultra-right Chicago boy
public ADA's his motto is literally
privatize everything sell the country
out to mostly foreign investors killed
right now they're killing the social
security system which is not that strong
but something as and everything over to
the rich and the powerful the newest
legislation is changed the history books
so that they don't criticize the
military dictatorship they say it was
necessary to protect the country from
communism he says the whole country has
been taken over by what's called
cultural Marxism including the
right-wing press University got a block
that science is finished we don't
support that chunk we don't waste money
on that kind of stuff so the Brazilian
science is pretty powerful the
interesting things coming in current so
I mean this is just indescribable and
it's happening in the most powerful
country important country in Latin
America one of the most important in the
world with the strong support of the
United States very powerful in fact this
media campaign
and you can't prove it but it has all
the fingerprints of the people who've
been running these things elsewhere well
let's let's I want to try what its gonna
get to linguist what you're not gonna
get to but look we've been a sobering
conversation in many ways but I wanted
to end by by talking about your balance
I mean we didn't get to talk much about
science a little bit but but you've
devoted much of your life to writing
your popular writing has been other than
interviews with you your popular writing
has been primarily on issues that we've
been talking about now whereas your your
scientific writing in linguistics has
not been you know as far as I know spent
a lot of time on popular books on
linguistics okay and so I want to and so
I wanted to talk about that balance
there's someone who also does science
and has written about science and and
writes about it this balance to ask you
why whether you feel I've often people
often asked me if you felt compromised
because one takes away from the other
yeah and and I have my own answer to
that but I wanted to hear about yours
whether you felt that the the efforts
you've devoted to to exposing what you
view is as fundamental problems that
need to be addressed for society has has
of course compromised potentially the
time you could have spent on linguistics
and philosophy and how you feel about
that if the world would go away I'd be
much happier just to keep to the
scientific philosophical issues that's
really intellectually exciting frankly
these issues we're now talking we've
been talking about are pretty
superficial it doesn't take much to
figure them out and understand them
there's nothing profound about it you
don't have to have a PhD in political
science to talk about these things the
Guild's try to protect themselves but
the fact that it's not a criticism
yeah the fields I mean they're yeah
they're just too complicated yeah so
things are complicated you don't get
deep theories I mean physics is lucky if
things get too complicated just hand it
over to the chemist physics is easy
you can't do that with human life you
know so it's but but the point is
anybody can understand these things if
they want it's not intellectually
exciting it's humanly significant and
it's there's a lot of frustration
because you know that what you're gonna
do is going to be smashed and
slaughtered in the mainstream with tons
of lies and attacks there's all kind of
evidence about this I won't go into it
so in a way it's you know it's kind of
like wasted in a sense except for the
whatever effect it may have for the
public so if it's wasted why if you do
it and it because I think it's just
critically important but so like take
say the Vietnam War when Kennedy started
escalating the war
I really had I remember a personal
decision nobody cares about this am I
gonna start trying to do something about
it or can I keep to my work which was at
a very exciting period at the time it
was young person department developing
all kind of new ideas and I knew
perfectly well from experience I have an
activist history this yeah you put your
one toe in and pretty soon you're
swimming ya can t just do a long yeah
any of it or pound I just decided it's
got to be done you know it looked
hopeless at the time as I mentioned
before it took years before you could
even talk about these things but they're
just too important to let go a fact that
Bertrand Russell was asked once around
the 19 late 1960s why he's wasting his
time on anti-nuclear activities when he
could be producing more serious work and
philosophy and logic and he said if I
don't work on the nuclear activities
nobody's gonna look at the philosophy of
logic well I think I mean you said it
before it looked hopeless in the Vietnam
War and ultimately it wasn't it was
really social it was really the raising
of consciousness about about by that war
that have ultimately forced that notice
that it's dual it was effective among
the population among the intellectual
classes basically zero but yet they
can't go beyond
it was a mistake no well yeah but I
nevertheless I think the lesson from
this is that we've spent two hours now
talking about largely talking about
problems that will depress people and
they're serious problems in the world
today but the fact that you chose that
you chose to devote much of your life
and time to at least talking about these
issues raising consciousness pointing
out that people could understand them
and that's the first step to action is
incredibly important and I think that's
why I feel I'm happy we were able to
spend us time and I think the world it
we're lucky that you did that and I'm
hoping that we will continue our
conversations and people who agree or
disagree will least be motivated to ask
the questions simple questions about
about the world that need to be asked if
we're going to make if we're going to
try and address the important challenges
of the 21st century which are now global
which as you said not on just nuclear
weapons climate change we need to have
these discussions and I and literally
millions of people thank you for what
you've done thanks a lot no thanks
