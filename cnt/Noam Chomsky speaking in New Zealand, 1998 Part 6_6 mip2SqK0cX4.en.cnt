rate has gone up very very fast tripled
in the reagan years still going up that
health and education and welfare are
deteriorating in fact profits are going
through the roof or they were until the
middle of this year in the middle this
year the fairy tale economy as it's
called which was a it was a fairytale
for few percent of the population that
finally began to you know that the
crisis began to hit the rich and the
wealth and privilege so that made the
front pages now it's a front-page story
that the global economy is in trouble
because it's not just the eighty percent
of the population who've been suffering
from it in the rich countries and even
more elsewhere but it's also the top few
percent who were benefiting from they
are facing problems markets are
extraordinarily financial markets nobody
understands they're governed by what's
called panics manias and crashes in the
international economics literature and
all totally unpredictable nobody knows
what's going on and that's now
threatening the rich they're afraid of a
global meltdown over them as well so
they now are calls for reinstitution of
britain woods re regulation of capital
and they're coming from the most
conservative sectors so the world bank
the bank for international settlements
which is you know the richmond the
bankers Bank basically it's the bank of
the central bankers the most
conservative institution you can find
that's been calling for it has also been
warning that about that one should have
humility in discussing International
Economic Affairs it's their term you
have humility because nobody has a idea
about what's going on totally out of
control as they recognize a lot of
dangerous because it's threatening rich
people so you see it on the front pages
well there's nothing as I say in the
third world it's mostly disasters and it
is as well for most of the most of the
population at home in the United States
it's remarkable I mean if this is always
talked about a fairytale economy but
take a look at it the top say few
percent of the population have been
doing fantastically well if you get the
top 10% and income sort of getting by
whether the next ten percent the 80th to
90th percent they've actually lost net
wealth during the fairy tale economy a
meaning that debts have grown faster
than has it and we get down below the
top you know the 80th percentile it's
mostly racing to try to stay even as you
possibly can that's the great Goldilocks
economy that everyone's talking about
salsa the slowest recovery in US
economic history and unprecedented and
it's left out most of the population and
the reasons are understood so the
reasons are understood to be what Alan
Greenspan calls greater worker in
security workers are intimidated you
know they're afraid that the jobs will
be transferred the unions have been
destroyed by simply refusing to enforce
the laws and though that makes workers
insecure so don't ask for raises and
that improves the health of the economy
gives you a fairy tale economy for the
people account now they happen to be the
ones who are writing the articles which
is why you read about it but it's not
true of the population and now as I say
it's beginning to hit the rich so
there's a lot of concern about what to
do well there's nothing inevitable about
all of this the you know these are not
the results of economic laws or you know
laws of nature or anything there are
political decisions very specific
decisions taken by groups that happen to
have the power to impose their will
through the often non-governmental
institutions like the international
financial institutions and others which
carry out their work more or less in
secret or simply through corporate power
corporations are tearin' ease private
Tara needs which are unaccountable to
the public which should Minister trade
you know it's not free trade and
involved in all kind of alliances with
one another and have enormous impact on
state policy obviously those decisions
are leading to a certain form of
globalization it doesn't have to take
that form and can take other forms the
globalization is by no means out of
control you look at trade and investment
flows and that sort of thing it's the
great majority is within is among
countries which have parliamentary
institutions Europe United States and
Japan and they have no fear of a
military coup which means that in
principle policies can be changed even
within existing mechanisms it's a matter
of taking control of what's effectively
at least in principle ought to be under
your control that requires understanding
what's going on of course and breaking
through the web of propaganda secrecy
and so on but that's by no means
impossible especially for relatively
privileged people and in these societies
large part of the population is
relatively privileged and can doing
quite a lot about it and choices
furthermore that's within the framework
of existing institutions and there's
nothing holy about them institutions are
not self legitimizing they have to be
they have to face the test of legitimacy
that's true of kings and princes and
slave owners and the Stalinist state and
corporate structures or any other form
of tyranny and domination has to prove
that it's legitimate and if it's not
legitimate it can be dismantled exactly
as has happened throughout history
that's why there's maybe agonizingly
slow but definitely detectable progress
in history progress to a more humane
world and that hasn't ended it's a
matter of choice and
the if institutions have to be
dismantled and modified and democratized
those are choices that are surely within
the hands of the public as they have
always been in the past
