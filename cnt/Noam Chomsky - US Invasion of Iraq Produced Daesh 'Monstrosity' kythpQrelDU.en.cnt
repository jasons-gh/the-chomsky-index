professor Chomsky Bernie Sanders
campaign has taken everyone by surprise
maybe it's taken him by surprise it's
certainly taking the Democratic Party
establishment by surprise no one
expected he'd be where he is today
he has tens of thousands of people in
some instances coming to his campaign
rallies millions of small donors he's
ahead in the popular vote although far
behind in Delegates probably because of
super-delegates he says that students
should go to school and it should be
free that student debt should be lifted
that affordable health care should be a
right and he also calls for a political
revolution what do you think about that
I mean that's something quite new when
the American electoral scene what is a
political revolution what is the
significance of Sanders campaign what
are your thoughts the only thing that I
think should be qualified as the phrase
political revolution what he's actually
calling for is what was pretty well
understood and accepted in the 1950s in
fact President Eisenhower wouldn't have
been much surprised by his proposals
he's fundamentally and as I read his
positions a New Deal Democrat
traditional New Deal Democrat in the
fact that it's him takes a and and his
positions are have been supported by a
considerable part of the population
often large majorities for decades so
he's putting forth positions which are
very familiar among people's attitudes
in fact often strongly supported that
takes a national healthcare right now
about 60% of the population supported
which is pretty remarkable when you
think that nobody it publicly advocates
it every time it's brought up it's
denounced but still considerable jority
support you go back a little further I
say at the Reagan years about 80% of the
population thought it oughta be
guaranteed by the Constitution in fact
about 40 percent thought it was
guaranteed by the constitute
these are long and the same as that
takes af free education that that's what
it was like in the 1950s virtually the
GI Bill gave nori free education but
even subsidies to huge numbers of people
veterans who would never have gone to
college it was very good for them very
good for the country it's part of the
reason for the very high and relatively
equitable growth rate in the 50s and 60s
before the neoliberal reaction said in
common in other countries rich countries
like Germany poor countries like Mexico
hardly these are hardly surprising
positions but in the fact that they're
regarded as extremists or that it calls
for a revolution is actually a comment
on how the spectrum within the
mainstream has shifted to the right
during the neoliberal years indeed that
we have the at one time you couldn't
call yourself a communist during the
witch-hunt then you couldn't call
yourself a socialist then in the 1980s
and 90s after Reagan the l-word the
liberal word also was banished all of
the progressive words associated with
social change or social justice or even
traditional democratic party mainstream
programs who are exercised from the
political lexicon so now you have
somebody calling himself a Democratic
Socialist which was one of those banned
terms saying okay we should have these
programs which are essentially liberal
programs but the entire Democratic Party
establishment and of course Wall Street
seemed completely alarmed I mean does it
take a political revolution to get back
to even mainstream politics no I don't
think it takes the political revolution
I think it takes return a return to a
situation which was far from radical so
for example just to illustrate back in
the 1950s the common quip about the
political system not inaccurate was that
the United States is a one-party state
the business party which has two
factions
called Democrats and Republicans which
differ somewhat if you take the
situation today still a one-party state
business party but it only has one
faction and it's not Democrats it's
moderate Republicans who call themselves
Democrats if you take a look at today's
Democratic Party it's pretty much what
used to be called moderate Republicans
meanwhile the Republicans have simply
drifted off the political spectrum
they're not a political party in any
recognizable form yeah I want to ask you
about that because you have Donald Trump
I mean it's amazing actually Donald
Trump he commanding lead in South
Carolina he won in New Hampshire he may
to the surprise of all conventional
wisdom and the pundits and certainly the
Republican establishment he could
actually take the the nomination now you
have Trump calling for a building of
wall at the US Mexican border he says
like the Israeli Apartheid wall
he said ban Muslims deport 11 million
immigrants yesterday or a few days ago
he said the protesters at his rally
should be taken out on a stretcher like
the good old days I mean do you see in
Trump of course there's a deep strain of
white supremacy in America but you see
with the Trump campaign and the
surprising results the danger of some
sort of neo-fascist or fascist kind of
movement or is it something else well
first of all when you speak about the
Republican Party I'm actually speaking
about the Republican establishment being
off the spectrum not Trump that's an
interesting phenomenon but a different
one so take somebody like Mitch
McConnell who's considered a Republican
monarch moderate what was his reaction
to Obama's election was very clear he
said we have to have one policy no
anything that the government proposes we
say no and we block it because we want
to take power
that's not parliamentary politics and in
fact this is recognized to some of the
most respected conservative political
analysts Norman Ornstein
man of the American Enterprise Institute
right-wing think-tank they simply
described it not Trump they're talking
about the mainstream they described the
day's Republican Party as in their words
a radical insurgency which has abandoned
parliamentary politics and I think the
reason is pretty clear as the spectrum
both in the United States and in Europe
and in fact everywhere where neoliberal
programs have been imposed there's an
undermining of democracy that's one of
their aspects could go into it but it's
almost automatic and you can see it
happening at one effect one consequence
of that is that the sort of mainstream
Center begins to collapse and then you
get uprisings that both what are called
both extremes one of them is a far-right
extreme the others called left it's
actually kind of center left Social
Democratic like like Sanders or Corbett
and so on nothing particularly radical
about it
and that and as the parties have shifted
to the right the Republicans became so
dedicated to the interests of extreme
wealth and power that they simply cannot
get votes on their own programs and they
therefore had to mobilize sectors of the
population that have always been there
but hadn't been mobilized as a political
force so a substantial plurality maybe
the majority of Republicans are
evangelical Christians extremist
fundamentalist Christians you know
people who think the world was graded a
couple of thousand years ago can you see
it Donald Trump presidency
can I see it I think it would be if he
means what he says not just the things
you mentioned but much more serious ones
it's virtually a death knell for the
species every Republican candidate in
the primaries and Trump specifically
deny that global
is taking place or at least that we
should do anything of them and Michelle
Bachmann said it was she was the one who
admitted it in 2012 and she said it was
God's punishment for a homosexuality or
something like that
I mean she's far off the spectrum but
I'm talking about the mainstream all of
them say either it's not happening or we
shouldn't do anything about it and
they're acting to try to undermine
anything that might deal with it even
moderately and so for example take the
Paris the meetings last December
they weren't marvelous but they achieved
at least something minimal they were
hoping to gain to achieve a treaty with
commitments that would be fixed and
verifiable for emissions but they
couldn't and it was very clear why they
couldn't in fact it was recognized in
the mainstream press Republican Congress
wouldn't permit it they will not permit
a verifiable a treaty so what you have
to have is voluntary agreements the
Supreme Court just a couple of weeks ago
the the right-wing justices at that time
there were five no four with Scalia's
death they blocked they violated
long-standing precedent went out of
their way to effectively block efforts
to reduce emissions from coal plants
this is I mean they gave arguments but
the reason is the fundamental reason is
just the unwillingness of today's
Republican organization I hesitate to
call them a party even to address this
question this is critical for the
survival of the species
I mean support for torture is bad enough
the idea of building and getting Mexico
to build a wall is grotesque but this is
lethal and why is it happening well I
think we have to ask where is the
support for Trump coming from
if there isn't careful
data but it seems to be substantially
lower middle-class relatively uneducated
white males mostly these are the same
sectors of the population that are
suffering something unprecedented in
modern history increase in mortality
that's an astonishing fact the latest
Nobel laureate and economics got his
prize for recognizing it but it's much
more widespread there's a sectors of the
population for who see no hope their
life has been the neoliberal programs
have led as elsewhere to pretty much
stagnation for even decline for large
parts of the population alongside of
accumulation of spectacular wealth and a
tiny sector which is to become a kind of
a different society they're separated
from the mainstream society the hope for
the future has declined for the first
time maybe in history I mean I'm old
enough to remember the depression which
was objectively much worse than today
but it was a hopeful period my relatives
you know employed factory workers and so
on lived at a level of poverty much
beyond anything today but they expected
that the future would be better things
were happening CIO organizing mistake in
place there were was a relatively
sympathetic administration moderate the
Social Democratic programs were being
instituted it looked as if somehow we'll
get out of this that's not the attitude
today the people who are coming to the
Trump rallies as far as you can tell or
people through a large extent who feel
that something's been taken away from
them and there is as you mentioned a
strong element of white supremacy one
my graphic fact is that the white
population soon pretty soon you know the
foreseeable future will actually be a
minority so they are taking our country
away from us there's always been way
back a bitter anti-immigrant extremism
the the first apart from Oriental
exclusion you know the first major
immigration bill in 1924 after the first
world war was pretty much aimed at
Italians and Jews they called it Eastern
southern and South Eastern European and
South South European but that meant Jews
and Italians that's one of the reason
why plenty of Jews ended up in gas
chambers couldn't get here and that went
right through that after the end of the
war it's if you go back earlier right
here in Boston when the Irish
immigration came in the late 19th
century you could see signs on
restaurants saying no dogs or Irish the
Irish were treated like African
Americans which is the absolute bottom
and this goes way back we're here we
don't want you you know and its Europe
it's even worse I mean I think Europe is
probably more racist than the United
States you can see it right now but the
but this is real and this is a part of
the cheering for Trump when he says
build a wall and if you think about it
what is that wall supposed to do in fact
what is Obama doing Obama has been
pressuring Mexico to keep the Central
Americans away from our border the wire
people fleeing Central America because
the u.s. destroyed Central America
especially under the Reagan years if we
couldn't know the limited time we have I
want to move over to the Obama
administration and also to Hillary
Clinton who was of course the Secretary
of State during the first Clinton term
on October 20th the day Qaddafi was
killed he was
lynched after a very long bombing
campaign thousands of bombs and missiles
dropped on Libya in the name of
protecting civilians finally it ended
after he was killed but that day Hillary
Clinton was caught on video saying we
came we saw he died kind of happy giddy
I mean here we have ISIL Islamic state
so-called now taking over big parts of
Libya as they have in Iraq as they have
in Syria and you have the Obama
administration largely responsible at
least in the last seven years for
policies I believe that have created the
space for ISIL of course the bush
invasion in 2003 of Iraq
got the ball rolling but Clinton and the
Obama administration they came in not as
Republicans not as George W Bush
everyone was so excited I was on the
inaugural parade route millions of
people there was like euphoria people
felt not only is Bush leaving but the
Bush era is ending something new is
happening something positive one
qualification ever it's not true that
everybody games I mean everyone who I
was in fact I wasn't I I wrote about it
even before the primaries and tried hard
to warn people not to put faith in Obama
there's nice rhetoric but if you look at
the policies there that he was
advocating they were pretty ugly well
that's what I want to ask you it seems
as you described it the political
establishment has moved so far to the
right that even basic liberal programs
have now been considered a threat to the
economic and political elites and
exercise than called communist or
socialist when Obama introduced
Obamacare which was Mitt Romney's
program they call that socialist and
communist but has u.s. foreign policy
been basically taken over by the
neoconservative framework no it's been
taken over by mainstream liberalism
which is very hawkish the Obama take
Obamas position on the war in Iraq which
is very pretty he's praised highly for
opposing the war ask yourself why he
opposed it he says no we don't do invent
it he says he opposed it because it was
a strategic lung
not because it's wrong to invade another
country and not only violate
international law radically but smash up
the country destroy it kill hundreds
thousands of people generate millions of
refugees ignite a sectarian conflict
which did not exist before which is now
tearing the country in the region apart
that's not the reason to object to it
rather because it was a blunder was
gonna cost us too much I mean that's
like Russian generals who opposed the
invasion of Afghanistan said look this
is pretty stupid we shouldn't do it that
do we praise them I don't but he's the
most extreme protest objection that can
be voiced within the mainstream is it
was a mistake it was incidentally
exactly the same in the case of Vietnam
it's the worst crime and since the
post-war era was the invasion of South
Vietnam then all of Indochina where you
go to the end of the war when there was
strong opposition popular opposition
actually reviewed the mainstream
commentary you go to the far critical
extreme say Anthony Lewis at the New
York Times he says the u.s. began with
blundering efforts to do good now that's
a tautology anything we do was an effort
to do good so we began with blundering
efforts to do good but by 1969 it was
clear that it was a disaster and we
could not achieve our benign goals at a
cost that acceptable to ourselves so it
was really a mistake that's the answer
to the question of invading a country
killing millions of people destroying
the region chemical warfare which is
still people still dying and Saigon
hospitals the only thing is it was
State cost us too much in in Syria in
August September 2013 I remember very
vividly because I was outside the White
House protesting against the possible
and what seemed to be inevitable war
against Syria the bombing war not the
other war but but at that time John
Kerry who was demanding the bombing and
who said Syria has crossed the red line
and that red line was established by
Obama because the Syrians purportedly
used chemical weapons at that time there
was no comment at all about ISIL it was
all against the Syrian Arab army the
Syrian government whatever one thinks
about the Assad government it was the
secular nationalist independent
government it had opposed groups like
ISIL in the past whatever what
characterizes it today
today the US government has completely
shifted in one way maybe not completely
has shifted in one way both its rhetoric
and its orientation and has agreed with
Russia that there should be a ceasefire
in Syria from your point of view what
accounts for this kind of change
obviously there was grassroots
opposition to a new war in in 2013 but
this is a pretty profound shift that
isn't it well first of all I think we
should recognize that the Assad
government is absolutely monstrous it's
a vicious brutal government which has
carried out enormous atrocities it was
harsh and autocratic before but in the
course of the past few years it's guilty
of extraordinary war crimes and what
accounts for the u.s. policy and in fact
most policy is pretty incoherent but
what accounts for the change is just the
change in the situation on the ground at
that point there was no Isis in Syria
now there is in 2013 there was barely
now it's a very substantial force and
the question is exactly what to do to
try to find the US was it wasn't so much
opposed to a ceasefire it was calling
for negotiations but at first on the
condition that the Assad government not
participate it did shift position on
that the Assad government as I said it
is monstrous but it has to participate
in negotiations to reject that is just a
call for endless war because they're not
going to just say goodbye please kill me
so yes they have to participate and that
was a move which was proper or I think
the one slim hope and it's pretty slim
for something happening in Syria short
of self destruction of the country is
ceasefires
a negotiated settlement with eventual
diplomatic outcome which will probably
be pretty ugly
that's if there's any other hope I don't
see it but if you look at what's
actually happening it's pretty
incoherent I mean the turkey us ally of
their main goal is to attack the Kurds
the one Ground Force opposing Isis and
they're kind of have been in kind of a
funnel for support of Isis not
officially but in practice Saudi Arabia
and Qatar other US allies have are
openly supporting the illness referent
as is turkey publicly which is hardly
different from Isis the the u.s. is
supporting the Syrian Kurds but opposing
the Iraqi was the the related Kurdish
group in Turkey in Iraq which is in fact
on the terrorist list the policy is I
mean you have to kind of sympathize with
the Obama administration it's very hard
to imagine a coherent policy in this
complex and it it does trace back to the
you were correct it traces back to the
invasion of Iraq which among its other
crimes did instigate the sectarian
conflict than the atrocities out of
which
finally came this particular monstrosity
Isis than if it is simply destroyed as
it could be by force without dealing
with the roots of it something even
worse will probably come up you cannot
just say okay I don't like this guy
let's kill him but without asking what
happens next every serious analyst has
pointed out with impo Coburn just about
everyone that if you kill some terrorist
leader or destroy some terrorist group
without looking at the roots of where
they came from you're gonna get someone
worse it's happened consistently over
the years that just recently one of the
main US government terror what they call
terrorist specialists Bruce often warned
that if the current policies of the kill
of aiming to kill the leader of Isis if
they succeed he says we can be pretty
confident that somebody younger more
militant more violent more extremist
it's going to replace him that's been
the consistent pattern so you must deal
with the roots of the phenomenon not
just say ok let's let's kill this bad
guy and that has not been done I mean
take a look at the so-called global war
on terror which was declared in 2001 at
that time the what they call terrorists
was located in a small remote tribal
area of packet of Afghanistan where is
it now
all over the world every time you hit
the system with a sledgehammer you make
it worse the Iraq is one case Libya is
another that at that time the initiative
was not Obama it was France it was
France followed by England and the
United States went along they became
they did rammed through a Security
Council resolution which called for a
ceasefire and
protection civilians and negotiations
diplomacy action Qaddafi accepted it but
NATO did not they immediately violated
it became the air force of the rebels
that the effect of that was to sharply
increase the number of casualties at
least by a factor of 10 according to a
an analysis by pretty conservative
analysts and Foreign Affairs main
establishment Journal sharply increased
the number of casualties left the
country in ruins it's now that total
chaos within the hands of warring
militias it did open up an opportunity
for Isis to establish itself and it's
also it had spread the it initiated a
vast flow of arms and pretty including
pretty high-tech arms and jihadis to the
Middle East but even worse to Africa
West Africa is now the locus of the
worst terrorism in the world much of it
flowing from the NATO attack on Libya
and it also happened to have opened a
funnel for refugees fleeing from
countries in Africa where Europe has a
record not a pretty not a very pretty
one extending what's called the refugee
crisis and you're a lot of this was just
the result of the decision to violate
the Security Council resolution their
own resolution and to use the
sledgehammer again every time you do it
it's worse by now you'd think somebody
would notice you cannot take vulnerable
societies with real grievances and say
let's take care of them by smashing them
up no that's you're gonna get it
something even worse almost
automatically thank you very much
professor Noam Chomsky you took it
taking your time to sit with us too
analyzed both the domestic policy of the
u.s. the Foreign Policy's we are out of
time I'd like to ask you another
question but I wanna okay let's try to
really I the the last question is
because you're here you've been here for
so many decades I remember 40 years ago
as a young anti-war activist I was
reading your works
listening to you talk when you look and
look back and look forward do you view
yourself as a historical optimist at
this point or a historical pessimist or
are those improper labels in other words
do you have hopefulness about what's
coming well as far as hopefulness is
concerned we have two choices always
that we can say it's hopeless I'll give
up therefore all contribute to the worst
possible outcome or we can grasp the
hopeful signs that are always there and
are very much there here right now so
you opened by talking about the support
for Sanders yeah that's hopeful we can
grasp that and maybe we'll help make
things a little better that's not much
of a choice thank you very much
