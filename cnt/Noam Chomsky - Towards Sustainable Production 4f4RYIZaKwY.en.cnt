I was wondering within the within the
climate change topic there's a huge
range of figures who are working on it
there's everyone from Al Gore to to
people who are saying we need an
entirely new system and are trying to
create new ways of living in order to
solve climate change and so I was
wondering what your thoughts are on if
climate change can be solved within the
current political and economic system it
can we meet this challenge within the
the system that we have or do we do we
need in a sense a new system it is
possible to deal with climate change
within the current state capitalist
systems but by carrying out measures
which are pretty well understood
so one measure that could be instituted
immediately is a carbon tax the carbon
tax would at least internalize the costs
that are imposed by use of carbon it
would it would impose a great burden on
those who use fossil fuels and even
mainstream economists say this is
easiest way to do it that's not going to
end the crisis but it would be a major
step forward that is there a carbon tax
not in the United States even though
according to polls almost half the
population is thinks it's a good idea
that's without practically anybody
advocating it if it was real advocacy in
fact almost all the commentary is
against nevertheless almost half the
population is in favor of it and that
could be a significant step it is
certainly within the framework of
existing institutions this morning if
you look at the front page of the New
York Times discusses a conflict that's
arising in the Democratic Party between
two of its major constituencies
environmental and labor the labor
constituency that wants support for a
building
slimes like Keystone XL the
environmental sector of parties against
it so there's a split and you can
understand the problem it's one of the
reasons why the white working-class is
drifting to the Republicans to their
major class enemy literally to the party
that wants to really smash them in the
face
but they're doing it because partly
because the environmentalists and the
Democratic Party are opposed to things
like the XL pipeline is their solution
to this transparently but it's not
discussed the this country needs massive
construction work on things like
decaying infrastructure or a high-speed
rail all sorts of things that require an
enormous amount of labor the capital is
their workers want to work that can be
done it's not even raised all we can
talk about is building pipelines it's a
sign of a a social and political system
that is so sick that it cannot face
obvious issues and deal with them
sensibly so you have to tear the party
apart over whether we're going to have
pipelines when there's plenty of demand
for labor and technical work
construction work all kinds I mean even
things like weatherization of homes that
put which is environmentally sound and
could also be very helpful to the
economy and provide John a couple of
years ago the government essentially
nationalized the auto industry during
the crisis financial crisis and cook
over practically the whole auto industry
there were choices at that point but
they were not discussed one choice would
be should we hand the auto industry
after the taxpayer bailed it out should
we hand it back to the old owners or
clones maybe different faces but the
same basically the same people and have
it in
you to produce automobiles that's one
possibility
another possibility was should we have
the industry the direct did not did you
see more automobiles but the producing
of an efficient mass transportation
system after logos to see about the only
country that doesn't have anything like
I speed rail a very inefficient mass
transportation which is very costly to
the economy and very costly of
individuals and should the industry be
handed over to the old owners or should
it be handed over to the workforce and
the communities as a Democratic Society
to do these questions
literally were not raised except way out
at the margins like I talked about
couple other people talked about it but
it's simply not part of the discussion
but it should be a critical part I mean
it's kind of astonishing that you can go
from China to Central Asia in high-speed
rail but you can't go from Boston to New
York
in fact the train from Boston to New
York today which is the pride of Amtrak
is maybe 15 minutes faster than when I
took it 1670 you 65 years ago and it's a
shot if it even makes it on time which F
gun doesn't do these are um these are
even burdens on the rich no and Ray is
mostly business beat but instead of
getting to New York from Boston and you
know an hour and a half they sit around
for the forearm
you said elsewhere that in order to deal
with the environmental crisis were going
to have to dismantle an entire
sociological cultural economic and
ideological structure which is driving
us to disaster and it can so often be
hard to imagine when when we're embedded
within a system of what an alternative
could look like and I was wondering I
know you don't have any specific
thoughts on you know what a society
might look like but do you have any
general broad the
on the values or the overall structure
that a society that was actually
sustainable might look like should be
democratic that's an alternative to our
society an alternative to our society is
democracy that we live in for public use
optimize a democracy would mean that
every functioning institution production
Commerce information all of them would
simply be under popular Democratic
control so industrial installations
would be run by their workforce in
interaction with democratic communities
is this a radical idea you know kind of
but it's also a mainstream idea so if
you take a look at the major US social
philosopher John Dewey straight out of
mainstream America I'm practically
paraphrasing it in fact he points out
that unless this is done politics will
be as he puts it just the shadow cast on
society by big business which is pre
accurate that's mainstream America in
fact those ideas are not very much below
the surface and ordinary people's
consciousness it's just out of the
conversation it cannot imagine democracy
impermissible but that is an alternative
to our existing system it's called
usually called libertarian socialism but
it's basically a democracy
