this program is made possible by a grant
from the John D and Catherine T
MacArthur Foundation a world of ideas
with bill moyers noam chomsky has been
called many things the most important
intellectual alive America's leading
dissent her and a few other things not
suitable for polite company scholars
around the world know him for his
revolutionary work on the structure of
language studies he has pursued at MIT
since 1955 but his most controversial as
a freelance critic of politics and power
honest dissidents is what he calls it
the blunt scrutiny of national power
arbitrary government and injustice in
dozens of books and hundreds of articles
over the past quarter century he has
criticized the superpowers from u.s.
involvement in Southeast Asia and
Central America to Soviet involvement in
Afghanistan and Czechoslovakia 20 years
ago he was an early volunteer in the
protest against the war in Vietnam we
met in Boston to talk about dissent and
democracy then and now you said recently
that this country is more dissident now
than you ever remember it more so than
even during the Vietnam War when I read
that I am i went back immediately to
that period to the protest in the
streets the mass demonstrations the
riots on college campuses and in in the
ghettos that dissidents that was
powerful and emotional and unprecedented
you say we're a more dissident nation
now the dissidents now is much wider and
more deeply rooted and it's found in
sectors of the population that were
excluded from the the dissident
movements of the 1960s I think to
compare the present situation with the
late 60s is a little misleading because
of the scale of what what is being
protested the movements of the 60s
became well part of the peace movement
at least anti-war movement became a
significant movement at a time when we
had hundreds
thousands of troops attacking South
Vietnam and expanding the war to all of
Indochina major war with hundreds of
thousands of people slaughtered and just
one of the major Wars of the century in
fact until that time the peace movement
was very limited as late as mid nineteen
sixty six here in Boston which is a
pretty liberal City we had a hard time
having public meetings because they
would be broken up often broken up by
students and and in fact it wasn't
really until late nineteen sixty six
early nineteen sixty seven and remember
at that time we had what was it about
four hundred thousand troops fighting in
Vietnam that you got a large scale
protest movement going not compare the
80s when Ronald Reagan came into office
one of the first things he did was lay
the basis for his advisors one of the
first things they did was to lay the
basis for direct military intervention
in Central America the white paper of
February 1981 was a clear effort to test
the waters to see if you could get the
population to support direct dispatch of
troops to El Salvador and probable
military intervention in Nicaragua well
they react now that that's kind of
comparable to we might that's roughly
comparable to the situation that say
John F Kennedy faced in 1961 or even to
the late 50s now at that time
intervention could take place without
any protest but as soon as the Reagan
people made to be just the beginnings of
an indication that there might be direct
military intervention there was
substantial protest spontaneous protests
from all over the country horde of you
know there were there were
demonstrations they were the church was
protesting there were letters to
Congress in fact the protest was
sufficient so that they backed off and
they tried the administration backed off
because they were afraid that it was
going to harm the programs that they
were really interested in they went
underground with it and the Reagan
administration was literally driven
underground by a dissident population
the scale of clandestine activities in
fact is a pretty good measure of
domestic dissidents after all
clandestine activities are secret from
no one except the domestic poppy
are you talking only about dissidents
towards into American policies do you
see it's much broader for example it's a
striking fact that on almost every major
issue the population has been quite
strongly opposed to the policies of the
Reagan administration this has been true
from the beginning if you take a look at
the polls the poll results have been
quite consistent about this in fact
apart from a brief period in the very
first part of the first year of the
administration when they would support
for a military buildup briefly apart
from that the population has been
basically tending towards classical New
Deal positions it favors public spending
over social spending over military
spending the population has been in
favor of increased taxes if they are
used for improving the environment or
education or social welfare and so on if
you look at the questions on the polls
which ask would you spend session such
an amount money for new weapons or for
say medical insurance the answers of all
have consistently been in favor of
social spending against military
spending the population has been quite
strongly opposed to the direct
intervention ISM in fact the only
exceptions to this are the sort of
one-day quick victories United feat
Grenada Libya and things like that of
course everybody rallies around the flag
but anything that has extended even to a
limited extent beyond that has has in
fact had public opposition now it's not
organized public opposition you are
saying that the negative pole on an
issue constitutes dissidents no it's
only constitute dissonance if it becomes
articulated and on many issues it
doesn't become articulated on Central
American policy it did in fact become
articulated and that's what drove the
government underground even as we talk
however 55 percent of the people in the
latest Gallup poll express approval of
President Reagan as he is preparing to
leave office so that you have what you
you just have said polls showing
opposition to his policies while he
himself remains
usually popular in the public stand I
think there's nothing much more striking
the polls and that is the events of the
1980s in the 1980s I think it's a very
dramatic fact that in the 1980s the
government was driven underground it was
forced to undertake large-scale
clandestine activities because of its
domestic enemy because the domestic
population would not tolerate those
activities in fact the Reagan
administration was very interesting in
this respect it's the first
administration to have created anything
like the State Department office of
public diplomacy I mean there were
elements of that before but here we had
I have to tell you the Kennedy
administration the Johnson
administration the Nixon administration
all engaged in domestic propaganda that
Rosa Wilson that's the Creole
Commission's work began looking up
police but but there's a substantial
increase in scale I mean in the Reagan
administration you really had a massive
enterprise to control the public mind
in fact when this was exposed during the
iran-contra hearings partially exposed
one high administration official
described that as the most successful
operation that carried out he said it's
the kind of operation that you carry out
in enemy territory and that expresses
the attitude toward the population
completely the population is the enemy
and you've got a control enemy territory
and the way you do it is by very
extensive public diplomacy meaning
propaganda sure it's always been there
but the toxin considered you subversive
people like you so that's right Richard
Nixon there's a quality the enemy were
the people in the street the
demonstrators but the point is there's a
qualitative change and the resources
that have been devoted and the
intelligence that has been devoted and
the resources drawn upon to ensure that
the that enemy territory is controlled
now why go into the what why do that
it's because the enemy is much more
dangerous the period when the enemy's
quiet pote the protesters at dissenters
yeah when the enemy is quiet you don't
elect for example when John F Kennedy
sent the American Air Force to start
bombing South Vietnam in 1962 as he did
he didn't have to keep it secret it was
in the front page in the New York Times
no
when Johnson sent 20,000 Marines the
Dominican Republic in fact to prevent a
democratic revival there that was there
was a little bit of protest but it
basically wasn't secret when Johnson
sent hundreds of thousands of troops to
invade South Vietnam it wasn't secret
when we subvert the only free election
and Laos in 1959 wasn't secret nobody
ever cared about these things the
population was really marginalized that
changed it changed as a result of the
popular movements of the 60s which had a
dramatic effect on the country and I
think a lasting effect you keep coming
back though to to the opposition to the
Central American policies and I have to
keep coming back asking what's the
evidence of other dissidents in the
early 60s there was nothing like an
environmental movement there was nothing
like a feminist movement the there was
an anti-nuclear movement but it was a
few people sitting in a room somewhere
it's now it's now a movement so vast
that it in fact got something like 75%
support for a nuclear freeze couldn't do
anything with that support but that's
because again because the organizational
structure was lacking but all of these
developments are extremely significant I
mean take say the churches in the 1960s
the church the church is by and large
were either supportive of government
military intervention or else quiescent
now it's very different now there Ronald
Otto that William Sloane coffin this the
civil rights movement was kontin's a
co-conspirator my but-but-but-but civil
rights movement was was driven by a
churchman Church women but the civil
rights movement was different and Martin
Luther rain was a himself with a Baptist
minister absolutely and in fact it was a
tremendously important movement and it
was a popular movement which for the
first time after close to 200 years at
least technically and franchised
a significant segment of the population
now that was a movement which did in
fact have wide scale support even
business support for that matter but it
would its the thrust of the civil right
rights movement was not directed against
the interests of
centralized power in the United States
now that's crucial the the protest
against the war or the environmental
movement or even the feminist movement
in other respects is directed against
power and those are the kinds that
didn't exist and they've developed in
the sixth time they existed to an extent
there's more democracy today
well there's on the one hand a lot more
popular expression of democracy on the
other hand it's less and less part of
the official of the actual institutions
of the system it's outside and that's
why you get these funny conflicts I mean
I can see it in my own personal life for
example over the last couple of years
the demands on me personally for say
speaking somewhere have escalated beyond
any anything imaginable I have to plan
years in advance and the audience that
are interested and thoughtful there they
reach out to parts of the population
that you couldn't have talked to years
ago if all this firm it is going on if
there is more dissidents now than you
can remember why do you go on to write
that the people feel isolated because I
think much of the general population
recognizes that the organized
institutions do not reflect their
concerns and interests and needs they do
not feel that they participate
meaningfully in the political system
they do not feel that the media are
telling them the truth or even reflect
their concerns they go outside of the
organized institutions to act and so on
the one hand you have a lot of popular
ferment a lot a dissident sometimes very
effective on the other hand you have
remoteness of the general public from
the functioning institutions we see more
and more of our elected leaders know
less and less of what they're doing this
medium does that very striking in fact
the presidential elections have been
almost removed from the point where the
public even takes them seriously is
involving a matter of choice take
congressional elections Congress
especially the house is more responsive
to public opinion that higher levels but
even here the the rate of
electoral victory by incumbents has
become has been going up ninety high 90s
well that virtually is a way of saying
that there aren't a election you know it
means that others is to get those hate
Kahn it is just so tell me it means it's
something else is happening not choice
you know that means that options are not
being presented and so on the one so I
think you do have a kind of a complex
situation in the United States there's a
break taking place a cleavage taking
place between a rather substantial part
of the population and elite elements
well that includes a lead
intellectualism to no but that elite
element is supported by a substantial
part of the population I mean there are
people who take seriously the debates
who go out and vote who think that
they're participating and believe
they're participating in a any
legitimate exercise of democracy it's
not a cleavage of the point of
revolution it's not that you have a
narrow it's not as if you had an
aristocracy facing a mass population
it's not Iran in 1979 nothing like that
okay shurik it's it's split and complex
and fluid and so on but I think you can
see tendencies you can see tendencies
towards popular marginalization from
functioning institutions and and
abstraction of those institutions from
reflection of the pop from public
participation or even reflection have an
actor that means what well it means that
the political system increasingly
increasingly functions without public
input it means to an increasing extent
not only do people not ratify decisions
presented to them but they don't in fact
is it but they don't even take the
trouble of ratifying them they assume
that the decisions are going on
independently of what they may do in the
polling booth and they feed us that even
ratification of decisions made elsewhere
is a very weak form of democracy
ratification would it would be what well
ratification would mean a system in
which there are two positions presented
to me the voter I go into the polling
booth and I push one or another button
depending on which of those positions I
want that's a very limited form of
democracy a real really meaningful
democracy would mean that
I play a role in forming those decisions
makin creating those positions that
those positions reflect my active
creative participation at it not just me
but of course everyone that would be
real democracy is not very far from that
but we're even departing from the point
where there is ratification when you
have stage-managed elections with the
public relations industry determining
what words come out of people's mouths
you in fact are going beyond to the
point where we are even than even the
element of ratification is disappearing
because you don't expect the candidates
to stand for anything candidates decide
what to say on the basis of tests that
determine what the effect will be across
the population somehow people don't see
how profoundly contemptuous that is of
democracy contemptuous yeah suppose I'm
working on running for office and I
don't tell people what I think or what
I'm going to do I tell them what the
pollsters have told told me is going to
get me elected that's expressing utter
contempt for the electorate that's
saying okay you people are going to have
the chance to push your buttons but once
you're done I'll do exactly what I
intend which is not what I'm telling you
see if you if you if you if you express
what you believe you don't have to ask
what the polls tell you then you express
you don't believe what the polls tell
you that's what you say and in fact the
whole construction of their political
system is increasingly moving towards a
real articulated expression of contempt
for the general population I think
people understand it if you conduct
polls to tell you what people want and
they tell you or you're not listening to
the voice of the people only if that
changes your mind but of course the
whole structure of the system is the
system is based on the assumption that
that doesn't change your mind it changes
what you say so in other words if
popular a political figure is not
testing the waters and saying okay
that's what I believe if we had that
kind of political figure wooden model
voting for him he's not a barometer the
political figure represents something
supported by certain interests has
certain commitments and so on and the
political figure then comes before us
and produces things which the pollsters
tell him or his
visors on the average will increase his
chances of gaining office after which he
will follow his commitments his
interests what is demanded of him by
those who supported him by those who
provide him with resources and so on
well this is always of course been true
but what is interesting now is the
extent to which it is recognized to be
the democratic system it is recognized
that we don't care what we say we don't
express interest what we do is reflect
power so I think I reckon is very
interesting political figure and I think
in a way he may represent the future of
where capitalist democracy is tending
he's very natural kind of phenomenon in
a capitalist democracy and a capitalist
democracy you have the problem and it is
always perceived as a problem that the
popular general population has a method
of participating in decision-making they
can participate in politics the state is
not capable of stopping them you can't
shut them up you can't put them in jail
you can't keep them away from the polls
and so on and it's striking that that
has always been perceived as a problem
to be overcome it's what's called the
crisis of democracy too many people
organizing themselves to become to
practice to enter the public arena
that's a crisis we have to overcome
boarding to a certain view it has always
been understood by I would say even the
mainstream of democratic theorists that
when the voice of the people is heard
you're in trouble because they're always
going to make the wrong decisions the
stupid and ignorant masses as they're
called are going to make the wrong
decisions so therefore what we have to
have what walter Lippmann back in 1920
or so called manufacture of consent we
have to ensure that actual
decision-making actual power is in the
hands of what he called a specialized
class a smart guys you know we're going
to make the right decisions and we've
got to keep the general population
marginalized because they're always
going to make mistakes marginalizing
meaning reduce them to apathy and
obedience allow them to participate in
the political system but as consumers
not as true participants that is allow
them a method for ratifying decisions
that are made by others but eliminate
the method
by which they might first inform
themselves second organize and third act
in such a way as to really control
decision-making that is the ideas our
leaders control us not we control them
now that is a very widespread view from
liberals to conservatives and how do you
achieve this whether a lot of ways of
achieving it but one of the ways of
achieving it is by creating a stirring
the elected offices into ceremonial
positions if you could get to the point
where people would essentially vote for
the Queen of England then you and take
it seriously then you would have gone a
long way towards marginalizing the
public and I think we've made a big step
in that presidency as ceremonial leader
as and see that's why Reagan's so
interesting because you know although a
lot of intellectuals try to put the best
face they can on it the fact of the
matter is and most of the population
knows that Ronald Reagan had only the
foggiest ideas of what the policies of
his administration were and in fact
nobody much cared the Democrats were
always surprised that he could get away
with these incredible bloopers and crazy
statements and so on the detachment to
John is energy and I think the reason is
that much of the population understood
very well that they were supporting
someone like the Queen of England or the
flag the Queen of England opens
Parliament by reading a political
program but nobody asks whether she
understands it or does she believe it or
anything like every book from within the
right administration from the stockmen
book to the Regan book to the new book
that's now on the on the new stands says
that says that the president was
detached from detached I think he
doesn't know what it is and I think and
I think much of the population
understood it now I think that explains
the combination of moderate not an
enormous but moderate popularity with
opposition to the programs what do we do
about it I mean I don't want to leave
people on a wholly negative analysis
although I believe in facing reality for
ordinary people it's extremely hard and
that's why you need organization what is
if a real democracy is going to thrive
if the real values that are deeply
embedded in human nature are going to be
able to flourish and I think that's
necessary to save us if nothing else it
will be it's an absolute necessity that
peak that groups form in which people
can join together can share their
concerns can articulate their ideas can
gain a response can discover what they
think can discover what they believe
what their values are
this can't be imposed on you from above
you have to discover it by experiment by
by by effort by trial by application and
so on and this has to be done with
others furthermore surely central to
human nature is a need to be engaged
with others in cooperative efforts of
solidarity and concern that can only
happen once by definition through group
structures and unless such a typical
organization political and other civic
organization I mean all they're all
kinds of ways in which people can
associate with one another and I think
what I would like to see is a move
towards a society which is really based
on Perla con proliferating voluntary
organization with eliminating as much as
possible structures of hierarchy and
domination and the basis for them and
ownership and control and becoming the
means by which we govern ourselves by
which we control our lives does this
love does a citizen have to have
far-reaching specialized knowledge to
understand the realities of power to
understand what's really going on you
know it's not absolutely trivial but I
mean as compared with intellectually
complex tasks it's pretty slight it's
not like the sciences I mean I think
this big effort made to make everything
seem mysterious but you know there are
things that you have to study and know
something about but by and large which
at what happens in social political and
political life is relatively accessible
it does not take special training it
does
take any unusual intelligence what it
really takes is honesty yeah if you're
honest you can see it do you believe in
common sense I mean yours absolutely you
do believe in Cartesian common sense I
think people have the capacities to see
through the deceit in which there and
sneered but they got to make the effort
seems a little in Congress to hear a man
from the ivory tower of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology a scholar a
distinguished linguistics scholar talk
about common people with such
appreciation and common sense I think
that the scholarship at least the field
that I work in has the opposite
consequences my own studies in language
and human cognition demonstrate to me at
least what remarkable creativity
ordinary people have the very fact that
people talk to one another is a
reflection just in the normal way I mean
any particularly fancy reflects
deep-seated features of human creativity
which in fact separate human beings from
any other biological system we know you
get tremendous respect for human beings
when you begin to study their normal
capacities from Boston this has been
part one of a conversation with Noam
Chomsky I'm Bill Moyers
