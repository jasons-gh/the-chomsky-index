your book you talk a lot about the the
first be the second conflict in Iraq and
how we're occupying it right now and you
don't approve of it what do you think do
you think the initial invasion of Iraq
in the early 90s the first conflict was
justified well the first the second
conflict was just an outright aggression
it was just you know it was quote it was
what was called in the Nuremberg
Tribunal the supreme international crime
which include differs from other war
crimes in that it includes all the evil
that follows that's the second invasion
I don't see what there is discuss about
that the total horror story the first
invasion is more controversial but and
it's kind of interesting to look at if
you're interested if going into the
details including the internal record
and shortly after it in a book called
deterring democracy s'mores appeared
since but roughly the same story what
happened is that in the United States
was very strongly supporting Saddam
Hussein remember that began in 1982
under Reagan we have this thing called a
terrorist list which is just an outrage
it's a list invented by the government
it's not under any review if someone's
put on it like say Nelson Mandela
there's nothing you can say about it the
Mandela case illustrates the way it
works but a very Senate's being used
right now remember that's being used to
attack American groups and so on the one
striking illustration of how it works
was in 1982 Saddam Hussein had been on
the Iraq had been on the terrorist list
but the Reagan administration wanted to
support Iraq in its aggression against
Iran the bigger enemy so it was
necessary to remove you
back from the terrorist list so they
were removed shortly after Donald
Rumsfeld made a famous trip to Baghdad
who's shaking hands with Saddam ranging
for aid to be given and so on there
incidentally was a gap on the terrorist
list then so I had to be filled so they
decided to put Cuba on the terrorist
list the reason presumably was because
Cuba was far and away the leading victim
of international terrorism which in fact
had been expanding right through the
late seventies and we'll go through the
details so that was the terrorist list
u.s. strongly supported Saddam during
the iran-iraq war the Reagan
administration even went so far as to
block protests against Saddam's worst
atrocities the massacres of the Kurds
you know Al Anfal Massacre Alaba
the Reagan administration blocked any
action in fact tried to blame them on
Iran basically won the war for Iraq that
by the end you ran finally capitulated
after the war was over the US continues
to strongly support Iraq and this is now
Georgia first Bush George HW Bush he
increased aid to Iraq he actually
invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to the
United States for advanced training and
nuclear weapons development that was
1989 goes on into early 1990 the Bush
administration sent a delegation to Iraq
led by Robert dole Center Senate
Majority Leader later presidential
candidate including Senator Simpson
other dignitaries they went there to
Iraq to bring the president's greetings
to his friends Saddam Hussein the
transcript of that meeting is available
and I urge reading it they were
basically informing Saddam that he
should disregard critics in the American
press we have this free press business
we can't shut up
but they said they would remove somebody
from The Voice of America who was
criticizing Saddam and so on all of that
was I think April 1990 a great friend
August 1990 said I made his first
mistake
he either violated or probably
misunderstood orders and invaded Kuwait
well they were all kind of reasons for
that I won't go into them whatever they
were he invaded Kuwait very quick the
Bush administration immediately
recognized that this is an opportunity
not only to switch sides but to finally
you know crush him they liked him but
it's better to have somebody loyal
Saddam immediately recognized he'd been
made a big mistake and within weeks he
began to produce offers to withdraw the
in Washington you look back at the
debates the concern was his chief of
staff Powell put it that Saddam will
withdraw and leave a puppet regime in
place and all the Arab states will be
happy in other words Saddam would do
what the United States had just done in
Panama look at the reports on Noriega
today and you'll notice something's
missing how the United States got rid of
Noriega and Panama Panama Noriega had
also been a big buddy the United States
but he also kind of stopped obeying
orders they turned against him invaded
Panama killed hundreds or maybe
thousands of people nobody counts when
their victims attacked the Vatican
embassy where Noriega it was tonight he
gets asylum and finally kidding that got
him out of the country took him to
Florida where he was tried and convicted
for real crimes which he had committed
while he was on the CIA payroll like if
you read the papers today they talked
about how the family of Spada for one of
his victims are calling for the
compensation they failed to mention that
Spatafore was
murdered while the United States was
supporting Noriega under Reagan and in
fact praising him for the wonderful
things he was doing that out of history
again anyhow they were afraid that Iraq
would do just what the US had done in
Panama and invade the country install a
puppet regime and leave the difference
was that the Latin American countries
were infuriated they weren't happy about
it but they thought that the Arab
countries would be happy with this well
they wanted to block that they wanted a
chance to invade and in fact if you look
over the next couple of months the media
reporting is quite interesting there
were people in the government who were
leaking regularly leaking offers from
Saddam Hussein to negotiate a withdrawal
and the press wasn't covering them they
were finally they were being published
interestingly mainly by a small suburban
newspaper Long Island Newsday it's a
Long Island newspaper which happened to
be distributed in New York so you could
get a the newsstands in New York would
have a no cover of the island Newsday
with long on a Newsday with a big
headline saying Saddam says let's talk
us says no well you know after that the
New York Times had to have a comment on
page 28 at the bottom of a page the next
day saying State Department denies
rumors or something but these things
were almost certainly being leaked to
the New York Times nobody leaks things
to Newsday and presumably they just
wouldn't publish them so they were
leaked to Newsday this went on for a
couple of months finally by January
we're now in January 1990 lasted I made
a pretty definite offer to withdraw on
conditions which were in fact supported
by about two-thirds of the American
population withdrawal from Kuwait total
withdrawal from Kuwait in the context of
a regional conference on security issues
okay that's code words for Israel's
occupation of
Palestine so of course the US wasn't
having any of that and that also Paris
essentially wasn't reported a couple of
lines here and there and then the u.s.
invaded crushed Iraq easily destroyed
the infrastructure carried out a really
brutal war I'm in Iraq of course we
through from Kuwait but it looked as if
that could have been easily arranged
just by diplomacy negotiations
then comes the sanctions regime that's a
huge issue in the Arab world nothing
here after 9/11 polls here taken here
about you know why do they hate us that
kind of thing to show that one of the
main reasons was the Iraq sanctions even
among people very supportive of the
United States the sanctions were really
murders they killed hundreds of
thousands of people they devastated the
civilian population they strengthened
Saddam they compelled the population to
rely on him for survival they probably
protected him from the fate of other
monsters those I mentioned who were
overthrown from within
no Somoza and Marcos the rest of them he
was protected from that and this this
was known the people who knew the
Westerners who knew most about Iraq by
far were the two international diplomats
who administered the oil-for-food
program distinguished international
diplomats Dennis holiday from Ireland
Huntsman sponeck from Germany of very
outspoken both resigned on grounds that
the sanctions were as they put it
genocide 'el they had a lot of
information about Iraq they had
investigators all over the country they
were getting all sorts of information
sending it back to the Security Council
where the US wouldn't let it be
presented both resigned on grounds of
the they were genocidal fun sponeck
published a major book on it I urge you
to read it it's called a different kind
of war carefully documented
scholarly account of what the sanctions
were doing I don't think it's ever been
mentioned in the United States or in
England not that I can find at least
that's what was happening that protected
Saddam and then we get to the second
innovation so there's a lot to say about
the first invasion I mean you can argue
about it at least it's debatable
unlike in my opinion the second one but
I don't think it stands up very well to
scrutiny and I didn't think so at the
time for the kind of reasons I mentioned
you can check them out and see what you
think
