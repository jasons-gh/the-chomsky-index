in theoretical terms I sense a great
affinity between the analysis you and
Edward as Herman present in
manufacturing consent and the dissident
cultural research engaged in by Western
Marxist during the 20th century you are
famously given to quoting Antonio
Gramsci saying pessimism of the
intellect optimism of the world I would
like to ask whether you believe the u.s.
populace to be too conservative
distracted and enthralled by the system
to move radically against it do you
think the public will become the second
superpower you go for in hegemony more
survival well I'm not sure the public is
that conservative frankly there are some
interesting indications of the contrary
so for example in 1976 bicentennial of
the Declaration independent there was
support they were polls taken in which
people were asked what they thought was
in the Constitution and nobody has a
clue what's in the Constitution but the
answers basically were do you think this
is an obvious truth if it is probably in
the Constitution one of them was one of
the questions was to each from each
according to his ability to each
according to his needs majority of the
population thought that was a
constitutional because obviously true in
the late 1980s there were polls taken
asking people do you think that a right
to public to healthcare is in the
Constitution very large proportion i
think maybe
population clause in the Constitution if
you take a look at polls generally you
find that even among sectors of the
population that are considered very
right-wing you do studies of people and
say get the government off my back I
don't want the government they are not
be social democrats they want more
spending on health or spending on
education that we're spending on that
same others with dependent children but
not welfare because welfare was
demonized by racist Reagan and others
but add this runs across the board even
on international affairs so a majority
of the population that thinks that the
u.s. ought to give up the veto of the
Security Council and follow what the
general what the world population
believes is right you take a look at
taxes striking live in Paul's on taxes
for about 40 years but the Wellman with
the population thinks the rich should be
taxed more they're undertaxed policy
goes the opposite direction polls are
not the defendant you have to inquire
into why people are answering the way
they do lots of reasons but they're not
insignificant either my own feeling is
that people like Adam Smith were
basically right that there is a natural
scent
for others and I think the rich and
powerful understand that I think that's
one of the reasons why they're such
massive effort to destroy the
institutions in the society that are
based on solidarity so for example why
is the right wing in fact not just the
right link goes over to Obama so intent
on undermining Social Security it costs
nothing essential it's a very efficient
program the people survive on it it
works very well there's no economic
problems that could be tinkered with its
really marginal but there's a major
effort to destroy it why it's based on
solidarity it's based on concern for
others as a major attack on the public
schools deep underfunding vouchers all
kind of things foundations are trying to
undermine why public schools are major
contributions of modern society they're
one of the real contributions of
American society mascot of Education the
whitest ridden based on so there if you
take the ideology that we're supposed to
believe in why should I pay taxes for
the schools in my neighborhood of kids
in school or a children's school and
never will why should I pay taxes well
you know if you pay taxes so that kid
across the street will go to school
because you care about other people but
thats has to be driven out of people's
heads it's a little bit like markets and
consumption markets are favored by the
economics profession by the rich and so
on to a point they really don't believe
in they want the state powerful state to
come in and say even if they're in
trouble ideologically their preferred
because they restrict human action to
individual self gratification not mutual
support not protection of the comment
actually the comments are an interesting
case we're coming up to the 800th
anniversary of Magna Carta back part at
two part that one part was the charter
of liberties the central part was
presumption of innocence that's out the
window okay that's by now guilty means
Obama wants to kill you tomorrow that's
the definition of guilty innocent means
he didn't get around
but the other part of the Magna Carta
was the charter of the forest that's the
part that's kind of he find in popular
myth what the Robin Hood myth Robin Hood
was protecting the commons from the
Predators that's a big part of our
history in English history the comments
were cultivated by the general
population of the Commons were these the
forests fields the source of fuel food
welfare you know videos would pick
things from the common from the forest
to survive and was nurtured was nurtured
by the public was cared for they weren't
that that grow into jungles they were
carefully carefully the common the chart
forests was an effort not by the
population by the Barons to protect the
comments from the king but the
population wanted to protect the
comments for themselves then you move
into the capitalist period beginning
with the enclosure movements which grew
feel off the land and so on you have
instruction of the Commons today and the
capitalist ethic there's a concept
called the tragedy that traumas which
you study in economics which teaches you
that if you don't have private ownership
of the Commons want to be destroyed well
based on capitalism or morality that's
if I don't know it was shy to drive
observe but in ordinary human life
that's just totally fallen privatization
is the tragedy that comments we can see
that but when you privatize the commons
just straight for private property if
the Commons are kept under common
control their cultivated nurture because
people care about each other they care
about the future well okay I think these
are very different when you ask is the
population conservative I doubt it I
think that these are deeply rooted
sentiments and understandings which show
up wallet on they showed up and showed
up in labor struggles against the
industrial system which was dehumanizing
people in peasant societies they show up
indigenous today struggling against safe
gold mines may be given more material
wealth destroy their lives you find this
everywhere and in the great thinkers of
the past people we supposed to admire
like Adam Smith it's as central doctor
