hello everybody and welcome my name is
Leanne Gillooly and I'm the president of
the Boston University anti-war coalition
we are a coalition formed as an alliance
of students United in support of an end
to Wars and a non-violent methods of
social change our main purpose is to
raise awareness through education and to
advocate and develop a legislative
agenda that promotes our established
goals I would like to start off the
evening by sharing some thoughts with
you it is no secret that we live in an
extremely complex world and everyday
society spawns new issues that become
increasingly difficult to solve
as technology booms in our collective
intelligence expands limits are replaced
with innovations to the likes of which
our parents could have never dreamed
progress has led to an intricately run
consumer based mass production society
that is showing no signs of slowing down
yet in our current state of affairs you
do not have to look far to see our
economic slowdown increasing
unemployment or lackluster medical care
the incarceration rate in the United
States is among the highest in the world
while energy prices skyrocket are
skyrocketing and our ignorant of the
looming climate crisis continues and of
course there's the quagmire that is Iraq
which everybody seems to recognize as a
blunder yet nobody can seem to find a
way out of information about Iraq has
been staled from the beginning the
mainstream media effectively blacks out
gruesome pictures of war and the many
actions of the anti-war movement while
simultaneously misdirecting the public
with lofty rhetoric and distracting them
with breaking stories about Britney
Spears there are over 4,000 dead
American troops and estimates of
anywhere from 80,000 to over 1 million
deceased Iraqis the majority of them
civilians with this war our government
has carried out an assault on our civil
liberties from legalizing and justifying
torture of innocent people to openly
spying on our citizens while all along
the military industrial complex is
turning out profit in many different
arena arenas and top government
officials personally profit from
government contracts that serve the
private companies such as the prime
example of vice president Cheney's
Halliburton this is all topped off with
the mind-numbing redundancies of the
presidential campaigns complete with
media distractions personal attacks at
platforms that lead half-hour
since feeling disenfranchised
considering that this country was
founded upon the concept of for the
people by the people
it is dismaying that the public interest
in the in u.s. policies has drastically
fallen over time while the detrimental
effects these policies have in the rest
of the world have exponentially grown
how many more transgressions well our
unchecked government commits before
people get mad what does it take for
those not awake to the urgency of our
distress to finally see it and what does
it take for those who are conscious of
our ills to feel obliged to fix it some
argue that it takes a tragedy
yet with tragedy abound to every page
sort of the newspaper people are
desensitized to it the lack of outrage
at the war in Iraq and our burgeoning
domestic issues most notably from my
generation is due to viewing these
issues as distant abstractions society
desperately needs to be dislodged from
the complacent back seat
of American politics our methods of
government are punctuated with
rudimental grievances that our
politicians attempt to mend with
band-aids being anti-war means a lot
more than just desiring an end to this
war what we are really fighting is a
system that has led to massive
destruction on a global scale and will
continue to without a people of our
ideology on a restructuring of our
political system that is why undeniable
parallels between the wars and Iraq and
Vietnam can be drawn and why the social
movements of the 60s are used as a
paradigm for today's revolution and that
is why hate has been perpetuated instead
of unqualified love the great
enlightenment of our generation will
come but it will not look like it did in
the 60s we the current students of
America are faced with a difficult task
of having to run this place in the
future some say that there's simply
nothing anybody can do to fix it that
the powers that be are too overwhelming
to counter that public dissent is a
thing of a past here I like to invoke
Margaret Mead who once said don't ever
tell me that a small group of thoughtful
people could not change the world indeed
it's the only thing that ever has we
must work within the confines of the
structures of society for in the end it
is simply a game of power politics and
social status that when wisely
manipulated can be utilized to put
someone of good intention into power yet
this ultra concentrated power is
undeniably tainting and the real
challenge lies in combating the culture
of greed bigotry ignorant and
intolerance that permeates the United
States
because these plates are not identified
by our increasing increasingly
unbalanced media we turn to the unsung
heroes who have been the voices of
dissent the forefront of innovative
philosophy and the words bold and brave
enough to question reality I'll never
forget the day I first discovered Noam
Chomsky I had Inklings that there was
something off about this society I've
been living in for 18 years especially
considering the war we had begun in Iraq
feeling overwhelmed in an attempt to
locate some facts I was sifting through
media and I came across an article
professor Chomsky wrote in December of
2002 and my mind was cracked wide open
part of the article entitled modest
proposal Illustrated a persistent
pattern of policies that had been
occurring for decades and showed no
signs of changing It was as if I had
been staring straight at something for
years yet I was actually seeing it for
the first time mr. Chomsky's work is
like a precision laser whittling down
the cumbersome ideologies indoctrinated
into the social psyche exposing and
condemning their flawed underbellies a
true renegade professor Chomsky has
remained one of the most celebrated and
highly demanded voices of revolution
since he first took a stance in the 60s
although relentlessly sought after by
international media sources he's often
criticized at home in the u.s. most
widely recognized for his groundbreaking
contributions in the field of
linguistics undergrads cannot take a
course in evolutionary psychology
computer science or international
politics without encountering the works
of Professor Chomsky his tall intellect
is conditioned with a social
consciousness that gives purpose and
depth to his works his flame has been
ignited minds and hearts for decades
especially at his beloved school of MIT
where he has taught for the past 53
years his wisdom is adorned with
experience and professed with clarity
above all else
his in devout individuality is marked by
his unique positions for he has never
allowed anybody to put him in a box
refusing to reside along the established
plane of party politics he has added a
dimension to the otherwise horizontal
political spectrum he has taught to
dispel preconceived notions ignore
propagandistic headlines tune out sound
bites fight off their self-serving
tendencies and instead of sharpening
differences between one another
recognize the commonalities of man and
the potential for justice and peace that
exists with within each being he has
taught to question everything about the
reality to criticize and debate those in
power to find a more human response to
the challenges posed by globalization
his ability to think in different modes
has allowed for life-changing
revelations and has inspired my thinking
and it is my hope that you all be
inspired as well the future that is at
stake is our own and I believe with
intelligent reasoning and original
thought the answers to all these
questions can be discovered so without
further ado I am honored to introduce to
you the brilliant author empowered
lecturer multi-talented adoring father
and doting husband he's received
honorary degrees from over two dozen of
the top universities on the planet he
has been called by the New York Times
arguably the most important intellectual
alive and he's among the eight among the
eight most cited scholars in history I
could go on for hours about all the
college credentials literally but ladies
and gentlemen the one and only professor
Noam Chomsky
well I don't anticipate living up to
that but I'll try I've been asked to
talk about modern-day American
imperialism that's a rather challenging
task in fact the talk about American
imperialism is a little bit like talking
about triangular triangles the United
States is the one country that exists as
far as I know and ever has that was
founded as an empire explicitly
according to the founding fathers when
the country was found that it was a
nascent Empire that's George Washington
modern day American imperialism is just
a later phase of a process that has
continued from the first moment without
a break going in a very steady line so
we're looking at one phase in a process
that was initiated when the country was
founded and has never changed the model
for the founding fathers had borrowed
from Britain of that at that time was
the Roman Empire then they wanted to
emulate it I'll talk about that a little
even before the Revolution these notions
were very much alive Benjamin Franklin
25 years before the Revolution
complained to the British that they were
imposing limits on the expansion of the
colonies and he objected to this he
borrowing from Machiavelli he admonished
the British and quoting him that a
prince that acquires new territories and
removes the native the natives to give
his people room will be remembered as
the father of the nation and George
Washington agreed he wanted to be the
father of the nation his view was that
the gradual extension of our settlement
will a certainly caused the savage as
the wolf to retire both being beasts of
prey of a different shape
I'll skip some contemporary analogues
that you can think of Thomas Jefferson
the most forthcoming of the founding
fathers I said we shall drive them the
savages we shall drive them with the
beasts of the forests into the stony
mountains and the country will
ultimately be free of blot or mixture
meaning red or black wasn't quite
achieved but that was the goal
furthermore Jefferson went on our new
nation will be the nest from which all
America
north and south is to be people
displacing not only the red the red men
here but the Latin the spanish-speaking
population to the south and anyone else
who happened to be around there was a
deterrent to those glorious aims mainly
Britain Britain was the most powerful
military force in the world at the time
and it did prevent the steps that the
founding fathers in tempt attempted to
take in particular it blocked the
invasion of Canada the first invasion of
Canada attempted invasion of Canada was
before the Revolution and there were
several others later but it was always
blocked by British force which is why
Canada exists the United States did not
actually recognize Canada's existence
until after the first world war another
goal that was blocked by British force
was Cuba the again the founding fathers
regarded the taking over of Cuba as
essential to the survival of the nascent
Empire but the British fleet was in the
way and they were too powerful just like
the Russians blocked john f kennedy's
invasions the however the they
understood that it would sooner or later
would come the great grand strategist
john quincy adams the sort of electoral
father of manifest destiny he pointed
out in the 1820s
that we just have to wait I said Cuba
will sooner or later
fall into our hands by the laws of
political gravitation just as an Apple
falls from the tree what he meant is
that over time the United States would
become more powerful a Britain would
become weaker and the deterrent would be
overcome which in fact finally happened
and we should not ignore these early
events they are very much related to
current history that's made very clear
by scholarship on current affairs so the
major scholarly work on the Bush
Doctrine george w bush doctrine the
pre-emptive war doctrine major work is
by John Lewis Gaddis who's the most
respected historian of the Cold War
period it's on the roots of the Bush
Doctrine and he traces it right back to
John Quincy Adams who is his hero the
great grand strategist in particular to
Andrew Jackson's invasion of Florida
which conquered Florida from the Spanish
and that was strongly approved by then
Secretary of State Adams
in a famous state paper in which he
advocated the principle of pre-emptive
war
on the basis of the thesis that
expansion is the path to security so if
we want to be secure after all we want
to defend ourselves we have to expand at
that time expand into Florida we were
being threatened by what were called the
runaway slaves and lawless Indians who
were in the way they were threatening us
by their existence by barring our
expansion and as Gaddis points out
there's a straight line from that to
George Bush and now expansion is the
path the security means we take over the
world we take over space take over the
galaxy
there's no limit to how much you have to
expand to guarantee security and that's
been the
principle from the beginning goddess is
a good historian and he cites the right
sources on the so-called seminal war
Jackson's conquest of Florida but he
doesn't bother telling us what the
sources say and it's worth looking at
what they say they describe it as a war
of murder and plunder and extermination
driving out the indigenous population
there were pretexts made but they were
so flimsy that nobody paid much
attention to them it was also the first
executive war in violation of the
Constitution setting a precedent which
has been followed ever since there was
no congressional authorization that's
all like Adams lied through his teeth to
Congress I mean it's all very familiar
so Gaddis is correct it is the model for
the Bush Doctrine he approves of both of
them but that's a moral judgment but his
analysis correct yes what's happening
now traces right back to the wars of
extermination and plunder and murder and
lying and deceit and so on executive
Wars of that John Quincy Adams was the
great spokesman for Adams incidentally
later his life regretted this he after
his own contributions were well in the
past he condemned the Mexican War as an
executive war and a terrible precedent
wasn't a precedent he'd established the
precedent and he also expressed remorse
over what he called that hapless race of
Native Americans which we are
exterminating with such mercial
merciless and perfidious cruelty they
knew what they were doing contemporary
history likes to prettify it but if you
read the descriptions and the
observations by the people who are
involved they know exactly what they
were doing he expressed regret for it
but of course his own role was long past
well the it's commonly argued that
American imperialism began in 1898
that's when in 1890
the US did finally succeed in conquering
Cuba which called in history books
liberating Cuba namely intervening in
order to prevent Cuba from liberating
itself from Spain and turning it into a
virtual colony as it remained until 1959
setting off hysteria in the United
States which hasn't ended yet the also
conquering taking over Hawaii which was
stolen by force and guile from its
population Puerto Rico another colony
soon moving to the Philippines and
liberating the Philippines also
liberating a couple of hundred thousand
souls to heaven and the process and
again the reverberations of that extend
right to the present with ample state
terror and the one corner of Asia that
hasn't undergone a high development
something we're not supposed to notice
but the the belief they're old that the
Imperial thrust started in 1898 is an
example of what historians of Empire are
called the salt water fallacy the belief
that you have an empire if you cross
salt water in fact if the Mississippi
River were as wide as the Irish Sea the
Imperial thrust would have started much
earlier but that's an irrelevance I mean
expanding over a settled territory is no
different from expanding over the waters
so what happened in 1898 was just an
extension of the process that began when
the nascent Empire as it saw itself was
formed in its first moments the and the
extension to Beyond was again a lot of
this starts right into England with New
England merchants who wanted to know
very eager to take over the Pacific
trade the fabulous markets of China
which were always in their minds which
meant conquering the northwest so you
can control the ports and so on kicking
the British
the others out and so on that went on
from right here the goal was the William
Seward Secretary of State and 1860s
pointed out that the central figure in
American imperialism that we have to
gain command of the Empire of the Seas
conquered continent we're going to
settle take it over monitor doctrine was
a declaration that we'll take it over
everybody else keep out and the process
of doing so continued through the 19th
century and beyond until today but now
we have to have command of the Seas and
that meant when the time was ripe 30
years later when the apple started to
fall from the tree given relative power
proceeding overseas to the overseas
empire but it's basically no different
than the earlier steps the leading
philosophical Imperia Imperial is bricks
Adams he pointed out that his 1895 were
just on the verge of moving overseas
extensively that all Asia must be
reduced to our economic system the
Pacific must be turned into an inland
sea just like the Caribbean had been and
there's no reason he said why the United
States should not become a greater seat
of wealth and power than ever was
England Rome or Constantinople well
again there was a deterrent the European
powers wanted a piece of the action in
East Asia and Japan by then was a
becoming a formidable force so it was
necessary to explore more complex modes
of gaining command of turning the
Pacific into an inland sea and going on
and that was lucidly explained by
Woodrow Wilson who is one of the most
brutal and vicious interventionists in
American history the probable permanent
destruction of Haiti is one of his many
accomplishments those of you who study
international relations theory or read
about it know that there's a notion of
Wilsonian idealism
the fact that that notion can exist is a
very interesting commentary on our
intellectual culture and scholarly
culture if you look at his actual
actions fine words are easy enough but
these are some of his fine words which
he was smart enough not to put into
print he just ripped them for himself I
said since trade ignores national
boundaries and the manufacturer insists
on having the world as a market the flag
of his nation must follow must follow
him and the doors of the nations which
are closed against him must be battered
down even if the sovereignty of
unwilling nations be outraged in the
process no useful corner of the world
may be overlooked or left unset left
unused that's nineteen seven there's a
current version of that a crude version
by Thomas Friedman who says that
McDonald's cannot flourish without
McDonnell Douglas meaning the US Air
Force
well that's crude version of Wilson's
point they got about patted down the
doors by force and threat and no corner
of the world must be left unused no
useful corner there was a watershed in
this process at the time the Second
World War the time of the Second World
War the u.s. already had by far the
largest economy in the world and had for
a long time but it wasn't a major player
in world affairs Britain was the leading
player of France second the United
States a lagging it controlled the
hemisphere you know had made forays into
the Pacific but was not the leading
player however during the war the u.s.
planners understood that the war was
going to end with the u.s. the world
dominant power however it turned out
other competitors were going to destroy
themselves and each other and the US
would be left alone that comparable
security in fact the u.s. gained
enormous Lee from the war
industrial production virtually
quadrupled the war ended the depression
New Deal measures hadn't done so the
u.s. ended at the end of the war the US
had literally half the world's wealth
and competitors were virtually
distributed either damaged or Syria or
destroyed and incomparable security
controlled Western Hemisphere controlled
both oceans controlled the opposite side
of both oceans is nothing remotely like
it in history and during the war
planners understood that something like
that was going to turn out was obvious
from the nature of the war from 1939 to
1945 there were high-level meetings
regular meetings of the State Department
State Department planners and the
Council on Foreign Relations the sort of
main external nongovernmental input into
foreign policy and they laid careful
plans for the world that they expected
but to emerge it was a world they said
in which the United States will hold
unquestioned power and will ensure the
limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by States that might
interfere with u.s. global designs and
certainly I'm not quoting neo-cons on
quoting the Roosevelt administration the
peak of American liberalism the they
called for what they called an
integrated policy to achieve military
and economic supremacy for the United
States and bar any exercise of
sovereignty by anyone who would
interfere with it and they would do this
in a region that they called the grand
area well in the early part of the war
in 1939 the 1943 the grand area was
defined as the western hemisphere
routinely the former British Empire
which the US would take over and the Far
East that would be the grand area they
assumed at the time that there would be
a German led world the rest so would be
a non German world that's us in the
German world as the Russians gradually a
ground down
the Nazi armies after 1942 it became
pretty clear that there wouldn't be a
German world so the grand area was
expanded to be as much of the world as
could be controlled the limitless
that's simply pursuing the old position
that expansion is the path to security
for the nascent Empire of 1776 the these
policies were laid down during the war
but then they were implemented right
after the war in fact the thought you
now that we have available the
declassified record the planning
documents of the late late 1940s it
turns out they're not very surprisingly
very similar to the wartime planning the
one of the leading figures was George
Kennan was head of the State Department
the policy planning staff he wrote one
of his many important papers in 1948 PPS
23 if you want to look it up noted that
the United States has half the world's
wealth but only 6% of its population and
our primary goal in foreign policy must
be as he put it to maintain this
disparity and in order to do so we must
put aside all vague and idealistic
slogans about democracy and human rights
those are for public propaganda and
colleges and so on but we must put those
aside and keep to pure power concepts we
had no other way to maintain the
disparity and then in the same paper and
elsewhere he and his staff went through
the world assigned to each part of the
world what would be what they called its
function within this global system that
in which the US would have unchallenged
power unquestioned power so Latin
America and the Middle East the Middle
East obviously would provide the energy
resources that we would control
gradually pushing out Britain throwing
out France immediately and pushing out
Britain
slowly over the years and turning it
into essentially a junior partner as the
British Foreign Office ruefully
described their role at that time the
Latin America we simply control that's
our little region over here which has
never bothered anyone that is a
Secretary of War Stimson said while the
US was violating the principles it was
establishing by setting up a regional
organization in violation of the UN
Charter and so on so Latin America we
keep at least we control Southeast Asia
would be its function was to provide
resources and raw materials to the
former colonial powers meanwhile we
would purchase them - that would send
dollars there which the colonial powers
would take not the population and they
could use those to Britain France
Netherlands could use the dollars to
purchase US manufacturers it's called a
triangular trading arrangement which
would allow the US had the only really
functioning industrial system in the
world had a huge excess of manufacturing
products and there was what was called a
dollar gap of the countries we wanted to
sell it to who didn't have dollars
that's Europe basically so we had to
provide them with dollars and the role
of function of Southeast Asia was to
play a role in that
hence the support for French colonialism
and recapturing it's in the Chinese
colony and so on it's a there was
various variations but that's the basic
story the and so cannon went through the
world and signed them its function each
part when he got to Africa he decided
that the United States really didn't
have much interest in Africa that time
and therefore we should hand it over to
the Europeans to exploit his word to
exploit for their reconstruction he said
it would also give him a kind of a
psychological lift after the damage of
the war and while we were taking over
all of their domains well you could
imagine a different relationship between
Europe and Africa and the light of
history but that
wouldn't even be considered I mean it
was like too outlandish to discuss and
still is so Africa was to be exploited
by Europe for its reconstruction with
consequences we know us has since gotten
into the act
well that was canon he was removed from
office soon after because he was
considered too soft-hearted not up to
dealing with this harsh world and he was
replaced with real tough guys Dean
Acheson : it see and others and it's no
time to go through it but if you ever
won an education on hysterical jingoist
fanaticism you really should read their
documents if you've studied these issues
you've heard of at least NSC 68 which is
discussed by everyone but its rhetoric
is omitted and you have to look at its
rhetoric to see what's going on in these
crazed heads of the great thinkers and
this is true of the whole national
security council culture there's a
wonderful book on it that came out a
couple years ago by James Peck
Scientologists who called Washington's
China is the first scholarly book to go
through the whole national security
culture and it's like reading a
collection of Mad Men you know the work
was very much worth studying much more
worth studying than most of what people
study in their courses on these issues
well anyway that's what do we do that
Latin America the the one we just nobody
has you know our domain well Kenan was
pretty explicit about that too he said
in Latin America we should prefer police
States the reason is and he said that
harsh government measures of repression
should cause no qualms as long as the
results are unbalanced favorable to our
interests in particular as long as we
guarantee the protection of our
resources the resources happen to be
somewhere else but that's a historical
accident there are our resources and we
have to protect them and if you have to
do it by the mailed fist okay that's the
way you do it as I say he was
moved the there is a long ugly history
there's no time to go through it but the
Cold War history essentially follows
this pattern the Cold War was a kind of
a tacit compact between the super V
superpower and it's on the smaller power
the United States and Russia the compact
was that the United States would be free
to carry out violence and terror and
atrocities limitless in its own domains
and the Russians would be able to run
their own dungeon without too much US
interference so the Cold War in effect
was a war of the United States against
the third world and of Russia against
its much smaller domains in Eastern
Europe and the events of the Cold War
illustrate that each great power used
the others threats as a pretext for
repression and violence and destruction
the United States way more than Russia
if you look at the record reflecting its
their relative power but that's
essentially the picture you can see the
in fact for the United States the war
was basically a war again the Cold War
was a war of a basically a war against a
independent nationalism in the third
world what was called radical
nationalism the radical means doesn't
follow orders so constant struggle
against radical nationalism in
particular the leading thesis all the
way through is that even the smallest
place if it becomes independent is a
serious danger it's what Henry Kissinger
called a virus that might infect others
like even a tiny place you know Grenada
or something if it has successful
independent development others might get
the idea that we can follow the rot will
spread as patches and put it so you've
got to stamp it out right at the source
it's not a novel idea any Mafia Don will
explain it to you the Godfather
does not tolerate it when some small
storekeeper doesn't pay protection money
not that he needs the money but
kind like a bad idea of theirs I get the
idea and in particular small weak
countries have to be we have to crush
them with particular violence so that
others because they are it's easy you
know nobody can stop you and others get
the point
that's a large part of International
Affairs right to the present well to
learn about what the Cold War was about
the obvious place to look is what
happened when it ended
ok so November 1989 the Berlin Wall fell
Soviet Union soon collapsed so what did
the United States do
how did it react I mean the pretext for
everything that had happened in the past
was you know the Russian monster the
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
attempting to take over the world as
john f kennedy called it
well now the monolithic and ruthless
conspiracy was gone so what do we do
well it turns out what we do is exactly
the same thing but with different
pretext and that was made clear
instantly a couple of weeks after the
Blin Berlin Wall fell
the United States invaded Panama killing
unknown numbers of people we don't count
our victims according to Panamanian
human rights groups maybe a couple
thousand people bombing the slum melchio
slum the Panamanians take it seriously
in fact last December they once again
declared a national day of mourning
about the referring to the invasion I
don't even think I made the newspapers
here and when you crush ants and your
path you don't pay much attention to
their you know what they may have to say
about it but they invaded Panama had to
veto the Security Council resolutions
the point of the invasion was to kidnap
a kind of a minor thug Noriega who was
kidnapped brought to the United States
tried sentenced long sentence a sense
for crimes that were real but he had
committed them when he was on the CIA
payroll almost without exception small
footnote
oh but but for that we had to invade
Panama and kill however many people it
was a couple of thousand probably and
install a government of bankers and
narco traffickers that drug trafficking
shot up and so on about a successful
invasion and applauded here it was kind
of a footnote to history that's the kind
of thing the US doesn't its domains all
the time but it was a little different
for one thing the pretexts were
different this time it wasn't we were
defending ourselves against the Russians
it was we were defending ourselves
against the Hispanic narco traffickers
who were going to come and shoot up our
kids and destroy the country and so on
and in fact Noriega was a minor
narco-trafficker had mostly been working
for the CIA but he became unacceptable
when he started dragging his feet on
following orders like he didn't
participate enthusiastically enough in
the u.s. terrorist war against nicaragua
and so on so he obviously had to go well
one difference was that it had different
pretext another was that the United
States was much freer to act that was
pointed out right away by Elliott Abrams
as now after he's not back in office
running Middle East affairs he pointed
out right away that the invasion of
Panama was different from what had
preceded because we didn't have to be
concerned about the Russians stirring up
trouble somewhere in the world we were
free to use force without impediment and
correct observation counts goes on right
until today many of the violent acts
that the US has carried out since then
it would have hesitated seriously about
if there was a deterrent but now there
are no deterrence anymore so you do what
you like that was a change the again if
you want to learn more about what the
Cold War was about have a look at the
documents that were produced right
afterwards this is George Bush the first
right after the early nineteen ninety
gives you a budget request there was a
new national security strategy and they
described what the post-cold war world
would be turns out exactly as before we
still have to have a huge mass
military force but we have to maintain
what they call the defense industrial
base that's a euphemism for high-tech
industry in you know for the public and
so on you talk about our belief in free
trade and free enterprise and so on but
anyone who knows anything about the US
economy knows it's based on state
extensively on the state sector
high-tech industry is very largely
within the state sector and under a
government it's under typically under a
pentagon cover as long as it's
electronics based and that's called the
defense industrial base so we have to
maintain the huge public subsidy to
high-tech industry called the defense
industrial base we have to have a
massive military but it has different
targets the as they pointed out before
this we were aimed at a weapons rich
target namely Russia now we're aiming at
a target rich region namely the third
world and on any weapons but there are a
lot of rich targets there so that's what
we need the major military forces for in
fact that's pretty much what it was in
the past - but now it's openly conceded
we have - with regard to the Middle East
specifically we have to maintain
intervention forces directed at the
Middle East and then comes this
interesting comment
we need same intervention forces
directed at the Middle East where the
problems that we faced could not be late
could not have been laid at the
Kremlin's door ok so sorry folks we've
been lying to you for the last 50 years
claiming we're defending ourselves
against the Russians but now that the
Russians aren't there it turns out the
problems couldn't have been laid at the
Kremlin store which is correct the
problems were independent nationalism
and they continue to be so but now it's
said open and clear because the pretext
is gone we also we have to also be
concerned now about what they call the
technological sophistication of third
world powers it's a really overwhelming
threat
I like Hillary Clinton there two ago
saying that if you ran a tax Israel with
nuclear weapons will obliterate Iran and
the chance of Iran attacking Israel with
nuclear weapons is somewhere below an
asteroid hitting Israel but it doesn't
matter it's a nice throwaway line
but but that's the kind of threat we
have to worry about it's not like Ronald
Reagan in 1985 strapping on his cowboy
boots and declaring a state of national
emergency because of the threat posed to
the national security of the United
States by the government of Nicaragua
which was only two days away from
Harling in Texas so we really had to
tremble and terror well that's you know
that that's standard and it had to
increase after the end of the Cold War
with the main pretexts gone and it and
it has the this is also is all
consistent with a conception of a
conception of aggression that has
developed through the period and right
up till today it's very lively today
regression aggression has a meaning but
that meaning doesn't apply to us
the vitac by US leaders aggression means
resistance so anyone who resists the
united states is guilty of aggression
and that makes sense if we own the world
you know so any act of resistance is
aggression against us so when the u.s.
invaded South Vietnam in the early 1960s
under Kennedy Kennedy said we're
defending ourselves against what he
called the assault from within and the
leading liberal light died late
Stevenson described it as indirect
internal aggression so internal
aggression by South Vietnamese against
us and of course we're thereby right
because we own the world
the and that that continues right to the
present so
keep a lot of time because nothing much
changed and come right up till today so
the big problem middle-east now read The
Washington Post a couple days ago is the
growing aggressiveness of Iran that's
what's causing the problems of the
Middle East well you know aggression has
a meaning it means sending your armed
forces into the territory of some of the
state where when the latest case of
Iranian aggression was a couple of
centuries ago unless we count Iranian
aggression that was carried out under
the Shah which we approved of the tyrant
who we imposed conquered a couple of
Arab islands but that was okay but
nevertheless we have to defend ourselves
against tyranny and aggression in Iraq
in Lebanon and in Gaza where Iran is
carrying out aggression meaning people
they are doing things we don't like and
Russia isn't around so we'll blame it on
Iran
that's aggression and there's even
there's a lot of discussion about the
aggression inside Iraq that carried out
by the renegade cleric muqtada al-sadr
if you read the press you might get the
idea that moved out his first name is
renegade it's hardly a phrase that
reference to him that doesn't talk about
the renegade el Sutter why is he a
renegade well he opposes the US invasion
of his country ok that makes him a
renegade or a radical obviously and
that's routine nobody questions that
it's kind of like reflexive description
Condoleezza Rice was asked a little
while ago on a TV interview how could we
end the war in Iraq and said it's very
easy way to end the wars that it's quite
obvious stop the flow of arms to foreign
fighters stop the flow of foreign
fighters across the border that'll end
the war in Iraq well if somebody was
looking at this who hadn't been
adequately brainwashed by a good Western
education they would collapse and
ridicule I mean yes there are foreign
fighters in Iraq and plenty of foreign
arms
they're mainly from the country the
invaded arrests but they're not foreign
remember they're indigenous because we
are indigenous everywhere that follows
from owning the world going back to the
nascent empires spread so therefore
we're not foreign fighters there or
anywhere else
we're indigenous and it's the foreign
fighters who have to be stopped on and
actually the concept of aggression has
expanded recently a couple of back in
January you may have seen there was an
important statement by five former NATO
commanders which was reported the big
issue was that they had said we have to
base our military posture on possession
of nuclear weapons but it's nothing new
it's always been true it was strongly
advocated by the Clinton administration
but much stronger terms and thing but
that was what was reported how it was
interesting was and the one thing that
was new was their expansion expansion of
the concept acts of war they said acts
of war against which we must have let's
defend ourselves by the use of nuclear
weapons if necessary is using weapons of
finance okay so the country uses weapons
of finance against us that's an act of
war and we have to be ready to use
nuclear weapons if necessary well two
months after in late March the United
States Treasury Department warned the
world's financial institutions against
any dealing with Iran's state-owned
banks now those warnings have teeth
thanks to the Patriot Act little-noticed
element of the Patriot Act permits the
United States to bar from access to the
United States financial system any
country that violates its orders meaning
if a German or Chinese or other bank
tries to have dealings with Iran they
can be barred from the US financial
system which is a cost that very few are
willing to bear and might and it
and is in fact a declaration of war and
by the judgement of the five NATO
commanders an act of war against which
Iran is entitled to respond any way it
likes perhaps with nuclear weapons or
terror or whatever according to these
judgments now you'll notice that there's
a serious logical fallacy and what I've
just been saying it overlooks two
fundamental principles which are the
crucial principles of World Order the
rest is footnotes the first principle is
that we own the world and Iran doesn't
so therefore the principle is not
applied on us they only apply to others
and the kind of a corollary to that is
that everything we do is necessarily
with the best of intentions that's a
tautology you don't have to give
evidence or arguments and that's a
constant feature of the intellectual
culture almost without exception across
the spectrum so for example during the
invasion of Vietnam I don't hope I don't
to describe it to you but it killed
several million people destroyed three
countries it's just a monstrous atrocity
but and it was if you if you look over
there was vast discussion of it
mainstream discussion but if you look
closely you'll find that there was never
a principled critique of the war that
was not permissible
the typical just to keep the kind of
left critical end and the rest gets
worse at the end of the war Anthony
Lewis of the New York Times wrapped it
up he said speaking from the left
liberal extreme that the United States
entered the war with blundering efforts
to do good notice efforts to do good as
a tautology we did it so therefore its
efforts to do good so it's not saying
anything blundering because it didn't
work as well as they wanted at least
worked pretty well but not as well as
they wanted so we started with
blundering efforts to do good
but by 1969 it was clear that we could
not establish democracy in South Vietnam
at a cost acceptable to ourselves well
established democracy in South Vietnam
is on a par with some Soviet commissar
saying that Stalin was trying to
establish democracy in Eastern Europe
but that doesn't matter it's us so we
were doing and but the cope at the
problem with it was the cost to us okay
so that meant we had to sort of start
pulling out well that's the critique at
the very left end take one more example
the leading American liberal historian
maybe the most famous historian of his
generation Arthur Schlesinger who was at
first a super Hulk like the whole
Kennedy administration was no
alternative to victory and in their
invasion of South Vietnam this is what
it was but by the late 60s he was having
second thoughts and he wrote a I will
expressing them and he said that he said
we all pray that the Hawks will be
correct in hoping that the surge of the
day big influx of troops will be
successful and if they are we will be
praising the wisdom and statesmanship of
the American government in winning the
war and he was aware of what it was he
said leaving a land of wreck and ruin
with its institutions destroyed and may
never recover but will nevertheless be
praising the wisdom and the
statesmanship of the American government
and we pray that they're right the Hawks
but he said they probably aren't right
it's probably going to be too costly for
us no question about the cost of the
Vietnamese and land of wreck and ruin so
therefore maybe we ought to rethink it
well that's the criticism at the
critical end of the spectrum the dovish
critical end then from there on over to
the jingoist end of the spectrum you
have a kind of a debate could we have
one with more force or was a lost cause
anyway and so on rather striking that
the population is out of this so in 1969
the year that lewis pointed to seventy
percent of the population i thought that
the war was
fundamentally wrong a tomorrow not a
mistake try to find anything in the
literature of educated sectors that says
it was anything but a mistake that it
was fundamentally wrong a tomorrow
that's not unusual internally the
government was aware of this one of the
things that is not taught but should be
read because it's very illuminating is
the final part of the Pentagon Papers
Pentagon Papers are not Declassified
archives they are stolen archives so we
know a better idea what they were
thinking the Pentagon favors end in 1968
right after the Tet Offensive in January
1968 which convinced the business world
this is going to cost us too much we
better start separate winding it down
there was a request from the government
to send another couple hundred thousand
troops to Vietnam but they were dubious
about doing it and didn't do it finally
because they were fait afraid that there
would be an uprising in the United
States a popular uprising of
unprecedented proportions and they would
need the troops for civil disorder
control because of protests among
underprivileged people women youth and
others who just weren't going to take
anymore well that tells you that they
were they'd been in admit that they were
listening but they were and they always
do if they needed the troops for control
and they sort of slowly started backing
off another six years of war devastated
Laos and Cambodia and much of Vietnam
but at least they started winding down
well that was 1969 notice that you can
take the rhetoric about the Vietnam War
and translate it almost verbatim at the
discussion of the Iraq war there is no
principled critique within the
mainstream and nobody can buy principled
critique I mean the kind of critique
that we would carry out reflexively and
do when somebody else commits aggression
I say when the Russians invade
Czechoslovakia or
Afghanistan or Chechnya we don't ask is
it too costly in fact it wasn't costly
at all practically killed nobody in
Czechoslovakia Chechnya after reducing
the place to ruin apparently it's
functioning pretty well in fact if
according to Western correspondents if
David Petraeus could achieve anything in
Iraq like what the Putin achieved in
Chechnya I'd probably be crowned king or
something like that but nevertheless we
condemned it rightly doesn't matter
whether it worked or not or whether it
was costly for them or not or when
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait the
killing probably a fraction of the
number of people that Bush killed a
couple of months earlier when he invaded
Panama but we nevertheless denounced it
as aggression you know that's a
principled objection but when we carry
out aggression it's inconceivable and
that goes back to the principles that I
mentioned we own the world and
everything we do is by definition good
and intention so the worst that it can
be is what barack obama calls a
strategic blunder or what hillary
clinton calls getting into a civil war
which we can't win in fact iraqis
overwhelmingly blame zoo or on us but
that's irrelevant to that's the level of
critique and it's and it follows from
you know from the principles that i
mentioned and it governs news coverage
to in fact pretty openly here's john
burns is the dean of correspondents most
the senior most respected correspondent
in iraq after a long long career he says
that the united states is the prominent
economic political and military power in
the world and has been the greatest
force for stability in the world
certainly since world war ii it would be
a dark day if the outcome in iraq were
to destroy the credibility of american
power to destroy America's willingness
to use its power
in the world to achieve good to fight
back against totalitarianism
authoritarianism gross human rights
abuses okay in other words that's the
framework of reporting reporting must be
cheering for the home team nothing else
is conceivable because of the depths of
these principles which are instilled
into people in the educational system in
propaganda you can't see the world in
any other terms
so it's neutral objective reporting to
say we're cheering for the home team and
it's quite open that's interesting that
he said it so clearly but he says that's
particularly true he says in the Middle
East
notice that makes not the slightest
difference with the people of the world
of the Middle East think that's not
relevant or for that matter with the
people in the United States state so the
Vietnam War was benign efforts to do
good which were too costly to us even
when 70% of the population
I said that's fundamentally wrong and
immoral not a mistake population here is
as irrelevant as the population and the
rest of the world unless you're
frightened of them and have to keep your
troops here for civil disorder control
what what do people think well what
people think we know from international
polls that are regularly taken they
think that the United States is most
frightening dangerous country in the
world not John Burns this line what
about the and there's overwhelming
opposition to us force this everywhere
the it's also true the Middle East and
there's nothing new about it so George
Eric current George Bush after 9/11
asked why do they hate us and went on
they hate our freedoms and so on you
remember that but the press should have
reported is that he was just repeating a
question that President Eisenhower asked
in 1958 Eisenhower asked his staff why
is there a campaign of hatred against us
among the people of the Middle East and
the National Security Council the
highest planning agency had provided an
answer
is that the people in the Middle East
their perception is that the United
States supports brutal tyrannies and
blocks democracy and development and
does so because we want control of their
oil and then they went on to say on
perceptions more or less correct and
that's why it ought to be so therefore
there's a campaign of hatred against us
and so it continues after 9/11 The Wall
Street Journal to its credit conducted
some polls in the Middle East they
didn't care about the general population
what's demeaning Lee called the Arab
Street
they pulled the what they called money
Muslims bankers managers of
multinational corporations you know kind
of guys we like and they found pretty
much the same thing as 1958 there's a
camp it's not been I have any objection
to neoliberalism or any of this stuff in
fact they love it but they condemn the
United States for supporting and a harsh
tyrannical regimes which it does and
opposing democracy and development which
it does because we want to control their
energy resources by 2001 they had other
objections namely Israel's US backed
vicious repression and dispossession of
Palestinians which is ongoing and also
the sanctions against Iraq the sanctions
against Iraq didn't get much play here
because we don't pay attention to our
crimes that's crucial that's part of the
principle that everything we do is good
but they do pay attention and in fact we
know a lot about them or we can if we
want to there were two directors of the
oil-for-food program supposedly the
humanitarian part of the sanctions both
of them resigned because they regarded
the sanctions as genocide --all
carrying out a huge massacre of
population the Clinton administration
would not permit them to transmit their
information to the Security Council
which was technically responsible
and the media agree the secretary
spokesman for the State Department James
burns said that referred to Hunt's von
sponeck the second of them as I said
this man in Baghdad is paid to work not
to talk
and the press agrees and scholarship
agrees so they're suppressed they knew
more about Iraq than any other Western
are they had hundreds of observers
running around the country sending back
reports but you can do a Google search
and find out how often they were allowed
to speak in the United States and the
run-up to the war for that matter since
a fan sponeck right and who's a very
distinguished international diplomat
read a book about it about two years ago
called a different kind of war I don't
think there's a reference to it in the
United States little on a review we do
not want to publicize our genocide all
actions but people have at least noticed
and didn't like it and that increased
the campaign of hatred among the money
Muslims our friends there have to think
about the others but it doesn't matter
what they think the same is true of the
invasion of Iraq Iraqis regarded it is
worse than the Mongol invasions it's the
great successes it Iraq may never
recovered I mean you know the great
success story of Petraeus is to
establish warlord armies which will
probably tear the country up in the
future
and also to turn say Baghdad it's true
the violence in Baghdad has declined
that partly because there are fewer
people to kill you know there's been
massive as ethnic cleansing and that's
been accelerated by the Petraeus
strategy of building essentially walled
communities so comment by near Rosen
who's one of the two or three
journalists who actually reports
seriously from Iraq he speaks Arabic
fluently and he looks Arab so he can get
around easily travels all over not with
the armed guards
you know Abrams tanks and so on he says
talking about Baghdad recently says
looming on the looming over the homes
and the district he's looking at our 12
foot high walls built by the Americans
confine people to their own neighborhood
emptied and destroyed by civil war which
the u.s. fomented walled off by the
surge of sections of the city feel more
like a desolate post-apocalyptic maze of
concrete tunnels than a living inhabited
neighborhood they're controlled by
separation walls and in fact by the
increasing use of air power but will
quieter so therefore the critics having
no principled criticism don't talk about
it much well what does the public think
about all these things well we know
about Iraq public wants to get out but
they're irrelevant what about Iran the
next major crisis looming which will
make your act look like a tea party if
we go through that there are opinions
about this
there's the opinion of American elites
which you can reach they in the New York
Times or watch and post their liberal
journals and so on they'll tell you that
Iran is defying the world by enriching
uranium well exactly who is the world
okay well we can find out there is a
organization called g77 130 countries
includes the vast majority of the people
of the world they vigorously support
Iran's right to all the rights
guaranteed by the non-proliferation
treaty including enriching uranium for
nuclear power so they're not part of the
world okay what about the American
population an overwhelming majority of
the American population agrees with g77
mainly that Iran should have the right
to produce nuclear energy but not
nuclear weapons so the American
population is not part of the world
so non-aligned countries are not part of
the world American populations not part
of the world obviously Iranians are not
part of the world so who's left well the
world consists of people who follow
Washington's orders you can't say it
includes the United States because the
overwhelming majority of Americans are
not part of the world they oppose this
just as on many other issues and that
goes on with
comment you know correctly if we're
cheerleaders for the home team and
that's the framework for discussion is
there a solution to the crisis with Iran
which is extremely serious the u.s. goes
through it its plans parent plans like I
said it might look make your act look
like a tea party well there are
solutions potential solutions one of
them is what I just said that Iran
should have the rights of any signer of
the non-proliferation treaty Israel
Pakistan and India also what have those
rights if they sign the treaty since
they haven't done it they don't have
those rights but of course they're doing
it because we say it's okay the but
that's the opinion of the large majority
of Americans and the same large
majorities runs around seventy five
percent says that a nuclear weapons free
zone should be established in the region
including Iran Israel American forces
deployed there and so on
well that would end the crisis is that
possible well it's supported by the
large majority of Americans but as I
mentioned they're not part of the world
it's Iran's official policy but they're
not part of the world the US and Britain
are formally committed to it
in fact more so than any other powers
for a very simple reason which we would
read about if we had a free press when
the United States and Britain went to
war with Iraq and try to find the thin
legal cover for it they appealed to UN
Security Council resolution 687 1991
which ordered Iraq to get rid of its
weapons of mass destruction and as you
remember Britain in the United States
States claimed they had and lived up to
it well you know you're all literate you
can read resolution 687 it commits the
United States and Britain to work to
establish a nuclear free weapons zone in
the Middle East okay so if you can
appeal to it as a justification for
aggression you're you're compelled to
follow its its provisions but to point
that out would be really to break the
rules and you can again do a Google
so you can find anyone named and you're
the mainstream has ever bothered to
point this out another way to move
towards the solution would be to end the
threats against Iran the threats if
anyone cares or a violation of the UN
Charter but for outlaw states that's
irrelevant again the large majority of
the American population thinks we should
end the threats and move to normal
diplomatic relations with Iran well if
these steps were taken the crisis would
essentially be over so we can ask who's
defying the world if the world includes
its people including the American people
and the answer is very simple and
straightforward those who are defying
the world are the ones in power in
Washington and in London and in the
editorial offices and the university
faculties and so on they're defying the
world but not Iran not on these issues
and in fact it's a serious matter
because it could lead to total disaster
and the same is true on other issues so
the other major live issue in the Middle
East is Israel Palestine well what does
the world think about this there is an
international consensus supported by
about two-thirds of the American
population supported by former
non-aligned countries supported by the
Arab world formally at least supported
by Europe basically Latin America in
fact everyone your hand supports it
Hamas supports it it's for a two-state
settlement two-state settlement on the
international borders with being pre
June 67 borders with minor or
modifications who opposes that well for
the last 30 years the United States has
opposed it and it continues to oppose it
and Israel of course opposes it though
it if the US would support it Israel
would necessarily go along so the
problem is right in Washington this
begins in 1976 when the u.s. veto the
first Security Council resolution
calling for a settlement in these terms
as introduced by the Arab states backed
by the PLO
actually it even goes back earlier to
1971 when President Sadat of Egypt
offered Israel a full fee
streety in return for withdrawal from
occupied territory sequel he carried his
withdraw beltless withdrawal from the
Sinai where Israel was kicking out
thousands of peasants and settling
Israel he didn't say anything about the
Palestinians they were not an issue at
the time Israel recognized as a genuine
peace offer decided to reject it
they made a fateful decision preferring
expansion to security peace treaty with
Israel would have ended security problem
the Egypt would have ended security
problems important question is what
would happen in the United States
no the Godfather well Kissinger managed
there was a battle in a bureaucratic
internal battle in the United States
Kissinger won he and the US followed his
policy which he called stalemate meaning
no negotiations just force okay
that set the stage for the 1973 war and
on to a whole list of horrors since and
up till today the United States and
Israel are have been leading the
rejectionist camp by now they are the
rejectionist camp not the u.s.
population but the government's so who's
defying the world on this issue is there
a possible settlement sure there is but
resides here in fact on issue after
issue the major problems happen to be
right here which is a very optimistic
conclusion because it means that we can
do something about it
it's here we can have an influence not
elsewhere
she time yeah
contrary to what we say here in the
introduction your times of course not
say that you were the most important
intellectual alive and you know that
well it was merely an outsider
professor at Stanford who said it in a
revue which appeared in the New York
Times
interestingly enough you use that quote
on several of your books also a
fabricated quote you've also said that
whenever that arises during an
introduction like tonight you always say
something about it and correct it and
that's of course a falsehood because you
didn't do it here tonight and that's
happened in the past also number two I
couldn't help but notice the reference
to Arthur Schlesinger apparently you're
still something sticking in your craw
about you're about with him I guess it
was around 1970 in which he exposed you
for fabricating some Harry Truman quotes
that was the exchange in which he dubbed
you an intellectual crook so I guess
that's so sticking in your craw even now
and finally as to this notion of
steering for the home team which
obviously you don't do there's somebody
else you're curing for so I'd like you
to be very forthright like some leftists
do who say they are cheering for our
opponents in various places around the
world quite clearly do you have the
courage to tell us right now that you
are pulling against us in Iraq and
Afghanistan that you're hoping we fail
that you support the terrorists or you
might call them freedom fighters hoping
they kill Americans
or we get the point yeah can I go
through these points on the first one
the quote it was not by somebody
interview it was by a reviewer in the
New York he wasn't it you said he was
interviewed say that listen uh you did
but it doesn't matter what were you it
was a book review right and it won't you
know it's true that I didn't bother to
correct it tonight but I almost always
do it because it's funny it's a very
funny thing what he actually said is
he's the most important intellectual in
the world how can you write such
terrible things about u.s. foreign
policy I like that quote so I
invariantly neither I invariably
corrected you say you see it on the
backs of books if you take a look at the
publishing industry you find that the
author has actually no control over
what appears and blurbs nothing if I had
a choice I'd tell them not to use it of
course and I often do but they like to
use it and then I correct it when it's
brought up that's because I think the
actual quote is quite interesting
so that's one as for Schlesinger you've
got the story backwards I criticize
Schlesinger on these points in the in a
book that appeared in 1969 which he was
furious about and in his review of that
book which was a furious review he tried
to find some error and he found an
absolutely trivial error so small that
it was corrected two months later in the
second printing but it but he's been
screaming about it he screamed about it
ever since and people like you do too
the error was that in quoting a speech
by Harry Truman okay instead of quoting
his actual speech I quoted a virtually
verbatim paraphrase of it by a leading
respected commentator James Warburg so
the words were slightly different though
the content was exactly the same as I
say it was a trivial it was corrected
two months later in the second printing
it's a rare book that doesn't have some
small error but yes you know the the
defenders of state violence are
desperate and if they can find anything
that they can point to they'll run with
it forever so that's the truth about the
second point as for the cheering you
heard what I said and it's what I've
written I think we should pay attention
to the population okay
population of the United States
population of Iraq population of the
world we should pay attention to what
they think of course those who are you
know supporters of state violence think
we shouldn't we should pay attention to
the guys in power and to the sort of
cheering section that among the
intellectuals that supports them well I
don't agree with it if I just take the
case of Iran I think the opinion of
American the American population has to
be very sound
and I support it and the same is true in
Iraq I think the opinion of Iraqis is
very sane last December the Pentagon
released a study of focus groups in Iraq
and reported it as good news they give a
very upbeat report they said contrary to
what people are saying in the critics
there's a lot of agreement among Iraqis
and therefore there's hope for
reconciliation okay and then if you read
now will further what was their
agreement about well there was
overwhelming agreement among Iraqis that
the United States is responsible for the
ethnic cleansing and sectarian violence
and that the United States should get
out okay that's what there is agreement
about well yeah I think we should pay
attention to our victims and I can go
down the line if you like everything
else you said it's just a pure
fabrication and you know it
if you want if you want to write me an
email about it I'll be glad to give you
you know you haven't got the courage to
tell who you're leading pardon you
haven't got the courage to tell us who
your cheerleading for you've made your
point let's go
so decades ago the u.s. instituted a
policy of undercutting foreign food
markets sorry could you raise your hand
whoever's talking up over there sorry
yeah good decades ago the u.s.
instituted a policy of undercutting Ford
food markets by US subsidies recently US
farm subsidies have shifted to ethanol
markets much to the chagrin of almost
every third world nation and furthermore
much to the disinterest of almost every
major media network what role if any do
you think the food this food crisis will
play in u.s. expansionist policies well
just to clarify a little bit when the
ethanol craze began it was
overwhelmingly cheered by the media and
commentators and so on not by everyone I
mean I wrote an article criticizing it
in fact it was even an article in
foreign affairs criticizing it so there
were critics but it didn't take much
thought to realize that shifting of
cropland to ethanol production to fuel
was going to cause an increase in the
prices of food and shortage of food I
mean you know it tends to be a genius to
figure that out it's particularly true
when it's us ethanol it wouldn't have
been so obvious and maybe wouldn't even
true if it was Brazilian ethanol
Brazilian ethanol is made from sugar
it's much more efficient and it's much
cheaper and in order to keep the ethanol
industry functioning here the government
has to first of all provide huge
subsidies to agribusiness and also to
impose a huge tariff to prevent much
cheaper and more efficient Brazilian
ethanol from getting into the country
the technical term for that is free
trade okay
but if if it's a so it's a big gift to
agribusiness it takes plenty of land
away from crop production that means
that this shortage of corn but also a
lot of other things you know that if
land has shifted to corn production
inefficient corn production for ethanol
it's not being used for soybeans and
peas and so on so that gets reduced same
happening in the third-world third-world
countries that are say producing
soybeans may shift to using a cryptic
crops that will be bought up by the rich
for ethanol and that's happening too so
it spirals and yes it's leading to it's
one of the factors leading to a very
serious food crisis just how much of a
factor that is it's pretty hard to
estimate so the drought in Australia is
also a big contributory factor but you
know although that's kind of irrelevant
we can't do anything about the drought
in Australia the one factor we can do
something about is the use of cropland
for fuel and ethanol is not particularly
few efficient from the point of view of
pollution or energy inputs and so on and
so forth so all across the board it was
I think a disaster it was understood to
be anyone who thought about it from the
beginning
and it ought to be terminated if anybody
wants to use ethanol they should break
down the protectionist barriers and
subsidies to agribusiness and use
Brazilian ethanol it's causing all of
this is part of a whole system of
undermining third-world farmers so one
of the big effects of NAFTA is intended
effects is to drive Mexican peasants off
the land
Mexican peasants cannot compete with
highly subsidized the US agribusiness
it's kind of obvious so slowly being
driven off the land going to get worse
now that Mexico has been forced to
eliminate all tariffs and they flood
into the cities they lower wages which
is very good for you as manufacturers
who are exporting production there and
then they try to flee across the border
so we
build walls no I mean these things are
all interconnected same with Haiti I
mean when one of the things that our
America you know American cheerleaders
are supposed to cheer the government
about is that Clinton sent the Marines
to put an end to terror in Haiti in 1995
that part is true but there's a little
more the elected government government
the rst government first elected
government in Haiti
was a populist independent government
led by a what we call a radical priest
meaning liberation theology concerned
about the poor it was overthrown a
couple of months later by a military
coup as anticipated the u.s. had done
everything possible to try to undercut
it in those few months the u.s.
immediately turned supporting the
military coup violating the Organization
of American States embargo that was
under Bush one under Clinton the
violations increased Clinton actually
authorized the Texaco oil company to
send arms to send oil to the military
Hunta and the rich elite in violation of
his own presidential order
in 1995 Clinton decided that the public
population had been tortured enough and
it was pretty miserable I was there for
a while the size figure that's enough
we'll let the elected government go back
put on a condition the condition was
that they'd accept a very harsh
neoliberal regime mean drop your tariffs
drop all support for local production
and so on well the outcome was
completely predictable I'm not saying it
in retrospect I and others wrote about
at the time Haitian rice farmers are
pretty efficient but they cannot compete
with highly subsidized US agribusiness
exporters so now Haiti sort of food and
you're getting food rights yeah
predictably that's the consequence of
following such policies again it doesn't
take a genius to figure them out it's
kind of like the elementary school
student can figure it out and this is
happening in many places so your point
is very significant there is a major
food crisis
we're not helping hi
first of all thanks I I want to thank
you a lot for all the intellectual
inspiration all these matters are a lot
more interesting out they make sense and
I've been following the news a lot
lately with Iraq and it seems like
there's some deal of escalation going on
in Iraq and like a few weeks ago Vice
President Cheney made a major trip to
the Middle East and surely there after
the Iraq government commenced a
large-scale offensive against sadhus
forces in Basra and subsequently there
was more large large-scale action
against ciders forces in Sadr City and
Baghdad and there was an interesting
phrase that was used in an article I saw
their Iraqi tanks attacking Sadr City
I'm sorry I didn't hear lish it was
interesting that they used the phrase
Iraqi tanks which are storming yeah
Sattar City but um I was thinking about
this and it seems like our policy on the
war in Iraq has been almost remarkably
restrained it seems like we've been
concentrating mostly on like the Green
Zone and the oil infrastructure and so
given these recent escalations I was
wondering if you thought perhaps we're
going to attempt to ferment some kind of
like increased violence in blood baths
and may perhaps use that as a pretext
for additional action in Iran and I was
wondering what your thoughts are on this
well you're right that the war in Iraq
is restrained by comparative standards
killed 100,000 people maybe over a
million may have destroyed the country
forever it's worse than the Mongol
invasions and so on yet but that's
restrained for example with nothing like
the attack on Vietnam I'm not even close
the Iraq war has never reached the scale
of Vietnam in about 1965 you know at
that time there was no protest but and
there are a couple of reasons for that
one reason is that the American
population is much more strongly opposed
to aggression than it was in the 1960s
that's part of the civilizing effect of
the night of the activism in the 60s had
a big effect on the popular
on all kind of things I support for
civil rights for the women's rights
environmental movement you know all the
kinds of things I was quoting about the
American Indians those were standard
attitudes in the 60s not even questioned
the kind of things that kids were
reading in school texts say my own
children and late 60s you can find in
those backward crazed part of the
country today it wouldn't be permissible
all of this is a civilizing fact that's
why the 60s are constantly condemned as
the Time of Troubles you know kids going
crazy and so on they committed a crime
they civilized the country and one of
the forms of civilization was opposition
to aggression so contrary to what is
commonly said protest against the Iraq
war is far beyond protest against the
Vietnam War at any comparable stage the
at this stage the Vietnam where there
was no talk about withdrawal in fact the
first book on withdrawal was written by
Howard Zinn you know and it was I think
1967 at the time when there was you know
half a million American troops there
countries have been torn to shreds
extended to thee and that could barely
be mentioned because it was so far out
actually he asked me to write a review
of it which I did in RAM parks because
nobody would mention well now at a much
lower stage of aggression in Iraq every
can't everyone has to say something
about withdrawal
maybe they'll mean it but they have to
say something you know that's a big
change so one reason why there is why
it's restrained by comparative standards
is there's just way more opposition I
mean after all the Iraq Wars the first
war in the history of Western
imperialism that was massively protested
before it was officially inaugurated and
that's never happened before not that I
can think of so that's one factor but
there's another more important factor a
Vietnam didn't matter much to the United
States I mean if the country was wiped
off the map of the u.s. didn't care I
mean Eisenhower tried to build up some
support for his early stage of the war
by talking about
rubber and so on but I was a joke I mean
Vietnam had no resources of significance
to the United States the concern about
Vietnam was what I mentioned the virus
infection theory there was deep concern
that successful independent development
in Vietnam might spur others to take on
the same efforts the via the rot might
spread to Thailand maybe to Indonesia
maybe even Japan which was called the
super domino by John Dow or leading
Japan historian Japan might have to
accommodate to an independent Southeast
Asia that would have meant the United
States has lost the Pacific War which
they weren't prepared to do in 1950 so
there was a concern about Vietnam but
had nothing to do with its resources and
in fact that the concern was overcome
just by wiping the place out so the u.s.
basically won the war in the nineteen
seventies didn't achieve its maximal
objectives but it did satisfy its basic
war aims you can't destroy Iraq
it's far too value I mean Iraq has
probably the second largest energy
resources in the world they're very
cheap and easily available it's not like
Alberta tar sands you stick a pipe in
the sand and you know the oil gushes out
and it's right at the heart of the major
energy producing section of the world
that's a valuable asset not like Vietnam
so yes there's got to be a limit on the
destructiveness you can't destroy an
asset that you want to maintain and the
US does want to maintain it today it
happens that I just took a look at the
morning newspaper Christian Science
Monitor has a front-page article on the
opening of what's called the u.s.
embassy in Baghdad I mean the embassy
is not like any embassy in the world is
the size of the Vatican has 21 buildings
it's an entirely self-contained city
inside the green you know inside the
protected area of Baghdad I mean I'm not
building that in order to tear it down
the major air bases that are built
they're being built around Iraq are huge
facilities and they are not being built
with the intent of tearing them down and
they're supported by the Democrats they
fund them and the idea it clearly is to
try to figure out some way to establish
a client government which will be able
to function but but much like the
government in Chechnya functions you
know their Chechens they have their own
security forces or like say the Vichy
government under the Nazis with a French
government French security forces you
know French police French officials and
so on
the Germans sort of hanging around in
the background actually it's pretty much
the way Russia the Russians most run ran
most of Eastern Europe it was Czech
troops Polish troops and so on and so
forth so try to set up something like
that the traditional Imperial structure
but making sure that it's a base for
u.s. power and that the u.s. controls it
and we don't really have to debate this
any longer because it's public not much
of a fuss was made about it in fact I
don't anything was reported but in
November last November there was a
declaration an agreement by George Bush
and what's called the Iraqi government
which is a you know little Enclave
inside the green zone never gets out
sided which we call the Iraqi government
the client government that follows our
orders so an agreement was made between
them which is interesting it permits the
US to maintain effectively permanent
military bases and operations inside
Iraq all kind of pretext but that's what
it amounts to
and rather brazenly to my surprise it
says that the Iraqi economy must be open
to foreign investment
privileged in us investors that's
unusual to see such a brazen statement
of crass imperialism you know the u.s.
Iraqi economy means oil they don't
nobody cares about the asparagus they
grow so it must be open to foreign
investment unlike other countries which
have controlled their own resources and
it must privilege u.s. investors I mean
now that's more extreme than the most
extreme war critic ever said and Bush
underscored it in one of his many
hundreds of signing statements a couple
of months later in January in which he
said that he would he sign some
legislation because I'm not going to
live up to it and in fact I won't live
up to any legislation that interferes
with the u.s. goal of maintaining sort
of permanent capacity for military
operations there and it controls the
energy resources well that's totally
different from Vietnam that didn't us
didn't care once the country was
destroyed and Laos was destroyed and
Cambodia was destroyed the US didn't
care very much what happened happy to
pull out this is just a completely
different situation both domestically
and in terms of the geopolitics of it I
think I'll see to the other people that
are waiting yeah
hi I really enjoyed your book
manufacturing consent and I was just
curious over the last couple days the
mainstream media has gotten behind this
irrefutable evidence that North Korea
has built a nuclear reactor in Syria and
that Israel was able to us successfully
wipe it out I was kind of curious to
hear your take on that and maybe cut
through or got through the propaganda
yeah that's a very interesting story
actually I've written about a little if
you're interested in Oh give some
references but I happened to be
listening to NPR on the way in here the
evening news and you know they had a one
of their sober intellectual reports
which was a perfect example of what John
Burns was describing have you have to
cheer for the home team it described
about half the story
it said that you know this all this is
very interesting evidence that North
Korea isn't living up to its obligations
and then they're the Hawks who say we
should you know break goal a whole
discussion and attack them or something
and the doves who say maybe we should
give them a little more time and so on
well yeah it's probably true that North
Korea isn't living up to all its
obligations in its declaration but it's
also true that the United States is not
living up to its obligations in fact in
the rare reporting on this that you can
occasionally find the last report was
that the United stand on its nuclear
facilities and produce a declaration of
its nuclear activities and the United
States would join with the other six
powers in providing Iraq with fuel with
other aid and the US would enter into
the normal diplomatic relations and
remove them from the remove the
isolation of North Korea by taking them
off the list of states that support
terror and so on well us none none of
that you know furthermore there's a
history of this the same negotiations
same agreement pretty much was reached
in September 2005 North Korea agreed to
dismantle to end all nuclear
weapons-related
operations or nuclear operations and
Amal verifiably and the United States in
return would enter into diplomatic
relations remove the threats to Korea
and provide it with a light water
reactor and a couple of other things and
end all threats okay that would enter
the crisis a couple of days later the
United States carried out what the five
NATO generals now call an act of war
against North Korea they closed down
North Korean financial operations which
happened to be in a small Bank in Macao
was probably a trial run for what
they're now doing against Iran to see
how it worked well you know that's a
very serious attack on a country to
isolate it from the international
financial system no exports no imports
and so on and so forth and it was almost
certainly done in order to undercut the
negotiations that had just been reached
and in fact North Korea reacted as you'd
expect carried out a nuclear test you
know went on to develop missiles and so
on and that's been the history all the
way back North Korea may have the worst
government in the world but they've been
following a pretty pragmatic course on
this when the US gets more aggressive
they get more aggressive when the u.s.
gets more conciliatory they get more
conciliatory and it's been running
steadily all the way through so that's
the other part of the story and there's
another part of the story that's even
more significant I don't know if North
Korea has been providing anything to
Syria or not but there would have been
an easy way to stop this a very easy way
in 1993 North Korea and Israel were on
the verge of an agreement by which
Israel would recognize North Korea and
North Korea would terminate all weapons
related activities in the Middle East
now that would be very important for
Israel's security but the Clinton
administration said no it wouldn't let
him do it and when the Godfather speaks
you got a listen so that agreement was
never reached and if that agreement had
been reached we would
be having any discussion about whether
North Korea is doing anything in Syria
or not well that part of the story is
knocked out now it's not that it's
secret you know if you do some research
or you read the arms control literature
and so on yeah you can find it actually
I've written about it too and have
others but it's certainly not the
headline where it ought to be it's not
something that people know another small
point was made by Andrew cordis men this
one bleeding a Middle East security
specialists in the United States who
suggested that maybe this whole flap is
just a warning to Iran saying you know
we got our eyes on you and if you do
anything or even if you don't do
anything we'll pretend that you did
you're in trouble you know so yes
there's a lot to the story but exactly
what's going on we don't know and
probably won't know until the classified
documents come out someday if they ever
do hi I think you're I've read your
books and I think you're excellent my
question is most people I mean we can
sit here and have a discussion on the
problems that we've had in the past in
Panama or Guatemala and Cuba and we can
also talk about how you know how we
supported the Shah and we basically
affected the Iranian Revolution but the
fact is that most people in America
don't even know that at one point we
supported Saddam Hussein so knowing this
fact how can we help educate the rest of
the American public on all these issues
when it seems that you know the media
won't do it and it's all of this
information that you say is easy to find
is maybe not so easy for the average
person so yeah see I first of all lets
thought you write about supporting
Saddam Hussein but very few people know
the extent of the support
in 1982 yes Saddam Hussein was hanged a
couple of months ago year
whatever it was and if you look he was
hanged for crimes that he committed in
1982 he was alleged to have ordered the
killing of 150 or so people which by his
standards was like you know toothpick on
a mountain but that's what he was judged
for but it was kind of interesting to
see the commentary on it as something
else happened in 1982 in 1982 the Reagan
administration removed Iraq from the
list of states supporting terror which
is a name for the list of states we want
to go after as 90 to a sporting terror
so they removed it from the list in
order that the US could start providing
aid and support through their friend
Saddam Hussein Donald Rumsfeld went
shortly afterwards to you know sign the
friendly agreement and through the 1980s
the US was one of a number of states who
supported the gave support to Saddam
Hussein a lot of was agricultural
support which he desperately needed and
it was a big boon to us agribusiness but
also weapons support you know means to
develop weapons of mass destruction and
so on this went on right through Saddam
Hussein's worst atrocities you know the
halabja massacres is a unfallen
massacres you know everything the use of
chemical weapons
well we threw nada there was some
protest Congress protested now and then
but Reagan vetoed any effort to do
anything about it George Bush number one
came along he was a particular admirer
of Saddam in 1989 at the very time of
the invasion of Panama just as the
invasion of Panama was going on
Bush overrode the Treasury Department
and authorized new aid to his friend
Saddam Hussein the press cooperated by
not reporting it in also in 1989 Bush
invited era Iraqi nuclear engineers to
the United States to get advanced
training and weapons production nuclear
weapons production okay
that's also 1989 early 1990
Bush sent a high-level senatorial
delegation to Iraq led by Bob Dole
Republican Senate majority leader who
was then presidential candidate a couple
years later and the goal the purpose of
the delegation was to send George Bush's
good wishes to his friend Saddam to
insure him that he could disregard the
kind of protests he hears now and then
from the American press we have this
free press thing here and we can't shut
all these guys up and told him that he
would they would take off from The Voice
of America anybody who was criticizing
him I was generally kind of loved
session that was April 1990 okay a
couple of months later Saddam Hussein
disobeyed orders or maybe misunderstood
orders just possible and invaded Kuwait
okay
shifted instantly from favored friend
and Ally to reincarnation of Hitler no
you don't disobey orders you know like I
said any Mafia Don understands that's
the support and incidentally shortly
after that Washington returned to
support the first Saddam Hussein after
the war was a murderous destructive war
way beyond anything that was needed to
get some time out of quate but right
after the war by March 1991 the US had
total control military control of the
region control of the air everything and
there was a large Shiite uprising in the
south which probably would have
overthrown Saddam but the u.s.
authorized Saddam to crush it they
authorized him to use aircraft military
helicopters and so on to crush the
uprising killing probably tens of
thousands of Shiites in the south
general what was his name shorts cop who
was a general said later that he was
fooled by Saddam he didn't realize that
when he authorized Saddam to use
military aircraft he'd actually use him
so kind of you know we were tricked but
it was explained pretty open but frankly
by the New York Times the chief
diplomatic correspondent Thomas Friedman
a chief diplomatic correspondent
State Department spokesperson in New
York Times just relays State Department
propaganda he said he wrote a clear
column he said thee he said the best of
all possible worlds he supported the
decision to allow Saddam to crush the
uprising I said the best of all worlds
for the United States would be an
iron-fisted military front the ruling
Iraq just the way Saddam did but with a
different name because he's now kind of
embarrassment and so we have to settle
for second best
you know Saddam himself the Middle East
correspondent for the New York Times
who's still there still there top Middle
East correspondent Alan Cowell he said
well you know it's kind of unpleasant
watching all these people get massacred
they said but there's a consensus among
the United States and its allies namely
Britain and Saudi Arabia that the best
hope for stability in Iraq is saddam
hussein not the people who are trying to
overthrow him okay so therefore we have
to let saddam crush the uprising that
might have overthrown him the stability
is a technical term that means following
us orders okay so that's stability and
Saddam's more hopeful for stability than
Iraqis in fact what it have said is you
know the worst possible outcome is the
Iraqis might rule Iraq we're not going
to allow that independent nationalism is
not to be accepted that's why without
all sutter's a renegade and so on and in
fact through the 90s it's the same story
if you look at the main effect of the
sanctions Clinton sanctions I mean they
were murderers and destructive but they
strengthened Saddam Hussein they
undermined opposition to him they
compelled the population to rely on him
for survival
which is probably the reason he wasn't
overthrown you know otherwise he
probably would have had the same fate as
Ceausescu and Suharto Bhutto and a whole
bunch of gangsters not very different
from him who the u.s. supported until
the end but in fact that's exactly what
was said by Dennis Halliday and Hans von
sponeck the two directors of the
oil-for-food program was this as know
more about Iraq than certainly any West
so maybe so you know it's uh but it's
crucial that Iraqis not rule Iraq so yes
there was support now how do we get any
of this stuff to the American people
well you know how you get anything else
for the population was a you who quoted
Margaret Mead at the beginning you know
that's the way to do it
everything happens exactly the way you
said exactly didn't you know I'm taking
the civil rights movement the women's
movement the anti-vietnam anti-war
movement pick anything you like you know
the environmental movement starts with
small groups people doing things and
gradually it grows finally it gets to
the point where as in the case of the
entity Vietnam war movement where the
government was afraid to send troops
because they'd need him for civil
disorder control all that happened
within about two years and it just
changed the world I mean a striking
example is the women's movement it's not
that I mean there were feminists before
but until the 1960s there was nothing
much was happening and within a couple
of years it changed the country in the
world dramatically it's probably the
major impact of the 60s on the world and
it happened just by
consciousness-raising groups bigger
groups activism where it was necessary
and so on civil rights movement a couple
of black kids sat at a lunch counter and
freedom fries bus riders started rioting
and pretty soon you had a huge mass
movement which didn't solve the problems
obviously but Allah made it a lot better
earlier you mentioned latin america and
the u.s. preference for police states
and I think we see those police states
crumbling preference for what I didn't
read state blue state in Latin America
and those states are crumbling most
recently there was the election in
Paraguay and while we never heard
anything about the generations of rulers
in Paraguay this would this weekend
there was a significant election you
know we find Korea and Ecuador who is
saying that US military bases have no
place in Ecuador Venezuela a revolution
with resources a rich revolution on ever
Morales in Bolivia right now as you know
is being threatened and that there is a
worldwide appeal to to cease the
hostilities anyway my question is how do
you see Latin America moving forward on
its leftist path or just on its own path
and define in the US this is one of the
most important things happening in the
world I think it's not Latin America
unfortunately at South America Central
America was so devastated by Reaganite
terror it may never recover so they're
not part of this much I mean a little
bit not much but South America is
undergoing a really dramatic change and
it's the first time since the Spanish
invasions that the countries of South
America are beginning to face two
fundamental problems which have turned
them into a like a horror story some of
the worst poverty and misery in the
world in in a in a region with enormous
resources and a lot of potential you
know it's not like it's not like you
know it's not a desert somewhere the two
problems are both problems of sort of
disintegration one of them internal to
each society and other among all the
societies each Latin Latin American
societies typically have been run by a
very small wealthy
very wealthy largely white elite race
class correlations pre-close with a mass
of suffering and misery that's been an
internal problem so if you compare it
with East Asia's striking I mean Latin
America's many advantages over East Asia
should be way ahead and development but
in Latin America capital is exported by
the tiny rich elite the imports are
luxury goods so they can live it up
their second homes are in the Riviera or
someplace like that the children go to
school overseas there's nothing to do
with their own population no
responsibilities taxes nothing the
disintegration among the countries is
that they are all separated from one
another there's very little interaction
among them during the colonial period
and even the period of Independence you
can see that in the transportation
systems and on us everything well those
things are changing strikingly I think
the most dramatic cases Bolivia which is
really impressive what happened and
you're right it's under a lot of threat
now the white elite that's always run
the place is infuriated that they had a
democratic election for the first time
and the u.s. is just as infuriated
democratic elections are a real danger
but they had a remarkable democratic
election in which the large majority of
the population mostly indigenous entered
the political arena elected someone from
their own ranks on crucial issues you
know not did you make a mistake you
should have said but on real issues
control of resources issues of cultural
rights of justice and so on and they
want and if they were not just pushing a
button on Election Day
these were continuing struggles control
over water in all sorts of things
sometimes very bitter struggles and I
had developed mass popular organizations
and they had a democratic election of a
kind that is unimaginable in the United
States or in the West all the
and yes now there's a serious effort to
overturn it this strong secessionist
movement we don't have documents but I'm
sure it's backed by the United States to
try to support the rich mostly white
minority to pull out and that happens to
be where most of the natural resources
are and the majorities must hold the
country together and you know carry
forward the significant changes that are
taking place and there's also and that's
happening in the other countries too
that you mentioned including Brazil the
most important and there's a lot of
integration going on in fact the whole
region almost the entire region is sort
of moving to the left you know well the
US had means of protection stopping this
- means violence and economic
strangulation and both means have been
severely weakened a Correa throwing out
the monta airbase is a symbol of the
weakening of the weapon of violence
traditionally the u.s. when anything
like this happened the u.s. carried out
a military coup or you know instigated a
military coup installed a bunch of
gangsters and that was the end of it
it's but they can't do that now the last
time the u.s. tried a military coup was
in Venezuela in 2002 where they did
manage to the us-backed military coup
did manage to overthrow the government
but it was overturned within a couple of
days and it was huge protests all over
Latin America and the u.s. had to back
off and I haven't been able to do it
since the economic strangulation is also
weakened the economic strangulation in
recent years has been the instrument of
it has been the IMF International
Monetary Fund which is basically a
branch of the US Treasury so the idea is
you get the country's deeply indebted to
give impossible debts that they can
never pay the debts are not from the
population they're from the elite
population didn't borrow the money and
didn't gain anything from it but the
international rules are they're the ones
who have to pay it
okay well that's being overcome country
after countries as the Argentine
president put it ridding ourselves of
the IMF restructuring the debts repaying
the dets Argentina did it with
Venezuela Brazil did in its own way and
the IMF is actually in trouble it's not
getting a funding by debt repayment so
the and in general the method of
economic strangulation is declining
partly because of the integration the
countries are working together the
standard u.s. line
now press scholarship and so on is that
the there are two kinds if they have to
admit that Latin America is moving left
but there's a good left and a bad left
the good left is Lula and Brazil the bad
left is of course Chavez and Morales and
maybe Korea but in order to maintain
that party line you have to be quick on
your feet for example you have to
overlook the fact that one of the
strongest supporters of Chavez is Lula
that doesn't fit the party line so it
doesn't get reported after Lula and
Brazil after he was his second Nasser
was reelected his first act practically
was to fly to Caracas to support Chavez
in his electoral campaign and to
dedicate a joint Venezuelan Brazilian
project there's no more projects
development shortly after that there was
a very important meeting of Latin
American presidents in Cochabamba and
Bolivia very important place that's
where the Bolivian revolution took off
that's where peasants began protesting
the World Bank u.s. programs to
privatize water which means water is a
token you know people can't drink this
can't pay the cost so they threw out
they succeeded in throwing out the
Bechtel corporation and blocking the
effort it wasn't easy a lot of people
got killed
that's Cochabamba it's real symbol so
that's where the Latin American
presidents met it was December 2006 and
they made interesting plans joint plans
for an european union type integration
and actually taking steps towards it and
the u.s. is just that much that you can
do about it you know it's lost its main
weapons now the plenty of internal
to overcome so it's not going to be an
easy path but this is the first time
they're being seriously faced and on the
and with the participation of
substantial mass popular movements
that's the basis for democracy it's one
of the reasons why we don't have a
functioning democracy we don't have mass
popular movements so therefore in
popular opinion we mostly disregard it
as it is but they're overcoming then
it's a real model to look for the u.s.
is by no means giving up you may have
read in the paper a couple of days ago
that a training of military officers is
being shifted from the State Department
to the Pentagon that's been going on for
some time now in fact but they finally
reported it that's quite significant
training within the State Department is
at least theoretically under
congressional supervision meaning that
there are human rights conditionalities
and so on once it moves into the
pentagon it's just a black hole and do
anything they want nobody ever looks
training and torture or whatever you do
it's a weak control but it's something
furthermore training of Latin American
officers is shot way up the u.s. is
trying very hard to recreate a Latin
American officer corps that will be able
to follow its orders I think it's now
higher than it's ever been through the
cold warriors and the purposes are
explicit the training is designed to
combat what's called radical populism
well in the Latin American context
radical populism means human rights
activists union leaders priests
organizing peasants anybody who gets in
the way and that's the explicit goal of
the training of officers and training of
officers just doesn't mean just teaching
them it means providing them with
technology and weapons and connections
and so on so the u.s. is certainly
trying to recreate the weapon of
violence and also the economic weapons
but it's not as easy it was for one
thing there's much more protest here
which is a good thing for other things
there's the whole world has become more
diverse so the the exporters in Latin
America can now turn to China for
that markets and China's investing there
were also South South relations
development so Brazil South Africa and
India now have relations all of this
these moves are very positive I think
and could lead to of the basis for some
kind of authentic independence and also
for overcoming the enormous internal
problems so that's a Israel very hopeful
signs I think
