it's hardly a secret that the terms of
political discourse are not exactly
models of precision and considering the
way terms are used it's next to
impossible to try to give a meaningful
answer to such questions as what is
socialism or what is capitalism or what
our markets free markets and many others
in common usage now that's even more
true of the term anarchism for reasons
that Nathan pointed out it's been not
only subject to very varied use but also
a quite extreme abuse sometimes by
bitter enemies sometimes unfortunately
by people of hold its manner high so
much so so much is the variation of
abuse that it resists any simple
characterization in fact the only way I
can see to address the question that's
posed this evening what is anarchism is
to try to identify some leading ideas
that animate at least major currents of
the rich and complex and often
contradictory traditions of an anarchist
thought and crucially anarchist action
well I think a sensible approach can
start with remarks by the perceptive
important anarchist intellectual Ahmed
also activist
Rudolf rocker I'll quote him he saw
anarchism not as a fixed self-enclosed
social system with a fixed answer to all
the multifarious questions and problems
of human life but rather as a definite
trend in the historic development of
mankind which strives for the free
unhindered unfolding of all the
individual and social forces in life
it's from the 1930s
these concepts are not really original
they derive from the Enlightenment and
the early Romantic period in rather
similar words Vilhelm von Humboldt one
of the founders of classical liberalism
among many other achievements described
the leading principle of his thought as
the absolute and essential importance of
human development in its richest
diversity that's a phrase that John
Stuart Mill took as the epigraph to his
on Liberty it follows from that that
institutions that constrain such human
development are illegitimate unless of
course they can somehow justify
themselves you find a similar conception
widely an Enlightenment thought so for
example in Adam Smith everyone has read
the opening paragraphs of Wealth of
Nations where he extolled the wonders of
division of labor but not many people
have gotten farther inside to read his
bitter condemnation of division of labor
and his insistence that in any civilized
society the government will have to
intervene to prevent it because it will
destroy personal integrity and essential
human rights will turn people he said
into creatures as stupid and ignorant as
a human can be it's not too easy to find
that passage whatever the reason may be
if you look in the scholar standard
scholarly edition the University of
Chicago by a Bicentennial edition it's
not even listed in the index well but
it's one of the most important passages
in the book looked at in these terms
anarchism is a tendency and human
development that seeks to identify
structures of hierarchy domination
Authority and others that constrain
human development and then it seeks to
subject them to a very reasonable
challenge justify yourself demonstrate
that you're legitimate and maybe in some
special circumstances are conceivably in
principle and if you can't meet that
that challenge which is the usual case
the structure should be dismantled and
it's Nathan rightly adds not just
dismantled but reconstructed from below
the ideals that found expression during
the Enlightenment and the Romantic era
they founded on the shoals of rising
industrial capitalism which is
completely not effete achill through
them but rocker argues I think quite
plausibly that they remain alive in the
libertarian socialist traditions these
range pretty widely they range from left
anti-bolshevik Marxism that's people
like monthon Pannekoek all course Paul
mattock and others including the
anarcho-syndicalism that reached its
peak of achievement and the
Revolutionary period in Spain in 1936
and it's well to remember that despite
its substantial achievements and
successes it was crushed by the combined
force of fascism communism and Western
democracy they had differences but they
agreed that this had to be crushed with
the effort of free people to control
their own lives that had to be crushed
before they turned to their petty
differences which are we call the
Spanish Civil War the same the same
tendencies reached further to worker
controlled enterprises they're springing
up in large parts the old Rust Belt in
the United States in northern Mexico
they've reached their greatest
development and the Basque Country in
Spain
Mondragon partly a reflection of the
achievements of the
complex rich Spanish tradition of
anarchism it partly it comes out of
Christian anarchist sources
there's also included in this general
tendency or the quite substantial and
cooperative movements that that exist in
many parts of the world and I think it
also encompasses at least a good part of
feminist and human rights activism well
in part all of this sounds like truism
so why should anyone defend illegitimate
structures no reason of course and I
think that perception is correct it
really is truism I think honor killings
is basically ought to be called truism
but truisms have some merit that one of
them is the merit of being true unlike
most political discourse and this
particular truism belongs to an
interesting category of principles the
principles that are not only Universal
but doubly Universal they're Universal
in that they're almost universally
accepted and universal in that they're
almost universally rejected in practice
and this is one of there are many of
these for example the general principle
that we should apply to ourselves the
same standards we do to others if not
harsher ones a few would object a few
would practice it or more specific
policy proposals like democracy
promotion or a humanitarian intervention
professed generally rejected in practice
almost universally all doubly universal
and this truism is the same the truism
that we should challenge and coercive
institutions of all kinds demand that
they justify themselves dismantle and
reconstruction them if they do not easy
to say but not so easy to act on in
practice
well proceeding with similar thoughts
I'll quote rock
again anarchism seeks to free labor from
economic exploitation and to free
society from ecclesiastical or political
guardianship and by doing that opening
the way to an alliance of free groups of
men and women based on cooperative later
labor and a planned administration of
things in the interest of the community
now rocker was an anarchist activist as
well as political thinker and he goes on
to call on the workers organizations
other popular organizations to create
I'm quoting not only the ideas but also
the facts of the future itself within
the current society that's an injunction
that goes back to bakunin one
traditional anarchist slogan is need you
Annie Mehta
no God no master it's a phrase that
Daniel Galen cook gets the title of his
very valuable collection of anarchist
classics I think it's fair to understand
the phrase no God in the terms that I
just quoted from rocker opposition's of
ecclesiastical guardianship individual
beliefs are a different matter that's no
matter of concern to a person concerned
with free development of thought in
action and that leaves the door open to
the lively and impressive tradition of
religious anarchism
for example Dorothy days
very impressive Catholic workers
movement but the phrase no master is
different now that refers not to
individual belief but to a social
relation a relation of subordination and
dominance relation that anarchism if
taken seriously seeks to dismantle and
rebuild from below unless it can somehow
meet the harsh burden of establishing
its legitimacy well by now we've
departed from true
in fact to ample controversy in
particular right at this point the
rather peculiar American brand of what's
called libertarianism that the parts is
very sharply from the libertarian
tradition it accepts and indeed strongly
advocates the subordination of working
people to the masters of the economy and
furthermore the subjection of everyone
to the restrictive discipline and
destructive features of markets these
are topics worth pursuing you know take
them up later if you'd like but I'll put
them aside here although also
recommending to you
Nathan's comment his suggestion about
bringing together in some way the
energies of the young libertarian left
and right as indeed sometimes done for
example it's done in the quite important
work of valuable theoretical and
practical work of economists and David
Ellerman and some others well Anakin
anarchism of course is famously opposed
to the state while at the same time
advocating planned administration of
things in the interests of the community
rockers phrase again and beyond that
broader federations of self-governing
communities at workplaces well in the
real world of today the same dedicated
anarchists who are opposed to the state
often support state power to protect
people and society and the earth itself
from the ravages of concentrated private
capital so it takes a venerable
anarchist journal like freedom goes back
to 1886 formed as a journal socialist
anarchism by by supporters of Kropotkin
if you open spate pages you'll find that
much of it is devoted to defending
rights of people the environment society
often by invoking state power like
regulation of the environment or safety
and health regulations and the workplace
there's no contradiction here as
sometimes thought people live and suffer
and endure in this world and not some
world that we imagine and all the means
available should be used to safeguard
and benefit them even if the long term
goal is to displace these devices and
construct preferable alternatives in
discussing this sometimes used an image
that comes from the Brazilian workers
movement it's discussed in interesting
work by Bjorn Maybury Louis they speak
of both today's the image of widening
the floors of the cage the cage is
existing coercive institutions that can
be widened by committed popular struggle
happened effectively over many years and
you can extend the image beyond think of
the cage of coercive state institutions
as a kind of protection from savage
beasts that are roaming outside namely
the predatory state-supported capitalist
institutions that are dedicated to the
principle of private gain power
domination with the interest of the
community at most the footnote may be
revered in rhetoric but dismissed in
practice and in fact even in
anglo-american law well it's worth also
worth remembering that anarchists
condemned really existing States not
visions of unrealized democratic dreams
such as government of By and For the
People
they bitterly opposed the
of what Bakunin had called the red
bureaucracy which he predicted fifty
years in advance would be among the most
savage of human creations and they also
opposed parliamentary systems that are
instruments of class rule the
contemporary United States for example
which is not a democracy it's a currency
that's very easy to demonstrate majority
of the population has no influence over
policy and as you move up the income
wealth scale you get more and more
influence very top people get what they
want it will establish by academic
political science but too familiar to
everyone who looks at the way the world
works
a truly democratic system would be quite
different it would have the character of
quote again an alliance of free groups
of men and women based on cooperative
labor and a planned administration of
things in the interests of the community
in fact that's not too remote from one
version of the mainstream Democratic
ideal actually one version and stressed
that I'll return to others so take for
example the leading American social
philosopher of 20th century John Dewey
his major concerns were democracy and
education no one took do we to be an
anarchist but pay attention to his ideas
in his conception of democracy
illegitimate structures of coercion must
be dismantled and that includes on quote
hem domination by business for private
profit through private control of
banking land industry reinforced by
command of the press press agents other
means of publicity and propaganda
he recognized still quoting that power
today resides in control of the means of
production exchange publicity
transportation and communication
whoever owns them rules the life of the
country even if Democratic forms remain
and until these institutions are in the
hands of the public
politics will remain the shadow cast on
big cast by big business on society very
much what we see around us in fact but
it's important that Dewey went beyond
calling for some form of public control
that could take many forms
he went beyond in a free and democratic
society he wrote the workers should be
the masters of their own industrial fate
not tools rented by employers not
directed by state authorities now that
position goes right back to the leading
ideas of classical liberalism
articulated by von Humboldt
Smith others and extended in the
anarchist tradition turning to education
Dewey held that it is a liberal and
immoral to train children to work not
freely and intelligently but for the
sake of the work earned the to achieve
test scores for example in which case
their activity is not free because it's
not freely participated in and it's
quickly forgotten too as all of us know
from our experience so he proceeded to
conclude that industry must be changed
from a futile istic to a democratic
social order and educational practice
should be designed to encourage
creativity exploration independence
cooperative work exactly the opposite of
what's happening today
well these ideas lead to a vision of
society based on workers control of
productive institutions linked to
community control within the framework
of free association and federal
organization in the general style of
thought that includes of course along
with many anarchists
others to say gdh coals guild socialism
England left anti-bolshevik Marxism the
current developments such as for example
the participatory economics and politics
of Michael Albert Robin Hahnel Steven
Shalem and others along with important
work and theory and practice by the late
Seymour Melman his associates and many
others and notably gar alperovitz is
very valuable recent contributions on
worker owned enterprise and cooperatives
not just talk but actual taking place
well going back to Dewey he was as
American as apple pie to borrow the old
cliche right in the mainstream of
American history and culture and in fact
all of these ideas and developments are
very deeply rooted in the American
tradition and in American history fact
which is kind of suppressed but it's
very very obvious when you look into it
and when you pursue these questions you
enter into an important terrain of
inspiring often bitter struggle that's
ever since the dawn of the Industrial
Revolution which was right around here
Lowell Lawrence eastern Massachusetts
mid nineteenth century the first serious
scholarly work a study of the industrial
worker in those years was 90 years ago
that's by Norman we're still very much
worth reading he reviews the hideous
working conditions that were imposed on
formerly independent craftsmen and
immigrants and farmers as well as the so
called factory girls young women brought
from the farms to work in the textile
mills around Boston he mentions that he
reviews it but he focuses attention on
something else what he calls the
degradation suffered by the industrial
worker the loss of status and in debt
which could not be canceled even where
there casually was some material
improvement and he focuses on the
radical capitalist social revolution in
which sovereignty and economic affairs
passed from the community as a whole
into the keeping of a special class of
masters often remote from production a
group a into the producers and where
shows I think pretty convincingly that
for every protest against machine
industry and privation now there can be
found a hundred protests against the new
power of capitalist production and it's
discipline in other words workers were
struggling and striking not just for
bread but for roses and the traditional
slogan of the workers communities and
organizations they were struggling for
dignity and independence and for their
rights as free men and women and their
journals are very interesting there's a
rich and lively labor press written by
working people artisans from Boston
factory girls from the farms in these
journals they condemned what they called
the blasting influence of Mannar kacal
principles on democratic soil which will
not be overcome until they who work in
the mills will own them the slogan of
the massive Knights of Labor and
sovereignty will return to free and
independent producers then they will no
longer be menials
or the humble subjects of a foreign
despot the absentee owner slaves in the
strictest sense of the word who toil for
their masters rather they will regain
their status as free American citizens
the capitalist revolution the instituted
a crucial change from price to wage it's
very important when a producer sold his
product for a price he retained his
person but when he came to sell his
labor he sold himself
from the press that's a big difference
he lost his dignity as a person as he
became a slave a wage slave to use the
common term of the period 160 years ago
a group of skilled workers repeated the
common view that a daily wage was
equivalent to slavery and they weren't
warned perceptively that a day might
come when wage slaves will so far forget
what is due to manhood as to glory in a
system forced on them by their necessity
and in opposition to their feelings of
Independence and self-respect a day that
they hoped would be far distant these
were very popular notions in the mid
19th century in fact so popular that
they were a slogan of the Republican
Party you could read them in editorials
of the New York Times that's and then
not now but that they may come back
let's over labor activists at the time
warned bitterly often of what they
called the new spirit of the age gained
wealth forgetting all but self that was
a new spirit of the age 150 years ago
and in sharp reaction to this demeaning
spirit there were that quite enormous an
active rising movements of working
people and radical farmers radical
farmers actually began in Texas spread
through the Midwest and much of the
country was of course an agricultural
country then these are the most
significant Democratic popular movements
in American history they were dedicated
to solidarity mutual aid it's a battle
they were crushed by force we have a
very violent labor histories compared
with other countries but it's a battle
that's not over far from over
despite setbacks often violent
repression
well there are Paula
just familiar apologists for the radical
revolution of wage slavery and they have
an argument they argue that the worker
should indeed glory in a system of free
crop free contracts voluntarily
undertaken though there was an answer to
that 200 years ago by shelley in his
great poem masque of anarchy
this was written right after the
Peterloo massacre in england in
manchester the witan British cavalry
have erdely attacked a peaceful
gathering of tens of thousands of people
the first major example of huge
nonviolent protest and the reaction of
the state authorities to it they were
calling for parliamentary reform so
Shelley wrote that we know what slavery
is it is to work and have such pay as
just keeps life from day to day in your
limbs as in a cell for the tyrants used
to dwell tis to be slave and soul and to
hold no strong control over your own
wills but be all that others make of ye
that's slavery that's what working
people and independent farmers were
struggling against and the artisans and
factory girls who struggled for dignity
and independence and freedom might very
well have known Shelley's words
observers at the time noted that they
were highly literate they had good
libraries they were acquainted with the
standard works of English literature
before this is before mechanism and wage
slavery the wage system ended the days
of at least curtailed the days of
independence high culture or insecurity
before that we're points out a workshop
might be what he called a Lyceum the
journeyman would hire boys to read to
them while they worked these were social
businesses with many opportunities for
reading discussion mutual improvement
along with the factory girls the
journeyman the artisans in a bitterly
condemned the attack on their culture
the same was true in England
incidentally where conditions were much
harsher there's actually a great book
about this by Jonathan Rose called the
intellectual life of the British working
class it's a monumental study of the
reading habits of the working class of
what we think of as a Dickensian England
and he contrasts what he calls the
passionate pursuit of knowledge by
proletarian autodidact with a pervasive
Philistine ISM of the British
aristocracy actually I'm old enough to
remember residues that remained among
working people right here in New York in
the 1930s who were deeply immersed in
the high culture of the day it's another
battle that may have receded but I don't
think it's lost well I mentioned that
Dewey and American workers and farmers
held one version of democracy with very
strong libertarian elements but the
dominant version has been a radically
different it's most instructive
expression is that the progressive end
of the spectrum mainstream spectrum so
that is people among people who are good
Woodrow Wilson FDR Kennedy liberals
here's a few representative quotes from
icons of the liberal intellectual
establishment on democratic theory now
the public are ignorant and meddlesome
outsiders they have to be put in their
place decisions must be in the hands of
an intelligent minority of responsible
men namely us and we have to be
protected from the trampling and roar of
the bewildered herd out there the herd
does have a function in a Democratic
Society they're supposed to lend their
weight every few years to a choice among
the responsible men
but apart from that their function is to
be spectators not participants in action
and all of this is for their own good
that we should not succumb to democratic
dogmatism 'he's about men being the best
judges of their own interests they're
not they're like young children you have
to take care of them we are the best
judges of their own interests so their
attitudes and opinions have to be
controlled for their own benefit we have
to regiment their minds the way in army
regiments bodies and we have to
discipline the institutions responsible
for what they called the indoctrination
of the young schools universities
churches if we can do this we can get
back to the good old days this is
complaints about the 60s we get back to
the good old days when Truman had been
able to govern the country with the
cooperation of a relatively small number
of Wall Street lawyers and bankers then
we'll have true democracy now these are
quotes from icons of the liberal
establishment that walter Lippmann
Edward Bernays Harold Lasswell and
founder of modern political science
Samuel Huntington trilateral commission
which largely staffed the Carter
Administration well the conflict between
these conceptions of democracy goes far
back goes back to the earliest modern
democratic revolution in 17th century
England at that time as you know a war
there was a war raging between
supporters of the king and supporters of
Parliament that's the civil war that we
read about but there was more the gentry
the men who called themselves the men of
best-quality
they were appalled by the rabble who
didn't want to be ruled by either king
or Parliament like the Spanish workers
in 1936
neither side that they wanted to be
ruled as they put they had their own
pamphlets pamphlet literature and they
said they wanted to be ruled by
countrymen like our cell
that no heir wants that will never be a
good world while Knights and gentlemen
make us laws that are chosen for fear
and do but oppress us and do not know
the people sores
that's 17th century England the
essential nature of this conflict which
is far from ended was captured nicely by
Thomas Jefferson in his later years when
he had serious concerns about both the
quality and the fate of the democratic
experiment he made a distinction between
what he called aristocrats and Democrats
the aristocrats on quoting him are those
who fear and distrust the people and
wish to draw all powers from them into
the hands of the higher classes the
Democrats in contrast identified with
the people have confidence in them
cherish and consider them as the honest
and safe although not the most wise
depository of the public interest the
modern progressive intellectuals the
Wilson Roosevelt Kennedy intellectual
left those who seek to put the public in
their place and are free from democratic
dogmatism zaboo capacity of the ignorant
and meddlesome outsiders to enter the
political arena
there are Jefferson's aristocrats these
basic views are very widely held though
there are some disputes namely who
should play the guiding role should it
be what the liberal electoral is called
the technocratic and policy oriented
intellectuals the ones we celebrate as
the Camelot intellectuals who run the
progressive knowledge society should be
bankers or corporate executives in other
versions should be the Central Committee
or the Guardian Council of clerks all
pretty similar ideas and they're all
examples of the
ecclesiastical and political
guardianship that the genuine
libertarian tradition seeks to dismantle
and reconstruct from below while also
changing industry from feudalistic to a
democratic social order one that's based
on workers control community control
respects the dignity of the producer as
a genuine person not a tool in the hands
of others in accordance with a
libertarian tradition that has deep
roots and like Marx's old mole as always
burrowing quite close to the surface and
ready to spring forth thanks
[Music]
so for the discussion I'd like to invite
anybody who has a question to to line up
behind the microphones on either side
and please try to try to keep it concise
and as you do that I'd like to start if
you don't mind I just wonder if you
could say something about the images
that represent some of your first
encounters with anarchism I mean I think
for people who have gotten excited about
these ideas through the Occupy movement
it was important to see it and practice
somehow I wonder what those images have
been for you well I grew up in the 1930s
when I was kids deep depression and
plenty of suffering and there were
images that kind of stick in my mind you
know people coming to my parents were
teachers so we had some money you know
not rich but got long and in fact the
whole family of unemployed working-class
kind of converged around around our
house we had at least something but
there were images of people coming to
the door trying to sell rags to try to
get a piece of bread to survive
I remembered writing with my mother on
trolley cars watching going past textile
plants this is Philadelphia and watching
women on strike being brutally beaten by
security forces my own family was
extended family was mostly unemployed
working-class and as I mentioned very
high culture as the New Deal sort of
began to having an impact they were able
to enjoy Shakespeare plays in the park
go to the budva string quartet to my
unemployed seamstress aunts who were
members of the ilgwon ladies garment
workers union could get a couple of
weeks in the countryside at a solidarity
camp that that was life a lot of it was
communist party we're not allowed to say
anything nice about the Communist Party
that's
and there were a lot of things wrong
with it and I've mentioned some of them
now but there were things that were
right about it like I said one was that
it overcame the amnesia that Nathan
talked about it was always there you
know people remembered somebody
remembered how to turn the minigraf
machine or organized demonstration and
you went from a civil rights
demonstration to a labor organizing to
something else that had crazy
international ideas but that was kind of
in the back of their minds it wasn't
wrote was really going on of the
destruction of the Communist Party was
quite important killed off the radical
continuing element that kept a lot of
the Left traditions that going you know
the reasons it was in the Cold War
framework that was all there as far as
the anarchists were concerned the place
I learned about that was by reading I
went when I was a kid I'd go to visit my
relatives and as soon as I got old
enough to get on that train about 11 or
12 years old I'd take the train to New
York and stay with my relatives but
spend most of my time down on those of
you know New York
Union Square used to be the place where
the anarchist offices were a friar vite
there's Timah others and lots of
pamphlets lots of interesting people
very quite eager to talk to a young kid
you know so not hard to have discussions
and down below Union Square on 4th
Avenue not today but then there were
rows of small bookstores a lot of them
run by European emigrates many of them
Spanish refugees Spanish anarchist
refugees who are also quite eager to
talk and had lots of pamphlets and
direct you know a real original
documentary material actually when I
wrote about this 20 years later I used
mostly documentary material I had picked
up as a young teenager wasn't available
a lot of it's available now wasn't then
that was a pretty inspiring picture I
felt the Spanish revolution at least I
felt and feel was a really inspiring
moment which i think is why it elicited
such a vicious response from every
corner of power that's quite important
to remember communists fascists liberal
democracies all combined on crushing
this this was something they couldn't
tolerate then they could have a fight
later about who cooks up the spoils
actually there were anarchist proposals
that I felt were not unreasonable there
disparaged of course in the West but for
how to win the Civil War was an
anarchist thinkers like Camilo Benari
who was murdered by the communists in
May 1937 one of the leading anarchist
thinkers he he proposed that he had
pointed out I think West turned out
quite correctly that they'd never win a
conventional war for one reason because
the commitment to the war on the part of
the population had seriously declined
after the Revolution was crushed they
had lost what they had fought for and
then care very much who was going to
pick up the spoils he pointed out and
and of course the fascists were being
directly supported by by Hitler and
Mussolini and the West was not opposed
to that yet it's Hartley may forget now
but fascism had a pretty good image in
the West and the late thirties Mussolini
was that admirable Italian gentleman as
Roosevelt called him now Hitler was
regarded by the State Department as in
the late 30s as a moderate who was
holding off the forces of left and right
so we shouldn't be too critical of him
the United States had a consul in Berlin
up until Pearl Harbor who was sending
back dispatches
shouldn't be too hard on the Nazis
they're doing some things we don't like
but they're still kind of moderates his
name is George Kennan you don't read
that in the biographies but that's not
untypical of the period Roosevelt for
example bitter that there was a
Neutrality Act theoretically that the
United States was not supposed to allow
the support for either side in the Civil
War and Rosa was very bitter about any
attempt to by somebody to say send a
pistol to the Republic I couldn't stop
it by force but he bitterly condemned it
on the other hand the State Department
couldn't notice what I was reading in
the left-wing press at the time and was
later conceded twenty years later that
the United States had authorized the
Texaco oil company which was run by an
outright Nazi open Nazi had authorized
them to they were so they had a contract
to ship oil to the Republic they
switched it to shipping oil to the
fascist forces which is the one thing
that Hitler Mussolini couldn't provide
they couldn't find that the left press
could find it but State Department
couldn't well going back to binary what
he proposed was that in Spain itself of
the popular forces should fight a
guerrilla war that's an old Spanish
tradition in fact that's where guerrilla
Wars and it were initiated under
Napoleon fight a guerrilla war in Spain
itself and in Morocco call for support
the Moroccan liberation forces that were
trying to free themselves from French
and British Imperial and Spanish
Imperial control that was the base of
Franco's army they were Moorish troops
coming from northern Africa so his idea
was quite a revolutionary war I support
them in their efforts to overthrow
imperialist control that he thought
would erode the Spanish the fascist
armies just as in Spain itself the
pocket
forces were fighting but until they were
crushed well that's if you read the
scholarship on on the matter up till
today that's kind of dismissed as a sort
of a romantic joke as the whole line
urges movement is but I don't think it
was that's worth that was my initial
exposure hi professor Chomsky this is an
unimaginable honor thank you so much for
doing this
I just wanted to you touch briefly you
had this wonderful Shelly quote and you
touch briefly on your family's
engagement with high culture and I was
wondering where I was I was just gonna
ask you to reflect briefly on the
contemporary state of high culture and
serious art and how important you think
engagement with that you know serious
contemporary literature music cinema
whatever it is how important it is in
exploring this sort of the vanguard of
political thought and you know whether
or not contemporary artists and
contemporary audiences are rising to
that challenge well I think it's very
important and I'm not the only one who
think so
I think people with power think so
that's why famous rivera mural wasn't
allowed to be put in Rockefeller Center
that's why if you go back to cinema you
say go back 60 years early 50s some of
you remember so in 1953 interesting year
for cinema there were two major films
that came out one major well two films
that came out on the labor movement one
which was a huge box-office success
ton of you know PR or advertising and so
on a featured Marlon Brando was about a
corrupt union leader and how the heroic
you know Joe with his lunchbox finally
overcame the corrupt union leader at the
end of the film throws him into the
water and everybody cheers that was one
there was another film a lo a marvelous
film called salt of the earth low-budget
film
which was about a victorious strike led
by Hispanic woman it was a really great
film and she can find it somewhere he
should look at it but no one ever heard
of it you know I mean you could find it
maybe in a small art theater and
downtown New York somewhere but that
wasn't the kind of film that was going
to get publicity and that runs through
consistently and I think when people in
power believe something firmly it's
worth paying attention to him and I
think they believe firmly that you
should not have a revolutionary popular
art in which people participate actually
that's one of the reasons I think for
destroying the graffiti in the New York
subways that's considered a great
achievement of Bloomberg you know we're
feeding popular art all over the subways
you know because that's just too
dangerous as part of the drug war
grotesque
drug war race war murderers a large part
of it came from the fact that the Harlem
Renaissance black artists in Harlem were
playing jazz and smoking marijuana so
that had to be destroyed that became the
great criminal of the Age Mexicans were
doing it too this is pretty constant so
yeah I think it's that's really
important know what is what is
preventing people if anything from
organizing themselves into worker
controlled cooperatives you alluded to
coops and if not much is preventing them
from doing so
- what do you attribute their relative
lack of popularity and the related
question would be why what could Union
controlled pensions for example be doing
if the problem is capital for example
why aren't more entities like worker
control putative Li worker controlled
pensions investing the capital they have
some control over in supporting these
kinds of worker controlled alternatives
well first of all pensions are not in
the hands of working people the unions
are not popular democracies pensions are
in the hands of bureaucrats and money
managers and they're not about to hand
over power to popular organizations
actually 20 entirely true there are some
interesting initiatives know if they're
going to get anywhere but they're
interesting the United Steelworkers
which is one of the more progressive
unions has recently made some tentative
arrangements with Mondragon in the
Basque Country this huge in worker owned
industrial banking housing school
educational cooperative that could get
somewhere and I mentioned gar alperovitz
is work he's discussed very well the and
it participates and the spread of worker
owned enterprises in mostly northern
Ohio the old Rust Belt they have a kind
of an interesting history and which
relates very much to this back in 1977
at the beginning of the concerted effort
to destroy industrial production in the
United States and sort of the beginning
of the kind of neoliberal assault on the
population we've been through in the
past generation a US Steel that decided
to close its main steel plants in
Youngstown Ohio it was a steel town like
other working-class towns like Detroit
it had actually been built by the
working classes was their town they
didn't get the profit because there are
tools but they built it they wanted to
keep it
US Steel wanted to sell it to close it
down and the Union offered to buy it
they had community support they even had
some support of I think it was a
Republican governor just bought let the
workers by the plan and keep running it
well US still didn't want that in fact
this is consistent
I mentioned Dave Armen before he's one
was written about it
worked on it very commonly around here
to Eastern Massachusetts when workers
decide to try to take over an enterprise
maybe an enterprise which may be
perfectly profitable but not profitable
enough for the multinational who you
know who runs it maybe they don't want
to keep in their books when they try to
buy it which would be a good deal for
the multinational they refused to sell
it for class reasons they have class
interests they do not want to see the
spread of popular democratic
organizations for perfectly obvious
reasons this just happened and going but
I'll come back to Youngstown in a minute
but it just happened a couple of years
ago right here and Taunton there was a
small but quite successful manufacturing
plant made specialized parts for
aircraft doing pretty well but the
multinational didn't want to bother with
it so they were going to close it down
the Union you know UE in this case I
tried to buy it
multinationals usually refused to sell
it and there wasn't enough support
popular support to push it through if
there had been an Occupy movement at
that time real I think that's something
they might have pushed through actually
on a much larger scale a couple of years
ago Obama virtually nationalized the
auto industry not entirely but virtually
there were a couple of options that one
option was to restructure it use
taxpayer funding hand it back to the
original owners or other people just
like them maybe a different face but you
know bankers CEOs and so on and then
have it continue to do what it had been
doing before building cars that's what
they chose there was another option hand
it over to the work force have them
build what's needed in the country which
is not more cars for traffic jams but
high-speed mass transportation the
United States is very backward in the
world in this respect
you can take a high-speed train from
Beijing to Kazakhstan but try to take a
train from Boston to New York
it's about as slow as it was 60 years
ago this is really backward the country
needs it and the the former auto
industry could have been handed over to
the workforce and given may be given
some support but probably less than the
auto industry got to do this but that
wasn't an option suppose there had been
a large-scale Occupy movement you know
significant it was significant but
broader expanded well I think that could
have been pushed through takes popular
consciousness they're going back to
Youngstown oh the case went to court in
1977 the Union Union lost workers lost
and it was the steel mills were
destroyed but they didn't give up they
didn't just say okay we'll starve to
death or go somewhere else they began to
organize small worker owned enterprises
and they've been spreading around the
Cleveland area and good Youngstown good
bit of northern Ohio into other areas so
it is taking place but you know it's
it's happening elsewhere too in northern
Mexico there are quite successful worker
owned plants it's not easy because you
know the the the banks don't like to
give them capital and the government
doesn't like them and won't support them
again for class reasons but if the
sufficient popular support these things
can develop and it's not easy you know
it's hard work and the people who
organize usually suffer for it but
that's typical of almost everything and
civil rights movement correctly any
movement that has ever gotten anywhere
the people up front usually take it in
the chin you know it's hard and that's
people have to be willing to endure and
for a longer-term gain and that's not
easy but it can happen and it does
hi I'm just curious if you could address
the role of surveillance technologies
and increasingly the militarization of
police as far as moving forward in
radical thought today and in the future
kind of what you see that where that is
now well I think there are two things to
bear in mind about that the first thing
is that the phenomenon itself shouldn't
be at all surprising the second is that
the scale at least to me is kind of
surprising I hadn't really expected that
scale but the phenomenon is normal and
it's again as American as apple pie now
you can go back to a century take say
the Philippine war early in the 19th
century 20th century there was a vicious
war the u.s. conquered the Phyllis fill
the Philippines killed couple hundred
thousand people it was a major popular
nationalist movement after the military
victory it had to be suppressed and
controlled and a huge pacification
campaign was initiated using the highest
technology of the day for surveillance
subversion of breaking up groups you
know building up hostilities all kinds
of things a very sophisticated it was
very quickly transferred home it was
used by Woodrow Wilson and the Red Scare
the worst repression of American history
and developed further since it's had a
lethal effect on the Philippines people
mourn the typhoon that killed tens of
thousands of people that doesn't happen
in functioning societies very striking
in the Caribbean that when a tropical
storm goes through the Caribbean ends
Haiti when the major victims of Imperial
violence it's a vicious they right next
door in Cuba three people died you know
some buildings are knocked over same
storm depends on the Society well the
Philippines is a society that we created
have maintained
it's the one part of Southeast Asia that
hasn't taken part in the so-called Asian
miracle you know the not one of the
Asian Tigers there's a reason for that
good reason but these techniques you can
be confident that any state or a
commercial enterprise any system of
power is going to use whatever
technology is available to try to
control and dominate its what amounts to
its major enemy namely the population
that's what power systems are going to
do the scale of what was revealed I
think was a little surprising but it
actually shouldn't be and there's more
to come those of you who read technical
journals like say the MIT Technology
Review they should know what's coming so
for example just in the tech review
recently there's been articles on things
like there and elsewhere on the hardware
and computers which is now being
designed they blame China but of course
that means it's being done 10 times as
much here to put in components in the
hardware that will enable the
manufacturer to record every keystroke
everything that's happening on your
computer American businesses are worried
because if they have Chinese computers
they'll be picking it up at the People's
Liberation Army but they don't point out
that the American systems are doubtless
much more advanced than doing the same
thing robotics is a field that's been
worked on pretty hard for many years
here too and one of the goals quite
explicit nothing secret is to develop
fly sized drones tiny robots which can
you know get on your on the ceiling of
your living room and carry out constant
surveillance and drones tend to go from
surveillance to lethal capacities very
quickly so we can expect that pretty
soon and
these are things that are in development
any system of power is going to use them
and pretty strikingly G Hadi's are going
to use them but one of the things we're
doing right now is creating perfect
technology for terrorist attacks it's
not a secret you take a look at drone
technology but right by today already
it's claimed that for the three hundred
dollars you can purchase a small drone
online
well that's improving very fast and for
terrorist activities just perfect if you
want to get a picture of it there's an
article in this month's leading journal
of Foreign Affairs and Britain the Royal
Institute Journal of International
Affairs describing how we are rapidly
creating the technology to permit a
massive terrorist attacks on ourselves
that's also typical power systems seek
short term power and domination they are
not concerned with security it's
contrary to academic thought length very
easily show that they're interested in
power domination the the wealthy the
welfare of their primary domestic
constituencies which are wealth
concentrated wealth and if there's a
disaster in the long term it's not their
business you can show that them it's
obvious with environmental issues it's
the same with nuclear weapons same right
now with drone technology so sure this
stuff is going to go on unless we stop
it oh you can stop it - it doesn't have
to go on can you offer a critique of
startup culture and entrepreneurship
which which offers many of the
characteristic Eric turistic of autonomy
but isn't so CB characteristics I mean
startup culture is you know it's okay
people like their apps and so on but
it's based very heavily on state subsidy
it's not it's kind of a narrow form of
entrepreneurship now so take for example
the Silicon Valley culture where what
are they using well they're using
computers or the Internet
mic electronics and so on and so forth
almost all developed in the state sector
for decades before it's handed over to
private power to for commercialization
and application so yeah there's
initiative there and people are having
fun doing maybe interesting things but
relying very heavily on the the
background state subsidy which takes
many forms
after everyone at MIT ought to know it
it's paid our salaries for years you
know that's you know for decades
computers in the internet and the whole
base of the IT culture were being
developed right here similar places and
orally and so on
and finally after decades it was handed
over to Bill Gates and Steve Jobs to
market and commercialize and make
profits and make little things that you
carry around with you but so it's a it's
a kind of a it has entrepreneurial
aspects but it's a parasitic but it's
parasitic on much more fundamental
development the really hard work the
hard research and development the
creative work is it's quite
substantially in the state sector and so
it's not just subsidy there are many
other devices of taxpayer support for
private enterprise one of the main ones
is procurement so for example in the
early 60s
IBM through the 50s had learned mostly
in government laboratories and places
like this had learned to switch from
punch cards to digital computers and
they built the world's biggest computer
in the early sixties stretch computers
at SystemVue
but it was much too expensive for
business so the government bought it
that's the purchaser of last resort
and I think it went to Los Alamos and
that goes on all the time procurements a
major form of public subsidy to private
enterprise and there are many other ways
that's one of the reasons why private
capital does not want markets they want
markets for other people but not for
themselves for themselves they want a a
nanny state powerful nanny state that
will support them what the significance
of the entrepreneurial culture is you
can judge not overwhelmed by the fact
that there's thousands of new apps
coming today I think they're more
important so I had a question about how
you reconcile the the emancipatory
tradition of anarchism to the kind of
abstractness of the ideology itself
around authority and empower and
coercion because it could be argued for
example that the federal government
intervened in the south during the Civil
War was coercive to the Confederate
States we know that like it was the
Civil War was a revolution of slaves
against slavery when the federal
government ended up intervening much
later but that could be argued that was
a form of authority because I yeah so
that how do you how do you actually
navigate that would say for example the
Marxist kind of definition which would
be between labor and capital
for example do you see that as as
something that is is maybe different
from or offers as sort of a different
perspective from anarchism because I
think that that could account for the
reason why for example there are such
things as Anakin capitalism it can be
argued that you know several different
ways that the state is intervening on my
ability to pay my workers a low wage or
whatnot I didn't understand the question
of so my question is authority itself is
a really abstract term authority of whom
I feel like is enough
without authority we all live with it
all the time that's true if you're a if
you're a worker named Lea
that's a wage slave that's workers
understood it's true if you're through
that until very recently for most women
that's been obvious nothing abstract
about it that's women didn't women
didn't even have legal rights in the
United States until pretty recently
oh my question is like if there's do
workers have the authority for example
to take over do they have the authority
yeah why not they built the plant they
made the product so they do the work why
should they be tools rented by some bank
or somewhere else I mean that's the way
our institutional structure happens to
be if formulated but doesn't mean it's
legitimate I mean when you talk about
authority or asking questions about
legitimacy the people have the right to
run their own lives or do they have to
be the sort of tools in the hands of far
of foreign masters well you know that's
a question of legitimacy not not
Authority well you mentioned the Civil
War and there's ample evidence by now
that there was a very significant slave
initiative in the Civil War there's more
to say about that a lot more so take the
American Revolution to a large extent
that was a revolution carried out in
order to maintain slavery you look back
at the history in seventeen around 1770
the in Britain the legal system was
beginning to undertake strong
condemnation of slavery that was one
famous case Somerset case 1772 were
slave owners from the United States
brought their slaves with them to
England but one of them escaped thee
there was an effort to his owner wanted
him back it's my property and it went to
court and went to Lord Mansfield famous
jurist who
rural that slaver is so odious that was
the term that used that it cannot be
tolerated on English soil
if crucially it could be tolerated in
the colonies but that's another story
but not on English soil and the the
United States was the the founders of
the country or almost all slave owners
and they could see the handwriting on
the wall if the colonies remained under
British rule probably these laws would
apply here and they'd lose their
property that was surely a significant
element of the Revolution and it runs
right to the present I mean right to
this moment the Civil War is still being
fought simply take a look at the
electoral maps say the map of the
election in 2012 red states and blue
states it's almost identical identical
to the Civil War
it's the Confederacy which now call
themselves Republicans shifted names and
the rest which was the north a large
part of the motivation behind the effort
to shut down the government is just
revenge we want to shut down Washington
and win this war finally the United
States never developed class parties
like labor parties they didn't amount to
much but at least they were something
but the u.s. never had them it's always
had sectional parties and it's a
reflection of the Civil War which has
never ended it also hasn't ended in the
prisons and elsewhere it's a very deeply
rooted thing in the society and hard to
extirpate yep I hope you all join me in
thanking Noam Chomsky once more
