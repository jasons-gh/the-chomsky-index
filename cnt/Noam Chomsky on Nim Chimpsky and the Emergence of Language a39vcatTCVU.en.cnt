the NIMH experiments Laura and potato
who I quoted was in fact the researcher
who if there's what you don't know it
it's it was an attempt by some very good
cognitive scientists and linguists to
raise a chimpanzee from birth in
circumstances as close as they could
mimic to the way a human child would be
raised and laurahenne potatoes a fine
scientist was the person who was
actually the was with him all the time
and ran the experiments and what I
quoted you heard that no matter how much
they tried could get nowhere I mean for
a while they kind of fooled themselves
there's an interesting book called NIMH
that they wrote about it and if you read
the book the first chapters describe the
great achievements of him you know next
he's going to give a lecture at the
Vienna Academy and so on but at the end
when they finished the experiment the
experiment the chimp gets pretty
aggressive after a while and after a
couple of years they couldn't keep them
any longer one of the graduate students
who was doing a doctoral dissertation on
it work through the frame-by-frame
protocols they were very careful and
collecting evidence and he went through
all the protocols and it turned out that
they had been completely deluding
themselves in ways that are clever ham
hunt style ways the experimenters were
very skilled and practiced either were
sick subtly signaling NIM in ways that
men picked up and responded or else they
were taking strings of meaningless
symbols and picking things out which
seemed to make sense like them would do
a lot of signing and they see one sign
that the interpreters give and another
sign that they interpreters banana and
they say oh yes confer banana actually
what's going on in them's head nobody
knows but it was nothing like this and
in fact it was a total failure and every
other experiment with animals has been
the same which is not at all surprising
apes are twelve million years of
evolutionary distance from us and it
appears as I mentioned that this these
distinctive human capacities are very
recent even in the human line probably
about a hundred thousand years which is
nothing you know that's yesterday but
furthermore we have very strong evidence
that shortly after these capacities
emerged they didn't change any more so
it's almost certain that for the last
maybe fifty to eighty thousand years
there has been no detectable evolution
among in human cognitive capacities we
know this because if you take say an
infant from an Amazon tribe that has
hasn't had human other human contact for
twenty thousand years or something and
the infant is brought up in Prague it
will be indistinguishable from children
brought up here and conversely there are
essentially no detectable differences
except extremely marginal in cognitive
capacities so what it looks like is that
something happened very suddenly and
didn't change and what happened well
whatever happened created the huge gulf
between humans and every other organism
known and there's some suggestions about
what it might be I strongly suspect that
what developed is the computational
mechanism for generating the basic
properties of language which apparently
emerged at that time infinite unbounded
structures with interpretate complex
interpretations
which seems to be totally lacking among
all animals that when you get to sign a
lot has been learned about sign in the
last 30 years or so
okay look potatoes one who I mentioned
is one of the leading researchers in
this and what's been discovered has been
pretty surprising to a lot of people it
turns out that sign is essentially
identical to spoken language and of
course its uses a different modality and
the different modality induces some
differences like words have to come out
in sequence because that's nature of
their articulatory organs but sign it
can use simultaneity
so the expression you know lifting the
eyebrows through an expression through a
series of science can turn it into a
question let's say and other than the
reference and sign systems is different
because you can create a visual space
and identify points in it you know refer
back to them so there are differences
like that but in terms of the internal
nature of the system it looks identical
there's even rather surprising results
that show that from the Salk Institute
that showed that it's normally
represented in the same areas which was
a surprise because it was thought that
it might be right hemisphere localized
since it's visual but it's not it's left
hemisphere vocalized in the same parts
of the brain which means there's some
analytic system in there which is
working modality independent if
furthermore this has since been extended
there are studies of people who have
lost both sight and vision so they don't
use sign or sound and they learn they
can learn and gain a remarkable fluency
in language just by touch it's
astonishing when you look at it the way
that these people are taught language is
by putting their hands on someone's face
with thumb is on the vocal cords so you
can see if it's moving
the fingers determined facial motions
and from that amazingly impoverished
evidence they can develop something like
full fluency I'm at the most famous
cases Helen Keller
it was extremely fluent she lost sight
in vision about 20 months old and she
actually invented this system for
herself and complete fluency the in fact
the order even the order of acquisition
is remarkably similar so those of you
who had children or dealings with
children will be aware that there's
typically around 15 months of age
roughly their children interchange the
first and second person pronouns so they
refer to themselves as you and they
refer to their mother as I which is
understandable because the mother says I
refers to the kid is used so the kids
think those are names and then they get
over after a while well it turns out
signing children through exactly the
same thing at the same age and in that
case it's counter iconic they use the
same if they're used this you know the
use of this gesture say this gesture if
they're using it to point to him it's
him if they're using it in a linguistic
context it's me so it's counter iconic
but it goes through the same transition
and in fact just about everything that's
looked at suggests that language is
basically independent of sensory
modality any we can't use smell because
it's not differentiated enough but
anything that's sufficiently
differentiated you could use to
externalize whatever's going on in there
and there really are no known vide on
the kind of things I mentioned there
don't see the basic differences between
sign or even touch and spoken language
so it looks like as
that what emerged suddenly maybe 75
thousand years ago is some computational
mechanism that provided the basis for
creative use of language and thought and
if you look at the archaeological record
it pretty much corresponds to that
around that time roughly say 75,000
years you know plus or minus tens of
thousands doesn't mean much there is an
outburst of creative invention that much
more complex tools complex family
structures which you see in the
archaeological record marking of
astronomical events the beginnings of
symbolic art that's there's some
anthropologists call it the Great Leap
Forward sudden change which are usually
usually guessed as is connected to the
emergence of language art to imagine
what could be and after that it just
never changed and it does seem to be
sensory independent of sensory modality
so very likely that's the source of
human creativity well how could it have
happened I mean that may be one of those
mysteries that are in principle you can
imagine evidence like you could have
tape recorders from 75,000 years ago we
don't have the kind of evidence that's
available may not suffice to provide
answers to the question of what happened
in fact if there are going to be answers
I suspect they'll come from the brain
sciences just the brain sciences are way
short of reaching this point but someday
they might get to the point where you
could identify the kinds of neural
configurations that entered into some
slight rewiring of the brain that
yielded these infinite capacities that
