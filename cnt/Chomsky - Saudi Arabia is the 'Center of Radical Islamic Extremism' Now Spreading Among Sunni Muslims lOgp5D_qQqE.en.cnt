the war and peace report we're on the
road in Chicago Illinois I'm Amy Goodman
as we continue part two of our
conversation with world renowned
political dissident linguist author Noam
Chomsky Institute professor emeritus at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology where's tort for more than
half a century his latest book who rules
the world I asked him to talk about
Saudi Arabia's role in the Middle East
well there's a long history of the
basement we don't have a lot of time but
the basic story is that the United
States like Britain before it has tended
to support radical Islamism against
secular nationalism that's been a
consistent theme of Imperial strategy
for a long time Saudi Arabia is the
center of radical Islamic extremism
Patrick Coburn one of the best
commentators and most knowledgeable
commentators as correctly pointed out
that what he calls the Wahabis ation of
Sunni Islam the spread of Saudi
extremists will have a doctrine over
Sunni Islam the Sunni world is one of
the real disasters of modern of the
modern era it's a source of not only
funding for extremist radical Islam and
the jadi outgrowth of it but also
doctrinally mosques clerics and so on
schools and madrasahs we study just run
the spreading all over the huge Sunni
areas from Saudi influence and it
continues its it know Saudi Arabia
itself as one of the most grotesque the
human rights records in the world of the
Isis beheadings which shocked everyone
I think Saudi Arabia is the only country
where you have regular beheadings that's
the least of it women I don't know we
can't drive so on and so forth and it is
strongly backed by the United States and
its allies Britain and France
reason it's got a lot of oil it's got a
lot of money you can sell them a lot of
arms and I think tens of billions of
dollars alarms and the actions that it's
carrying out for example in Yemen which
you mentioned or this car causing an
immense a humanitarian catastrophe in a
pretty poor country also stimulating
jihadi terrorism naturally with you u.s.
and also British British arms French are
trying to get into it as well this is a
very ugly story
Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia itself is it's
it's its economy its its economy is
based not only on a wasting resource but
a resource which is destroying the world
its trumpet there's reports now that
it's trying to take some steps to much
belated steps that have been 50 years
ago to try to diversify the economy it
does have resources that are not
destructive like sunlight for example
which could be used and is to an extent
being used for solar power but it's way
too late and probably can't be done but
it's it's a it has been a serious source
of major global problems horrible
society in itself in many ways and the
US and its allies and Britain before it
have stimulated these radical Islamist
developments throughout the throughout
the Islamic world for a long time do you
think Obama has dealt with Saudi Arabia
any differently than President Bush
before him not in any way that I can see
no maybe in nuances
