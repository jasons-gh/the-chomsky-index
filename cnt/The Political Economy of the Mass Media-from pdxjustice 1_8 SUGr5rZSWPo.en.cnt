hi well let me begin with two recent
events both of them widely publicized
the first has to do with the famous
Salman Rushdie case a couple of days ago
you may have noticed the prime minister
of Iran suggested a very simple way to
resolve the crisis concerning Rushdie he
said he suggested that what should
happen is that all the copies of his
book Satanic Verses should simply be
burned and I guess the implication is
that if that happened then they could
cancel the death sentence that's one
case lots of coverage the second case
had to do with an interesting thing that
happened here there was a what some
people are calling a mega merger of two
media giants time incorporated and
Warner Communications incorporated each
of them huge conglomerates and putting
coming together they formed apparently
the biggest world the world's biggest
media empire now that also had a lot of
publicity even outside the business
pages and there was concern over the
effects of the merger is by increasing
me concentration so effectively the
effects on freedom of expression well
these two events are they seem rather
remote from one another and in a sense
they are but we can draw them together
by recalling an event which was not
considered important enough to be
reported but which I happened to know
about because I was personally involved
the title for this talk is you may have
noticed manufacturing consent political
economy the mass media that's actually
the title of a recent book that I was
co-author of with my co-authors Edward
Herman and the two of us have been
working together for many years
we the first our first book was
published in 1974 book on American
foreign policy in the media and thing
and it was published by a publisher a
textbook publisher flourishing textbook
publisher which happened to be a
subsidiary of Warner Communications
incorporated well that's a very rare
person you never saw that book and the
reason was that when the advertising for
the book appeared after 20,000 copies
were published one of the executives of
Warner Communications saw the
advertising and didn't like the feel of
it and asked to see the book and liked
it even less in fact was appalled and
then followed a an interaction which I
won't bother describing but the end
result of it was that the parent company
Warner communication simply decided to
put the publisher out of business and to
end the whole story that way now they
didn't burn the books they helped them
and which is more civilized also books
don't burn very well actually I'm told
no they're kind of like bricks but
pulping works and it wasn't just our
book that was eliminated it was all the
books published by that publisher well
there's a couple of differences between
this and the case of the prime minister
of Iran one difference is that this was
actually done not just suggested the
second difference is it wasn't just one
look it was all books which happened to
be tainted by being published by the
publisher who had done this bad thing a
third difference is the reaction the
reaction in the case of the Warner
Communications putting a publisher out
of business to prevent them from
publishing our book the reaction to that
was zero not because it wasn't known it
just was not considered of any
significance whereas the Rushdie affair
of course has had a huge furor as it
should and the Prime Minister's proposal
was greeted with ridicule and contempt
as a demonstration of what you can
expect from these barbarous people so
there are some differences well let's go
back to the question about the mega
merger would the will this new
Media Empire restrict freedom of
expression by excessive media
concentration possibly but the marginal
difference is slight given what already
exists as perhaps illustrated by this
case this is instantly not the only case
far from the only case which illustrates
how hypocritical and the cynical the
reaction to the Rushdie affair is the
reaction is legitimate but we can ask
the question whether it's principled or
not and if we look I think we find that
it's not well actually this whole story
that I've just told is kind of
misleading it's accurate in identifying
the locus of decision-making power not
only in publishing and in the media but
in political life and in social life
generally in that respect it's accurate
but it's very misleading with regard to
how that power is typically exercised
this is a very unusual case I wouldn't
want to suggest that this is what
happens typically it's usually much more
subtle than this but no less effective
and now I'm going to come back to some
of the more subtle ways and the reasons
for them and in fact if there's time or
maybe back in discussion I'll talk about
the aftermath of this particular
incident which is also kind of
illuminating in this respect though more
complex well with that much as
background let me turn to the main topic
manufacturing consent a strange a topic
and thought control and indoctrination
and so on now there's a and and I'm
going to discuss how this relates to
thee to the media now there is a
standard view about the medium and the
way they function the standard view is
expressed for example by Supreme Court
justice Powell when he describes what he
calls the crucial role of the media in
effecting the societal purpose of the
First Amendment that is enabling the
public to assert meaningful control over
the political process so the idea is
this is kind of an instrumental defense
of the First Amendment the value to be
achieved is the democratic process and
for the democratic process to function
it's necessary for the public to have
free access open access to relevant
information and opinion and a wide range
of opinion and it's a job the media to
ensure that and the First Amendment has
the instrumental function of
guaranteeing that this is served in the
media then do it that's the standard
view and notice it has a kind of a
descriptive component and also a
normative component it says is what the
media ought to be like and this is what
they are like now that they ought to be
this way seems sort of obvious in fact
kind of almost tautological if democracy
means has something to do with the
public having a capacity to shape their
own affairs
it obviously presupposes information and
that means the information system and
free society would have to serve this
function since it seems so obvious it's
worth bearing in mind that there is a
contrary view and in fact the contrary
view is very widely held in fact I
wouldn't be surprised if the contrary
view is the dominant view among people
over the last couple of centuries who
have thought about liberal democracy and
freedom and how to function in any event
it's certainly a major position this
contrary view can be traced back to the
origins of modern democracy in the 17th
century English Revolution when for the
first time the there was a challenge to
the right of authority whether it was
the gentry or the king or whatever and
there was actually the beginnings of a
real radical Democratic movement with a
commitment on the part of the people
involved were very widespread in England
- public involvement and control over
affairs they didn't want to be ruled by
the king and they didn't want to be
ruled by Parliament they wanted to run
their own affairs and they were defeated
the Radical Democrats were defeated but
not before doing some important things
which had a lasting effect
well what I'm interested now is the
reaction to this the reaction to the
first efforts at popular democracy
radical democracy you might call it were
a good deal of fear and concern one
historian of the time
Walker warned that these guys who were
running putting out pamphlets on their
little printing presses and distributing
them and agitating in the army and you
know telling people how the system
really worked we're having an extremely
dangerous effect they were revealing the
mysteries of government and he said
that's dangerous
