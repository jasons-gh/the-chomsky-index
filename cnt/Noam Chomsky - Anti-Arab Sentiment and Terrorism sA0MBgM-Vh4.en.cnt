they're pretty wild nobody doesn't seem
to bother anybody but I I would guess if
a professor at Harvard for example were
to describe Jews as people who remember
the exact words people who bleed and
read and advertise their misery you know
people might think that that's not the
right kind of thing for a Harvard
professor to say about Jews saying let's
not listen to these guys wail anymore
they're just people who bleed and
breathe and advertise their misery but
when a Harvard professor says that about
Arabs that's considered fine if a
leading kind of hero of the left said
that New York has New York City is
uninhabited because it's got too many
blacks and Spanish and not enough whites
it's depopulate it's under populated
suppose somebody said New York that's
the word
New York's under populated this small
number of white Christians but a lot of
blacks and all those people and we got
to do something to overcome the under
population of New York I think people
would think of something funny about
that but when you know a hero of the
left talks about the under populated
Galilee meaning too few Jews and too
many Arabs
nobody thinks anything about that or
when the editor of a leading liberal
Journal says Arabs lie you know that's
in their nature so therefore you don't
even believe what they say it's part of
their culture well you said that about
Jews
he wouldn't last very long if a
well-known writer described I talked
about Jews and other third world the
treatise no rubbish you've noticed it
but not when it's Palestinians other
third world decreed and on and on
furthermore it's just you know it's like
every report in the newspapers it's got
this when Lebanon is bomb every couple
of days you'll notice a little item
somewhere saying you know it's really
troops killed seven people in Lebanon
it's not considered an issue on the
other hand that seven people that she
was got killed in Israel or seven
Americans got killed in New York by
terrify a foreign terrorist action it
would be considered something actually
give you another it's not strictly what
you're talking about but pretty close
the last terrorist bombing in Jerusalem
weeks ago the big terrorist bombing real
atrocity in Jerusalem the same day and
it was a big front-page story you know
agonizing pictures of people suffering
and so I was yeah that's the way should
treat a terrorist bombing same day four
bombs went off in Havana same day okay
very similar touristic places just like
the one in Israel four bombs went off in
Havana in tourist places Italian
fortunately not too many people were
killed but an Italian visitor was killed
as throat this jugular vein was cut by
flying glass it made the New York Times
underworld news briefs a couple of lines
underworld news briefs well then if you
follow the story along the two stories
along it's pretty dramatic and the
proposal with regard to Israel the
supported by the United States ok
brought it let me read the actual words
so I don't make it up I think I'd wrote
it yeah here's what it was
when albright was there the proposal
supported by the United States is that
all Palestinian militant groups with a
problem you know should would have to be
outlawed and there have to be
administrative legal and police action
against military political civilian
religious economic infrastructure
welfare societies mosques educational
institutions health centers banks
investment companies and etcetera which
support terror okay so in other words
Israel's close to in the Institute of
real terrorist regime against anybody
who might be regarded as in some fashion
or other supporting terror and the u.s.
supports that nobody does anything wrong
about it I take that same phrase and put
Miami in instead of Israel okay any any
any humanitarian group or a welfare
group or a bank or anyone else who
supports terror in Cuba has to be
outlawed without trial administered no
no sentencing you know it's toss them in
jail break up the group how far would
that go well it makes a lot of sense I
mean there the bombings in Havana are
whether they were carried out five we
don't know but they were certainly
supported publicly by groups who
continually call for terror and are
right sitting there and Miami know all
around Florida and thing they're not
only tolerated they're loved like you
know Clinton goes and hugs them and
kisses them and asked for their money
and so on and so forth and furthermore
they've been carrying on this terror
since 1959 like it's not just the
bombing that they you know of the day
the same haven't happened to be the same
day as the Jerusalem bombing so you can
sort of compare the a drones but in this
case it's been going on since 1959 from
US territory with US government support
and in fact with you would direct US
government participation
so if involvement you know if her own
say degree of involvement in an act of
terror was even a factor in making
something newsworthy the stories would
have been reversed
it's the Miami it's the Havana bombings
which would have been a front page in
there versus Jerusalem bombings would
have been underworld news briefs but it
was the other way around partly it's
racism but partly it's just that when we
do it it's not terror it's when we do it
it's fine when they do it it's terror
that's the definition of terror this is
an extremely dramatic case and there are
many cases like that let me just give
you one last one which is again dramatic
because of the coincidence you're in
theme everybody knows about the opponent
City bombing okay so here's this
horrible bombing you know truck bomb
goes off fuels lots of people if you
recall when the bombing took place the
first thought was it probably had a
Middle Eastern connection so there was
all sorts of talk about how I mean some
people say we had to just bomb the
Middle East right away like Rosenthal
and The Times just bomb bomb the bastard
others said well if we find any Middle
East connection we're gonna bomb you
know bomb and Clinton got up and said
we'll pursue them to the end of the
earth and so on and so forth there were
big headlines about how Oklahoma City
looks like Beirut remember that big
bombs going off and blowing people up
just horrible come here is Beirut coming
to Middle America and great are about
that okay turned out there wasn't the
Middle East connection there were people
like Rosenthal said let's bomb them
anyway but
well it's exactly ten years before the
Oklahoma City bombing we kind of like
anniversaries so exactly ten years
before almost of the day a bombing did
take place in Beirut it's one of the
reasons why Oklahoma City looked like
Beirut a virtually identical mommy bomb
when a car bomb went off right outside
of a mosque a time in order to kill the
maximum number of people at a time when
they were leaving the mosque killed
mostly women and children lots and lots
of women children killed you know babies
torn to shreds in their beds I mean the
whole story
in fact the Oklahoma City bombing was
virtual duplicate know if we're gonna
trace the attackers to the end of the
earth we can easily get those guys that
is assuming that the US Air Force has
the capacity to bomb Texas and
California and maybe a bomb or two left
over for London because that bombing was
carried out by the CIA with the
assistance of British intelligence
aiming at a Muslim cleric Lola who they
missed but they killed plenty other
people instead so there's a perfect
parallel not just out of curiosity I
brought personally brought that the
attention of a fair number of
journalists they can't even see the
point no couldn't understand what I was
talking about they could not understand
why that's even a parallel I mean in one
case it's a bomb maybe Middle Eastern
origin that's what they thought going
off in Oklahoma City so we're gonna
really you know bomb all over the place
and the other case was a bomb that we
dropped we put in front of a mosque to
kill as many people as we could and
Beirut so that's not an act of terror
you know and that conception is so
deeply ingrained in the psyche that
people can't see the point and you can
go on and on I don't know if you call
this racism right now I mean it somehow
it's beyond racism you know but it
incorporates racism as a special case
they were just living eat what the heck
