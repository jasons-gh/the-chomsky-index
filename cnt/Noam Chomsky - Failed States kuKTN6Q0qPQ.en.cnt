dates recently the MIT linguistics
professor addressed the cadets at West
Point this is an hour
murmurs and Friends of the West Point
community in particular
Colonel Karen Colonel Zupan colleagues
in the trenches who teach philosophy
2:01 and the nearly 500 cadets now
taking this course good evening to all
and welcome I'm Robert Tully professor
of philosophy at the academy our guest
speaker tonight a man of extraordinary
accomplishment is Noam Chomsky Institute
professor of linguistics and philosophy
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology his reputation precedes him
here by leaps and bounds just six months
ago the British Journal of current
affairs Prospekt conducted a poll among
its more than 20,000 readers to identify
today's leading global public
intellectual in the list of a hundred
such figures professor Chomsky came
first drawing more than twice the votes
received by the runner-up Umberto Eco in
the eyes of this journal professor
Chomsky belongs to thee as they said the
age of the great oppositional thinker
opposition has indeed been a consistent
feature of Professor Chomsky's public
life since the 1960's he has been a
determined and acerbic critic of
American foreign policy he has denounced
politicians of both parties for hubris
and blindness and condemned American
Society for tolerating the grip of big
business on politics and the pervasive
influence of mass media if he has been
given more to condemnation than to
praise that may well be the world's
fault not his professor Chomsky has
launched his attacks in newspapers
journals and magazines on radio and
television and in public forums
pronouncing on the major issues of the
day from Vietnam to Central America the
Middle East the war on terror and of
course Iraq his articles and essays on
political topics alone number more than
200 that at least is where I gave up
counting in addition there are hers more
than 50 books on political matters
beginning in 1969 with American pow
and the new mandarins and continuing to
the present with the recently published
failed States however this amazing
productivity constitutes only half the
picture seem seemingly to people fill
the shoes of one Noam Chomsky his
protests and denunciations will
eventually recede from public view but
posterity will certainly always remember
Noam Chomsky as the single thinker the
non global non public intellectual who
once revolutionized the science of
linguistics Chomsky's work in linguistic
burst upon the scene in the late 1950s
and was steadily consolidated in a vast
number of articles and more than 30
books he gave linguistics a new starting
point Chomsky set out to answer a
fundamental question what makes possible
the endowment of human language itself
what lies beneath the enormous variety
of spoken languages he theorized that
our familiar languages derive from an
underlying universal grammar a set of
operational rules in which native
children already possess sufficient
skill to enable them unthinkingly to
become speakers of their parents
language in just a few years whether
this underlying grammar is a function of
the mind or of the brain was of
secondary concern to Chomsky as a
linguist to gain to codify and give
formal shape to the rules by which the
language learner naturally operates this
is science in an abstract but profound
sense the new direction that Chomsky
gave to linguistics made his project
comparable to the work done by Whitehead
and Russell a half-century earlier who
aspired to base both formal logic and
number theory on a set of first
principles his achievement on behalf of
linguistics was also in the spirit of
two great European rationalists the
philosophers Descartes and Kant who had
sought in their own ways and for
different purposes to find Anchorage for
our experience of the world in the
workings of an objective human reason to
selves then the public controversy list
and the academic scientist two voices
but one Noam Chomsky
two such divergent interests have a
foundation is there an underlying unity
to the voices I think the answer can be
found in the same European tradition
from which also comes the view that the
moral will is the essential component of
human reason according to the
rationalist we recognize the rightness
or wrongness of human actions just as we
Intuit
the necessary truth of some propositions
our ethical judgments express the
workings of the moral law and a
sharpened insight compels us to take an
ethical stand if we have the courage the
rationalist with courage reject
self-deception and the dominance of
feeling the chief concern is with what
it is right to do not with weather
consequences make the action right above
all the rationalist upholds a universal
perspective that treats people as ends
rather than as means actions contrary to
this perspective deserve to be exposed
and criticized all the more so if they
are the actions of governments that
abuse their nearly absolute power for
the sake of self-interest Noam Chomsky
is a passionate rationalist yet his
endeavor has not been to advance a novel
theory of ethics the moral certainties
that compel him to speak are not
theoretical they are the stuff of
everyday moral intuitions simple and
easily recognized but in need of a voice
how these certainties are applied is the
stuff of controversy but the dust of
political and social debate all too
easily obscures the strong moral
convictions that underlie them I do not
apologize for these lengthy remarks
about professor Chomsky it cannot be
said that a person of such remarkable
complexity needs no introduction to use
a warrant phrase he has come to speak to
us tonight about some aspects of Just
War theory after which he will want to
engage the students the cadets of
philosophy 2:01 in discussion and
priority in the question and answer
period will be given to the cadets let
this discussion be what all
philosophical debate aims to be
objective open respectful fair well
argued in one word
rational please join me now in welcoming
our guest professor Noam Chomsky
Thanks
I think a useful place to start might be
with a recent academic study by an
Oxford professor of traditions of war
which contrasts two leading paradigms in
the study of Just War what the author
calls the brodien and Republican
interpretations first pair paradigm
traces back to Hugo Grotius famous 17th
century humanists who founded the
dominant framework of thinking on laws
of war within this paradigm the law of
war is an act of States and just war
proposals are means to humanize to
introduce Humanity in warfare
it's one tradition the contrasting
Republican paradigm traces back to
Rousseau and the uprising against
monarchy in feudalism in the late 18th
century including the American
Revolution this paradigm blends war with
justice with liberty equality individual
and community rights whatever else may
fall within our concept of justice well
these positions are of course
idealization x' the real world is more
complex
the formal implementation of efforts to
introduce humanity into warfare do not
simply disregard the questions of
justice but they do put them to the
margins they're not central to the
codification of the principles of world
order and practice with single exception
of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights which has a pretty tattered
history well despite real-world
complexities the differences between
these two approaches
- just war I think deserve attention in
considering both the issues that are
addressed and those that are ignored we
might ask whether that itself is just
there are at least three major sources
of insight into the concepts of Just War
the first is the scholarly literature
the second is the underlying notions of
human nature that underlie our moral
judgments and the third is the
International codifications so I'd like
to say a few words about each of these
topics I think it may help to indicate
in advance where I'm heading in brief my
own conclusions are that the literature
merits careful attention but is
ultimately not very instructive about
just war secondly that the notions of
human nature should be at the heart of
the discussion although serious inquiry
into this is still in its early stages
and third that the codifications
are seem to me sensible but actions in
the real world
all too often reinforce famous maxim of
Tacitus that the strong do as they can
while the weak do as they must so let's
start with some remarks on some of the
current literature on Just War one of
the most recent studies is Michael
Walters book arguing about war which
merits particular intention and not only
because of the high praise it's received
but also because Walter is responsible
for the largely responsible for the
recent revival of Just War Theory the
strengths I think the book reveals both
the strengths and the weaknesses of Just
War Theory the strengths are that many
of the conclusion seem plausible enough
at least to me
but particularly those conclusions that
pretty much reiterate standard
codifications the weakness is that
despite the book's title arguing about
war it's very hard to find an argument
you might try that as an experiment and
more accurately well arguments are
sometimes detectable they rely
personally on such premises as seems to
me entirely justified or I believe or no
doubt and there's almost no effort to
bring in relevant background information
and evidence
Walter gives to paradigm examples which
in which case he simply asserts that the
wars are just in fact so obviously just
that argument is unnecessary the two
examples are Afghanistan and Kosovo
he describes the invasion of Afghanistan
as a triumph of Just War theory which
stands alongside the bombing of Serbia
in 1999 as a nun controversial case of
Just War no argument is felt to be
necessary although in either case it
doesn't take much effort to think of
possible evidence that might bear on the
pronouncement that these are triumphs of
Just War theory and these are
considerations that would certainly be
brought by brought up by just were
theorists if the responsibility for the
military actions lay elsewhere well for
lack of time I'll skip illustrations but
can come back to them if you'd like to
be clear I'm not asking whether the
bombings of Afghanistan and Serbia were
right or wrong maybe they were maybe
they weren't I'm asking a different
question namely what does Just War
Theory have to say about it and I think
if you look closely you'll find yet that
the answer is that it has nothing to say
about we're left with assertions of the
authors that state violence was
justified
uncontroversially so and any
consequences whether anticipate or not
are entirely no doubt the fault of the
official enemy well another reason and
also highly regarded inquiry into Just
War theory is by moral political
philosopher Jean Elka Elstein the
paradigm of Just War she writes is the
bombing of Afghanistan and she adds that
nearly everyone with the exception of
absolute pacifists and a few lunatics
agree that the bombing of Afghanistan
was clearly a just war argument ended in
reality
nearly everyone excludes substantial
categories of people of the majority of
the world's population for example even
in Europe far more so in Latin America
and also leading Afghans who had been
fighting the Taliban and including u.s.
favorites and virtually all aid agencies
working there but what's relevant is
that this constitutes the sole argument
to establish that the war was just in
fact
uncontroversially so the facts are
irrelevant and their argument is needed
well Elston does provide criteria for
just war so we at least have the
rudiments of a theory four criteria I'll
read them first criterion the war must
be openly declared or otherwise what
otherwise authorized by a legitimate
Authority second it must begin with the
right intentions third forces justified
if it protects the innocent from certain
harm as when a country has certain
knowledge that genocide will commence on
a certain date fourth it must be a last
resort after other possibilities for the
redress and defense of the values at
stake have been explored well
the first two conditions are vacuous
declaration of war by an aggressor
confers no support whatsoever for a
claim of just war and even the worst
criminals claim right intentions the
third and fourth conditions sound
unreasonable but they have no relevance
at all clearly to the case of
Afghanistan
so therefore else teens perish paradigm
example collapses entirely under her own
criteria he had just one word on the
classic modern work Michael Walters just
and unjust wars which I believe you've
been reading my personal judgement is
that his conclusions are generally very
reasonable also pretty much in accord
with the conventional reading of the
United Nations Charter but what's
relevant here is that the conclusions
just about invariably rely crucially on
the ubiquitous phrase it seems to me and
so on and you might test so just as an
illustration take what he regards as the
hardest question in his words that is
the British bombing of urban centers in
Germany up to the end of the war
Walter concludes that such bombing
quoting him after the immediate threat
posed by Hitler's early victories had
passed was entirely indefensible maybe
so but if you check you'll find there's
no argument apart from the statement
that the policy seems cruel I think it
does seems cruel to me at least about
what does Just War Theory have to say
where does it enter into the argument
and why are relevant facts disregarded
there are after all relevant facts well
the character the theory is revealed
further
we look at the examples that Walter is
it's about a half-dozen examples which
are just listed no argument or
discussion to show the to show that Just
War theory applies leaving in his words
no doubts the examples are mostly
unconscious although one might we'll ask
why some of these examples are chosen
but not others for example the Russian
invasion of Czechoslovakia is given as a
case where there's no doubt but not
given is the Israeli invasion of Lebanon
which I suppose had about a hundred
times as many casualties and many more
during the 22 years of occupation of
Lebanon of southern Lebanon in defiance
of Security Council orders so maybe
there's a reason maybe there isn't but
whatever it is it's not given that's all
examples except one now the last example
of a case where Just War theory applies
leaving no doubt is the Egyptian
challenged Israel in 1967 that's the
sole example in the long period covered
we're just were theory allegedly
demonstrates that a preemptive strike
was just beyond all doubt well maybe the
selection of cases and the conclusions
are correct and maybe they're not but
what's relevant here is the Just War
Theory plays little if any role in the
argument which reduces pretty much two
declarations of personal preference well
I won't go on but these are to my
knowledge fairly representative
selections from the most highly regarded
literature and I think it's fair to
conclude more generally that we learned
very little about Just War from Just War
Theory although we do learn something
about the prevailing intellectual moral
climate in which the theory is
and honored well it's not turn to the
second source of potential insight
second source of potential insight into
just war theory that is their intuitive
moral judgments well here we are turning
to what was traditionally called moral
philosophy I think it's more aptly
described as moral psychology in modern
terms it's after the divorce of science
and philosophy in the mid 19th century a
century before that David Hume had done
his classic work on what he called the
Springs and origins of human nature
human recognition
are grounded in what he called a species
of natural instincts part of their
inherent mental nature he recognized
also that something similar must be true
in the domain of moral judgment his
reason was that our moral judgments are
unbounded in scope we are constantly
applying them in systematic ways to new
circumstances in a manner that's
intelligible to others hence they too
must be founded on general principles
that are part of our nature
although beyond what he called our
original instincts meaning the narrow
our instincts that we share with animals
well that insight which i think is
accurate should lead directly to efforts
to develop something like a grammar of
moral judgment that's an enterprise very
much like the inquiry into the
principles that are encoded somehow in
our brains that permit us to do what you
and you and I are now doing and more
broadly to produce and understand
linguistic expressions over an unbounded
range and use them in a way which is
appropriate to circumstances and
intelligible to others even though they
may be quite new
in our own history or unexperienced in
fact all of history well as was
recognized a century before Hume these
principles must be universal
hence grounded in our nature and the
basis for acquisition of any particular
language today we would say that the
principles of language and moral
judgment are part of our genetic
endowment part of human biology in both
cases they're culturally specific and
universal aspects both the case of
internal faculties of language and moral
judgment these things can be studied
they're part of science in fact studied
in rather similar ways inquiry into the
moral faculty in these terms was
undertaken by the leading American moral
and political philosopher of late 20th
century John Rawls who relied explicitly
on the analogy of two linguistic
theories that were being developed in
the 1960s at the time that he was
writing his classic work theory of
justice Rawls in fact put this aspect of
his work aside under severe criticism by
moral philosophers turned to core issues
for him the criticisms were reexamined
and I think adequately refuted in a
doctoral dissertation a few years ago by
John Mikhail who is now a law professor
at Georgetown forthcoming book of his
based on the dissertation develops this
and also presents empirical
investigation of moral judgments in
puzzling thought experiments that have
been designed by moral philosophers this
experimental work reveals that
intuitions and these quite puzzling
cases are typically instantaneous and
reflexive in adults and children with
systemic changes through early childhood
development much as in other aspects of
development
he then goes on to develop a theoretical
explanation in terms of fixed principles
that can be regarded as a development of
roles theory of justice and the much
earlier work of Hume and other classical
writers on our natural instincts there's
another book soon to come out by Harvard
primatologist and cognitive scientist
mark Hauser carrying such enquiries
further includes comparative studies and
more general ideas about what he calls
the moral organ analogous to the
language organ other sub components of
the cognitive systems that are a core
part of our biological nature well in
recent years these topics have become a
lively field of theoretical and
empirical inquiry the for many points of
view incidentally is these a study of
principles that underlie intuitive
conceptions of justice and rights and
their cultural variety their limited
cultural variety and their universal
properties that could someday provide
foundations for a more substantive
theory of just war but it remains
largely a task for the future though
it's underway and interesting and
interesting ways well finally a couple
of words on the codification of these
intuitive judgments in the past century
I'll keep through the period after World
War two although the earlier conventions
have very clear and significant
contemporary relevance a conventions of
1907 for example can come back to that
if you like the post Second World War
codification of the laws of war that
consists primarily of the UN Charter the
Geneva Conventions and the Nuremberg
principles later adopted by the General
Assembly well as you know I'm sure the
Charter bars the threat or use of force
except in two instances if authorized by
the Security Council of the United
Nations or under Article 51 of the
Charter in self-defense against armed
attack until the Security Council acts
the phrase armed attack is
conventionally interpreted in terms of
Daniel Webster's principle which extends
armed attack to cases where in his words
the necessity for action is urgent his
instant overwhelming and leaving no
choice of means and no moment of
deliberation any other resort the force
is a war crime
in fact the supreme international crime
encompassing all the evil that follows
and the words of the Nuremberg Tribunal
I was high level UN panel meeting and
issued its report in December 2004
included among others former National
Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft it
concluded that article 51 needs neither
extension or a restriction of its long
understood scope it should be neither
rewritten nor reinterpreted last
September the UN World Summit reaffirmed
quoting that the relevant provisions of
the Charter are sufficient to address
the full range of threats to
international peace and security
these summit and further endorsed the
responsibility to commit ourselves to
helping States build capacity to protect
their populations from genocide war
crimes ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity and to assisting those
which are under stress before crises and
conflicts breakout the summit granted no
new right of intervention to individual
states or regional alliances whether
under humanitarian or other professed
grounds and it established
a responsibility to protect the contrary
- it was widely alleged in news reports
and commentary the high-level panel of
December 2004 had reached the same
conclusion in words that were
specifically directed at international
and intellectual opinion and state
practice in the West in recent years its
words were these for those impatient
with declaring article 51 to be
appropriate as formulated the answer
must be that in a world full of
perceived potential threats the risk to
the global order and the norm of
non-intervention on which it continues
to be based is simply too great for the
legality of unilateral preventive action
as distinct from collectively endorsed
action to be accepted allowing one to so
act is to allow all allowing one to so
act as to allow all now here the panel
is presupposing the principle of
universality namely that we apply to
ourselves the same standards we do to
others if not more stringent ones that's
perhaps the most elementary of moral
truisms and it's the foundation of Just
War theory if that theory is to be taken
at all seriously the principle however
is flatly rejected in the elite
intellectual moral and political culture
of the most powerful states and is
explicitly rejected by official doctrine
that includes the expositors and
advocates of Just War Theory also
includes a substantial legal literature
it's pretty easy Dell illustrate there's
plenty of material and print about it
well in this and we can draw some
conclusions from that in this connection
and by saying that it's worth
remembering some eloquent words
on the principle of universality
foundation of Just War theory in any
serious moral theory the comments by
Justice Robert Jackson he was the chief
of counsel for the prosecution at
Nuremberg he informed the tribunal that
if certain acts of violation of treaties
or crimes they are crimes whether the
United States does them or whether
Germany does them and we are not
prepared to lay down a rule of criminal
conduct conduct against others which we
would not be willing to have invoked
against us we must never forget that the
record on which we judge these
defendants is the record on which
history will judge us tomorrow to pass
these defendants a poison chalice is to
put it to around own lips as well the
supreme international crime for which
the defendants were hanged at Nuremberg
was defined clearly enough by Justice
Jackson at Nuremberg he proposed to the
tribunal that an aggressor is a state
that is the first to carry out invasion
of its Armed Forces with or without a
declaration of war of the territory of
another state illustrations of that too
are easy enough to find and others are
on the horizon it's again noteworthy
that these considerations are virtually
excluded from the dominant intellectual
and moral culture in the West rather
generally although we have no difficulty
at all and applying them to official
enemies
well once again there's nothing special
about our own country in this respect
except that it's more powerful than
others such evasions
with regard to the acts of one's own
state are close to universal they
disfigure intellectual history as far
back as you go to the maximum of Tacitus
that i quoted we may add an observation
by President John Adams
always thinks it has a great soul and
vast views beyond the comprehension of
the week I think that's another
near-universal again all too easy to
illustrate from the traditional practice
of governments and the educated classes
within them well to return to the
beginning what can one learn from Just
War theory my feeling is that from the
literature on Just War we learn mostly
about the prevailing moral and
intellectual climate in which we live
scientific inquiry into moral psychology
and its roots in our nature may someday
provide important insights but practice
cannot wait for that day any more than
engineering has waited for physics or
medicine for biology for centuries in
these cases which are much simpler ones
and much more accessible to inquiry than
human nature thirdly the codification of
laws of war has over time had a notable
civilizing effect but the gap between
professed ideals and actual practice is
much too large to be tolerated in my
opinion thanks
your chance to talk repeat that
questioners won't be filmed so you can
feel free to talk
sir I was just wondering if you believe
that the United States of America has a
responsibility to intervene in cases
where just war says that it is justified
to intervene do I think that there's a
responsibility to intervene in cases
we're just were theory concludes that it
is correct to intervene at the question
personally I agree with the UN Charter
the high-level UN panel of December 2004
and the UN World Summit which I quoted
but I can't really answer the question
because as far as I can determine you
can tell me if I'm wrong Just War Theory
never tells you anything it doesn't tell
you when it's proper to intervene what
it tells you is I think it's proper to
intervene well you know I I may also
think so but there's a big gap between
assertion and argument between surmise
and evidence so if you can tell me where
Just War Theory entails that we ought to
intervene we can consider the question
but until that's done we can't really
consider the question
sir I was wondering yes sir I was
wondering do you believe that it would
have been right to reassess article 51
of the UN Charter and you would believe
that by not reassessing and not
rewriting it it loses relevancy I'm
sorry I didn't get it by by say it again
by not reassessing it rewriting it loses
it has been reassessed repeatedly for
example by the high-level UN panel of
December to that issue does report on
2004 with many distinguished
participants I mentioned Brent Scowcroft
but there are others yes that's exactly
what they did they reassessed the UN
Charter and their conclusion is what I
read the UN World Summit last September
again reassess the UN Charter and that's
what it concluded maybe there should be
a further reassessment that's fine then
let's undertake it and let's consider
their arguments or other arguments but
we can't say that it hasn't been
reassessed and what we can say that we
haven't paid any attention to it well
that's possible in fact true but it
certainly has been reassessed by very
respectable and leading figures and
their conclusions in my opinion at least
are pretty justified however to get back
to the main topic I don't think just
were tell theory tells us anything about
that when we judge these things we're
judging them on another basis on the
basis of actual evidence about what
happens in particular cases in terms of
our fundamental moral principles which
we should try to explicate and apply
like the principle of universality
that's the way we should reassess it
also we should I think think seriously
about the statement that I quoted of the
December 2004 panel that was directed to
people like us it was directed to
intellectual opinion in the West and can
read it again
what they said is the foundations of
world order based on the principle of
non-intervention and the affairs of
others not forceful intervention is too
important and too fragile to be
destroyed or the consequences will be
terrible because for one to act is to
grant the authority to all at least if
we believe in elementary moral
principles that's a heavy burden to bear
maybe we can come up with a different
conclusion in some cases actually
personally I think we can but it has to
be argued cerca de Greco he said that
it's possible that article 51 needs to
be reassessed but you mentioned earlier
when you were referencing Walters book
that he said that the Israeli preemptive
strike was just or that he said the
Israeli preemptive strike was justified
stated that his arguments did not really
have justification by his theory however
in the case of the preemptive strike he
does say that there are several
criterion that are necessary for the
Israeli attack to be justified
specifically the fact that the Egyptian
army was standing at a state of
readiness that the Israeli army was
incapable of holding so under article 51
even though Egypt had not yet invaded
Israel that they they were not at war
however what Egypt was doing tactically
put Israel at a severe disadvantage so
under our modern definition of war it
seems to me that that ought to be it
seems to me it seems logical that it
ought to be called an act of war what
Egypt was doing putting Israel at such a
disadvantage so doesn't article 51
definitely need some reason article 51
clearly does not apply
I reckon we can argue that we can argue
that it was justified but we can't say
that article 51 justifies it not under
Daniel Webster's characterization or any
other one that's accepted by the
international community we might argue
and here's where I think you could make
an argument that if you consider the
range of issues that arose at the time
the pre-emptive strike was justified
maybe one can give such an argument but
the point is that no argument is given
to that effect
none of the relevant facts are
considered and this is regarded as one
of the half dozen cases where Just War
Theory entails that the use of military
force was legitimate Just War Theory
doesn't entail that women tell anything
it what it tells you is well I Michael
Walzer believe this was justified but
without giving any reasons and without
looking into the background if you look
into the background it's a lot more
complex than that a lot of literature
and scholarship on it the u.s. did not
agree there were all sorts of
possibilities you could have taken I
mean I don't want to if you want to run
through the background but it's quite
intricate and complex going back to the
question of free passage from the
Straits of Tiran and whether that should
be brought to the World Court which the
US and Israel refused to do and he
insisted on involves Israeli strikes
against Syrian targets all sorts of
things so yes there's a complicated
background you could look at them you
could decide maybe that in the light of
these complex these complex
circumstances perhaps Israel is entitled
to make a preemptive strike but that's
not what's claimed what's claimed is
that without looking at any evidence
Just War Theory whatever it is it's not
easy to determine Just War theory
entails that this is one of the
half-dozen cases in the last century in
which the use of force was no doubt
legitimate and the only case in which
pre-emptive strike was legitimate we can
also raise the question of universality
I mean I don't believe and I'm sure you
don't believe that Iran has a right to
say carry out terrorist acts in the
United States right now but undoubtedly
it's under serious threat and
undoubtedly the threat is simply
overwhelming as compared with Iran's
capacities but with the outrageous to
suggest that of course and if it's
outrageous to suggest that why is it
legitimate in this case I mean for one
to act is to give the right to all and
we can give a whole lot of other
examples I mean let me give an even more
outrageous one okay not this except that
of course but just as an example nobody
I know of who's any sane that goes out
every December 7th and celebrates Pearl
Harbor Day however if we use these
arguments you can do it
Japan on December 7th attacked US
military bases in how to effectively to
US colonies territories claimed by the
u.s. Hawaii in Philippines Tech military
bases the Japanese were perfectly
capable of being of reading what was
being written in US public journals and
in fact US intelligence which it cracked
the Japanese codes know that they knew
about it and what was being written
going all the way up to the high
military command being reported by you
know political commentators in the New
York Times was that the United States
was that these seven teams were running
off the Boeing assembly line that
designs to be able to burn the to the
ground the what they were called the
antiques in which the Japanese lived
these wooden cities to the ground with
their b-17 attacks and furthermore b-17s
were being shipped from the Atlantic
where they were needed to pacific bases
in preparation for such attacks well you
know is that a threat that's a pretty
serious threat
that justified Pearl Harbor I mean not
in 10 million years but if that doesn't
why does why is this just effect
my birthday incidentally so I have a
special interest in that day sir I can't
see I'm sorry
cadet Hobson I just wanted to know if
you thought our operations in a war were
preempted or preventive and sorry I
couldn't hear the first point do you
think our operations in Iraq are
preventive or pre-emptive and do you
think that our operations in Iraq or
just or unjust
well there was interesting terminology
and then the administration presented it
and in fact the National Security
Council described they had that in mind
but more generally as pre-emptive work
but it certainly isn't preemptive work
by any stretch of the imagination more
accurately you could call it preventive
war okay you say we have to prevent a
potential attack against us personally I
don't see much justification for that
even if you accept that they believed
all the reports that Colin Powell was
giving it the UN Security Council and so
on even if we accept that all that was
believed it doesn't seem to me that a
preventive war in such a case is
legitimate and as you know the world
didn't think so either there were
international polls taken on this and
outside the United States and to a
limitless more limited extent England
you could barely find a country in the
world where support for it was above 10
percent in fact the only two exceptions
in the international polls that were
taken were India and Israel but both of
them had something different in mind
what they had in mind was their own
repression of occupied territories
Kashmir and the occupied territories
yeah they like the idea of preventive
war by the powerful but they weren't
talking about this how are the rest of
the world
almost non-existent you know 10% or less
was is it and again we have the same
question
if preventive war is legitimate under
those circumstances it's legitimate for
everybody okay that means it's
legitimate for Iran today I mean to take
another case it is simply undeniable
the US official document that the United
States has been carrying out a terrorist
war against Cuba since 1960 I mean at
first it was with direct participation
in more recent years is just with
tolerance but that it happened isn't
even questionable no John F Kennedy
assigned his brother Robert Kennedy the
task of running the terrorist war I was
to be his highest priority Robert
Kennedy's official more or less official
biographer historian Arthur Schlesinger
who was well-known historian it was a
Kennedy member of the Kennedy team a
latin-american adviser he writes that
Robert Kennedy's task was to bring the
terrors of the earth to Cuba and if you
look back at the record it was no joke
and it continues now still based on US
soil and the u.s. harbors happily
harbors terrorists who were involved in
it does that give Cuba the right to
carry out terrorist acts in the US to
prevent this did it ever give them the
right well I don't think so I'm sure you
don't think so but if preventive war is
legitimate why not and in fact there are
many other cases where it takes a
Lebanon in 1982 when Israel was
preparing the attack and in fact trying
desperately to conjure up an excuse for
the attack they were bombing Lebanon
hoping for some retaliation that could
be used as a pretext and that was a
serious attack killed probably maybe
20,000 people destroyed a large part of
southern Lebanon City
much of it did that give Lebanon the or
the Palestinians in Lebanon the right to
carry out the terrorist acts in Israel
prior to it to prevent the war well I
certainly don't think so I'm sure you
don't but if preventive is legitimate
under such ambiguous cases as Iraq why
isn't that legitimate so no I don't
think it was just I think it was
regression service paradigm when he
describes it he also describes three
revisions one of which being the human
rights provision saying that it is
justified to intervene if human rights
are being violated well do you have any
credence to the argument that Saddam
Hussein was in fact a tyrant that did
violate human rights no even though even
though there were other reasons given
for war such as WMT and additionally
aggressors walls are also describes
aggressors as also being Justin to go
against the war okay good a war against
and when when and did he ever lose his
status as an aggressor from the first
Gulf War
he lost his status as an aggressor when
he was driven out of Kuwait just as
Israel lost its status as an aggressor
went after 22 years it pulled out 11 but
I can give plenty of other examples
close to home but as for the human
rights violations they were horrendous
and here is one of the cases where it
really is important to look at facts
before you make decisions and we know
the facts and not secret so yes
Saddam Hussein carried out horrendous
human rights violations in fact he's on
trial for him right now but have a look
at the trial Saddam Hussein is on trial
for crimes that he committed in 1982
right killed he's charged with killing
probably accurately killing about 150
you're signing the death warrant
for 150 or so Shiites who were involved
in an uprising yeah that's a crime in
1982 happens to be an important year in
u.s. Iraqi relations this should be
headlines and a free press in my opinion
it was a very important year 1982 was
the year in which Ronald Reagan dropped
Iraq from the list of states supporting
terrorism so the US could starts
providing him with extensive aid
including military aid including means
to develop biological and chemical
weapons and missiles and weapons of men
and nuclear weapons he was dropped from
Donald Rumsfeld the next shortly after
went the firm up the agreement the next
charge against Saddam Hussein the ones
going to come along it's been announced
is a much more serious crime the
atrocities against the Kurds in 1997
1988 the unfold massacres object you
know they were terrible I'm Fela kill
100,000 people u.s. didn't object in
fact the Reagan administration blocked
efforts in Congress even to protest
against it furthermore the support for
Saddam increased and continued in fact
Saddam was given an extraordinary
privilege remarkable he was allowed he
got away with attacking a US naval
vessel and killing 37 soldiers I'm
seaman in 1987
that's pretty astonishing nobody can get
away with that but we were supporting
the Reagan administration was so
strongly in support of Saddam right
through the worst atrocities even let me
get away with that I mean in 1918 you'd
after the end of the war with Iran after
the worst atrocities in 1989 Iraqi and
nuclear engineers were invited to the
United States to take part in a
conference I was in Portland Oregon in
which they were a trained in how to
develop weapons of mass destruction 1989
furthermore George Bush number one told
us why it was being done they said we
to provide aid to Saddam because it's of
our responsibility to help us exporters
and because he contributes to stability
in the region
in fact that continued I mean thinking
after the invasion of Kuwait after he
was driven out of quake you know Iraq
was correctly bombed into rubble the US
had total control of the area there was
an uprising April March April 1991
Shiite uprising in the south probably
would have overthrown him
they were rebelling Iraqi generals good
chance he would have been overthrown the
Bush administration determined that they
would essentially permit Saddam the
crush it they used military helicopters
other armed equipment they don't have to
do that that led to a huge massacre and
it was described you know you can go
back and read the New York Times right
after that they said well you know it's
regrettable but there's a consensus
among the US and its allies meaning
Saudi Arabia and Britain there's a
consensus that I'm virtually quoting
that Saddam Hussein offers more hope for
the stability of the region than those
who are trying to overthrow him that's
1991 you know yeah this to do with
invasion nothing that's of Chomsky I'm
most regretful that I have to interrupt
the flow of your thought and your and
your a very interesting presentation
unfortunately we are constrained by
military time to end at this time and
but I am happy to say that the that the
occasion the opportunity for those of
you who did not have an opportunity to
ask your question here may come out in
the rotunda I certainly hope that will
there is a reception immediately to
follow but first sir
sear on behalf of the class of 2008 I
like to present you with this gift as a
small token of appreciation for speaking
with us tonight thank you sir
I usually leave gifts for my
grandchildren to open they get a big
kick out of it but I'll change the rules
this time I don't know if you can see it
but it's a wonderful picture
to find out more about Noam Chomsky and
his work
