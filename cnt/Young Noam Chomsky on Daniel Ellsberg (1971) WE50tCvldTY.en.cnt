well thank you mr. rusher now mr. Miller
it's time for your rebuttal well I'm
delighted to see you both embarrassed by
and having to defend President Johnson
in fact in fact the president whatever
the classification rules are can no more
release documents that injure the United
States than anyone else can and that's
what we're talking about because that's
what must be shown for the prosecution
of Daniel Ellsberg to proceed injury to
the United States and really the whole
thing is beyond belief because what
we've been told is the only injury that
existed is injury we can't tell you
about because it in fact the secret if
that is the basis on which Daniel
Ellsberg is being prosecuted then these
charges should have been dropped long
ago so talk to us not only about what
Daniel Ellsberg did but perhaps what he
had a duty to do I've asked to join us
tonight professor Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
the country was glad to see here Noam
Chomsky is professor of linguistics at
MIT and has been active in the peace
movement professor Chomsky why did
Daniel Ellsberg do what he did Dan
Ellsberg released to the American people
information historical information about
how a series of presidents and meshed
them in a vicious and costly war of
aggression he had every reason to
believe that this war was continuing and
would continue at the present incredible
level of violence and he hoped I hope
correctly that if this historical
information were brought to the American
people they would do something about it
and stop that war today in fact the may
he in fact have had a duty to disclose
the information I think he definitely
had a duty perhaps not a legal duty but
certainly a moral duty to bring to the
public evidence about criminal acts and
that's in effect what the Pentagon went
but what the Pentagon Papers reveal they
are a history of a criminal conspiracy
operating in secret to enmesh us in this
world aggression
we're told that one of the harms of
releasing the papers that we aren't told
exactly what is harm to ongoing
negotiations could that possibly be true
well I don't recourse I haven't seen the
full documents but I don't recall a
single instance in the documents that
deals with ongoing negotiations there is
material for very interesting material
about negotiations for example the
documents reveal in 1964 that there was
a concerted effort by the executive
branch of the government to avoid
negotiations negotiations which they
called premature because they knew that
if negotiate negotiations took place at
that time and if there were a peaceful
settlement then the client government
that they had instituted and were
maintaining by force in South Vietnam
could not maintain itself so therefore
they violated their legal obligation to
avoid the threat and use of force and to
pursue negotiations and other legal
means and they said no we have to AH
pact in such a ways to put off every
negotiation effort and we have to first
for example William Bundy on August 11th
1964 said we first have to make sure
they're hurting we first have to apply
the use of force and then maybe after
we've hurt them badly enough then we can
go to negotiations we've heard that Van
Ellsberg's disclosure of these dock you
may have an inhibiting effect on similar
confidential planning in the future is
that something we should be afraid of I
think that's I hope that it does have
have such an impact if there is planning
going on about engaging the United
States in criminal acts of aggression I
think that that information should be
brought to the American public or the
right people to know about it and the
right people to stop it thank you
professor Chomsky all right mr. Chomsky
just put your own views in the picture a
little bit and your book American power
and the new mandarins you say that
Americans should struggle to and I'm
quoting directly to remove the heavy
Yankee boot from the necks of oppressed
people throughout the world that's your
opinion absolutely this is your notion
of what the United States is doing
putting the heavy Yankee boot on the
necks of oppressed peoples around the
many many such case certainly and make
it understandable why you feel the way
you do would you favor prosecuting a
person who avoided the draft in protest
against the Vietnam War and certainly
not I've always supported draft
resistance and know what about if that
person who deserted no I think that
deserters should be supported but in
fact anyone who is resisting these
officially what about should we destroy
military file or ROTC property as a
protest against the war well when you
get to destruction that becomes more
ambiguous but in many instances I would
any instances you would what I won't do
it don't support a rail a troop track if
oh that's even more difficult because of
that we're getting more difficult that's
right and there are these are there is
no I should say that there is you're not
going to find any general principle that
applies to this case it has to deal with
each particular instance no you have to
deal with each particular instance on
its merits and went this way all right
no I wouldn't do that because the injury
to the individuals nobody we're injured
if nobody if you could be certain in
advance that no one would be injured
then I think also first I would I would
derail a train that was carrying live
ammunition to be dropped on the people
of you know what about Ellsberg if he
had distributed the four volumes he
withheld would you have prosecuted him
for doing that I have no idea what's in
those four volume I see
yeah well the implication for mr. Miller
was that this was the really hot they
packed security stuff and we have no no
that's not the implication but he has no
idea wasn't it
the noodle you're quite right yes should
Ellsberg have revealed this material
assuming it was security matters having
to do with ongoing operations affecting
the Vietnam War that depends entirely on
what the social consequences would be of
revealing that infinity would determine
that well in the case of very serious
criminal act such as the act of say
killing maiming and driving up in their
homes half the population of Vietnam I
think any American citizen has the right
to make it itself absolutely yes because
we're dealing with very significant and
ongoing criminal action what if an
opponent of mr. Nixon's new initiatives
toward Red China somebody who opposed it
that's their right manner and the
government leaked classified documents
that that went back and forth we may
assume preparing it and that this
getting into the hands of a hostile
press had derailed those negotiations
would you consider that such a person
should be prosecuted I don't think it
should be prosecuted but I would
certainly oppose what he had done why
would you not prosecute him sir because
I'm I'd be very cautious and careful
about prosecuting people for bringing
information to the public
supposing though that they harmed or
effectively ruined that policy at that
delicate moment I think that would be
very unfortunate and if it and I can
conceive of circumstances under which
prosecution would be legitimate but not
a photo but not in any case in this one
what if Roo TEPCO had leaked his
classified documents to the press rather
than to the Congress I think a rather
important distinction well not entirely
because don't forget that Ellsberg did
bring the material to the Congress a
year for a year and a half before that's
stopped Ellsberg did it because because
then the daughter of the press that
would have again been extremely
unfortunate but I agree with the other
witnesses they should not prosecute
is there Bergman had stolen the
documents and sold into newspapers
simply for the cash involved well then I
think you might argue that there was an
element of robbery or something of that
sort no no I'm not talking about robbery
that robbery is a is is a specific crime
and you can commit it whatever your
intention in the particular code no well
I want to know I want to know if he had
had merely cash on his mind should he be
prosecuted I would I think at that point
he could probably be pressed the words
the tax just a minute for the trivial
and a very different act of robbery a
test like we had time for
test then is motive two-part question
motive and consequence and Senator
McCarthy's motives were they pure enough
so Senator McCarthy us were quite evil
and all the question of illegal
absolutely no one else Berg determined
well I think that's it that's something
for every American citizen to determine
for himself I think the government it by
looking at the content of these papers
and our laws for Chomsky thank you
[Applause]
