last August August 26th as his fire was
reached between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority the the most
recent of a long series of ceasefires so
far the the terms of the ceasefire were
familiar from earlier ones over review
the record briefly and the aftermath so
far has also fit the usual pattern and
the pattern is very clear and evident
almost exceptional is for the major
ceasefires Israel ignores of the terms
completely and maintains its progression
its siege its violence its criminal
activities in the occupied territories
and they are criminal Hamas observes the
ceasefire as Israel officially concedes
until some escalation of Israeli
violence elicits a Hamas response which
serves as a pretext for another episode
of what Israel calls elegantly mowing
along another assault of perfume
typically greater violence than the one
that preceded the American press and
commentary then goes into its regular
mode deploring what the New York Times a
couple of days ago called Hamas as
assault on Israel and explaining that
Israel has a right to self-defence
asking how we would react if we were
being attacked by
from Canada may be saying that Israel
went a little too far and it's
self-defense activities but it's
fundamentally the victim and justified
and then we move into the next phase of
the same pattern over and over again
this began very relevant policies fire
agreement was in november two thousand
five read the terms it was the agreement
on movement and access it quote this is
a pretty close paraphrase it called for
crossing between Gaza and Egypt at the
Rafah had rough uh for the export of
goods and the transit of people
continuous operation of crossings
between Israel and Gaza for the import
export of goods and the transit of
people reduction of obstacles to
movement within the West Bank Brett
Weston truck want convoys between the
West Bank and Gaza the building of a
seaport in Gaza and the reopening of the
airport in Gaza which had been destroyed
by Israeli attack that's essentially the
terms of the repeated ceasefires
including this one slight differences
the timing of the first of these
november two thousand five is
significant that was the moment of
Israel's what they call their
disengagement from Gaza what happened is
that Israel decided to remove several
thousand settlers from their subsidized
homes illegally in Gaza where they were
protected with the taking maybe third or
more of the
limited resources as a protected by a
substantial part of the Israeli army and
Israeli Hawk realized that this was
pretty ridiculous Gaza was already
almost devastated by Israeli attacks it
would have made more sense to move them
from Gaza to subsidize homes and the
West Bank and Golan Heights which Israel
intends to keep this was presented as a
noble gesture opening the way to peace
but the awful Palestinians didn't take
the opportunity and instead the decided
all they want to do is kill Jews they
started sending rockets and building
phones and so on and standard picture
but the reality is entirely different
the the goal the official goal of the
so-called disengagement was actually
described frankly by the Israeli
official who was in charge of
negotiating it with the United States
and implementing it the Vice class close
associate of from then prime minister
ariel sharon he said the goal of the
disengagement I'm quoting him is the
freezing of the peace process so as to
prevent the establishment of a
Palestinian state and to ensure that
diplomacy has been removed indefinitely
from the agenda as i said the hooks for
the hawks it was a rational objective of
the propaganda was different those of
you who are old enough to remember my
Nicole they say the Boston with a Boston
Globe depicted it big front-page picture
little boy fleeting the soldiers not the
tear down his home with a big headline
saying never again
we're never going to allow ourselves to
be dispossessed from our land again it
was it was a for the American audience
the main target it was an effective
propaganda agency in Israel the more
sophisticated observers simply ridiculed
with barb kimerling israel's major
sociologist for example it is described
that as it was PR gesture designed to
ensure that there would be support for
Israel's illegal colonization of the
rest of the occupied territories it
would have been very easy to remove the
settlers with Noah do at all it would
simply have been necessary to announce
that on such-and-such a date the Israeli
army will leave Gaza and the settlers
then would climb into the worries that
are provided to them and would move from
their subsidized illegal settlements in
Gaza that are subsidized illegal
settlements in the West Bank but there
would be no PR success from that it was
particularly carnival because it was a
repeat of what almost to the detail of
what was done in 1982 when israel was
compelled to evacuate the sinai and they
staged the same same kind of events
recall there was a headline in israel's
major newspaper Haaretz which said
neighbors at national trauma 1982 just
ridicule in the show and this was a
repeat if you had something incidentally
the same could be true if Israel is
compelled to remove the illegal settlers
from the other occupied territories it's
very hard operation on a different story
well what actually happened then is not
this noble effort them for peace which
Palestinians refuse to accept what
actually happened is described quite
accurately by Israel's two leading
scholars in Israel who have written the
definitive work on the settlers Indians
earth oven Akiva Eldar people Garza his
real fleeting diplomatic correspondent
the Czar thousand noted historian what
they say is the ruined territory Gaza
was not released for even a single day
from Israel's military grip or from the
price of the occupation that the
inhabitants pay every day after the
disengagement Israel left behind
scorched earth devastated services and
people with neither a present nor future
the settlements were destroyed the
Israeli settlements were destroyed in an
ungenerous move by an unenlightened
occupier which in fact continues to
control the territory and killed when
her assets inhabitants by means of its
formidable military might that's it
Israel's two leading scholars authors of
the major work on the occupation
actually has an English translation now
it's called lords of the land worth
reading and Israel is still with the
occupying power that's recognized that
by the world as far as I know by every
country including the United States
apart from Israel of course which
rejects it it's the occupying power and
every reasonable respect well that was
the first november two thousand five
that ceasefire lasted a couple of weeks
in january 2006 few weeks later
palestinians committed a very serious
crime and were punished for it and are
continuing to be punished for it there
was a free election in Palace
actually only for election in the Arab
world it closely monitored declared to
be free and fair but it came out the
wrong way the United States is strongly
in favor of democracy when it comes out
the right way welcome that the wrong way
we destroy it that's our remember that
this was right in the middle of
passionate orations about democracy
promotion and so on it came out the
wrong way hamas won the control of the
parliament that's not supposed to be the
result of a free election Israel and the
United States instantly reacted by
imposing a much harsher siege by other
penalties European Union to its shame
trailed along behind the master as it
usually does and that was the end of the
ceasefire that has escalated the Israeli
attacks continued by by june of that
year about 7,700 israeli shells
high-explosive shells that attack gazit
part of the general attack and of course
the siege was extended all the terms of
the ceasefire that i mentioned were
completely abandoned i mentioned i say
june because in june the attack
escalated much more harshly and so it
continued until the next ceasefire which
was in june two thousand eight pretty
much the same terms Israel was to in the
siege loan allow export and import and
essentially the terms i just read before
from the november two thousand five one
with a pattern repeated israel
immediately announced that it was going
to ignore the terms of the ceasefire
maintain the zoo siege maintain violence
John Hamas observed the ceasefire Israel
officially acknowledges that until
November fourth 2008 the day of the u.s.
presidential election when attention was
focused on that event on that day Israel
in Israeli forces invaded Gaza escalated
and killed half a dozen Hamas buttons
that led to two cousin Rockets this kind
of primitive Rockets they're called
rockets Israel responded that went on
for a couple of weeks lots of deaths all
Palestinian in late December Hamas
offered to renew the ceasefire on the
original terms in fact terms even more
favorable Israel the Israeli cabinet
considered it this was what's called a
dovish cabinet under the hood on earth
they considered the offer and decided to
reject it and instead launched the next
episode of mowing the lawn that was
Operation Cast Lead I was a murder some
fertile operation there's very good
literature on it in January President
Obama was interesting interested
interesting at that time he had been
elected on November forth but he hadn't
yet been ignored inaugurated and he was
asked the number of times to to comment
on the mass effect on the massacres were
pretty well for it with the usual twist
I mean Israel's on her soul but they
were reported and he was asked that he
could comment on and he said he couldn't
that the United States has only one
president namely push and therefore he
can't comment he was commenting on
everything else but couldn't
actually made one comment of the usual
he said if my daughters were under
attack by rockets I would do anything
possible to stop it he wasn't referring
to the children in Gaza were being torn
to shreds and slaughtered but two
children in the israeli settlement of
state road who are under occasional
custom rocket attack the assault was
very carefully planned cast led it
perches real totally controlled there's
no defense they terminated the assault a
few hours before obama's inauguration so
therefore he didn't have to comment on
it was was over and when he was asked to
come and he said well we shouldn't look
at the past we should look forward to
the future that's a standard line of
major criminals forget the past so let's
look forward to glorious future if any
of you were planning career or as in the
Mafia and
madam service which is about the same
thing it's a good lesson to remember so
therefore Obama did not say anything
about it that done well in right in the
middle of the attack january january 8
2009 the UN Security Council passed a
unanimous resolution the US obtaining
called for an immediate ceasefire and
then added the usual terms pretty much
the ones i quoted they were never
observed it all broke down completely
with the next major episode of mowing
the lawn that was november 2012 just to
illustrate what was going on you take a
look at the casualty figures for that
year which are typical there were 78
palestinians killed one Israeli Israel
was under assault then came a ceasefire
with the usual terms the familiar ones
the aftermath of that was described
pretty accurately by a prominent scholar
Nathan for all he's the Middle East
specialist for the International Crisis
Group but he says is that Israel
recognized right away that Hamas was
observing the terms of the ceasefire and
it therefore saw little incentive in
doing the same in other words it ignored
the terms the military attacks on Gaza
increased along with more stringent
restrictions on imports exports were
blocked exit permits were blocked that
continued for 18 months until april 2014
when Gaza Hamas based in Gaza and the
Palestinian Authority based in the West
Bank made an agreement for a unity
government signed a unit agreement
Israel was infuriated and they became
even angrier when not only the world
endorsed it but even the United States
kind of capital e endorsed it there had
to be a reaction to block that that's
quite important I should say there's a
good reason why Israel with us backing
has blocked integration of Gaza and the
West Bank for 20 years that's ever since
an agreement from sign called the Oslo
agreement which declared that the West
Bank and Gaza are a single territorial
entity and cannot be separated ever
since then the United States and Israel
have been dedicated to separating them
there's a very good reason for that it's
rarely discussed but if you look at a
map and think for a minute you can see
it if Gaza and the West Bank are
separated any kind of limited autonomy
that ever might be granted in the west
bank is essentially in prison has no
access to the outside world any access
would be through Gaza so if you break
the two apart and you keep Gaza kind of
totally devastated under siege anything
that happens in the West Bank is more or
less meanings it's surrounded completely
surrounded by Israel on one side and the
Jordanian dictatorships was ally of
Israel and the other side very handy
Palestinian so that's there is a good
reason to keep them separated and that's
one of the reasons why Israel was
extremely angry at the unity agreement
which could be a step towards
integrating the two as required by the
sacred the text of the Oslo agreement
which the US and Israel were signed with
the usual cynicism another problem from
Israel's point of view was that one of
the pretexts for avoiding serious
negotiations was that it's impossible to
negotiate with the Palestinians because
who do you negotiate with they're not
yet
there's two groups there's Hamas which
unfortunately won the election and the
Palestinian Authority which we support
well once they're unified that goes says
another reason for the fury in any event
it was pretty clear that Israel had to
respond pretty quickly and it did that
launched a major assault on Palestinians
in the West Bank also in Gaza primarily
aimed Hamas killed hundreds of people
who killed a lot of people and so on
finally that did elicit a response from
come on a couple of days after lots of
killings in Gaza and that led to the
latest episode of mowing the lawn
protective edge all the way through I
should say that Israel did have a
pretext at the pretext for everything
the pretext for the assault was the
murder of three Jewish settlers TV
teenagers who were murdered in the West
Bank quite brutally Israel claimed that
they didn't know whether they were alive
or dead and that would be false they
knew right away that they were did but
it gave a pretext for several weeks of
intensive pretended efforts to search
for them combined with extensive
repression Israel also end of course it
once Israel announced but on yahoo and
others that they knew for certain but
this was carried out by
actually it turns out they knew right
away that it was probably carried out by
a cell and heavy room from the cosmic
plant which has loose connections with
Hamas that has been a foreman Hamas
aside for years then fellow workers and
I was pointed out right away by Shlomi
Eldar by their Naomi Drury there another
leading specialists on Hamas but the the
Act worked very well for the intended
American audience and it looked as if it
was a pretext for the operation well
that's up to the present the pattern is
very clear it's hard to miss it takes
considerable genius maybe for the media
commentators to miss it but don't take
my word for it you can look at the
records it's all a lil and this is
essentially what it is so far in the few
weeks since the latest ceasefire it's
been pretty much the same the siege
remains Israel has a very slightly
relaxed it there's a report this morning
from very good Palestinian journalists
founded on their personal friend but
actually who lives and gays have been
reporting from there for years and he
says that Israel has allowed a small
shipment of sweet potatoes to leave Gaza
so far that's about it they haven't
allowed products from Gaza to go to the
west bank which is the natural market
and they used at the market in Europe
for flowers vegetables and so on but
barely allowed there are few other
relaxations of Israel he points out no
longer prevents import into Gaza of
shoelaces ketchup and I think candy is
the third which they used to block
that's now alone otherwise things were
pretty much the same way there is a
possibility which has been discussed by
some reason observers inside Israel that
this time Israel might be willing to
stop or at least record land a little in
the steady torture of Gaza which has
actually been going on since nineteen
forty eight but intensively in the
period I describe the reasons are
several one reason is that Egypt is now
in the hands of a very vicious
dictatorship one of the darkest periods
in Egypt history and that's a very
beneficial for Israel they were happy
about that for one thing they liked
dictatorships in the Arab world
democracies are dangerous and this
dictatorship happen to be very anti
Palestinian and particularly opposed to
four months so it's a decent Ally for
Israel so that means that on all sides
the Palestinians are kind of contained
that's one reason a second reason is
that Israel's actions in the West Bank
which go on steadily right through this
period in fact right after the August 26
the ceasefire Israel announced the
biggest land grab in decades in the West
Bank in the Jerusalem area anything that
goes on in verse Allah may notice that
all of this is in strict violation of
international law there is a question
about that it's repeatedly condemned by
the Security Council including the
United States World Court has ruled that
it's all in violation of the Geneva
Conventions that's with the agreement of
the US Justice he didn't join the
majority were at a separate opinion but
he agreed that yes all of the settlement
ISM is de facto violation of the Geneva
Conventions
to prevent block the transfer of
population without territory and there's
no death nobody except Israel it refuses
to call this occupied territories so
it's all illegal and Jerusalem its
multiple oliva because there are
separate resolutions going back to
nineteen sixty eight which the u.s. also
signed it ordering that Israel should
terminate any actions that change the
character of Jerusalem there most of the
building and development is going on
anyway these illegal activities have now
reached the point where the Israeli
government might consider that they're
just too far gone to reverse so
therefore it's less important to
separate a Gaza from the West Bank and
to torture Gaza the third reason which
Israel has discussed is the turmoil
that's going in in the going on in the
outer world which is very good for
miserables point of view they like to
see Arabs killing each other and it as
they point out it's created new
alliances so there has been a kind of a
tacit alliance between Israel and Saudi
Arabia the main US ally because that's
where all the oil is going back to the
formation of the state of Saudi Arabia
family dictatorship that reliance been
kind of tacit mouth a little bit more
overt and with this new collection of
alliances and they focus on Islamic
state than jihadism so in Israel may
feel that it has it's in a better
position to put an end to the torture of
Gaza or at least relents lightly and
that's a possibility so far there's no
indication of as i said the pattern is
being pursued just as it's been for
years including the u.s. description
well what about the prospects if you
look at the debate over this in the
in diplomatic circles commentators
scholars activists almost universally
the there are two alternatives
counterpose the one alternative is the
two-state settlement that has been in
international consensus for 3540 years
we're not allowed to talk here about
history remember that's irrelevant was a
bit look good if you look at it the
two-state settlement was proposed for
the first time in January 1976 in a
resolution brought to the Security
Council by three Arab states three major
Arab states Egypt Jordan and Syria they
called for a settlement on the
internationally recognized border with
the guarantees for the right of each
state to exist quoting it to exist in
peace and security within secure and
recognized borders that's January 1976 I
think Israel refused to attend the
session maybe coincidentally at bond
Lebanon without any pretext killing 50
people but that's just normal it may
have been a response to the United
Nations the United States feet to the
resolution when the United States vetoes
a resolution and remember the u.s. is
the champion & vito's by far since the
UN sort of fell out of control in the
1960s with decolonization when the US v
does a resolution it's of course doesn't
not implement it but it's also vetoed
from history so you don't have to look
pretty far to find the record of this
it's there actually you need to find it
the New York Times that they was passed
but it's kind of out of history and try
and search and see if you can find a
same thing happened in nineteen eighty
us it's Carter the United States vetoed
a similar resolution matters in the
international arena shifted to the
General Assembly where their regular
votes 152 to at us Israel sometimes
Marshall Islands or something like that
the most recently though februari 2011
actually didn't receive a little
attention they're usually more oh that's
Obama's veto februari 2011 the Security
Council with voting on a resolution to
implement Obama's official policy in
vetoed the official that didn't raise a
few eyebrows the official US policy
which is words not me and the official
US policy is that Israel should end its
expansion of settlements that's the big
issue that's discussed actually the
expansion of settlements is a pretty
marginal question the question is the
settlement not expansion they're all
illegal start with but the Security
Council did vote on the expansion of
settlements and Obama vetoed it Susan
Rice that UN Ambassador gave an eloquent
explanation of why we had
policy but you can look at that figure
that one as I say it didn't receive a
little attention what's actually been
going on is that for and meanwhile the
United States provides the military
economic diplomatic support that is
necessary for Israel to carry at all its
actions and also the ideological support
by the way the issue is framed it
doesn't show very well in the rest of
the world but it sells here the way the
issue is framed is as I describe
Israel's the victim we have to as a
right of self-defense and so on of
course is it this particle truth in that
Israel does have the right of
self-defense but it doesn't follow that
has the right of self-defense by force
there's a qualification to the right of
self-defense you have the right of
self-defense by force if you have
exhausted peaceful means when you've
rejected peaceful means we've refused
even to try them you know if any right
of self-defense at all you don't make
this shoot a pistol across the border
that's evident the same would be true
with and we were if it were imaginable
to take the usual analogy of sade Canada
was sending kassam rockets at the mood
or a person that we would have a right
to respond by force if we had exhausted
peaceful means not if we had rejected
peaceful means not if we followed the
pattern that I just described so the
right to self-defense is just it doesn't
arise well the standard description it
is either a two-stage settlement which
is incidentally supported by essentially
the entire world the Arab states the
Organization of Islamic states which
includes Iran Europe at least
theoretically that
America and so on Israel rejected the
United States blocks those are two
rejectionist powers essentially why it
doesn't get implemented that's one
alternative it's very common not to say
that Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and nobody talks about it but the Golan
Heights has proceeded far enough so that
it can't be reversed and that leads to
the second alternative the second
alternative which is widely discussed is
that there will be a single state Israel
will simply take over the entire area
from the jordan river to the sea former
Palestine will be a single state and
main Palestinians support that outcome
they argued that then there can be a
civil rights struggle and anti-apartheid
struggle modeled on South Africa within
this single state Israelis are don't
except for the extreme right Israelis
are opposed to that because it poses a
problem a problem which is called the
demographic problem the demographic
problem is too many non-jews in a
democratic Jewish state Democratic
Jewish state is kind of an oxymoron you
can play with that if you like but if
there's too many Arabs will really be a
problem so that many especially liberal
the Israelis are kind of a close to this
will turn and that's that those are the
choices that are counter posed those are
the prospects that are laid out all of
this is wrong it's missing the obvious
think about it for a minute Israel has a
much better alternative and the u.s.
backing it as well the better
alternative is simply to continue doing
exactly what they're doing and we know
what that is you can read it observe it
and what Israel is doing with us support
endless us support is first of all
taking over the what's called Jerusalem
which is an invention it's about five
times the size of anything that ever was
Jerusalem it takes in all sorts of our
villages and regions around it that will
take over Greater Jerusalem big piece of
the West Bank it will take over there
are corridors that are being constructed
to the east is a major part or east of
the Jerusalem it goes to incorporate a
big town all other than man which was
built mostly during the Clinton years
with the purpose of essentially
bisecting the West Bank you take a look
at the map its lands reach to Jericho
just about which essentially bisects the
West Bank there's two other partners in
the north cutting through one the town
of REO other two miam couple of others
Israel takes those over that kind of
Canton eise's what's left if you look at
the map it looks as if there's a
substantial area that Israel isn't
taking over but that's mostly
uninhabitable desert they're taking over
what they want what's useful Israel's
taking over the Jordan Valley quietly
step by step that reduced the population
that our population there from was
300,000 in 1967 mounts maybe 60,000
usual procedure the Army moves in
announces that there's a military area
all the settlements have to leave or
maybe there's a green area which is not
allowed to be settled the Palestinians
were kicked out if their bedrooms are
just bust in the desert after a while it
turns out that a military settlement is
being built it's really military
settlement and it's replaced by an
actual settlement they sink wells all
over and slowly developed this is a
policy for those of you know the history
of Zionism has this been going on for a
century the policy is what's
dunno was that like a quarter of an acre
the dune on after dunno the Sheep best
our sheep in other words do things
quietly so the goyim don't notice it but
gradually you get more and more and when
it gets established its accepted that's
how the state was built that's the
policy that's being pursued now with
these support the commercial support of
the United States can claim not to see
it Israel will also take over everything
that's on the Israeli side of what's
called the separation wall as a wall
which about eighty-five percent of it
cuts through Palestinian territory it
was declared illegal by the world tour
certainly is it is presented as defense
against terrorism but that doesn't pass
the last test its protection for the
settlers who are inside the the the
world and if Israel wanted to defend
itself against terrorism it would build
a wall on the border they could make it
a mile high you know tanks up and back
each side atom bombs anything wanted and
there wouldn't be a whisper of protest
in the international community that
would be defense this has nothing to do
with defense it has to do with taking
over arable land resources or water
resources there and the nice suburbs of
Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and so on taking
over the Jordan Valley incidentally
means about a third of the arable land
and the West Bank and of course it
completes the imprisonment completely
take a look at the map it's not just
Jordan but also the West Bank in the
Jordan Valley will be under Israeli
control occupation ultimately that does
leave some Palestinian Canton's and in
typical neo-colonial fashion Israel
to establish a few places in the West
Bank for the Palestinian a leads the
rich Palestinians the educated
Palestinians so they can have a nice
place kind of like any third-world
country they'd go to the poorest third
world country you can imagine there are
people who live in luxury that is
unimaginable to us that's that's the
neo-colonial pattern and that's from
Allah maybe a new city that's being
built a nice theaters restaurants we
live like in London tomorrow that's the
pattern that's being established there
is absolutely no reason and if you can
and those are the areas that is really
intends to integrate into Israel well
they have very few Palestinians those
who are there are being mostly kicked
out anyway so that at the end of this
process of integrating these areas into
Israel there won't be any demographic
problem in fact if you look at the
numbers it will actually increase the
ratio of Jews in Greater Israel because
they'll bring in half a million settlers
and scattered numbers of errands so no
demographic problem no problem with the
Democratic Jewish state Palestinians
will be left and isolated can't done
that can have some kind of economy if
they want but actually what they can
have was described graphically by the
first israeli prime minister to
countenance the possibility of the
Jewish state they actually it's Benjamin
Netanyahu that was considered the
Ultrabook the Labour Party Prime
Minister's like kushina Paris praveen
never considered the possibility of the
jewel of Palestinian state they're
strongly opposed that when Netanyahu
came in in 1996 his ministers were asked
could there be a Palestinian state
that yes we're going to leave something
to the Palestinians they can call it a
state if they want where they can call
it fried chicken that's essentially the
goal so there'll be some fried chicken
left to scattered Palestinians in the
West Bank nice town and Ramona or they
can live like Westerners Gaza kept under
siege illegally of course and devastated
there's no reason for Israel to go to
move towards one state why should they
have a much better solution that's the
likely prospect and as long as the
United States supports it there's every
reason to expect this steady regular
process to continue and that really puts
it in our hands any significant change
in this process but I have to come from
here and it can come from organized
activism of the kind that has changed
policy in other cases sometimes even
harder ones and account in this case too
if it doesn't I think these are the very
likely prospect
so let's go right now and Isis a bit of
support
they're returning all the seven is this
meant for them and bringing everybody to
the 67 for now we be the negotiator for
Palestinian for the months and how can
you assure me that no rockets will be
fired from Gaza the first children
wouldn't be Iran was she house reach
anywhere and that people ago the border
between Jordan and with bank how can you
assure me that I would have resource for
netless or from remind the Jerusalem so
what's most important for us the
Israelis nor any of us that's a security
same spontaneous so how'd me assure you
yeah actually that's about the least
important issue i think they away it was
the real problem and the history
demonstrates it very clearly is how can
you ensure that a palestinian state will
not be subject to regular israeli attack
and that's obviously the primary
question okay that's the primary well
the real question is and the history
makes it completely obvious how do you
protect a Palestinian estate state from
repeated Israeli attack backed by the
United States that's the overwhelmingly
important question as far as your
question is concern it is a question but
a pretty minor one and the reason
let me tell you why it's a minor one
actually I've already told you if you
look over the record of the ceasefires
every major ceasefire has followed a
pattern check it and see Israel rejects
it Hamas observes it and Israel concedes
that sorry Israel concedes that
officially until an Israeli escalation
elicits a response that's been the
pattern in every single major ceasefire
if you don't believe it i'll be glad to
provide you with a documentation so one
reason is that's been the pattern so
there's every reason to continue it to
expect to continue it this certainly
make mackinaw mcmackin fine there's
another reason Israel has such
overwhelming power that is there was
ever anything like you described they
could wipe out Palestine in two minutes
I mean it's like asking how do you look
at the United States conquered half of
Mexico 150 years ago and in fact that's
why the cities in the south west and the
West have spanish names suppose somebody
had asked at the time how can we ensure
that will be safe from an attack from
Mexico I mean maybe some crazy person
asked that I don't think so because the
answer was obvious the US was able to
conquer Mexico and what President Grant
described as the most wicked war in
history presented overwhelming military
force so we now sit on half of Mexico
and if Mexicans try to flee from the
effects of NAFTA which destroyed Mexican
agriculture we send them back but that
we're not then maybe somebody claims
we're threatened by Mexico but it's
pretty extreme we're not threatened by
Mexico and that's essentially the
relation view Israel and Palestine
with this simple way to end Hamas rocket
and Israel knows it live up to a
ceasefire every time it's been Israel
has never actually lived up to the
ceasefires it has always violated them
from the first minute as I described but
nevertheless from us maintain the
ceasefire until when Israeli escalation
pardon
sorry I didn't hearing in either one
savory to state about Palestinian
leadership because of Amazon's ratings
are not fantastic so the question is how
we're passing in leadership operate
under either one state or tuesday well
the question one state is moot israel's
if not going to accept it the United
States will not accept it actually
nobody in the world supports it so it's
not going to happen israel and the
united states have a much better option
the one I described continue doing what
they're doing there's no reason no
imaginable reason why they should ever
accept taking over a Palestinian
population that they don't want their
sometimes analogies drawn to South
Africa but they're extremely misleading
I'm in the case of South Africa
eighty-five percent of the population
was black South African nationalists
needed their black population I was
their workforce they couldn't get rid of
them they needed them and in fact they
trot they even sustained a South Africa
when it set up the banta stands provided
that provided for their try to develop
them they were trying to gain
international recognition for them
Israel doesn't want anything like that
they don't want the Palestinians they
want to go away have no interest in them
so they're not going to take them in
they leaving the rock didn't count on so
there isn't going to be any one state we
can forget about it there's no support
for it and no has no remote possibly
the Institute actually it could be a
long-term objective i'm at the talk
about one state is kind of curious
there's a lot of talk about the ones one
state now and the solidary groups on the
palestinians and so on plenty of people
propose it but there's an important
point to recognize and activists in
particular should be attend to this
there's a big difference between
proposal and advocacy like you can
exposure against nuclear weapons you can
propose that nuclear weapons be
eliminated okay that i just did that's
easy you can if you want to advocate it
you've got to show how you go from here
there what's the path that's advocacy
that's activism so you can propose that
there be one state and feel good about
it but how do you get there well
actually there is a way and there's only
one way that I know actually cursive
just speaking personally I've in favor
of it for 75 years but you have to find
a way to get there and the only way I
know of is to be is in stages beginning
with the two-state settlement that is
the international consensus and could be
implemented if the u.s. didn't block it
in some form yeah I can argue about the
details but the basic structures
essentially understood that could be a
first step a chances are very high I
think that if got that far and the cycle
of violence will deduce that you would
see exactly what has happened in the
past every time that the violence
reduced the beginning what you see is
the beginnings of connections between
the two communities the commercial
cultural tour
and so on I mean anybody who knows that
territory anybody's traveled there knows
that there is just no way to draw a line
through the former Palestine every way
is crazy it just really crazy and I
think those borders would begin to erode
and as though began the road there might
be equal parts closer integration
federalism a kind of thing that's
happening in much of the world where
borders are eroding like all of Europe
for example closer connections maybe
some form of binational arrangement of a
client that exists in other places and
another there's another possibility more
chicken long range but not impossible if
you take a look at the border between it
like the word between Israel and Lebanon
for example it's completely artificial
border it cuts right through right
through the Galilee actually had
personal experience with that sixty
years ago I was living in a kibbutz in
Israel my wife and I were students we
were just hiking for the Galilee no
backpacks student stuff and as we were
walking it was the evening that Jeep
drove by on a dirt road behind us and a
guy got out of the Jeep and started
yelling to us then he were telling us
that to come back we had crossed into
Lebanon yeah it does because it's the
same place you know that there's no
meaningful border and I think those
borders could erode too they're all
imposed by Imperial force like all over
the world of legitimacy that the source
of conflicts everywhere and in time they
might erode as in fact is happening in
happening in Europe and Stephanie
another places in my view that's the
only
possibility only circumstance in which
the question of the rights of refugees
can ever be seriously considered a short
of that there's no advocacy that I know
of but that might lead to a situation in
which it could be partially dealt with
in an amicable fashion I think these are
all possibilities but if anyone can
think of a different scenario I haven't
heard it and until they do there's no
other advocacy of a single state just
talked about it and I think the talk is
very misleading because it diverts
attention away from what is happening
and what is going to happen unless US
policy changes
will change this policy more interval
for ya that's that's the crucial
question we ought to be asking ourselves
what can we do about it there are a
number of things first of all actions
should be designed which will change US
policy I'm you can take actions that
will punish Israel and I think there's
reason for that so they say the European
Union has taken a very strong step they
have passed directives whether they'll
be implemented we'll see but directives
blocking any connections with Israeli
institutions that have any activities in
the occupied territories which puts your
regards as illegal activities like the
world outside the United States so if
that's implemented it's pretty strong
and it's it's being implemented because
of popular pressure okay that's a strong
action and there are other actions of
that time some of the major churches in
the United States presbyterian when I
Church of Christ of cold for a
divestment from any institution in
Israel or the United States notice both
that have any activities in the occupied
territories that's essentially saying
let's stop participate in criminal
actions I think that's a good step to
take but the real significant tax will
be directed at US policy I think and
there are very concrete things that can
be done so take for example us shipment
of arms to Israel that's very important
that we actually just saw how important
it was during the Gaza the latest gadget
attack protective edge that you've
probably read in the papers that in the
middle of that attack which is a very
fierce
so Israel which is armed to the teeth
began to run out of weapons they needed
replenishment of their weapons the
Pentagon provided Israel with more
weapons in a very interesting and
revealing way the weapons came from US
weapons which are pre-positioned in
Israel their pre-positioned in Israel
for eventual used by US forces in one of
their peacekeeping missions that when
they destroy a country in the Middle
East that's part of the reason for the
very tight relationship Israel is
considered just a like a militant US
military base in the Middle East anyway
the Pentagon released weapons to Israel
they didn't even ask the White House
which was a little irritated talk
followed but bear in mind that the
weapons that the US provides to Israel
our first of all in violation of
international law as Amnesty
International others have been pointing
out for years but they're also in
violation of US law US law explicitly
bars the sending of weapons to any
military organization that is engaged in
human rights violations and in Israel's
involved in human rights violations up
to the sky all of our weapons to Israel
are in violation of US law it's the lay
low its goal after playing that's a good
organizing point I think it's a very
good organizing point I think Americans
can be mobilized to stop sending weapons
in violation of US law to a country that
is carrying out major human rights
a lot of reasons that part of the
reasons is just concerned about the
economy why should we be doing this I
think that's an option that can really
be pursued has been for years and I
think that could affect us policy and
there are the things like it another
thing to be done is what you can see
right here in this room ten years ago
literally if there was a talk on Israel
Palestine at MIT there would be maybe 20
people showing up most of them trying to
break up the meaning screaming and
yelling there would be police protection
in fact the police would insist on
walking me back to my car literally
Israeli human rights activists were
shouted down by protesters organized in
the Jewish community here that's gone
things have changed radically that by
now it's one of the biggest issues on
campus there's overwhelming support for
Palestinian rights a new understanding
that hasn't happened by a miracle that
happened by activism by organization by
education outreach and what happens
among the younger population college age
population sooner or later affects the
general population it can be not
happened in other cases that's how the
anti-war movement got started with other
cases actually that was even the case in
South Africa it's people forget what
happened in South Africa
never knew the United States was the
last country to support partly even
Israel back down before the United
States did Reagan was a hideous racist
he support liver Raven Reagan refused to
believe that there was a race issue in
South Africa his view was it's just a
tribal conflict it was the Zulu of the
Bantu the white so they can't get
together and he was supporting he was
even trying to override congressional
sanctions against South Africa finally
it got to the point where the US
government had to go along with the rest
of the world it was enormous protest
support here for this in other countries
us finally did abandon support for Fort
Hood collapsed that's not the only case
it can happen in this case
Hawaiian is real continuing to attack
guys I mean let's suppose it were to
stop exposes your work to stop attacking
gaza gaza is potentially a pretty rich
place it could be a Mediterranean resort
like the Riviera beautiful beaches as
agricultural resources that produced it
has a very natural market in Europe and
the West Bank it could be a reasonably
flourishing area could have a seaport
which used to have kind of an airport
which it had until Israel destroyed it
it could be a kind of a flourishing
Mediterranean Gaza used to be one of the
main producers of fish for the region
they don't do it anymore because Israel
has the Israeli Navy refuses to allow a
Gaza the fishermen to go more than a
couple of kilometers offshore protects
the security but that's a joke when they
go only a couple of kilometers offshore
that means they have to fish in waters
that are heavily polluted because Israel
is destroyed the sewage plant and
periodically destroys the power
class so the fishing industry has been
almost wiped out but it could be again
as it was in the past source of fish
agriculture flowers sweet potatoes
because they're now allowing out and
that have been a very fine resort area
Europeans would come to it as raley's
we've come to it and but then remember
if it's if the US and Israel agree to
adhere to the auto agreement there will
be a connection between free connection
free access between Gaza and the West
Bank as incidentally explicitly declared
in all these ceasefire agreements I read
read it before well that means that the
west bank will have an outlet to the
outside world that means that the West
Bank could be a viable functioning area
Israel wants the list it wants not the
whole West Bank it doesn't want the
population it once maybe fifty percent
of the West Bank the parts that I
mentioned for the same reason that
people in Boston want to have the
western suburbs and if you look
literally the nice suburbs of color
bathe and Jerusalem or in the West Bank
in the hills and there's a huge
infrastructure development all illegal
of course which enables you to go on a
super highway from wherever you tour
settlement is in the West Bank to the
main Israeli cities without ever seeing
an error because they're not allowed but
they want to keep hold that just like
they want to keep the resources
it's not for security reasons in fact
that was made very clear along time ago
so you go back to shortly after the
occupation of the West Bank there was
there was a lot of discussion in Israel
time of whether to keep it or not and
one of the most prominent figures is a
rights mount the head of the Air Force
it war hero later as president kind of
dove and the Israelis back and he
pointed out he said look there's no
security issue if Israel were to
withdraw from the West Bank might even
improve Israeli security but but he said
if we do we will not if we withdraw we
will not be able to live at the scale
and quality that we now enjoy okay
that's true like if say Boston was to
give up lexington and Lincoln it could
not be no security issue but couldn't
live at the scale and quality it now
enjoys but faculty like me couldn't get
out there and then but those are the
issues and if the Gaza was allowed to
flourish and join the West Bank it
wouldn't be it wouldn't be a rich
country it would be a small country
demilitarized of course totally
overwhelmed wise early force and it
would still be viable and this means
Israel would give up what wants to take
over in the occupied territories and so
it seems to the move of heights they're
Syrian territory israel annexed them in
violation of explicit security council
orders the u.s. voted with you with the
you
security council at that point Israel
bit ahead anyway and now you take a look
at the commenter in the press now
counter and the presses says well look
good if we gave up the Golan Heights we
would have Isis on our borders you know
right in the Galilee that's not true if
Israel if Israel had a security argument
for keeping the Golan Heights that would
have no settlers there the settlers harm
security that was made very clear during
1973 war but when Syria attacked the
Syrian Golan Heights the Israeli army
couldn't respond until it at first
removed all the settlers which wasted a
lot of time the settlers are a burden
for security so if there were any
security reason what they would do is
just militarize the Golan Heights didn't
do that they wanted for a nice vineyard
nice place to live skiing on the
mountain all kinds of things that's not
a security issue and the question is
will Israel except to become part of the
region not a regional not a state
dominating the region that's a choice
what does not see I'm one of our vendors
four dimensions for just a sec knowledge
using the nail that sucks here this one
a lot of people in the house are
confused as I see reviews on des so I'm
wondering if you can dispara fine why
are these our way stances are no I've
written about it if you want look it up
and I just had a few minutes ago when
VDS activities are perfectly reasonable
in fact I was personally involved in
them before the BDS movement even formed
sure it's always makes sense to carry
out to stop participating in criminal
actions that always makes sense that
means to the boycott what it means
concretely is to boycott institutions
including US multinationals incidentally
important part of it which are involved
in criminal activities there are lots of
them I look out my office window
unfortunately at the coke building okay
can make some suggestions about that but
if you work there well it has its
supposed to be the most green building
on campus that's true
which is kind of ironic if it's the case
but but there's very good reason to
boycott criminal activities the
sanctions don't arise because sanctions
are imposed by States there's no
sanctioned divestment is a possibility
like divestment from sa energy
corporations that are destroying the
environment or from corporations that
are carrying out repressive activities
or even construction in the West Bank
that makes very good sense that's why
the European Union move was quite
important it was focused on the occupied
territories now if you take a look at
the BDS movement that I'm not talking
about the tactics which makes sense but
the movement it's ambiguous it has a
platform you can read it and the
platform changes from now and then the
beginning at the beginning what it was
formed it had three planks the first was
calling for a boycott divestment and
sanctions on three issues one the
occupied territories the second civil
civil rights actually the first was
civil rights anywhere in Palestine they
later changed its civil rights in Israel
the third return of refugees okay the
first of those planks makes perfectly
good sense and in fact if you look at
the BDS activities that have been
carried out almost without exception
maybe without exception they're focused
on the occupied territories including
the major ones which the BDS movement
actually has nothing to do with like the
EU movement the new directives that's
really important focused on the occupied
territories when you talk about boykakke
you know boycott and divestment
concerned with civil rights in Israel
that gets tricky there are there is
undoubtedly a significant repression in
Israel have been writing about
for 50 years the details but you know if
you move if you move that way you
immediately open question why aren't we
boycotting the United States plenty of
it takes a the african-american
population in the United States
responsibly okay suppose that suppose
that the black community here at the
african-american community says let's
boycott the United States okay suppose
is coming from the african-american
community is there a meaningful proposal
it's more like what I quote proposing
not advocating her thoughts not really
there's a question whether it's coming
from the Palestinian community but let's
put that aside suppose it is how do we
boy why should we if we're if we're if
we're posed to violation of civil rights
in Israel how come we're not opposed to
it in the United States so as I lose
that
yes black people in our state's all four
media's I will not dictate to them how
to resist their impression that the
sentence on there so that sense
Palestinians who are the only person
being positive myself the sense call for
me yes is it really how they should yeah
but I'm you're talking about it kind of
principle at the level proposal I'm
talking about advocacy at the level of
doing something if any effort that has
been made to start medias type
activities aimed at civil rights in
Israel has failed and it has filled in a
way which leads to a backlash which
actually harms Palestinians you have
proposals which you know would get a
petition maybe 100 people sign it you
got a backlash with 10,000 people
signing that harms Palestinians and the
reason is very simple the educational
and organizational work has not been
done people here plausibly don't
understand that why we should be
opposing violation of civil rights in
Israel when we're not opposing
comparable or often even worse violation
of civil rights right where we live
until you can convince people of that
and that's not easy these these efforts
are going to not only fail but even
cause a backlash which is harmful to
Palestinians will you really
how good can be excluded because it's
seen one of the real problems that the
Palestinian leadership and the
Palestinian solidarity movements have
had for many years is that they try to
act on principle instead of practically
I'm not the only person to say this
Rajesh Shahada you may know just had an
article blaming criticizing the
Palestinian leadership way back saying
the read one of the reasons we've always
failed is because we like to stand on
principle and we don't look at what can
be achieved that meanwhile the Zionists
say forget about principle let's go do
not after do not we'll see we can
achieve and therefore they succeed if
the Palestinians want to succeed they're
going to have to face the real world
it's a real world where there's no use
stating a principle you can say to
principal and fine let's eliminate
nuclear weapons okay we're done with
that topic you have to have proposals as
to how you'd do something about it and
if you want to do something about civil
rights in Israel which you should I mean
I've been writing about it and talking
about it for 50 years educate people
about it and support the groups in
Israel they're doing something about it
so for example there are significant
steps going on in Israel which are
similar to the civil rights movement
here I could talk about it if you like
okay that makes sense but approaching an
American audience and saying let's
boycott Israel because they carry out
repressive actions against Palestinians
in Israel it has always failed in the
past is going to continue to fail
stating it as a principle is no use
because you're living in a real world in
which people's immediate reaction will
be as it
spin why not do something about it right
here like boycotting the United States
you can't overcome them and we overcame
that is by carrying out a difficult task
which has not been done task of
Education and organization which will
make it plausible to people that we
should oppose these actions in Israel
but we don't oppose them here that's not
easy you take the third point the
refugees even more there has not been a
single BDS action aimed at the refugee
problem which has even begun to succeed
in fact everyone that's been tried has
led to an immediate huge backlash saying
you're calling for the destruction of
Israel well you can't ignore that fact
you can't live in a dream world you've
got a design tactics for this world not
for some imaginary world now is there a
way to deal with the refugee problem
actually I know of only one actual form
of advocacy the one that I mentioned try
to go in stages towards an erosion of
the Imperial borders which should not be
sacrosanct and that could lead to an
opening where there could be
interactions that would deal with part
of the refugee problem other than that
at some point of anything more than
symbolic there is ZERO support for that
in the world 0 you cannot say let's do
something where there's zero support for
it but that's just you know that's
making a principle a point of
self-destruction in this look around
there's no support for it in fact you
know if you look at the legal basis even
that's pretty dubious the appeal is to
resolution 194 right the resolution 194
is not a Security Council resolution
it's a general assembly resolution
General Assembly resolutions are
recommendations the heaven force there
are many Oh
sorts of General Assembly resolutions if
this issue ever arose and it's so remote
in the internet you know a meaningful
sense if it ever did arise every smart
Israeli lawyer would say well first of
all it's a recommendation secondly we're
perfectly happy to readmit the refugees
they've all died by now and the
resolution doesn't talk about the
grandchildren of refugees you
immediately get into this it would get
nowhere and there's a there's no basis
for so calling for the BDS actions aimed
at the refugee problem while you can say
okay it's principle but it has no
tactical meaning and I think for
activists it's extremely important to
focus on tactics that can achieve
something not a statement of abstract
principles just as registrado pointed
out that's been a kind of a lethal blow
to Palestinians for years that i should
say the palestinian national movement
has been quite unusual in this respect I
mean over my lifetime I've been involved
with national liberation movements from
all over the world with the exception of
the Palestinians they have all
understood that you have to make
compromises you I was in Gaza recently
and there was discussion kind of like
this and some of the young people nice
people so you know why should we make
compromises that national liberation
movements don't make compromises it's
exactly the opposite every one of them
has made compromises it takes a the
Vietnamese in 1954 they made a serious
compromise they agreed to temporarily
they thought
languish control of half the country
u.s. intervened was temporary then you
look through the record continually made
compromises because they were trying to
achieve something not win points in a
debate but I achieved something and the
same is true of every successful
national liberation movement of the
Zionists for example they didn't pose
the principal and they have a principal
like the governing party in Israel it
could its ideological core is a rutabaga
is party they have a principle to what
it isn't here acquitted so Israelis here
will know both sides of the Jordan this
is adders and that's ours too meaning
Jordans ours that's part of the Land of
Israel bagan always insisted on it
that's never been revoked still the
principle but they'll put it forth you
know they don't say let's stand on
principle around and talk about anything
until Jordan we take over Jordan maybe
they have a long-term goal doing now but
if so you do it step by step you try to
achieve something now okay and that's
the only that was also the principle of
the majority of the kibbutz movement
after depa Dom which was the largest
part of the woods movement had the same
principle but they don't him and it's
kind of back there in the history but
nobody talks of them did they never
ended
