what is your personal opinion about the
future of Iran u.s. relationship well I
think it in theory it ought to be it all
work out very well there's no
fundamental reason why the countries
have to be at odds I mean the United
States is the fact of the matter is it's
not discussed much in the West this look
for 50 years the United States has been
torturing Iran first was the overthrow
the parliamentary government than
suicide after shy you know the sanction
the supporting Iraq and the murderous
war the 80 is finally entering the war
almost directly with the shooting done
and Randy an airliner than the sanctions
and until today there hasn't been a
moment in which the u.s. hasn't been
torturing Iran Iran has very serious
internal problems this can only be
handled internally there are the US and
the outside world can consist and
unfortunately it hasn't so there were
periods just a few years ago during the
kethani government when the US could
have taken a constructive attitude
towards Iran which would have helped the
reformist however did the opposite in
fact that they actually did they send a
proposal to push his administration at
the time that they proposed to solve
every single issues that they have and
for even they mentioned in that at the
proposal that they're going to accept it
to a state solution and you know that
that was a very bold movement of that at
that time said
but unfortunately was ignored not I
rejected it its censured the Swiss
diplomat who brought the proposals and
right after Iran was quite supportive of
us activities in Afghanistan Iran was
rewarded by being charged with being
part of the office of him Authority and
then in fact there were ongoing
negotiations between the Iran and the
European Union several years on issues
of uranium enrichment and so on and they
broke down because the European Union
could not live up to its commitment to
make it to give a guarantee that there
would be no military force used against
Durant an agreement was supposed to
include security guarantees and rubinyan
couldn't do them so that collapsed and
there's every reason why those options
could be picked up pursued particularly
because the people of the two countries
degree of a whelming lee in fact I'm you
know the idea that there should be a
extremely threatening and dangerous
conflict when in both countries the
large majority the populations our
agreement is a real
condemnation of the way the nation-state
system functions
