Noam Chomsky thanks so much for joining
me glad to be with Ian one of the things
that's always struck me about reading
your work and listening to your talks is
the ability or the capacity humans have
for self to see you quote people like
John Stuart Mill and and Waldo Emerson
people who are some of the leading
progressives of the time with moral
integrity you quote them in Emerson's
case advocating invading Mexico and in
Mills case imperialism by the British in
India I want to know like I mean it's
natural that we look to people to
emulate and to look as as people with
the moral integrity do you remember when
you first started reading these
philosophers and uncovering some of
their less altruistic sides so now since
childhood it's hard to read anything
seriously and not to realize that the
people you're reading however much you
admire them are human beings with and we
all have failings and the failings often
derived from just general assumptions of
the time that people can't extricate
themselves from we all will surely know
this from our own experiences and it's
hard to learn it's hard to learn about
yourself so for example one many
examples but one pretty striking array
of experiences from the late 60s was I
had to do with resistance against the
war in Vietnam the kids who were
resisting we're facing we're making very
difficult choices your 18 year old kid
you decide okay I'm I'm going to I'm
going to ruin my life I'm going to go to
jail I'm going to go into permanent
exile I'll never see my parents again
my friends but I have to do it because
it's right and if you want to be able to
do that you have to be able to convince
yourself that you're morally upright
that's justified then people tried to do
it but you have to recall that that was
just the bare beginnings of the feminist
movement and inside the resistance
organizations of course there were women
but the women were expected to be
servants they brought up the food you
know took the notes of the men did the
important things and the early stirrings
of the feminist movement and among young
people began with the raising of
consciousness that this is a form of
oppression we don't have to accept it
well at that point young men who were in
fact facing extremely dangerous and
difficult decisions somehow had to come
to the terms with the fact that they had
never faced which they had never faced
that they too are oppressors and that's
hard and it was true for them
particularly because of the extreme
situation they were in but was true for
everyone men just had never thought
about the fact that they were oppressors
in fact women had never much thought
about the fact that they were oppressed
and when these things break into
consciousness you get a new perspective
on yourself and across often be pretty
distressing and that's true all through
life the people you mentioned you know
if if they were alive today and you
could bring their words to them they'd
be shocked how did you have any
experiences yourself having to confront
some I mean you say how hard it is to
look at ourselves honestly in the mirror
were there any experiences you yourself
faced in in confronting your actions and
I guess your your thoughts well that was
one everyone went through the
I was involved with the resistance of
course I was old I was technically a
draft resister but too old to be drafted
but I was very much involved with all
this we all had to face it we faced it
in the resistance support groups we were
taking chances we were I mean I came
pretty close to the long jail sentence
it was possible for all of us so there
were chances but we realized that this
point that the resistance support group
were almost entirely men and the lead
positions were almost entirely men
didn't have to be but they were and we
all had to come to terms with this but
there are many other cases I mean I
recall I'll tell you another experience
which stuck in my mind back in the early
60s I went to a civil rights
demonstration down in the South Jackson
Mississippi it was pretty brutal
State Police beating people bloody
driving up to the states of the federal
building you know a very moving
experiences in the evening in black
churches where people were trading
regain their courage and companionship
altogether an extremely moving
experience a couple of weeks later I
happened I was teaching a summer summer
school in Indiana was and I was walking
across you know nice campus summer
everybody cheerful I was walking across
campus and ran into a kid who had met
down in the demonstration and we talked
little and we just walked across the
campus together and quietly then all of
sudden he turned to me and he said
looking he said talking for the other
plenty of other students around he said
how can they be so interested in
phonemes meaning how can they be working
so hard on narrow technical questions
when this is going on right before their
eyes and that's a
and it's true how can you be but we do
it all that time and we have to face it
all the time if we're honest right this
minute and it's a hard it's a hard
realization and it keeps coming back so
did that have an effect on you like was
this before you had dedicated yourself
consciously to becoming an activist well
first of all I never I mean that goes
back to childhood I was an activist long
before I got to college you know there
was in there in you know it's different
things in the 1930s and 1940s during the
50s I kind of dropped out for a while I
was at college
I was married had kids family you know
got a job but you never expected to get
and it was a pretty passive period
nothing much was going on things should
have been going on a lot of awful things
happening but nobody much was paying
attention to him I'm even South Vietnam
I'm at the time to get involved in
active protest against the war in
Vietnam would have been maybe early 50s
not early 60s I was much too late by
then maybe 80,000 people have been
killed all kind of atrocities and so on
but in the early sixties I came back
into it again mostly with the anti-war
movement partly civil rights later other
things so it was it was revival not not
beginning and when I got back into it I
I did think about it I mean I I knew
enough from experience to know this is
not the kind of thing you can put one
foot in and then walk away if you get
involved it's going to get deeper and
were compelling it'll draw you away and
a lot of things in my life then which I
was like that like my work I like
teaching here but out of family little
kids everything looked nice no but I
said
you know don't you have to make a choice
because once you get into this it's it's
all it's going to drag you farther and
farther which true does one of the
things that personally is an example of
that is you know I can watch talks or
watch documentaries and think about
things like global warming and all these
big issues confronting our times and
then sort of racket it to one side of my
mind and then continue moving on because
it's I think that's what stops a lot of
us from getting involved because the
implications would be that we would have
to drop everything if these things
really were as dire as but of course you
know even the most dedicated people have
to do that I'll tell you another
anecdote which remind this is from India
I was in India I know if you've been
there but I mean it's just a dramatic
experience there's a lot of wealth a lot
of vitality a lot of excitement and
miserable poverty which you just can't
miss it's all around you one time a
couple years ago I happened to be there
and I was driving in New Delhi to a
demonstration where I was going to give
a talk and another person was in the car
with me woman who was also going to give
a talk there she's a woman who had had
taught in the university she was patti
university position but she left and in
order to go live in a poor village in
one of the poorest areas rajasthan where
she lived in a hut and what we would
call describable conditions are working
mainly on women's issues and i think
she'd been there about 17 years by then
so a really dedicated person throughout
her life into it I noticed as we were
driving through this when you drive
through a city as soon as the car stops
there's a horde of miserable people who
come asking for a you know
rupee a penny you know showing a gypsy
woman with a starving child you know
every whore you can think of and she
told me right away don't give anyone
anything because once you do you can't
make any dent anyway and once you do it
just get them out but as we drove I
noticed that she wasn't looking out the
window
and I asked her you know I asked her
when how do you live with all this and
she said the only way you live is not
looking you can't look and survive so
you have to somehow ward yourself off
just in order to keep going and this is
a person who had dedicated her life at a
level that you almost never see but
she's right we all have to do it you
can't survive otherwise but it's easy to
the bracketing so it's necessary in some
sense but it's very easy to overdo it
like take global warming but you
mentioned that's a really dire
catastrophe a Canada right now is on the
verge of destroying civilization
it's almost literally true if Canada
proceeds with tar sand development in
Alberta the effects could be really dire
if Obama approves the XL pipeline which
will then accelerate the tar sands
development and that continues the
effects on human life could be really
severe how much is being done about it
well you can tell me that it's this is
not small it's not like stopping a war
across the ocean is very important but
destroying human civilization is more
important and it's and that your choices
are right before us and you know very
well how people are dealing with it all
of us and for Canada it's particularly
important
one thing you point out is that after
talks dealing with activists and in
developed nations like can in the US you
often get the question well what can I
do
whereas when you go to to developing
nations like Colombia our you talk to
the Kurds and in Turkey they don't ask
you what to do they tell you what
they're doing I just came back from
Turkey and the same thing I was the apt
to be there this time partly for
protests about repression of Kurds but
meant the main invitation was for a talk
at a memorial for an assassinated
journalist the front think been
assassinated a couple years ago to
because he was exposing our median
atrocities a century ago which really
broken with is probably the government
was behind his assassination it's kind
of obscure but that's what it looks like
anyway it was a bad call because the
assassination aroused enormous concern
and involvement and so for example at
this memorial though there was also a
huge demonstration of people going
through Turkey Istanbul big
demonstration at the site of the
assassination people really engaged
there's been a lot of a further exposure
of what happened the efforts to try to
overcome some of the imagery
rehabilitating rebuilding destroyed
churches and things and a boat and I was
talking mainly to activists people were
there but but and these are and you know
being an activist in Turkey is a lot
harder than Canada or us it's a pretty
repressive state as a lot of state
violence this it has for example more
journalists in jail than any other
country in the world the world champion
it's increasing but they're very very
courageous they're energetic they they
want to talk to you about their doing
and how you can help that's normal for
us it's easy and we're very privileged
there's some repression but my
comparative standards we live in very
free societies and there is a lot that
the government can do to you especially
people like us you know who are part of
the privileged sector we go to college
you know that sort of thing and there's
just endless opportunities I mean I just
mentioned one tar-sands
but can go on listing and you know of
others can you take me back to your own
evolution when you were becoming more
active and decided to that you would
have to jump in fully to activism in
politics I guess how conscious was the
decision and what stopped you from doing
it earlier I mean were you worried about
being a rabble rouser when you're a
professor and giving up the comforts I
came along with your life as a
linguistics professor I was very
conscious I thought about it seriously
I mean I wasn't giving up my life I
continued to teach you know I wasn't
giving up my family spent time with the
kids but it's you know it's facing risks
and I assume within about seven or eight
years I was actually facing long jail
sentence which I didn't anticipate
specifically but for what for organizing
resistance which was you know
technically illegal can't say it was
repression was that the not paying taxes
I not paying taxes I started earlier
mid-year around 1965 I guess and that
could have led and sometimes does lead
to the government reaction most of the
time I just take the money basically but
the support for draft resistance was
more serious you know that meant openly
defying Lee openly defying laws
regardless crucial and why wasn't Benny
means the only one to do it but I was
remember the out of here called the
Spock trial yeah well one of the big
trials was I said I was an unindicted
co-conspirator and was named as
the person who would be indicted in the
next trial
mostly the trials were kind of a joke
they didn't know what they were doing
but it was serious enough so that we had
three kids by then my my wife went back
to school after about a 16 year gap plus
we figured she cry left it take care of
the kids and but it's you know it's not
like facing repression in a country like
Turkey
we shouldn't exaggerate it's like you go
to jail you're not going to be tortured
for example and at first there lot of
the early stages there was really not
much to do support for the war was just
overwhelming I mean the first talks I
gave were literally in people's living
rooms or in at church with four people
or something in fact the first efforts
to have demonstrations public
demonstrations here in Boston which is a
pretty liberal City
oh we're just smashed by counter
demonstrators there is a place in Boston
for demonstrations that wasn't common
traditional place for public speaking is
kind of Hyde Park and London that sort
of thing and our first public
demonstration there we planned for 90
was October 65 it's about four years
after the war started into the South
Vietnam was already half destroyed but
it was broken up violently with a strong
support of the liberal press supporting
the Smashing up of the demonstration a
couple years later that it continued
like that but a couple of years later
developed into a mass movement by 68 67
68 it was substantial popular movement
what was the reaction of your fellow
colleagues at MIT and professors I mean
you're right that there isn't many risks
that go along with becoming involved
with politics and activism here in
American and Canada but it seems that as
you
the higher more prestige and more
recognition you've gone from the system
the because you have something to lose
in just a sense of respect from your
colleagues it seems almost harder to to
give that up in a sea there was plenty
support I mean not you know small
minority the faculty were also seriously
involved in fact oddly enough the-- the
library was where the department was
electronics lab was a hundred percent
supported by the three armed services i
was the main academic centers of any
word resistance practically the
practically the whole faculty was even
at either involved or sympathetic
student body to and others around the
college so it wasn't you know not
everyone participated directly but fair
amount of sympathy a lot of antagonism
but okay live with that so you didn't
suddenly would lose respect of your
colleagues or anything like that
many young many because they just don't
see why you're wasting time like this
it's different in different countries I
remember it kind of one country it's
kind of interesting strip add on there
fairly regularly since the early 60s and
there the there was there was an
activist fairly militant group but it
just wasn't the kind of thing to do like
the universities and do things like that
I remember as Japan was one of the few
countries I went to till recently where
I wasn't asked to give political talks I
was asked to give technical talks on the
radio newspapers at general audiences
and so on which was okay and I was
occasionally asked to give a talk but it
was usually by expatriates from
Australia and I remember one talk I gave
two
this must be the mid-eighties probably
about Central America or something like
that was a couple of Japanese professors
came and they came mainly because they
were curious as to why I was spending
time on things like massacres and
torture and terror when I could have
been writing a technical paper on some
problems that came up in footnote 4 of
the latest that's the inverse of this
young guy I mentioned to you at the
summer school in the early sixties and
that's that's a pretty that's a pretty
standard attitude if quite apart from
not liking what you're doing because
people tend more or less reflexively to
support the crimes of their own state
that's why they're mostly unknown so for
example literally unknown I'm this very
very rarely a poll asking people to
assess say the number of people killed
in Iraq or Vietnam or something but when
the polls are taken the results are
utterly shocking the tiny fraction of
the reality because people just have no
sense of it it's just too easy to
protect yourself from you don't want to
know things like that you might know
about a particular atrocity that makes
the news you know belie of a grave but
not not that these things are just
footnotes to much worse trustees but
what sort of advice would you give to
someone just trying to grapple with how
the world really works and how power
works when faced with the fact that you
know the New York Times doesn't
necessarily talk about the crimes of the
West whereas all the crimes of who knows
who Cuba or things like that get a lot
of play how do you start digging I don't
know if you can see a painting that's
half hidden back there but if you look
at the painting afterwards you'll see it
said it's a painting of the truth
it depicts Archbishop Romero who was
assassinated while reading Mass the
Angel of Death hovering over him a six
murdered Jesuit priests led team leading
Latin American intellectuals their
housewife and her daughter very
graphical throughout the leader if
anything like this was 1989 it was the
end it sort of almost brought to the to
an end a bitter violent us war against
the church in Latin America and that's
not an exaggeration started with Vatican
two Pope Ratzinger who just retired
today every yesterday he announced his
resigned he was fighting the war from
the Vatican side he was the enforcer for
the Vatican but at the US Army was doing
it on the American side and they're
proud of it so if you read the talking
points for the School of the Americas
which trains Latin American officers
they announce that they are with pride
that the US Army helped defeat
Liberation Theology Liberation Theology
was a movement which really took off in
1962 when john xxiii vatican ii tried to
transform the church back to what it had
been before was taken over by the roman
empire in the fourth century the church
and persecuted not the persecutors and
that had a big effect in latin america
priests bishops laypeople went out to
bring the message of the Gospels to poor
people preferential option for the poor
the Gospels is kind of a radical
pacifist document people read the words
but they don't think about it and that
set off the Vatican repression and the
much more violent u.s. repression
leading culminating pretty much in that
almost unknown
well if anything remotely like that had
been going on saying Eastern Europe the
90 would ever would know about it we
could had nuclear war but when it's
going on under our eyes and we're doing
it you don't see it I presume it's
barely known in Canada but on the
anniversaries of say the assassination
of the archbishop or the Jesuit
intellectuals there'll be a
commemoration in Boston but usually net
church and a poor neighborhood not not
in Harvard Square so how do we besides
just I mean when there's so little
information out there about the crimes
that we do have information we can get
the information but it's alternative I
guess but you have to work them it's not
going to be in the headlines like the
headlines about the Pope today and the
articles they may be a word about how
he's opposed to liberation theology
which I'm going to find anything about
what I just described but the
informations there I mean people write
about it the original documents are
there we kept we can claim that it's
work to get information but not that we
can't get it but until it occurs to you
that there is a difference it has to
occur to you as to you courteous there's
a problem otherwise you don't look and
most of the time it's easier just to
listen everything's okay
on the same is true one I mean even
things like the fate of the species
let's go back to the tar sitt again
you know really major issues are at
stake like the fate of the human species
but it's much easier to pretend I don't
know anything about it I find myself
avoiding about articles in the paper
yeah it's painful to know and if you
don't it's a little bit like this Indian
woman looking out the window if you look
at the window you've got to do something
about it that's hard I know you don't
dwell on spiritual or psychological
explanations of
how power works and why we do what we do
but it seems that the root of what
you're talking about in many ways is
first a need to let go of our attachment
to both our ego and I guess our
attachment to our pride of State or
pride of group could you talk about that
I don't think there's anything profound
to say I think it's pretty clear what it
is I mean we all have some of us really
suffer but not you and me and the people
we know we have fairly decent lives you
know you do a lot of things we like to
do a lot of rewards and so on work we
like people we like and so on and it's
it's just easier not to face the kinds
of realities which would lead us to
giving it up even in part so it did draw
you close the window we do it all the
time and as I say at some level you
couldn't survive if you didn't do it
like the woman at the car in New Delhi
she desert I respect that she has to
otherwise be no way for her to survive
but for most of us we close the window
much too early were like these people
that young man in Indiana was referring
to rather work on a technical problem
one thing that you always talked about
or point out when people ask certain
questions about ask advice on how to do
this or how to best achieve change is
that there's no magical answer there's
no easy solution people want the quick
fix but what it really takes is years of
boring work and dedication to organizing
and protests and education and things
like that things that aren't necessarily
sexy or exciting
they're already knotek's all right you
know they can be exciting but the point
is they're not going to give instant
gratification
they'll be you can make efforts
sometimes to succeed partially they'll
be reaction
lose and you go on I mean take what's
happening right now and say a gyp tan
Tunisia those two uprisings were
extremely important historical events I
mean there have been major achievements
on the other hand there have been huge
failures there now at a stage where
might all collapse the chaos in the
streets in both Cairo and Tunis nobody
knows words nobody can even think of a
simple solution it seems too essential
that we deal with sort of the
uncertainty that we don't know if our
efforts are going to be successful or
not and we don't know what's going to
actually work the only thing we know is
complete come a lot of confidences and
we don't do anything things will get
worse is that what keeps you going I
guess just knowing that things can
change but you don't know when or how
yeah you never know when or how I'm in
take say the Occupy movement I mean if
I'd been asked one week a day before the
Zuccotti Park encampment I'd have said
it's a waste of time because couldn't
possibly work I was totally wrong it
sparked the mass popular movement you
could say the same about Taher square go
back to 1960 a couple of kids and
students black students in Greensboro
North Carolina decided to sit in a lunch
counter of course they were arrested
brutalized and off could have been the
end of it but it turned out others came
Andreessen you had people writing
freedom buses pretty soon you had mass
marches did demonstrations ultimately
there were achievements achievements are
limited so the were achieved Minh Simon
was undoubtedly the civil rights
struggle had major lasting achievements
on the other end if you take a look at
the african-american population in the
United States they're about as bad off
as they were then and then she's just
enough I mean you're in your 80s and you
maintain a schedule that would tire most
thirty or elles year
constantly answering emails you're
flying across the world you're giving
interviews so what personally keeps you
going then just in the face of having to
deal with and talk about things like the
essential end of the species because the
alternative is totally unacceptable so
do what you can do and you've already
going into cynicism just by the cases
where things have changed pardon and you
avoid cynicism by just seeing how things
have in fact change over the years
I don't know cynicism is a kind of an
evasion we should face to face the world
realistically there's a lot of
unpleasant things what it's not a base
for cynicism which base we're doing
