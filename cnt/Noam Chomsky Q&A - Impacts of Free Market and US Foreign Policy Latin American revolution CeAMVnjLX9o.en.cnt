what can be done by the u.s. in order to
regain its leadership in the Americas
well I hope nothing can be done that's
up to a large part American citizens are
they going to tolerate these monstrous
crimes they can't are they even gonna
know about them so for example
everything I've said here you can find
out for yourself is perfectly well
documented in public the available
material but almost nobody knows about
it if you do a poll on the Harvard
faculty let's say educated people I
suspect very few would know anything
about this except maybe a few
specialists and it remember it holds not
just in Latin America but everywhere
same in Southeast Asia same in the
Middle East same in every place where
the world dominant power functions which
is why the United States is regarded in
the world as the greatest threat the
world peace
far in the lead of any other country
these incidentally are Gallup polls
polls taken by the leading us polling
agencies the only country that's way
behind in second place is Pakistan and
that's probably inflated by the Indian
vote essentially nobody's nobody's
competing when you hear the rhetoric in
the United States you know presidential
candidates newspapers editorials Iran is
the greatest threat to world peace but
that's us doctrine the world doesn't
agree and as I said we're protected from
that information by the press and
similarly here so to repeat I would hope
that it won't the US won't be able to
recover just as I would hope that Russia
would not be able to recover its control
over Eastern Europe as much smaller
domains what has changed is pretty
markable for 500 years the latin america
has been pretty much in the hands of
foreign powers and a small small local
wealthy elites the typical latin
american state had a small very rich
Europeanized often white elite ruling
over a mass of enormous poverty in
potentially very rich societies the
elites were foreign oriented the capital
went abroad imports were luxury goods
radically different from East Asia
incidentally the countries were
separated from one another they didn't
even have communications and they were
dominated by by foreigners in the last
century so that means the United States
US intervention in Colombia goes back to
Theodore Roosevelt carrying out anama
and goes on the and that's changed in
the last ten or fifteen years there was
a strong reaction to the neoliberal
programs which had devastated Latin
America
I mean Latin America was the most
obedient student of the so-called
Washington Consensus and so it suffered
most others suffer too but Latin America
was pretty awful and there was a
reaction to it and it's a pretty
remarkable fact I mean the change of
something that's been going on for five
hundred years is not a small moment in
history the Latin American countries are
taking small steps some steps towards
integration there are organizations that
bring them together on us or Marcus or
Alba and so on there are the beginning
to do an integration is a prerequisite
for independence means you can't get
picked off one by one there are
there's mutual support the US has been
the war us war against Cuba has been
going on for 50 years a very serious war
it's not discussed here but major
terrorist war launched by the Kennedy
administration crushing embargo the
Latin America finally in the last 15
years Latin America has strongly risen
up in opposition to it this showed up at
the preceding summit that Carter Hannah
so that in Colombia 2012 where the u.s.
was taught US and Canada were completely
isolated from the entire hemisphere on
to issues Cuba and drugs that's
unprecedented nothing like that has ever
happened
I mean it's so extreme that Obama was
finally compelled to take some small
gestures towards renormalizing relations
with Cuba here it's presented as a noble
gesture you know we're helping Cuba
escape from its isolation and so on
actually it's a small gesture helping
the United States escape from its
isolation and leaving most of the system
still in place but all of this is
enormous ly important there have also
been efforts to deal with some of the
internal problems they're halting
efforts you know a lot of problems with
them a lot of flaws but something is
being done and that's basically new not
totally new but substantially new and I
think that's extremely important will
the u.s. be able to cover I I doubt it
I mean in general power in the world is
being somewhat diversified there's a lot
of talk about American decline which is
pretty misleading the United States are
still in comparably the most powerful
and rich country in the world but there
is a decline and actually the decline
goes back to the 1940s it's been pretty
steady but in the last year's it's
noticeable and
the China's one poll the BRICS or
another potential potential power group
and I doubt that the post-war system of
the unilateral domination of the world
can be reconstructed but the United
States for example has lost all its
military bases in South America Colombia
was supposed to be the last hope six
military bases but to everyone's
surprise at least my surprise the
Constitutional Court man so right now
there are none the it was a nice comment
which you probably saw by Rafael Correa
the Ecuadorian leader who was when the
United States he kicked the United
States out of its last base the monta
base in Ecuador and what he said is to
the United States you can keep the base
in monta if we can have a military base
near Miami right axia Ava Morales said
something pretty similar and said you
can keep fumigating in Bolivia if we can
fumigate in North Carolina and Kentucky
where there's a much more lethal crop
grown in comparably more lethal tobacco
that murders tens of millions hundreds
of millions of people around the world
but it's protected so we're all I said
well let us if you want to destroy that
you can destroy coca but this kind of
reaction to the United States is
completely in 2002 director Andrew Davis
launched the movie the movie collateral
damage starring by Arnold Schwarzenegger
and young leg asanam in this movie
Hollywood
generalized among the American people
into the entire war a clear support to
parity to paramilitary armies by some
sectors of the US government last year a
scholars Dib and Naidu wrote a working
paper issued by the National Bureau of
Economic Research and in this space they
estate is that I'm
in US military assistance assistance
leads to differential increase in
attacks by paramilitaries but has no
effect on guerrillas attacks
eight also results in more paramilitary
but not guerrilla homicides during
election years particularly in
politically competitive municipalities
the findings suggest that foreign
military assistance may strengthen our
meant non-state actors undermining
domestic political institutions and of
the court in the Americas summit Barack
Obama highlighted his commitment with
the Colombian peace process there are
some roles in the peace process today
such as victims victimizers and
facilitators among others which do you
think should be the role of the US
government in the peace process in order
to help Colombia to gain a lasting peace
I suspect the biggest help the United
States can provide is to withdraw from
involvement in Colombian affairs
we have been mostly quite harmful I
discussed some of it but it's pretty
general the United States it's we really
shouldn't be this is the kind of
question that's asked in US policy
circles and academic circles all the
time
what can the u.s. do to help okay there
is something called the Hippocratic oath
no harm when you stopped doing harm then
you can ask the question what can we do
to help and there's a long way to go
before we get to that this is results
that you mentioned are on the front page
every day so take a look at this
morning's newspapers New York time lead
story in The New York Times this morning
it's a very interesting and what it
tells us about the culture in which we
live
Americans that is Harvard you know high
culture it's a discussion of the fact
that the drone attacks killed
inadvertently killed an American hostage
an Italian hostage and that's a big
issue because we're not supposed to kill
Americans and Italians it's a huge
discussion about it
but what about killing the people who
live there there's no question at all
about that the drone campaign is the
most extraordinary global terrorist
campaign that has ever been envisioned
I mean suppose that Iran had a campaign
in which they were assassinating people
all over the world who they suspected
might want to harm Iran so for example
they could start with the editors of the
New York Times in the Washington Post
who have just run articles not know
needed to suspect they've run lead
article op eds calling for the immediate
bombing of Iran so we know they're
planning to harm Iran so let's kill him
suppose they were doing that all over
the place what would we think well we
wouldn't have to bother thinking does it
be a nuclear war but when the US does it
it's fine no criticism the drone
campaign officially officially my words
is attacking suspects people suspected
of maybe wanting to harm the United
States someday Obama's meetings you know
whatever they are
Tuesday morning meetings decide who
we're going to kill today who is on our
kill list a suspect who we think might
want to harm us and this goes on without
virtually no comment the only comment is
about killing an American that's a
problem or what's called collateral
damage when you attack a village and
with a drone and you kill somebody and
half a dozen other people standing
around they get killed too that's
collateral damage and that's considered
a kind
problems of their studies of how much
collateral damage there is and that's
not so good now but what about killing
the suspect I mean this happens to be
the 800th year of commemoration of Magna
Carta it's great contribution was it was
limited but it established the principle
of presumption of innocence that a
person cannot be harmed unless fried by
a fair to had due process in a trial by
peers another the cont this comes up in
the discussions at this morning's Times
for example there's a claim by the US
government that the suspects have due
process because they're they are
considered in the executive branch of
the United States government the United
States government considers whether
there are proper targets for
assassination
so that's due process that's the
position of the US government the
liberal government for liberal Justice
Department and there is no comment about
this I mean try to find it it's just
considered fine if we want to kill
anyone we suspect that maybe someday
harming us why shouldn't we and this is
considered really great because it
doesn't put Americans at risk just kills
other people's or what could be better
now there is the problem of that you
mentioned it creates terrorists it's a
terrorist generating system and that's
very well known in high places all kind
of commentary about it and the reason is
pretty obvious you bomb a village in
Yemen you murder some guy who may may or
may not be the guy you were trying to
kill you kill a bunch of other people
across the street it inspires a desire
for revenge in fact that's one of the
reasons why the United States is the
most feared country in the world things
like this and we we Americans are
responsible for we accept it we tolerate
it
it's right in the peak of the
intellectual culture Harvard University
no protest about it accepted and it is
it does have these negative effects of
generating more terrorists in fact if
you look at the terror the terror took a
war on terror in the last 15 years it
began in a small tribal area in in
Pakistan on the Afghan border
it's now all over the world what we call
terrorism is spread all over the world
it's a wonderful success you know we've
managed to magnify what we call
terrorism meaning what they do not what
we do all over the world
North West Africa and South Asia you
know at least of course everywhere and
the inability to perceive this is
mind-boggling so just let me give you
one last example as endless the day
after the Iran array you know draft
agreement was was was accepted of course
there was ton of coverage for the next
day read the New York Times most
important paper in the world the front
date front-page story by think piece by
Peter Baker one of their main analysts
and he discusses the agreement the
basically positives as good step but he
says there are problems that we have to
be wary about Iran you can't trust
around because he ran is carrying out
aggression and supporting terrorism and
destabilizing the region and so on and
it gives a couple of examples the most
interesting one is that Iran is
supporting groups in Iraq which kill
American soldiers that's a real crime
like when we invade a country destroy it
the kill maybe a million people
generated couple million refugees that
tear the country to shreds
inspire
ethnic a sectarian conflict that didn't
exist before it is now tearing our the
country but the region apart
that's stabilization if somebody tries
to resist our attack
that's destabilization see if you can
find a comment on that I mean as long as
the culture is at this level of
depravity the world is in real danger
and that's the problem here Columbia hmm
the last thing that I would like you to
come in is this before the free trade
agreement Columbia had a positive
balance of trade with the US for more
than a decade just absurd this free
trade agreement the balance of trade
began to decay
today Columbia has a commercial deficit
with the US of more than 3.3 billions of
dollars in the field one of the examples
of this process is the destruction of
more than 2 million tons of rice seeds
by the Colombian government since 2013
Colombia government destroyed these
farmers seeds to comply then the new
regulation of the free trade agreement
and the WTO regarding property rights as
a consequence thousands of families have
to stop doing what they have done all
their lives what their ancestors have
talked termed by generations in practice
these farmers won't have any chance to
compete with the US rice experts today
they will have they will have to starve
to death or to rely in the income given
by cocaine plantations or get into
illegal armed organizations and again
it's it's happening I'm sorry it's
happening all over the world
that happens everywhere and some of the
cases are but III wanted to say yeah
that the question is is there is there
any convergence or core coherence
between the us compromise with Colombian
peace and its free marketing positions I
doubt it I think the u.s. is interested
in the Colombian peace agreement for
pretty much the same reason that the
u.s. finally abandoned its support for
apartheid the US was the last country in
the world to support apartheid Reagan
who was an extreme racist didn't even
believe that a part I was existed he
said there's just tribal wars you know
Zulu Bantu whites and so on not a single
country was supporting apartheid by
around late 80s except for the United
States but the United States finally did
back down and was willing to accept the
end of apartheid there are a number of
reasons for that
did go into it but one reason was that
there was a compromise on the table
which was acceptable the u.s. business
US multinationals and also to the white
rich the you know the business community
in South Africa the compromise was will
leave the socio-economic system
unchanged but will allow some black
faces in the limousines that's basically
the compromise and the US was willing to
accept that so it finally abandoned
support for apartheid actually there's a
much more fundamental reason which
you're not allowed to talk about in the
United States
it's called Cuba Cuba had sent military
forces to which drove the South African
army out of Angola forced them to
abandon illegally held Namibia and made
it very clear to them that they were not
going to succeed in establishing this
regional support system that they hoped
would protect apartheid and these were
black soldiers and I had a huge impact
in Africa both sides you know black
Africa and white Africa no more myth of
the invincible white Superman you know
and South Africa pretty quickly
capitulated after that we were not
supposed to talk about that here it's
amazing they know that Africans know
about it so Mandela went as soon as he
got out of jail they practically the
first thing he did was to praise thank
Castro for his enormous assistance and
liberating in Africa South Africa in
particular but I think that's the kind
of reason why the US would tolerate the
agreement no the associate they what
wants is for the socio-economic system
in Colombia to remain but without
massacring union activists and human
rights workers which doesn't look nice
you can killing of course the worst
victims are peasants Africa Lumbee ins
and indigenous and so on so I think
they'd accept it but this question about
the rice again it's worth what you
describe is correct but remember that
the rice exports from the United States
are government subsidized there's
nothing to do with free markets nothing
these are massive corporations which
gain from state subsidy and of course
they're going to drive out rice farmers
anywhere
the moment they select the corn farmers
in Mexico that I mentioned and the most
sometimes it's I mean it's kind of so
caught Eskew can hardly even talk about
it well I take the poorest country in
the hemisphere eighty Haiti was
self-sufficient in rice now it has
practically no rice production what
happened there was an election in Haiti
which went the wrong way the patient's
chose somebody the United States didn't
like IRA Steve so a couple of months
later there was a military coup which
overthrew the government installed a at
awful terrorist regime actually visited
during the terror it was unbelievable
it was supported by the United States
they claim to oppose it but actually
trade with the military went to
increased under Clinton finally Clinton
allowed the Marines to enter Haiti to
throw out the military Clinton
that's called a humanitarian
intervention in the United States what
it actually was was reinstatement of the
traditional order and part of it was
imposition on Haiti of an extreme form
of structural adjustment extreme
neoliberalism Haiti was not permitted to
impose any tariffs on import which means
that the Arkansas rice corporations can
flood subsidized of course can flood the
Haitian market no more rice production
in Haiti it got to such an extent that
there were some small businesses
surviving in Haiti one of them was a
chicken manufacturing chicken parts for
sale well it turns out Americans don't
like what a dark meat so this is surplus
of dark meat so what do you do you try
to dump it on someone else they tried to
dump it on Canada and Mexico but those
are functioning governments they used
anti dumping restrictions and they
blocked it Haiti's not allowed to do
that thanks to the free trade agreements
they have to observe the free market not
like us so the so they were the market
was flooded by exports from Tyson you
know the other big good meat producers
the end of that industry this kind of
thing goes on all the time I said it's a
staple of economic history it goes back
to England and India England and China
you know that's
how modern history modern economic
history developed the rich don't accept
market discipline why should they know
they impose it on the poor that's called
free markets but take a look at the way
it actually works hi professor thank you
for coming I'm one of the organizers and
we wanted the conference to be a very
sort of heuristic and instructive thing
for a lot of students and and young
scholars in Harvard MIT in the
surrounding area too to start thinking
about our responsibilities and roles
towards Columbia so as a scholar and
activist I wanted to hear your comments
on what you think we are scholars
students potential activists what can we
do to sort of remain critical towards
Columbia towards the US and to be
constructive in both our scholarship and
all the work that we do well my own
feeling is that the most important task
is to overcome the cultural backwardness
of the United States and I mean that
quite seriously people here you can't
really accuse it of them of immorality
they don't know if you go through a good
educational system in the United States
you don't know any of this where you
gonna find out if you read the
newspapers you don't find it if you look
at scholarship yeah the scholars know so
for example the John cotesworth one of
the leading scholars points out and not
obscure place the Cambridge University
history the Cold War major scholarly
study his chapter happens to be on Latin
America he points out that since 1960
that's the period I've been talking
about repression violence atrocities
torture in the u.s. domains of Latin
America far exceed anything that
happened in Eastern Europe
that's not people's picture the picture
they have is the opposite you know we
talked about dissidents the term did the
very term dissident refers to East
Europeans and not to the
six Jesuit intellectuals who were
murdered by us run back spiritus
security forces in El Salvador in 1989
they're not dissidents the dissidents
are people who oppose governments we
don't like and that's the general
picture that's American intellectual and
moral culture and that has to be that
needs to be cured and the people who can
cure it best are the people who know
something who have the resources that
privilege the access to try to raise the
educational and moral level cultural
moral level alright let's take one two
questions from the audience once one
from Twitter and then we're finished
hey I'm Marie gerberg from the Harvard
Kennedy School and mine is the small
addition to that question in kind of a
practical sense at meetings a lot of the
discussion about the policy failures
comes from these decisions that are made
and and many of us will be making some
level of those decisions what are the
questions that we should be asking
ourselves when we're sitting in those
meetings well in my view the kinds of
questions have been talking about you
might ask yourself the question why is
the United States considered the great
pot by a large margin the greatest
threat to world peace in the world peace
now what is a free trade agreement and
what are the consequences of free trade
agreements and why does the free trade
agreement so-called with Mexico lead to
a flood of undocumented immigrants from
corn producing regions which didn't
happen before you might ask why in 1994
when NAFTA was passed the why did
Clinton also begin militarizing the
border it was a coincidence maybe why
has the US aid like large strokes
pointed out and many others why has US
aid
consistently correlated with torture
Massacre undermining democracy and so on
those are all questions we could ask
what is it about our society that is
having these consequences now what is it
about our moral culture that can allow
us to read that Iran is too stable
destabilizing Iraq by supporting people
who are killing American soldiers who
invaded and destroyed the country the
wood is it about our moral and
intellectual culture that allows us to
read that and not to notice that
something's wrong and so on across the
board these are all questions that I
think questions is not on the surface
don't think about it we have a social
protest has to do with free trade
especially with the
with military view in this perspective
we continue the need for this course
community in this work so I want to say
that your international voice to
continue telling people the violation
of human rights and the activism
Columbia and even though we are in
dialogue with the FARC a repression
continues in Colombia and also defenders
of the human rights are being
assassinated not surprisingly I couldn't
agree more but it's not really my
responsibility that's everybody's
responsibility now this has to be a
large-scale effort Colombians within
Colombia people here because of our
crucial role and extraordinary power so
yeah I think everything you said is
correct all right we'll take one last
question here and then we'll move on
well thanks very much
Chomsky my name is Malone coterie I'm a
visiting scholar at the MIT program on
human rights and justice and I was
Special Rapporteur at the UN for a
number of years and I just wanted to ask
you if I mean I know it's not the topic
for this afternoon but if we can put
aside the United States for a second and
look at the history of how the Colombian
government successive governments on
their own have deceived their population
in the sense that you know they've
played a very sophisticated game of
pretending that it's a democracy we
don't have an armed conflict I am the
question I have for you is what role do
you feel the United Nations for example
can play because you know this is a
two-way thing the Colombian government
also has human rights obligations
they're participating in the Universal
Periodic Review there's huge economic
social and cultural rights issues so how
can the international community which is
a whole lot of people aside from the
United States can also contribute in
that kind of a nation-building process
that goes beyond peace because you know
there's a whole post-conflict industry
and it's a whole thing of peace but we
have to do much more work after that
right and there's so many Colombians who
are living or not in a conflict
situation right now
so what needs to be done you think from
the UN where it can be
be effective and which includes the
people from Colombia Thanks
well me write about the nature of
Colombia father
Javier's book genocidal democracy is
captures it quite accurately the UN has
had projects as you know in colombian as
some of them are pretty constructive I
think drug projects of peace projects
others but the UN is not an independent
actor the UN can act just insofar as the
major powers allow and that means
primarily the United States the UN
cannot so for example the the UN
Security Council in 1986 considered
resolutions calling on every state to
observe international law the u.s.
vetoed that ends that I mean the
resolutions didn't mention anyone in
particular but everyone knew who they
were referring to the USA just rejected
the International Court of Justice
orders to stop its attack on the Caraga
but the US says no I'm sorry we veto the
resolution that's the end of it
Britain and France cooperated by
abstaining but but the UN can do many
things and has had often a positive role
of the kind but it it's gonna have to be
it will require that the United States
not inhibit what it does maybe even
possibly support it but at least not
inhibited but yeah I think could have a
positive role then it has elsewhere like
truth commissioners things like that
I meant the UN Human Rights Council
because the United Nations Human Rights
Council with the universal review and
the fact that you know if you have a
talented and educated local population
that can relate to that there have been
changes in a number of countries and
yeah you know maybe that could be aware
of it is a possibility I mean all of
these institutions like the Human Rights
Council are
compromised by the participation a lot
of the participants are leading human
rights violators so it's all kind of
compromised but nevertheless some things
can be done all right with a lot of
things to think about I want everyone to
you
