you
there have been clearly quite
significant changes in global order
they're underway right now but before
returning through them I'd like to say
just a word about the fact that they may
not continue for very long there's an
unfortunate reason the reason you all
know I'm sure is that for the first time
in human history we are facing realistic
questions of species survival at least
in any decent form that concern is not
new or unfortunately nothing much has
been done about it
over half a century ago
in July 1955 two of the greatest figures
of the 20th century Bertrand Russell and
Albert Einstein issued an extraordinary
appeal to the people of the world to
face a choice that in their words is
stark and dreadful and inescapable shall
we put an end to the human race or shall
mankind renounce war Russell and
Einstein were of course thinking of
nuclear war there have been many very
close calls or since it's kind of a
miracle but the species has survived
this far and they continued in fact even
in recent weeks there's time I may say
something about them and there's a
companion threat which they didn't
realize at the time but it's now
understood that's environmental disaster
meeting in Bonn right now that almost
certainly will have no outcome that is
supposed to deal with it the threat of
environmental disaster was highlighted
by a report last week from the
International Energy Agency the report
was that the greenhouse gas emissions
had increased by a record amount last
year despite the recession and that the
chances are now quite slim for holding
global warming to two degrees Celsius
level that's considered to be the
threshold for really dangerous climate
change and we may have passed it I'll
return briefly to both of these matters
merely noting that they cast a dark
shadow over any discussion of global
order well let's put those grim
prospects to the side and consider the
evolving global order one major theme
widely discussed is what's called
American decline it's real but I think
it's sometimes misinterpreted it's
commonly described as another stage in a
long-term shift of global hegemony from
east to west crossing the Atlantic then
moving across the Pacific to the rising
powers China and India and their recent
growth is indeed spectacular but I think
this is an error of interpretation and
though there is a significant global
shift I think it may be different than
this one
well proceeding to approach that let's
look back briefly to the evolution of
the contemporary global order beginning
with World War 2 and it made a huge
change the changes and continuities
since that time are significant they're
very real and they're quite instructive
it's worth thinking about them from the
outset of the war in 1939 Washington
anticipated
that the war would end in with the
United States in a position of
overwhelming power
there were high-level meetings right
through the war 1939 to 1945 high-level
government officials and
non-governmental foreign policy
specialists a mentor to lay out plans
for the post-war world they delineate
'add what they call the grand area that
the US was going to dominate and it
included the entire Western Hemisphere
the entire Far East and the former
British Empire which the US would take
over including crucially its Middle East
energy reserves as Russia began to grind
down the Nazi armies after Stalingrad a
grand area planning changed the goals
expanded to include as much of Eurasia
as possible at least its economic core
in Western Europe and within the grand
area there were certain policies which
still hold I simply read them within the
grand area of the United States would
maintain
unquestioned power with military and
economic supremacy and it would ensure
the limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by states that might
interfere with its global designs these
are doctrines that still prevail though
the ability to impose them has declined
it's very clear from the documentary
record that President Roosevelt was
aiming at United States hegemony in the
post-war world I'm quoting the accurate
assessment by one of the leading
diplomatic historians British historian
Jeffrey Warner one of the major
specialists on the topic and much more
significant the careful wartime plans
were very soon implemented in
thoughtfully and in great detail and
it's not surprising that the US had
those plans at that time the United
States was in a position of historically
unprecedented power it had literally 50
percent of the world's wealth an
incomparable security controlled the
Western Hemisphere controlled all those
oceans that controlled the opposite
sides of both oceans the State
Department planning which was largely in
the hands of George Kennan the head of
the State Department planning staff it
assigned to each region of the world
what they called its function in Latin
America the function was to fulfill the
Monroe doc
of 1823 the doctor announced that the US
would dominate the hemisphere but
couldn't be implemented at a time the
British were much too powerful but after
the Second World War you could implement
the Monroe Doctrine that was our little
region over here as the Secretary of War
Henry Stimson explained while demanding
that all regional alliances be
dismantled except for Aaron which would
be expanded the function of Southeast
Asia was to provide resources and raw
materials to the former colonial masters
the United States had little interest in
Africa at the time so canon assigned
Africa to Europe to exploit his work for
Europe to exploit for its reconstruction
could imagine a different relation
between Europe and Africa in the light
of history but that wasn't considered as
for Europe itself it was to be
reconstituted but in a very specific way
it was to be reconstituted only after
the labor and the left were suppressed
and that's the core of the anti-fascist
resistance of course and they had to be
suppressed and the traditional order had
to be reestablished including fascist
collaborators that sometimes recovery
required considerable violence and
large-scale subversion continued for
many years and Italy intended well into
the 1970s for Germany
it was necessary I'm quoting to veto the
major Union constitutions to forcefully
terminate in social experiments to bar
early co-determination efforts and more
generally to wall off the western zone
from the east that was canons
interesting phrase planners were
concerned that they would not be able to
compete with social and economic
pressures coming from the east so
therefore your western Germany had to be
walled off that meant left labour
influences and they were very explicit
about it then later came the Marshall
Plan which doubtless aided European
reconstruction but it had other goals as
well in reality the Marshall Plan if you
look at what happened it was very
largely a taxpayer subsidy US taxpayer
subsidy to US businesses most of the
money never left the United States and
that's appreciated by the beneficiaries
in the United States the domestic
beneficiaries so Ronald Reagan's
Commerce Department pointed out that in
their words the Marshall Plan set the
stage for large amounts of private and
US direct investment in Europe
laying the groundwork for the rise of
multinational corporations that time
almost all American business week the
main Business Journal described
multinational corporations as the
economic expression of the political
framework expressed by established by
post-war policymakers in which American
business prospered and expanded on
overseas orders fueled initially by the
dollars of the Marshall Plan and
protected from negative developments by
the umbrella of American power
that's 1975 it was always recognized
that Europe might choose to follow an
independent course perhaps along gorlice
lines and NATO was partially intended to
counter that threat and that was seen
very clearly and when the in 1989 1990
when the official pretext for NATO
dissolve official pretext and natives
there to protect Western Europe from the
Russian of words no more Russian hordes
anyone who believed the propaganda of
the preceding years should have expected
that
wouldn't dissolve on the contrary it was
expanded to the east in violation of
very explicit pledges but only verbal
pledges to Gorbachev who was pretty
upset when they were violated but the
washington pointed out to him that the
pledges weren't on paper and if he was
stupid enough to accept the gentleman's
agreement that's his problem
so in violation of the pledges expanded
to the east and since then it's been
expanded well beyond it's now a
officially a u.s. run
global intervention force it's official
task is controlling the crucial
infrastructure of the global energy
system a pipeline sea lanes and so on
nevertheless what's called American
decline ISM set in very quickly the
grand area began to unravel
it's very seriously by 1947 with what's
called the loss of China which is an
interesting terms the term constantly
used debates about who's responsible for
the loss of China and the phrases worth
thinking about that you can only lose
what you possess and legitimate and
ownership of
the world has just taken for granted
it's not surprisingly given given the
scale of us power Southeast Asia began
to go the same way first in Indochina
but much more seriously in Indonesia
much more valuable prize in 1958
President Eisenhower carried out the
largest intervention in postman
since World War two the goal was to
support a military revolt overthrowing
the government the idea was to split off
the outer islands that's where most of
the rich resources are that failed but
in 1965 there was a us-backed military
coup in Indonesia which installed the
dictatorship of General Suharto carried
it out with staggering bloodbath that
was a gleam of light in Asia in the
words of the New York Times hundreds of
thousands of people were slaughtered
mostly landless peasants and the country
was thrown open to Western exploitation
euphoria and the West was virtually
unconstrained years later the McGeorge
Bundy who was the national security
adviser for presidents Kennedy and
Johnson he reflected in retrospect that
the United States should probably have
called off the Nam
in 1965 since the major objective had
been achieved the major objective we
know from declassified documents was to
prevent what's called the virus of
independent nationalism from spreading
contagion to the rest of the region
possibly even Japan was called the super
Domino by the eminent Asia historian
John dower the fear of contagion from
the virus of independent nationalism
that's the terminology later of Henry
Kissinger Nixon administration that's a
leading theme of post-war history one of
the major themes in fact well our little
region over here Latin America that
posed similar dangers early on in 1954
the United States overthrew the first
democratic government in Guatemala
installed a brutal dictatorship that
carried out horrendous crimes and
ultimately a virtual genocide of the
Mayans and the highlands still fleeing
to the United States all with the strong
support of the Reagan administration but
the contagion nevertheless spread in
1962 President Kennedy shifted the
of the Latin American military which of
course the United States can do it
shifted the mission from hemispheric
defense which was a kind of a holdover
from World War two to internal security
internal security has a very definite
meaning means war against the population
of the brutal war and the consequences
are described by Charles meach Lane he's
the man who led counterinsurgency and
internal defense planning in the Kennedy
and Johnson administration's now he
described Kennedy's 1962 decision quote
him as a shift from toleration of the
opacity and cruelty of the Latin
American military to direct complicity
in their crimes to u.s. support for the
methods of Heinrich Himmler's
extermination squads just recently
Cambridge University Press published the
academic history of the Cold War Latin
American one of the contributions is by
Latin American scholar John John
cotesworth and he wrote writes that from
that time the early sixties to the
Soviet collapse in 1990 quoting the
numbers of political prisoners torture
victims executions of nonviolent
dissenters in Latin America vastly
exceeded those of the Soviet Union and
its East European satellites all
supported sometimes instituted by
Washington that included a long series
of religious martyrs and mass slaughter
as well the last major violent act was a
week after the Berlin Wall fell and
brutal assassination of six leading
Latin American intellectuals Jesuit
priests the perpetrators were an elite
Salvadoran battalion which already had
left a trail of thousands of brutally
murdered victims they had just come from
renewed training at the John F Kennedy
School of Special Warfare and they were
acting on direct we now know on direct
orders of the high command of the US
client state which was in always close
contact with Washington well the
consequences of this hemispheric plague
still of course reverberate from the
wartime years in fact since the dawn of
the oil age back during the First World
War
control of the Middle East was regarded
as a very high priority in President
Eisenhower's judgment the Middle East
was the most strategically important
area of the world it was a stupendous
source of strategic power probably the
richest economic prize
in the world in the field of foreign
investment that's the judgment of the
State Department in the 1940s and that
was a prize that the United States
intended to keep for itself and its
allies in the unfolding new world order
of that day
well problems also arose there very
early in the oil-producing regions in
1953 the United States and Britain
overthrew the parliamentary regime of
Prime Minister Mossadegh and iran
installed the daters dictatorship of the
shah and the the general reaction of
liberal intellectual elites was
expressed very clearly by the new york
times editors quote underdeveloped
countries with rich resources and now
have an object lesson in the heavy cost
that must be paid by one of their number
which goes for circa with fanatical
nationalism it's too much to hope that
iran's experience will prevent the rise
of Mossad X in other countries but that
experience may at least strengthen the
hands of more reasonable and more
far-seeing leaders who will have a
clear-eyed understanding of the
principles of decent behavior
decent behavior means you follow us
orders and you don't try to take over
your own resources now that's
the liberal progressive end of the
spectrum go to the right
it's harsher consequences of that are
too well-known the review well that's
the mirrors the sketch of implementation
of grand area policies in what's called
the global South the preferred version
of the post-war area here is quite
different it's actually expressed quite
well by the lead article in the current
issue of Britain's prime foreign policy
journal International Affairs it
discusses all quoted the visionary
international order of the second half
of the twentieth century marked by the
universalization of an American vision
of commercial prosperity well there's
something to that account but it does
not quite convey the perception of those
who were at the wrong end to the guns
and that's typical of Western
ideological pronouncements old
scholarship and journalism and so on a
grand area doctrine restricts the
sovereignty of others but it grants the
United States unrestricted rights among
these is the right to carry out
unilateral military intervention at will
and that doctrine has repeatedly been
articulated for example by the Clinton
administration it explained that the US
has the right to use military force
unilaterally to ensure quoting
uninhibited access to key markets energy
supplies and strategic resources and the
u.s. must maintain military forces
forward deployed in
Europe and Asia in order to shape the
people's opinions about us not by
handing out chocolate bars and to shape
the events that will affect their
livelihood and our security but notice
that that the Clinton doctrine was
considerably more extreme than the Bush
Doctrine the Bush Doctrine received a
lot of criticism but more because of the
style and the content that Clinton
presented it politely Pleasant words and
so on the Bush administration presented
with extreme arrogance and European
leaders don't like to be insulted they
don't mind the doctor in fact they
accept it but presented to us politely
please the same principles govern the
invasion of Iraq after a few years was
becoming quite clear that the United
States was unable to impose its will in
Iraq and at that point the actual goals
of the invasion that couldn't be
concealed any longer behind the usual
pretty rhetoric in November 2007 the
White House issued they called a
declaration of principles which insisted
that US forces must remain indefinitely
in Iraq free to carry out combat
operations and that Iraq must privilege
American investors two months later in
January 2008 the President Bush informed
Congress that he would reject
that might limit the permanent
stationing of US Armed Forces in Iraq or
US control of the oil resources of Iraq
very explicit all of this of course has
been concealed before you know nice
rhetoric about democracy the usual these
were demands that the United States had
to abandon in the face of the Iraqi
resistance that was another step in a
major defeat it's quite unlike Vietnam
where the US did achieve its major aims
that as was recognized by McGeorge Bundy
for example well throughout these years
despite the many successes American
decline ISM continued by 1970 the US
share of global wealth had declined to
about 25 percent and still enormous but
much less than the post-war height of 50
percent
now the other industrial powers had
recovered with considerable assistance
from us violence so the Korean War was a
major stimulus to Japan's recovery and
the Vietnam War gave it another
significant boost it also helped to
spark
South Korea's remarkable development
from the level of a poor African state
to a leading industrial power
substantial share of South Korea South
Korea's foreign exchange
in the 1960s came from mercenaries
vicious brutal mercenaries that they
were supplied providing for the American
war in Vietnam hundreds of thousands of
decolonization was proceeding following
its agonizing course by 1970 the
industrial world was described as by Pol
tri-polar rule three North America and
Western Europe and East Asia at that
time Japan based and already beginning
to become the most dynamic industrial
region of the world or one revealing
index of the decline of u.s. power is
Vito's at the United Nations until 1965
there were none the world was under
control and the UN in fact could be used
as a weapon against the Soviet Union
since 1965 the United States is far in
the lead in vetoes on a very wide range
of issues and Britain is second and no
one else is even close in the 1970s
there were also quite radical changes in
the entire state capitalist system with
the twin processes of
financialization of the economy and for
the u.s. the offshoring of production
that these effects have been substantial
and they've contributed to a
self-inflicted acceleration of American
decline return to that decline has
continued in the new millennium very
dramatic developments have taken place
in our little region over here in the
past decade for the first time in 500
years since the days of the European
conquerors for the countries of South
America have begun to deal with their
terrible internal problems ruled by a
small Europeanized often white a lead
with enormous wealth these are just
little islands and a sea of miserable
poverty they've begun to deal with it
and they've also begun to move towards
integration that's a prerequisite for
independence the US has been expelled
from all of its military bases in South
America one symbol of the current
developments is the formation of an
organization select which includes all
states of the Western Hemisphere apart
from the US and Canada that would have
been unthinkable before its first
meeting is scheduled in a few weeks and
if it becomes operational that'll be
another step in undoing them
a doctor well control of Latin America
was always considered a cornerstone of
global dominance one dramatic moment was
under the Nixon administration when it's
preparing for the overthrow of Chilean
democracy the National Security Council
Planning Board observed that if the
United States could not control Latin
America it could not expect to achieve a
successful order elsewhere in the world
that is to control the rest of the world
Washington's credibility would be
undermined Henry Kissinger put it was
planning the overthrow of the democratic
government and this concern as kissinger
explained was that others who might
separate themselves from US control if
the Chilean virus was not destroyed
before it could spread the contagion his
rage he was actually concerned with
southern Europe he thought there was a
period of what was called euro communism
kind of social democratic movements and
Spain and Italy and Kissinger was
concerned that the Chilean virus might
spread contagion there he didn't expect
Chilean army to land and Rome but he was
afraid that the model might inspire
others actually Brezhnev shared that
concern at the time for other reasons
therefore parliamentary democracy and
Chile had to go
that actually happened on what in latin
america is often called the first 911
september 11th 1973 it's gone from
history in the West now though in terms
of the consequences for Chile and the
whole region that far outweighs the
terrible crimes of what we call 911
September 11th 2001
well important as Latin America was for
world control it paled alongside the
Middle East I've already mentioned some
assessments of its significance at the
dawn of the post-war age despite all the
changes since its is every reason to
suppose that today's policymakers and
basically adhere to the judgment of very
influential Roosevelt advisor Aberle who
observed that control of the
incomparable energy reserves of the
Middle East would yield substantial
control of the world and correspondingly
notice that that doesn't mean access to
the resources in fact didn't much care
about then its control or a different
matter correspondingly the loss of that
control would threaten the project of
global dominance that was very clearly
articulated and during World War two
and has been sustained in the face of
major changes in world order ever since
that day but that's being threatened too
right now US dominance in in that region
is under sewer threat that's the Arab
Spring the Arab world is beginning to
move in the same direction as Latin
America in the past decade that's the
Democratic uprising of the Arab Spring
and the US and its Western Allies are
sure to do whatever they can to prevent
an authentic democracy in the Arab world
it's very important to understand and to
understand why it's sufficient to take a
look at the studies of Arab public
opinion these are conducted by the most
respected US polling agencies in the
United States do not reported all barely
mentioned elsewhere you can tell me
whether they reported here but they're
certainly known to planners they reveal
that by overwhelming majorities Arabs
regard the United States and Israel as
the major threats they face 90 percent
in Egypt most important country in the
region now there are some in the Arab
world who think of Iran as a threat
10% opposition to US policy is so strong
that a majority in the Arab world
believe that security would be improved
if Iran had nuclear weapons
to deter the united states in egypt
that's 80% of the population and other
figures are pretty much similar well the
conclusion is that if public opinion
were to influence policy as would happen
if there's any serious move towards
democracy then the United States would
not only can not control the region but
it would be expelled from along with its
allies and that would undermine
fundamental principles of global
domination the contempt of a lead
opinion for democracy was revealed very
dramatically in the reaction to the
WikiLeaks exposures the ones that
received the most attention euphoric
commentary that were cables reporting
that Arab support of the u.s. stand on
Iran the reference was to the ruling
dictators the attitudes of the public
were unmentioned so it's enough if the
dictators support us doesn't matter
Republic is radically opposed and there
is a guiding principle that was
articulated pretty clearly by the Middle
East specialist of the Carnegie
Endowment Marwan or Ashur is formally a
high official of the Jordanian
dictatorship the principle is there's
nothing wrong everything's under control
in short if the dictators support us and
they control the population
nothing else could matter that's the
Western conception of democracy very
clearly exhibit the watcher doctrine is
rational and very venerable to mention
just one case that's highly relevant
today and ought to be taught to everyone
in schools in the West there was
internal discussion in 1958 President
Eisenhower and Eisenhower expressed
concern about what he called the
campaign of hatred against us
in the Arab world and not by governments
but by the people and the National
Security Council issued a memorandum
explaining it they said they said that
there's a perception in the Arab world
that the United States supports
dictatorships and blocks democracy and
development now we do it in order to
ensure control over their resources and
furthermore they said the perception is
basically accurate and that's exactly
what we should be doing they're relying
on them Washer doctrine long as the
dictators can keep the population or
control no matter what they think if
this campaign of hatred who cares after
9/11 there were you may recall that
George Bush president plaintively
pleaded that they hate our freedom
but many intellectuals the government
actually carried out a study and it
confirmed that they do not hate our
freedom they hate our policies with good
reason namely the ones that the National
Security Council described in 1958 the
truth of the matter is we hate the air
freedom and with very good reason we
being the governments of the West and a
lead opinion in the West well in Egypt
though the old regime still remains
pretty much in place there have been
important victories the press is far
more free labor organizing which was
brutally crushed under the
western-backed dictatorships it now
proceeds effectively and the struggle
for democracy is unabated it's going on
constantly now poses serious threats to
the United States and its Israeli client
for the first time in 30 years
Egypt has allowed Iranian ships to
transit the Suez Canal into the
Mediterranean which is supposed to be an
American Lake actually just yesterday
you may have read was reported that the
Iranian submarines were allowed the
transit into the Mediterranean Egypt is
also planning to exchange ambassadors
with Iran for the first time Egypt has
partially opened the Gaza border if it
proceeds it breaks the us-israeli siege
which is designed to keep the people of
Gaza the barest level of survival that
Egypt has also
brokered an agreement between Hamas and
Fatah two major Palestinian factions
that interferes with u.s. Israeli
policies that go back 20 years to
separate Gaza and the West Bank it's an
explicit violation of the Oslo Accords
but the purpose is to undermine the
prospects for a viable Palestinian state
well there's something more threatening
in the background the Egyptian public is
strongly opposed to the way the 1979
Egypt Israel treaty has been interpreted
by the US backed dictators articulating
the Western interpretation of the treaty
the New York Times describes it as a
cornerstone of the region's stability
that's true only if we understand the
term stability in the technical sense of
foreign policy discourse it means
conformity to US demands it's a standard
usage in reality it's a cornerstone of
the region's instability it was
understood at once by that the effect of
the Egyptian defection as it was called
would be to free Israel to sustain
military operations against the
Palestinian organizations in Lebanon as
well as settlement activity in the West
Bank I'm quoting one of Israel's leading
strategic analysts of maryani's and it's
obvious to remove the Egyptian deterrent
the only major deterrent in the Arab
world
can proceed to do July and in fact
Israel at once prepared to invade
Lebanon as it did in 1982 with strong
support from the Reagan administration
killed maybe 20,000 people destroyed
much of the country it sought to
establish a puppet regime didn't quite
succeed and the purpose was to
consolidate control over the West Bank
and that was frankly admitted there was
no security concern also a settlement in
the occupied territories all illegal
proceeded very rapidly and problem is
that further progress in toward
democracy in Egypt might seriously
threaten the form of so-called stability
that the u.s. seeks to impose well as I
mentioned our public opinion strongly
supports an Iranian nuclear weapons
program but that doesn't mean that we
should do so it could be extremely
dangerous and if you read the foreign
policy literature or even the press it's
full of proposals as to how to deal with
this potential threat one proposal is
studiously ignored the one that's very
strongly favored by most of the world
namely establish a nuclear weapons free
zone in the Middle East now that issue
regularly arises at the
regular in meetings the conference's of
the non-proliferation treaty conference
every five years last one was at the UN
headquarters in New York last year at
that point Egypt was the chair of the
hundred and eighteen nations of the
non-aligned movement once most of the
world they proposed that the conference
call for negotiations on a Middle East
nuclear weapons free zone now that had
been formally agreed by the West
including the United States at the 1995
review conference but they do anything
about it
well international support last year was
so overwhelming that the Obama
administration formally had to agree
while saying fine idea
but not now furthermore they insisted
that Israel be exempted then of course
the u.s. is self exempted from
international obligations and quite
interesting ways which are not well
understood
Washington informed the conference that
no proposal quoting it now no proposal
can call for Israel's nuclear program to
be placed under the auspices of the
International Atomic Energy Agency and
no proposal can call for release of
information about Israeli nuclear
facilities and activities including
information pertaining to previous
nuclear transfers to Israel well so much
for a nuclear weapons free zone
that's one of the many ways in which the
threat of nuclear war is being advanced
right now it's worth bearing in mind how
isolated the United States and its
allies are on Iran the non-aligned
countries again most of the world for
years they've been vigorously endorsing
Iran's right to pursue the uranium
enrichment of the Arab world as I
mentioned even wants them to go on to
nuclear weapons the most important
country in the region turkey is
improving commercial relations with Iran
a very natural trading partner and it's
announed announced plans to triple its
relations at the most respected country
of the global south Brazil has also
strongly supported Iran's position
that's most of the world well the United
States can tolerate a Turkish and
Brazilian disobedience though with
dismay but China is harder to ignore the
press warns on quoting the New York
Times that China's investors and traders
are now filling a vacuum in Iran as
businesses from other countries
especially in Europe pull out the Europe
was obedient to US orders but China
isn't it these sanctions have absolutely
no status those are unilateral US
sanctions China does
the UN sanctions but that's because
they're toothless the issue has to do
with the unilateral US sanctions in
particular China is expanding its
dominant role in Iran's energy industry
well Washington is very upset and
they're reacting with a touch of
desperation the State Department issued
a warning to China that if it wants to
be accepted in the international
community that's another technical term
like stability the international
community means the United States and
anybody who happens to be going along
with it at the moment so if they want to
be accepted in the international
community then China must not skirt and
evade international responsibilities
which are clear namely follow us orders
as I said China does accept the
relatively toothless UN sanctions but it
ignores the unilateral US sanctions it's
therefore undermining stability and the
technical sense it's an illegitimate
exercise of sovereignty in violation of
grand area principles that need not say
that China is quite unimpressed by the
stern warning their picture is we've
been around for 3,000 years disregarding
the barbarians and will continue
and that's very disturbing to the United
States
well the hegemonic doctrines that were
formulated during world war ii they
still prevail
but the cap capacity to implement them
is declining as the world is becoming
more diverse more independent but
they're also as I mentioned there are
domestic factors contributing to
America's decline the society is being
quite consciously undermined at home by
the people who Adam Smith that called
the Masters of mankind those who control
the economic system no time to go into
the details but since the sharp economic
shift towards the financialization and
offshoring of production in the 1970s a
variety of factors have converged to
create a vicious cycle of a radical
concentration of wealth mostly in the
top 1% 1/10 of 1% actually of the
population was such a small group not
even picked up by census figures that's
where the heavy any quality stream
inequality is coming from
now that means the CEOs you know
directors of corporations and hedge fund
managers and so on their activities are
little if any benefit to the economy
probably harmful to it
but that's where the economic power is
concentrated and concentration of
economic power translates at once to
concentration of political power it's
another point emphasized by the
dangerous radical Adam Smith who worked
with the worship but not read too
dangerous to read him he pointed out
that in his day speaking of England the
merchants and manufacturers were the
Masters of mankind and they were also
the principal architects of policy they
made sure that their own interests were
very well served no matter how Grievous
the effect on others including the
people of England well that was the
1770s and that principle remains the
concentration of economic and with it
political power has led to state
policies that are designed to increase
the concentration fiscal policies rules
of corporate governance and deregulation
a lot more meanwhile the costs of
electoral campaigns have skyrocketed and
that has a very clear effect it drives
both political parties deeper into the
pockets of concentrated capital
increasingly the financial capital and
for the Republicans this is reflexive
the Democrats are not far behind
what are there's a lot of commentary
about the disappearance of modern
moderate Republicans that's not quite
accurate they're still there they're now
called Democrats every
shifted so far to the right that
old-fashioned moderate Republicans are
now the leading Democrats in fact if
Richard Nixon were in Congress now he'd
be caucusing with half a dozen people on
the far left
it's not a joke incidentally well while
wealth and power have narrowly
concentrated for most people in the
country
the real incomes have stagnated and
they've been getting by with increased
work hours by now far higher than Europe
even Japan debt which can only go on for
so long and asset inflation like the
bubble the housing bubble is the most
recent case and these bubbles are
repeatedly destroyed by the financial
crisis crises that began to occur in the
Reagan years as the regulatory apparatus
was dismantled the effect is that the
country is being severely weakened well
none of this is problematic for the very
wealthy in particular for the financial
institutions that their share of
corporate profit the rose to an
astonishing 40 percent in 2007 right
before the crash that they caused and
the major players
benefit from a government insurance
policy which is called too big to fail
and as one commentator quipped too big
to jail they can get away with any
crimes they like they can
the result is that with the government
insurance policy they can make and do
make the very risky transactions which
mean rich rewards while adhering to a
stab a sycamore c't principle that you
ignore externalities in a market system
make a transaction you ignore the effect
on others what economists call
externalities in this case the
externality is systemic risk the risk
that if one of your transactions goes
back bad the whole system may collapse
well the system inevitably crashes this
happened over and over again since the
Reagan years each time more serious than
the last but that's not a problem
because they can run to the nine a state
that they nurture ask for a taxpayer
bailout and meanwhile they clutch their
copies of Hayek and Milton Friedman and
I Rand in their hands and that's been
the regular process since the Reagan
years
it's each crisis more extreme than the
last and for the public that is right
now
real unemployment is at the levels of
the Great Depression for much of the
population but the main architects of
the crisis are bigger and richer than
before that's what happens when you
control the state that goldman sachs for
example the biggest criminal they've
just quietly announced seventeen and a
half million dollars in compensation for
last year for executives with the CEO
avoid like fine
they're receiving a twelve and a half
million dollar bonus and his base salary
was tripled in appreciation for having
and much the same is true among among
its colleagues in England it's pretty
much the same
well these developments contribute to
American decline but not as often argued
to the shift of global global power to
China and India the world's becoming
more diverse but despite their rapid
economic progress these two great Asian
powers are hardly poised to assume the
dominant role in the world one
illustration look it up in the internet
is the United the United Nations Human
Development Index kind of measures the
health of the society China now ranks
89th the right next to the Dominican
Republic and El Salvador in two pretty
poor countries in the ranks 115 it's
next to copy their day and Timor Leste
extremely poor countries each of these
two Asian giants also suffers from
extreme inequality about the same as the
u.s. that means that the large majority
of the population ranks even lower the
CIA estimates that China's gross
domestic product per capita at about 20%
of that of the rich countries Europe for
example furthermore they both have you
internal problems ecological and human
India is torn apart by major internal
Wars the China by severe repression and
very wide labor unrest at tens of
thousands of labor actions every year
according to official figures realities
probably greater China is also facing a
severe demographic problem it did have
spectacular recent growth but that
relied very heavily on the availability
of a young and productive labor force
that's a non repeatable historical
phenomenon China scholar one thing
observes that favorable Democratic
demographic dividend is expected and
very soon to disappear and in fact to
reverse sharply with significant effects
on labor productivity and also on social
life in particular ability to care for
the growing elderly population social
system that formerly existed is
collapsed also there's an effect on the
of the sex selection is a illegal but
there's a very definite sex selection
policy though it has led to a vast
excess of males over females in the
population under 20 and that could have
extremely severe social effects the
China is indeed huge manufacturing
center but it's not like Germany China
is basically an assembly plant it's an
assembly plant for the advanced
industrial societies surrounding it
Japan South Korea Taiwan they provide
the parts and the components and the
advanced technology as incidentally does
the United States and other rich
countries of the West everyone talks
about the US trade deficit with China
but when it's properly calculated as has
been done by a couple of economists
namely an estimated in terms of
value-added how much is produced
literally produced in each country well
it turns out that the deficit with China
declines by about 25 percent and the
deficit with its Asian suppliers
increases by about 25 percent so this is
not the kind of export economy that
Germany is quite different the sooner or
later
China will presumably climb the
technology ladder but it's not going to
be an easy path there is in fact a very
noticeable and significant global shift
of power but a different one not from
the West to the agents but from the
global workforce all around the world to
the very rich that's happening
everywhere the tendency is implicit in
what are called more free trade
agreements which have little to do with
free trade and certainly aren't
agreements at least if people are part
of their countries they're mostly
opposed but what are called free trade
agreements with they're designed to set
working people in competition with one
another that globally while protecting
wealthy professionals and providing
investors with extraordinary rights
among other
it's for investors these agreements
allow free movement of capital but they
firmly reject Adam Smith's principle
that free circulation of labor is a
foundation of free trade and in many
other ways too they violate basic free
trade principles and these tendencies
are exacerbated in very ugly ways by
growing xenophobia in the rich societies
notably in Europe the picture that's
developing is very aptly described in a
brochure for investors that was produced
recently by Citigroup it's a huge bank
that once again is feeding at the public
trough as it has done regularly for 30
years in the course of a cycle of risky
loans huge profits and bailout when it
crashes the like goldman sachs they've
gained from the crisis that they helped
create the banks analysts in this
brochure they describe a world that's
dividing into two blocks the one block
they call the plutonomy that's the very
rich globally they're the ones who power
the growth and they're the ones who
largely consume the growth then there
are the non rich majority those are now
sometimes called the global precariat
precariat is a workforce proletariat and
living in a precarious existence that's
increasing status of global workforce in
the United States the precariat is
subject to global working insecure
worker insecurity
it's Galan Greenspan's words when he was
testifying to Congress about the success
of the economy he was managing he said
it's based on growing worker insecurity
which is the basis for a healthy economy
and economists can explain if workers
are insecure they don't ask for rights
they don't ask for wages they don't make
any protests you can harshly exploit
them
the Citigroup analysts advise investors
to focus on the very rich where the
action is they have what they call a
plutonomy stock basket no investment
advice aimed at the very rich and they
point out that that economy's stock
basket has greatly outperformed the
world index of developed markets since
1985 that's when reagan-thatcher
economic programs of enriching the very
wealthy we're really taking off and well
that that's a shift of power and a very
significant one I've barely skimmed the
surface of these critical issues enough
I hope to suggest things you can think
about but I don't want to end without
mentioning another externality that's
dismissed in market systems that's the
fate of the species if you're a
corporate executive that your task is to
maximize short-term profit and
market share that's in fact when your
salaries based on if that happens to
endanger the species that's an
externality you don't pay for it you
don't take account of it in a market
system in the financial system systemic
risk
I mean externality that can be remedied
by the taxpayer but nobody's come to
come to the rescue if the environment is
destroyed and that it must be destroyed
comes pretty close to being an
institutional imperative so US business
leaders u.s. is the most business run
Society in the world so significant in
this respect US business leaders are
quite openly that conducting energetic
propaganda campaigns to convince the
population that anthropogenic global
warming human contribution to global
warming is just a hoax and they're
having some success by now probably
two-thirds of the population doesn't
believe it
well these same people who are running
the campaign's they're just like the
rest of us do they understand very well
that the threat is grave I mean in their
private lives maybe they're contributing
to you know Sierra Club or something but
in their institutional lives they have a
role they have to maximize short-term
profit and market share if they don't do
it they'll be thrown out and somebody
else will come in who will do it
meaning the problem is an institutional
it's not individual since it's much more
severe now this is another vicious cycle
and this one could we'll turn out to be
lethal if you want to get a sense of how
grave the danger is simply have a look
at the new Congress in the United States
which is propelled into power by
business funding and
almost all of the new people in Congress
are climate deniers climate change
deniers don't believe it
and they've already begun to cut
measures that might mitigate
environmental catastrophe so for example
they're trying to get rid of the
Environmental Protection Agency
introduced by Nixon the last liberal
president and now they want to get rid
of it and much else we're still some of
them are really true believers for
example the new head of a Subcommittee
on the environment that he explained to
the press that global warming cannot be
a problem because God promised Noah that
there wouldn't be another flood
one shouldn't laugh I mean if this was
happening in some small remote country
okay then you could laugh but not when
it's happening in the richest and most
powerful country in world history and
before we laugh we might also bear in
mind that the current the financial and
economic crisis is traceable in no small
measure to a fanatic faith in certain
dogmas such as what's called the
efficient market hypothesis and in
general to what Nobel laureate Joseph
Stiglitz fifteen years ago called the
religion and it is a religion that
markets know best the religion made it
unnecessary for economists and in fact
the Federal Reserve the central bank
made it unnecessary for them to notice
that there was an eight trillion dollar
housing bubble it's a lot of money a
trillion dollar housing bubble no
economic fundamentals no relation to
anything that in the economy but they
don't have to notice it because the
market knows best efficient markets
devastated the economy when it bursts
that's a serious religion that interests
incidentally that religion has been
reconstituted almost without change
after the total collapse of this edifice
this intellectual edifice it's a
remarkable event in economic history in
fact an intellectual history it's useful
to think about what's being done in the
richest country the richest most
powerful country in human history and
what's going on in the poorest country
of South America and you know
States Congress is taking the lead in
the Obama administration's going along
in undermining any hope for preventing
catastrophe and as I mentioned it's
driven by deeply rooted institutional
factors first country in South America
is Bolivia they are have taken the lead
in the world in efforts to protect the
environment
their most recent recent effort is to
pass legislation granting rights to the
natural world
well sophisticated Westerners ridicule
such naive Tay
but unless we gain some of the
sensibility of the indigenous majority
in Bolivia the last laughs gonna be on
us well all of this and a great deal
more can proceed as long as the mawashi
doctrine prevails as long as the general
population is passive apathetic diverted
to consumerism hatred of the vulnerable
as long as that goes on the powerful and
do it please masters of the universal
have their will and those who managed to
survive can contemplate the ruins thanks
I would like to quote you in an article
on capitalism Europe and the World Bank
about a court case that that urged
corporations to carry out benevolent
activities or else an aroused public may
figure out what corporations are up to
and take away their privileges now given
that how you on different occasions
quoted John Dewey the government is the
shadow cast by business of a society
does thought cases like dodge versus
Ford affect the behavior of politicians
those were court cases like dodge versus
for the behavior of politicians and fes
which methods are at the disposal of
small and regional operating initiatives
to make politicians aware of the
existence of an aroused public section
well the business can't ignore the
minutes I quote John Dewey but I also
quote Adam Smith said the same thing
the
business can't ignore what the
population is doing actually that's true
of totalitarian states as well so for
example the Nazi leadership could not
ignore public opinion if you look back
the provided benefits to the public to
try to keep him quiet and the same is
true in every totalitarian state and
certainly in more free and democratic
societies that's true and you can see it
happening so let's go back to the Great
Depression the there was President
Roosevelt was unlike the current
leadership he was fairly sympathetic to
social democratic measures but at one
point he told labour leaders who were
pressing for him to do various things he
basically told them you make me do it
what he meant is get out in the streets
protest in the factories carry out
sit-down strikes and organize and if
there's enough public pressure I'll do
it but I've got a face down corporate
power well that's basically the right
advice and that's exactly what happened
the Great Depression is an interesting
case it began in 1929 but the measure
the New Deal measures actually began
about six years later took a while and
by that time there was
massive public protests that was the
period of great labor organizing the CIO
the great industrial union was being
organized and they were moving on to
sit-down strikes the sit-down strikes
are extremely frightening to the masters
of mankind because a sit-down strike is
just one step before saying we don't
need the bosses we'll run the place
ourselves okay at that point you get a
major concerns actually those are the
concerns that in the early post-war
period animated US and British planners
in places like Germany they were
concerned that that was going to happen
under pressure this pressure from the
east that they were worried about it's
one of the reasons they wanted the wall
off Western Germany and the same
elsewhere so these are constant concerns
and it runs from factories to protests
in the streets so for example and it has
effect during the 1960's the next great
in the United States the next major
period of sort of social democratic
activism on the part of the government
that was clearly motivated
the mostly youths at that time activism
in the night you know in which you know
about the radical activism of the 60s
and in fact the business world was very
upset about it and the liberal
intellectuals were very upset about it
if you haven't read it there's a
important book to read called the crisis
of democracy published by the trilateral
commission and around the mid 70s the
trilateral commission is liberal
internationalists from Europe the United
States and Japan three major industrial
countries to give a sense of their
complexion they're the people who
staffed the Carter Administration that's
kind of the liberal extreme that you go
over to the right it's much harsher so
what was the crisis of democracy that
they were concerned about they were
concerned that the population was
demanding too much democracy the people
who are usually passive and apathetic
that what they call the special
interests are getting out in the streets
protesting and assisting on their
demands so who are the special interests
the young the old
workers farmers in fact the population
the population of the special interests
if you notice there's one you read the
book you find there's one interest that
they don't mention corporate power and
there's a reason for that
because there the national interest by
definition so they can never ask for too
much they're supposed to get everything
but the rest of the population which is
supposed to be obey the washer doctrine
supposed to be passive apathetic
diverted to something else now they were
getting out and demanding things and
there were changes and in fact these
changes read primarily in the Nixon in
the Johnson administration but also in
the Nixon administration he as I
mentioned was the last liberal kind of
Social Democratic president well that's
from the pressures and that happens over
and over all the time so that's just a
continuing aspect of modern history so
there's a lot you can do in fact almost
anything you know now free societies
like like ours so the very few limits
the maybe it might be hard you know you
might lose a job or something but you're
not gonna be tossed into a torture
chamber you know it's not like the
global south or totalitarian states so
sure this everything's over exactly what
to do depends on the circumstances in
the issue a lot of it's going on right
now and say Spain with very significant
protests underway
they went on in the United States in the
industrial heartland the Wisconsin
they're right at the same time as the
Arab Spring and also very significant if
that reaches enough of a scale
the people who run the place have to pay
attention fact if you read the business
literature after the 1930s of New Deal
measures they were terrified
now they business literature talks about
that the hazard facing industrialists in
the rising political power of the masses
I'm quoting the need to fight the
everlasting battle for the mind of men
to indoctrinate people with a capitalist
story or else we'll be in trouble if
this sounds like a little red book
that's it's because it is the business
classes are vulgar Marxists and what
they're always fighting a bitter class
war and that values have the inverted
but it's just what you read and you no
malice tracts or something like that
so they understand constantly that it
and if the population gets out of
control then you have to do things
plenty of examples effective modern
history's full of them that's why we
have more freedom and more rights and so
on it's not given as gifts from above
as I understood you it's upon us as
citizens to change the system do you
think democracy yes we have it at the
moment is enough for that or do we need
the forms of direct democracy or new
forms of democracy in principle we've
got institutions that could work but you
have to make them work
it's like roosevelt said make me do it
and there are big barriers to democracy
and so for example is a fundamental
country with the contradiction between
capitalism and democracy you can't
overcome that contradiction so it's
capitalist system has changed over the
years but it's still divided between
people who give orders and people who
take them and as long as that goes on
well it's a plainly a barrier to
democracy if the Masters of mankind Adam
Smith's phrase if they get too much
power then the barrier is very high if
they can be controlled then the barrier
goes down it's dentally to quote John
Dewey again the John Dewey was not a
particular radical he is the leading
social philosopher in the United States
the late 20th century 20th century
throughout his physician was not only
that what you quoted that democracy is
the shadow cast by business over society
he also went on he said this he went on
say this isn't going to change until you
have democracy everywhere meaning
industrial democracy in the workplace
worker control of production and popular
control of every other institution as
long as you don't have that
policy will remain the shadow cast by
concentrated power over society so yeah
there should be if you really want
functioning democracy it's gotta go to
institutional changes significant ones
if wanna shop see Donna is a guest here
pharmacy when you see him
hello my name's Julio's from radio
station in Kosovo Padilla mr. Chomsky I
have two questions you were speaking
about the Arab Spring how do you analyze
the uprisings now masses of people in
Spain and especially in our Greece
countless streets rejecting the party
system and demanding direct democracy
and you were referring to the nuclear
ambitions of Iran how can you do that
without mentioning the slaughtering of
people in Iran from the regime they're
people who are struggling for freedom in
the last year's democracy in Iran in
your area well
first of all Spain and Greece quite
important things are quite important
things are happening in Iran and Greece
but they're different you got to look at
these things in their particular
circumstances so in Greece there's
massive public protest against the
austerity programs that are being
imposed by the central authorities and
those are very destructive programs I
think for all of Europe my own feeling I
think us what you need at a time of
recession is not austerity you need
stimulus in this case they tend to agree
with the Obama administration they do
much too little of it but in Greece it's
harming them very badly and they have
real problems but the programs that are
being rammed down their throat but the
European authorities are very likely
going to destroy the economy so people
are protesting but if you look closely
they don't seem to be protesting for
anything not much at least there aren't
it's hard to find any positive corals
coming out they're opposing what's
happening and they should be but what do
you do well you know there are a few
options not very many didn't talk about
them in Spain
there's major protests and there are
programs but if you look at the programs
they are sensible but mildly reformist
it's so mildly performant they're needed
but the even the press points out
Spanish press well these are feasible
mostly they're calling for a political
reform you know like a change in the you
know electoral system to allow more
participation and so on but those are
things that could be instituted without
you know the Masters objecting much so
it's very important make along we may go
on beyond that but right now it's a
significant call for limited but a
central reform that's you're an increase
roughly in the United States in
Wisconsin which was a big uprising that
tens of thousands of people in the
streets
day after day occupying the state
capital and so on
it went well beyond and not just young
people they were calling for something
else and they've lead defense of rights
that are being destroyed there's an
effort by the right-wing to eliminate
the last limited residue of labor rights
collective bargaining and there's big
popular uprising to produce that
imagined Iran
yeah this is very ugly regime highly
repressive but unfortunately it's not
unusual in the region like Saudi
Arabia's worse nobody talks about Saudi
Arabia because the u.s. is a Western
client so they can do whatever they like
there was an effort in Saudi Arabia to
join the Arab Spring and have a Day of
Rage protests on Friday and the security
presence was so extreme that people were
afraid to go out in the streets nothing
happened and there's no protest in the
West the same in queit loyal dictators
are given the right to do anything they
want disloyal ones you got to do
something about Iran nothing much the
West can do so you know just they scream
about it but can't do anything so sure
we oughta talk about it we ought to try
to help the protesters and try to
protect them but the means are quite
limited in contrast the means are very
great where the West has influence
substantial influence as with the Saudi
Arabia Kuwait Bahrain Egypt and
elsewhere so yes you're right
and what would you suggest doing what do
you get to explain the meaning of nation
building nation building nation building
it's just another fraud you know it's
like there are there are real cases so
the cases that are always presented in
the literature are the success in nation
building in Western Europe and Japan
after the Second World War but take a
close look at what was done first of all
these were societies that had already
been functioning like if you go back to
the 1920s let's say Germany was
considered the you know most democratic
society in the West also the peak of
Western civilization in many ways you
know sciences arts and so on a major
industrial power was all in people's
heads so
to Rica there was no real nation
building and Germany it was just
allowing the local forces to act within
limits and you should it's important to
understand the limits this good
scholarship on this I was quoting some
of it the effort the primary effort in
Germany and the rest of Europe was to
restore the traditional order and to
crush the anti-fascist resistance which
was largely labor based so they got to
be crushed traditional order has to be
reinstalled restored that started right
away as the British and American forces
were beginning to enter Europe that
started in Italy remember Sicily then up
through the Italian peninsula of 1943
one of their first tasks was to restore
the fascist order and a traditional
business rule and to destroy the
resistance and the resistance was pretty
significant
the Italian partisans they were holding
down six Nazi divisions and they had
pretty much liberated the northern part
of the country before the British and
Americans got there the British and
Americans had to destroy the democratic
system that had been developed by the
left movements left labor movements and
to restore the traditional order then
well I won't go through the details but
subversion in Italy goes right on until
at least the 1970s when the record runs
dry to try to prevent those forces from
emerging in Greece it was the same
Britain tried to suppress the anti-nazi
resistance they weren't powerful enough
to do it they called in the United
States in 47 and 48 there was a major
civil war and which may be a hundred
fifty thousand people or so that kill
torture terror or so on essentially
restoring the traditional quasi fascist
order driving out the partisan movement
the left and so on and it happened
everywhere same in Japan same in Korea
that was a post-war policy so yes there
was a kind of a nation building but
nation building in accord with grand
area principles not the pleasant
mythology that people are
school so it can happen but the other
places where there have been economic
and social successes it's been over the
objections of the West there's pretty
good scholarship on this incidentally so
it's the nation-building is kind of like
democracy promotion is another term used
the same way and there's very good
scholarship on it it doesn't penetrate
the intellectual community doesn't reach
the media and so on but it's there if
you want to look into it
speaking of the United States the the
very good source is the work of a man
named Thomas Carruthers he's a true
believer
he's he was a an official in the Reagan
administration Insider working on non
nation building you know democracy
promotion in mostly Latin America but
he's written about it all over the world
he was the head of the law and democracy
project of the Carnegie Endowment no big
prestigious institution written several
books right up to the mid a couple of
year years ago and he points out that
his good scholar and on a scholar he
believes in it but he says that you
speaking about the United States is same
with everyone else
he said US leaders are schizophrenic
they support democracy if and only if it
occurred with social and economic
objectives and he takes say the Reagan
administration which was full of talk of
democracy promotion and he was in it he
was working within it he said they were
sincere but they if you look at the
progress of democracies and
and the Western Hemisphere it did occur
but it occurred in the regions where the
United States had least influence so if
you go down to the southern cone the
southern countries of the Western
Hemisphere there was progress and
democracy and as he pointed out Reagan
tried to prevent it and support the
dictatorships he couldn't manage so
there was some democracy promotion but
he come to the regions near the United
States where US influence was
overwhelming is centrally note moves
towards democracy and he gives the
reason the United States was willing to
tolerate only top-down forms of
democracy in which traditional ruling
groups remain in control and remain
subservient to the United States as it
approximately his words well he
considers this a kind of like a
pathology so the leadership ought to be
sent to for psychoanalysis because
they're schizophrenic
there's a much simpler explanation
plainly but that one's ideologically
unacceptable and the same is true of
nation-building so for democracy is fine
for the West in Eastern Europe great so
you hell what's called democracy and in
fact it's interesting to look at why
they held it they go back to the
business press in 1990 they were very
enthusiastic about the right the
separation of the Eastern European
satellites from Soviet control the
reasons were it would enable business
leaders to undermine the I'm quoting the
luxurious lifestyle of Western workers
because there's a new labor force that's
healthy educated blond and blue-eyed
they didn't say that but that's implicit
that can be exploited very brutally
exploited and that'll undercut the
Western labor movement so it's terrific
democracy didn't Eastern Europe's
fantastic but not democracy and the
countries that we want to control like
not in the Middle East for example
because it would be a disaster as I said
just look at public opinion
so that's nation-building and democracy
promotion it's very hard to find an
exception maybe there's space for one
last short question because they have an
invitation then to the dinner with the
rector and I think they have to we see
close to a tutu microphone
Kristof just give the microphone to
somebody
we have his drum press we have periodic
reminders that the European monetary
union is on the brink of collapse on the
one hand because like our payments to
Greece and Portugal and Ireland of
course always risks in a phobic
undertones and on the other hand that
the dollar is also very volatile I'm not
sure I'm really skeptical out what this
these announcements have for a function
but do you believe that these currencies
are really on the brink of collapse and
if that would happen what effect would
that have on the global order I don't
think that the the euro and the dollar
and the end are not on the brink of
collapse now these are very rich
societies with all the problems they're
having historically speaking it's pretty
rich that's not there they're suffering
but not at the style of the south
there are problems Europe is it is rich
enough to bail out the countries that
are in trouble but it's not at all clear
that that's the right approach I mean
why should Europe follow the
recommendations of the central bank
let's say the solution to recession is
austerity that's been tried and that's
Herbert Hoover in the United States you
know yeah his position was we got a big
depression let's go to austerity well
you know what happened economy totally
collapse
and there's pretty good reason to
suspect that that will happen again if
the austerity is just not the right
response to unemployment recession
what's the right response is essentially
in a state capitalist system they're
more radical responses but keeping to
the institutions of the right responses
probably Keynes's response which worked
stimulate the shortage of demand demand
stimulated and that's got to come from
the government it could lead to a
deficit debt and so on but that can be
overcome with growth that's the way to
overcome it now furthermore the main
problem all over the Western world is
not debt it's unemployment unemployment
is an extremely severe problem for one
thing it's very harmful to the people
you know such as done human grounds the
people the families the communities they
are suffering but furthermore even on
just narrow economic grounds
unemployment means unused resources
these are there's working people who
want to work there things that have to
be done but the system is so irrational
it can't put on a eager needed work into
the hands of eager people well that's a
real social economic problem and it's
not solved by increasing austerity
programs if you look at the particular
countries that you mentioned they're all
different
so Ireland for example actually had a
surplus Spain too at a surplus in
Ireland the economic crisis that came
primarily because the government bail
the bank's I mean the banks destroyed
the economy they came up they come came
to the public and say okay bail us out
and yeah they did there's another
approach and that'd say it's your
problem
I mean suppose we anybody really
believed in capitalism well nobody does
but if they did if investors let's say
banks and make risky loans a lot of
profit and then it crashes it's the
problem of the investors it's not the
problem the community if anybody
believed in capitalism so that's another
approach that could have taken okay you
made the investments you made the
profits now it's your problem
you take the losses but the Masters of
mankind don't think of the losses they
expect the public the bail amount it's
pretty much what's happening in Spain
Greece is a somewhat different problem
but I I don't it doesn't you know I all
of these things are debatable it's not
two plus two equals four but there's
good reason to think that the programs
that are being pursued are not well
adapted to a situation of deep
unemployment unused resources you know
human costs and deficit which is a
problem that could be overcome with
growth if demand is increased the United
States is an interesting case actually
you know it's this kind of leads led the
way in this but if you look closely at
the United States the deficit which is
the big problems the only issue
discussed in Washington is the deficit
frankly no discussion of the fact that
unemployment is at depression levels for
much of the population
what's the deficit well this has been
well
in the United States about half the
deficit comes from military spending
military spending in the United States
is out of sight you know it's about as
much as the rest of the world combined
it doesn't provide security in fact it
provides insecurity but it's there for
its own reasons basically grand area
reasons in fact that quoted with Clinton
as saying we have to keep forces forward
deployed in Europe and Asia in order to
ensure that people do what we want okay
not for the American population so
that's roughly half the deficit the
other half the deficit comes from the
completely dysfunctional health care
system the u.s. health care system is an
international scandal it's about twice
the per capita cost of other industrial
countries that has some of the worst
outcomes and the reason is not hard to
discover it's the only privatized
unregulated system and the private
sector is extremely bad at providing
public goods like health highly
inefficient a lot of administrative
costs profits bureaucracy and all kinds
of things so sure it's extremely
expensive drugs in the United States
cost about twice as much as comparable
countries and the reason again is very
straightforward in the United States and
I think it's the only country in the
world at least that I know of the
government is not permitted by law to
negotiate drug prices they can negotiate
anything else but not drug prices so big
surprise correct prices are out of sight
no this is incidentally over the
terms of about 85% of the population
there are ways to deal with this which
are not utopian in fact if the US had
the same kind of health care system as
other industrial countries no not
utopian there would be no deficit in
fact it would actually be a surplus but
you can't touch that because that's
getting to the centers of power the
financial institutions big
pharmaceutical institutions they won't
allow it to be discussed since they
basically run the government you have a
huge deficit well you know you take a
look at other countries you can find
ways of dealing with the deficit problem
differs from country to country and the
big problem is lack of demand and lack
of jobs and I think that's you know so
the system doesn't have to collapse I
mean maybe it will if the wrong policies
are followed but then look likely thank
you very much
