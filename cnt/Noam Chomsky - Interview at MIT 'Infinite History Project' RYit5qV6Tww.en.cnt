till you make Trina 2009 I am Karen
arenson we're interviewing noam chomsky
Institute professor and professor of
linguistics emeritus at MIT father of
modern linguistics philosopher prolific
author and political activist he's one
of the most widely quoted intellectuals
living today and probably one of the
most interviewed he has received
numerous honorary degrees in the US and
abroad and even had a research
chimpanzee nim chimpsky named for him
but not altogether friendly act I think
for chimp professor Chomsky thank you
for talking with us
for this series of interviews being
recorded for MIT sesquicentennial
you've been at MIT since 1955 for
virtually your whole career and for more
than a third of mi t--'s existence
what's kept you here all this time I
like the atmosphere it's I mean I've had
very attractive offers from other places
but never considered them it's a great
place to work it's a lot of bright
exciting students a good
interdisciplinary environment it's just
practice place to be never saw any
reason to leave what do you think is and
should be mi t--'s role in the world
well mi t--'s actual it's sort of the
core of its role that has been pretty
much to create the advanced economy of
the future so to use computers and the
Internet information technology
pharmaceuticals whatever it may be a
good part of it this created here and in
some similar places primarily through
government funding and it's on the side
there increasingly over the years it's
shifted from being years I've been here
from being an engineering school which
is what it was when I got here - just a
science-based university which had a lot
of side effects for example one side
effect was enrichment of the humanities
Social Sciences Department was as the
student body shifted from engineering
oriented to science oriented they just
had different interests concerns and
needs of the university adapted to them
but the role in the world should be -
like any other university place of free
inquiry interchange thought this one
particular University happens to be
focused primarily primarily but they're
not solely on science secondly
secondarily technology because that's
becoming more and more of an offshoot of
science a place where students at the
most free period of their lives out of
parental control not yet into the stage
of having to put food on the table
and enquire and create to find
themselves for the Faculty of same thing
constant innovation excitement both from
students from other faculty from the
outside world and should be an
environment which they can pursue those
interests and concerns in a constructive
way and to an unusual extent it's been
that I think during the period I've been
here changed a lot so it was quite
different in the 50s is it still as
hospitable a place for you as it was
then well that's it's grown a lot so in
the mid 50's you kind of knew everybody
you know so you had a question you
wanted to talk to the Provost you nice
personal friend and so on but now it's
far
for each individual it's kind of more
impersonal because it's so much larger
and more complex but it remains this in
my experience pretty much the same kind
of place how good a fit has linguistics
been for MIT and has MIT been for
linguistics it's it's always been in the
School of Humanities and Social Sciences
not not in the science school
technically but that's that was
administrative leave but not actually so
the field developed the modern field of
linguistics to a large extent developed
at MIT but it was in the electronics lab
I mean yes the administrative offices
were in the modern language department
but the contacts there were pretty
restricted though the main contact
connections were in orally the
electronics lab which is a highly
interdisciplinary alive and in those
days in the fifties in fact a lot of the
particular specific departments that now
have exist exist enough spread around
we're sort of sitting there in building
20 with a lot of interaction between
them and linguistic fit there perfectly
it was right at the core of the emerging
cognitive sciences they didn't really
exist at the time they were just coming
into existence and language was at the
core of it and has in many ways remained
so it was a interconnection of
mathematical interest computational
interests a study of increasing
interdisciplinary study of sort of mind
and a broad sense its implications for
other aspects of human behavior and
interaction so it has a sort of a
natural spot the study language always
has at the intersection of the sciences
and the humanities at Social Sciences
and here it developed very in a very
natural way in the pretty unstructured
and open environment
of the old building 20 research live
electronics of course connections
elsewhere so I worked a lot with George
Miller's presser of psychology at
Harvard we had close ties to Bell Labs
of back Lincoln labs to an extent but
the various expanding departments here
the psychology and the cognitive
sciences weren't a separate program they
grew out of the RLE environment looped
over it was one of those who and now
that are Elie and building 20 are long
gone unfortunate are those connections
still there is their connections are
there but you know it's less intimate
than when you're in the next room so the
disappearance building 20 was kind of a
sad moment in fact there was an effort
when some of us to try to preserve it as
a historical monument but just Jerry let
and who was almost at the point of that
you know old lady who won't give up her
home buildings are being constructed but
not quite but it was a pretty it was a
really wonderful place to work first it
was totally there was no security you
know so you could be in there night
students some students are practically
living there no guards the doors it kind
of astonishing to me that nothing was
ever stole and had a lot of equipment in
it and so on and of course this was a
this is at the time this was kind of
like an urban neighborhood you know
factories working-class housing and so
on but it was kind of on the mi edge of
the MIT campus at that point
edge of the campus and the bitter that
was just a very nice look kind of a
perfect research environment if you
didn't mind the windows flowing out
every once in a while there squirrels in
the walls but you could open the windows
I'm sort of yeah we once had a my
colleague
Marsala and I we're still in next-door
offices but we started in 55 we we were
off in one corner of RLE which was a
Second World War temporary building but
it was incredibly hot over the summer so
we tried to put in an air-conditioner
but you had F permission so we asked
permission from the whatever chain of
bureaucracy it was we finally got a note
back saying couldn't do it because it
would be inconsistent with it the core
of building 20 so we bought the note
asked a janitor to put it in for us but
the other thing in building 20 was that
it was a temporary building you can move
the walls around so it was kind of
randomized inside it which had very nice
properties so like for example I I
happen to find a little corner of it
that didn't have a room but had no
windows I figure that I'm gonna use it
for anything so I asked if I could use
it just for books
I said sure it finds a big storage space
for books that was nice and yours a
current quarters what are they like well
it's a very interesting building a
building that's right on top is like
building 20 used to be right it's not
really a place to work I mean so for
example that and I had to my work at
home now like I don't even have a
computer in the office but and it's for
appointments interviews things like that
so for example it has a has a slanted
wall which is not to make a lot of sense
for a faculty office I mean what you
need is a place to put books on a
blackboard and things like that but it's
you know it's an interesting attractive
building that's fine actually I think
it's less it was built to be interactive
but my impression is it's probably less
interactive than the old building 20
used to be which wasn't built for
anything it was just put up hey
do you think that being at MIT has
provided you with a kind of legitimacy
as your professional career was
beginning to develop and in your role as
a political activist or in other ways I
don't think as far as the profession was
concerned in fact it's a kind of an
interesting fact that what happened in
the United States has replicated
throughout much of the world modern
linguistics developed on the periphery
of the academic system so here at MIT
not at Harvard and that's been true as
it's later expanded throughout the world
it was very different from the modern
field developed in a manner which was
quite different in fact antithetical in
many ways to the existing disciplines
and was not you know it was it was not
welcomed so for example for years I
didn't publish in linguistics journals
and published into engineering journals
something like that and in fact it I
remember my first monograph which came
out in 1957 was published in Holland but
shortly after it there was a review of
American linguistics by somebody and he
had a foot that decision won't mention
this because this is Dutch linguistics
knowing that back for anything so it
wasn't Madana journalistic inquiry room
published by MIT press in large measure
because the work that was coming out
here students and us couldn't couldn't
really it was a natural place to put it
within the linguistics profession I mean
in fact it has interesting roots back in
the tradition of linguistics actually
back to the millennia back to the early
Indian grammarians but that had been
almost entirely forgotten by the
profession I started working it myself
but by now there's a field of written
much richer field and there was of
history of linguistics but that came out
of here to a significant extent off on
the periphery of the field
as I say that's replicated elsewhere I
know it was a while before people began
to accept some of your ideas and took a
while for your first book to come
together but I just wondered whether the
MIT lustre even then commit may have
helped convince some people well maybe
we should be looking at it you know MIT
thinks he's good right that because
remember MIT was an engineering school
right it was not then regarded as a
major university this place where you
went if you wanted to build things in
fact I mean they had a very good math
and physics department but to a large
extent they were service service
departments teaching the engineers
tricks so they could do things what is a
my being at MIT meant for your role as a
political activist I think it's
sometimes closed arched eyebrows and so
forth it was kind of ironic the role
that it played actually the not just me
incidentally that there were faculty
peace groups in the 50s and the early
60s and they were largely MIT based not
not Harvard based my own role was our
elite where it was was a hundred percent
supported with three armed services and
in fact MIT you all together there was I
think about 90% Pentagon funded at the
time there was also the center of anti
Vietnam War academic center of Adi
Vietnam War activism resistance and so
on and it was there was no interference
I'm in the a Kadir Eckerd for academic
freedom is very good at I'm there are a
few exceptions but by and large quite
good what do you think your being at MIT
has meant for MIT
that's brothers do this up but it was it
was the source of a lot of things that
have happened since so the
I'm gonna provide personally it was at
the time that was virtually nothing and
maybe one course and philosophy almost
you know psychology was directly nothing
I did introduce the first modern
philosophy courses and it helped
establish what's now a flourishing
department and the brain of behavioral
sciences sort of grew out of the
interactions mostly at Harley and in the
late 50s early 60s I was part of it
along with others likes looped over I
mentioned those thinking along the lines
of people perceive MIT to be very much
in engineering and science at University
and then they say but it has the top
economics department and the top
linguistics department and and in some
ways maybe it's it's helped convince
people that there there's other that
there's a breath and an excellence to
MIT outside of the things they think of
a good probably on the other hand I
think that's part of a broader
development that took place since the
fifties as I say at the time it mainly
was an engineering school so students
were making things the liquor circuits
bridges students to if you were studying
mechanical engineering and civil
engineering Electrical Engineering you'd
take quite a different curricula because
you were it was oriented towards the
technology of the time well in this
after the Second World War there was a
substantial change in the relationship
between science and technology I mean
there had always been a relationship so
Archimedes was scientists contributing
to the armaments but it was a
qualitative change during and after the
Second World War the sciences became
really essential to technology in a way
that they hadn't been they had been an
aid it's kind of like biology and
medicine you know medicine courses
paying attention to biology but couldn't
contribute much
but this transition took place primarily
at that time and as it took place the it
reflect was reflected at MIT and to a
certain extent stimulated by MIT as an
interaction and it shifted the character
of the Institute altogether so now it
shouldn't really be called Massachusetts
Institute of Technology it's a
science-based University students in the
various fields take pretty much the same
courses maybe slightly adapted their own
interests and they also have a range of
other interests music philosophy
humanities and so on so it's kind of a
university based around science and I I
don't know how much it's understood in
the outside world but that's what the
way it should be perceived in the role
of linguistics and economics and so on
just sort of fits pretty naturally into
that let's touch a do a brief pass
through some of the biographical
information can you talk briefly about
where you were born growing up your
family your schooling I was born in
Philadelphia 1928 my parents were
immigrants they themselves were pretty
much you know sort of a Jewish ghetto
immigrant community ghetto not
physically like scattered all over the
city but their contacts were with social
other contacts with other people very
much like them now the Jewish immigrant
community was split into various
different directions and my parents
happened to be involved in well for them
the primary interest was revival of
Hebrew so my father was a Hebrew scholar
my mother was a Hebrew teacher the
language was being revived the culture
was being revived and that's what they
did
they my father ran the Hebrew school
system in Philadelphia my mother was
active in it
all of my friends and my wife and
everyone else we all came out of that
media and though there was it was not it
wasn't it was observant but not
religious and it was kind of oriented
towards Palestine I was the people would
have called themselves scientists I did
too but in a sense quite different from
post 1948 so my father for example was
what was called in those days a cultural
Zionist the father of a ha da leading
writer in the early part of the revival
of Hebrew century ago whose vision was
that there should be a cultural center
for Jewish life in Palestine and that
that was pretty much the life you know
we were immigrants from my father came
at the age of 17 from the Ukraine just
in time to escape being drafted into the
Czar's army which was a death sentence
for Jewish boys and that my mother's
family came and she came which is about
one from what's now Belarus and in the
language they spoke at home and that you
could run the initial native language
was Yiddish but there was a cult or
Kampf going on in the Jewish community
between the Hebrew ranted and the
Yiddish orietta
they were on the Hebrew side so I was I
never heard a word few dish that was my
parent it was like their secret language
because their native language insane
with my wife she but not Russian or my
father knew had learned Russian which
was considered heresy where he he grew
up in a little village near Kiev and you
weren't even supposed to know Hebrew I
mean he used Hebrew for prayer or like
reading the Bible you're not supposed to
speak it so even looking at modern
Hebrew literature which was developing
at the time was considered heresy but he
went on learn some Russian which advised
out of his father even though about but
but that was not part of our background
it was
you know today take sent that it was not
an english-speaking thing that was
Hebrew were in and your schooling my
parents would work working them I they
were teaching teaching all the time so
they sent me from that age one one and a
half I guess to a private school which
and my father was interested he was kind
of a very much influenced by John
Dewey's educational and other ideas and
this was a Dewey progressive school run
by Temple University which had a do
educational program department and I was
there from before too until school ended
it twelve that was a fantastic
environment in fact I remember
elementary school much better than high
school I remember everything that
happened it was on Dewey eight lines
there was encouragement of students to
think independently work creatively work
with others a lot of interaction
projects it was virtually no I didn't
even know I was a good student until I
got to high school because there was no
ranking I mean I knew I skipped a year
and everybody else knew I'd skipped the
year with that matter I was the smallest
kid in the class you know but didn't
have any other connotations and I think
you Indicom nted that pretty much
everybody throught seemed to thrive in
that environment you know it's like a
lot of private schools with a mixed
story there were kids whose parents were
kind of achievement oriented and there
were kids who just couldn't make it in
the public schools the problem of
children so you get a usual mixture but
there was a sense that people weren't
ranked the kids weren't ranked so the
everyone's supposed to be doing their
best you know they're praised if they do
their best there was it was pretty much
accepted by the children in the school I
remember him and then you went to a more
traditional high school which
who went to a traditional of their in
the city there were two academically
oriented high schools and one for boys
and one for girls my wife went to the
girls when I went to the boys Minh and
for me at least that's kind of got black
hole I barely remembered I hated it it
couldn't stand it as I say I quickly
learned I'm supposed to be a good
student always and that sort of thing
but it was it was it was nothing there
that really grabbed you nobody
everything I did was on the outside it
was just a place where you were you did
well enough to to go off to Penn yeah I
was well you had you know had two we
were working students she went to the
local school there was no other choice
and although it was pretty inexpensive
at that time I think it was a hundred
dollars a year or something couldn't
make it without a scholarship so I've
got a scholarship went to Penn which was
in those days not all that different in
fact Penn was I was I got out of high
school at 16 I was pretty excited about
going to college I thought it'd be
interesting I'm done with this boring
stuff and the catalog looked great and
so on so I took what I thought with the
interesting courses but I found it was
overgrown high school in fact after
about a year I was thinking of dropping
out
it's changed a lot and is now a major
university but at that time was
substantially a football fraternity
school with a scattering of extremely
good faculty so the more academically
oriented students who sort of found each
other who were many of them like me had
a variety of interests that weren't
connected because you were to look
attractive by terrific mathematician in
my case outstanding country's
outstanding linguist a few great
philosophers these things in fact by the
time I was a junior I was mostly taking
graduate courses and really didn't have
an undergraduate education but you you
contemplated dropping out I think going
off and had you not I guess didn't
that's our 17 year old kid I know
exactly what I do but I didn't see much
point she did your parents care whether
you got your degree or not I don't think
they even knew you know and in that
generation you just didn't talk much to
your parents there were a lot of things
they didn't know about our lives
so for example we we happen to be the
only Jewish family in a mostly Irish and
German Catholic neighborhood which was
rapidly Semitic in fact pretty pro-nazi
during the 30s and that was boys in the
street you know you just sort of figure
out what's happening but my parents
never knew I don't never talk to them
they didn't ask interesting along the
way I guess as a child you you've spent
a lot of time in New York City - with
relatives of your mother's and my
mother's their friends intellectual
circles you know that was cynical
circles that was a different crowd
I mean her family at least the part I
got involved in was mostly unemployed
working-class pretty radical some of
them had essentially no formal education
in fact the uncle who was most
influential in my life had never gotten
past fourth grade was one of the most
educated people I've ever met he he was
physically disabled so he was able to
get a to run a newsstand under some New
Deal program and that was the one place
where there was any employment and the
family so everybody worked there I did
too and he collected a circle of
European immigration them who used to
hang around that understand and have
discussions of the political talks and
German psychiatrists and so on and so
forth it was pretty lively effect they
for years I thought that was a newspaper
in New York called the noose and mirror
because people were racing out of the it
was it a this episode would stop people
would run out and ask for the noose and
mirror
that it was it was a very lively
environment and ever had it by the time
I was old enough to go to New York by
myself like about 12 but immediately
gravitate there on weekends and so on
it became an education if you came an
education and I had another related
education there this is us around 1940
approximately in there were there was
big refugee population in New York a lot
of people fleeing from fascism and in
New York at that time the I guess 4th
Avenue from Union Square down south was
full of little bookstores
run by some guy who astonish anarchist
here or something like that not a real
intricate reading material I spent a lot
of time hanging around those the
anarchist offices fry right there demo
office and I guess it was in Union
Square and spent time there I a couple
of my relatives in particularly my uncle
were also very much involved in such
things I just got a totally separate
political education in fact the first
article I wrote was it fourth grade so
it would have been was 10 I guess 1939
yeah I know exactly when it was because
it was right after the fall of Barcelona
so it was February 1939 I was about full
of Barcelona spread of fascism in Europe
was just a large part of so you made it
out of pen this is long before I got the
pen right in fact what drew me back to
college at Penn was meeting zelich
Harris and I mean political context
shared political interests and he was a
professor at Penn I didn't know it at
the time but he was the leading linguist
maybe the world or the country but and
he kind of in retrospect I think he was
trying to talk me into coming back to
college or something but at the time he
just suggested he knew ice planet
dropout or thinking about he just
suggested I take some of his graduate
courses
and then he suggested a couple of other
faculty members in particular in
philosophy and math and suggested I take
their graduate courses and it kind of
went out there so you did get through
college and that record through its IT
fillers fellows at Harvard and wrens
where you did a lot of the thinking
about your elastic area that was I was
there for four years and it was a
research fellowship with no particular
constraints so you could sit in a desk
in Widener Library in those days and
have the whole resources of the library
the university a lot of bright young
colleagues so very intellectually
stimulating environment and again free
to explore in a way it was back to
elementary school environment they were
you're free to explore or the streets of
New York and the bookstore the streets
of now yeah so as long as I just skip
that high academic high school you know
it's just kind of like the continuity
how did you develop your theories that
define modern linguistics where did your
ideas come from well partly it was just
having acquaintance with other fields
like logic and foundation of mathematics
other things there their concepts that
were developed there which did seem to
me to be applicable to the study of
language now at the time well it just
give you an example what at the time the
way use when we were I was in an
undergraduate student and formally in
linguistics a standard a term paper
would be to go to the International
Journal of American linguistics of
journal where people did descriptive
studies of American Indian languages and
take one of the articles you know the
phonology of Cherokee or something and
do what was called a structural
Restatement that was restated and a more
elegant form using procedures of
analysis was sort of like inductive
procedures of analysis which were most
extensively developed in zelich Harris's
book which
the first edition of his book was called
methods and structural linguistics and
that's what it was it was methods in
fact I learned the field from
proofreading the book for him but I was
when we met
and he was sort of I presume enticing me
back to college or whatever was he asked
me if I had proof read the galleys so I
did and you know I kind of learned the
field that way but that's what you
learned methods you applied them and you
got a restatement of the descriptive
data and that's what we did when it came
time to do a undergraduate thesis Harris
suggested to me that I do that with
modern Hebrew which I knew fairly well
perfectly but well enough so I started
to do it the way we were taught you know
you'd get an informant that's really
informant was pretty just about you know
from the Jewish community in Palestine
Hebrew speaker and native Hebrew speaker
and yes in this field methods you know
you're taught how to elicit data from an
informant so I used the field methods
get the data and start organizing and
according with method methods and after
a while I was working entirely by myself
you know it just seemed to me that this
is senseless for one thing I know the
answers to everything I'm asking him
except for the parts I don't care about
like the pronunciation because I didn't
care about princey dish
so what's the point so I just sort of
put it aside and did what seemed kind of
obvious intuitively it is obvious namely
write what's now called a generative
grammar let us try to find a set of
rules and principles from which you can
mechanically derive the structures of
the infinite number of expressions of
the language and the structures have to
feed into basically two other systems of
the mind or the body the sensorimotor
system you've got to pronounce
and the thought systems going to be
interpreted so that's what's now called
the generative grammar but that this
this I didn't know at the time that
there was a tradition of doing something
kind of similar to that which in fact
goes back to the indian grammarians of
2500 years ago and it sort of persisted
and kind of a back strain of the field
but it was not what anybody knew about
it was off there at some exotic place
and by the mid 1950s of the 19th 20th
century you could actually do things
like this in a fairly precise way after
in the 30s 1930s in the 1940s that was
the beginning of the really extensive
and careful development of the asylums
the theory of computability there were
major results in the field theory of
computability recursive function theory
I was studying these things on the side
and it did give a comprehensive in the
air but this made them readily available
in a precise enough form so that you
could actually formulate what was being
coming but I later came to be called a
generative grammar in these terms
pretty much the way you could on the
model of the week and do what's called
metamathematics you know the study of
formal mathematics event theory in terms
of the theory of computability which had
really profound results many of them so
kind of melding these things together as
an undergraduate it just gave you know I
did this these I don't think anybody
ever looked at it look you frankly but
anyway it was done and when I got to
Harvard I was kind of schizophrenic for
a while I mean for a while I was in many
ways with for one thing I was committed
intellectually to the belief that the
procedural approach of the quasi
inductive analysis of data must be the
right one because that's not what all
the smart people were doing but on the
other half of my brain
and this seemed to make a lot more sense
and I sort of tried to work on both for
a while and at some point in fact I
remember the exact point in 1953 my wife
and I were taking the graduate student
backpacking trip to Europe so we were on
some old half sinking boat and going
over to Europe and is completely seasick
and there's any had just occurred to me
that I was actually getting results from
the generative grammar approach while
the other approach was just kind of
technical formalization which wasn't
going anywhere so I kind of decided okay
I'll drop that continue with the
generative grammar meanwhile there was a
side issue in this was the period of
behavioral science so the social science
of the psychology there were studies of
behavior and that had a kind of a
similarity to the structural linguistics
of the period
I mean the topic was data and the
problem is how to control organize
describe to organize and describe data
and to control performance
that's what behaviour psychology was and
that it was just everywhere you know it
was this Cambridge for example where was
the these were the dominant thinking
philosophy psychology linguistics social
sciences I just never made any sense to
me I wasn't alone there were a few did
you sit around and and kick around ideas
with with friends are you two mostly
sort of noodle about this in your own
mind how did you work there's a small
group of graduate students who were kind
of resistant to the prevailing sentiment
so one of them's Mars Howie who who was
it Harvard with you he was at Harvard
with me
although he was actually it was a
student at Harvard with me but he was
actually starting to teach MIT you know
he's he's a phone it was working in
phonetics labs so he was working here I
don't think he was teaching but he was
in the labs at MIT in fact my wife was
working in the same lab in the early 50s
I met Morris through my wife
another was Erik Lana Berg who went on
later to become the founder of what's
now called biology of language went on
to medical school and didn't work and
there were a few others that one of them
was a fellow a junior fellow the same
place I was Peter Elias was a
mathematician especially it was
information theory and we did a lot of
discussion and work together he ended up
being chair of the computer sipping
electrical engineering department at MIT
you may be but there's a very small
number just a few of us just didn't fit
with prevailing attitudes and we're at
the time of how transformational your
your ideas would become I mean did you
step back and kind of look at well you
know there was very little we were
talking to each other in fact the first
person from the outside this small group
of students who became at all interested
was George Miller it was a professor of
psychology at Harvard and the psychology
department at Harvard was it was kind of
characteristic at the times there were
three major professors a BF Skinner
space Stevens George Miller Skinner and
Stevens both knew the total truth but it
was different truths so if you're a
student of Skinner you weren't allowed
to take courses with Stevens and
conversely Eric Lana Berg who was in
psychology a lot of problems within and
then there was George Miller who was
kind of eclectic open-minded you know
thinking about other things so students
who didn't fit into the straitjackets
drifted towards Miller and I met him he
was kind of interested in what I was
doing and we
actually spent a summer together and
Stanford working on this stuff and
teaching it and that but but even with
that there was essentially no residence
I'm in the book that I was writing I
wrote I was writing a book on my own
that the Society of fellows finished in
1955 and you know my wife and I ran off
about 800 pages on hectic graphs never
saw them but everything everything in
the world turns purple when you
we ran off a couple copies for 20 copies
for friends and somebody suggest that I
submitted that MIT press which I did but
it came back pretty soon with pretty
sensible comments I either rejected it
but the comments from the reviewers were
that they had no clue what it was it is
no such field where's it belong yeah so
doesn't so they're just making sense it
did how was your reaction their reaction
my reaction I didn't care much notice'
you were supposed to be at the frontiers
of knowledge and that's well this is
well there was no interest in it outside
right so but it didn't matter you know
in your early 20s you're thinking about
what you're doing you know where they
care what the world thinks so did you
have a Eureka feeling as you were doing
it though oh yeah there were a lot of
things that just seem to be discoveries
and I was I was excited about them and a
couple of people I could talk to her but
then I got involved so to some extent in
a formal theory of automata and that I
could publish you know I could publish
in engineering journals journals of
information and control which measure
all the time you were here at MIT that's
yeah that was parade by the time I was
in 1956 so I was at MIT and there there
there was a lot of outside interest and
it's kind of loosely related to
linguistics I mean the formal systems
are similar in some respects to the
systems of natural language not terribly
close but similar and this could go on
in parallel it's since become a sub
branch of the theory of copy
sir and other mathematicians got
interested and so on but the actual
linguistic work was very restricted when
you came to our Le Jerry Wiesner was
head of it
Jerry was head did you talk to him at
all about yeah he get them interesting
interview with him Roman Jakobson who
was great it was a personal friend and
if he was up at Harvard he was at
Harvard at the time but he was a leading
figure in the whole intellectual
community he knew Jerry Wiesner he
suggested I I didn't have any possible
academic appointment I had no field when
I got my when I got out of the site I
fell I was a PhD and everything is I had
no thought of going into the academic
world because there was nowhere to go
but jakob sin' suggested I talked to
Jerry Wiesner and so I did an
appointment with him and you know he
asked what I was doing it kind of
described what I was doing and then he
suggested that I come to orally and work
on a machine translation project they
had a project of trying to you know
develop computer programs that could
translate language and I told them you
know I don't think the project makes any
sense I mean the only way to solve this
problem is brute force what's going to
be understood about language is not
really going to help and I'm just not
interested so I'm not going to do it so
he thought that was pretty good answer
and he hired me I should project but
mainly to do what I felt but you didn't
do then no because I'm the project made
no sense and over the years it's I think
become clear why it made no sense but it
didn't bother him he hired you anyway
that's what our Lee was like he was just
it was just encouraging a lot of
innovative strange people without ideas
some of them worked out some didn't but
how well did you come to know Jerry
Jerry Wiesner you know people knew each
other in those days it was a fairly
small community and so you know we're
friendly would not
close personal friends soon he went off
to the Kennedy administration went to
Washington and came back and began four
of us and so that the president later
but the same with the others like walter
rosenblith who was there later became
Provost it was provost under Jerry I
guess yeah and later but at the time he
was in orally like anybody was Jerry let
and the tiber almost everyone was there
at the time they later branched out to
different fields different departments
but there were internal to the early
community they were there was interest
and there was George Miller at Harvard
this later by the mid fifties I the the
kind of Bible in the sort of
intellectual community of this these
topics was Skinner's book verbal
behavior which was circulating in
manuscript when I got to Harvard and
that's what you know that Quine who main
philosopher studied with him was kind of
like the Bible and you know I read it
didn't seem to make any sense whatsoever
so I wrote a I finally wrote a critical
review of it we got a lot of attention
that turned out to get a lot of
attention that came out in 1959 I wrote
it in 57 got a lot of attention it was
part of the other was that was that long
a lead time and getting that you know
just getting that but you know it was
part of a sort of a growing it was part
of the growth of cognitive science and
neuroscience related to cognitive
science and so on and there was a
undercurrent there of a discomfort with
the behaviorist sort of ideology it was
kind of like a religion almost and this
was so this fit into that and
contributed to it and in fact there was
work by it was so considered so out of
tune with the mainstream that there's a
famous brain scientist burning our
scientist Karl Lashley who was at
Harvard in fact who back in 1950 or so
published a really important article on
structure behavior in which he showed
very convincingly that
the behaviorist approaches couldn't
possibly work but nobody paid any
attention to it
in fact I was right in the middle of all
of this sign of a heard of it I found
out about it from an art critic Meyer
Shapiro then I read it and I saw look
this is really important so I my art my
review of Skinner maybe the first
article that even referred to it I think
in those days you could do it data they
search easily but I couldn't find any
reference nor did anyone else and it was
apparently novel to the people I showed
it to but then there were a couple of
other things like that within
comparative psychology which was that
those days pretty different from
Experimental Psychology there was work
coming out that was just inconsistent
with the behaviorist approach there was
also another development was ethology
there's no Comparative Zoology
with figures like Connor Lawrence and
Tinbergen and others and that this small
group of graduate students that we were
reading that material and you could see
that just didn't fit at all with
behaviour ideology so how did you go
from all this research and thinking and
there wasn't a linguistics department
there were some language courses and
well that was become a department
bureaucratic whatever well we were in
the modern language department and we
had to pay our dues by teaching Morris
it was there I forgave probably teaching
German or French or something whatever
he was doing but I really didn't know
any languages submit not that kind of a
linguist and the only curses I could
teach were in those days they had
cram courses for PhD students
to help them fake their way through
breeding exams and fake is the right
word these were a residue of the pre-war
period I mean pretty Second World War if
you wanted to be the civil engineer so
you had to know French and German
because the United States was kind of
like an intellectual backwater the main
work was being done in Europe but all of
that changed totally during the Second
World War for obvious reasons and none
of the graduate students were ever going
to read an article in French or German
almost unbelievably still had the
residue of the exams and the only way to
deal with it was for the modern language
department to run courses in which you
taught graduate students enough tricks
so that they could fake their way
through the exam and then forget about
and the exam would be had to read and
translate a paper in their own fields
well you know take a look at a paper in
your own field understand the formulas
you know you understand the the
international words you learn that the
verb is over here instead of over here
and so on they can kind of fake your way
through it those are the courses I was
teaching sometimes they were quite funny
but so jump from there to a department
or real well I was I was allowed to
teach an undergraduate course in
linguistics and philosophy modern
linguistics and my own kind of were kind
of work and modern philosophy there was
nothing like that at the time and after
a while they were students were
interested so in fact a number of the
students went on and became
professionals and executives chair of
linguistics departments and where there
were mathematicians who became
interested and so on
there was a certain increase in interest
among undergraduates and by that time we
were getting visitors from outside who
just heard about it and wanted to know
something about it by about 1960 we we
had one visitor who was at a point where
he could get a PhD but there was no PhD
department so the electrical engineering
department agreed to let him get his
ph.d and Turkish nominalization like
Department but it was sort of reaching
the point where he could think about a
graduate department and MIT was pretty
friggin open so they agreed that we
could establish a graduate department
and shortly after that also in
philosophy because that was building up
similar way I was again very much
involved in the appointments teaching
and so on so the department just sort of
formed the room it was under stress no a
graduate Howard Johnson in there but
this was still under 1960 it was early
sixties dealing at Jay Stratton I guess
but maybe Howard John forget the exact
order but I think it was did you care
very strongly one way or the other
whether it became a department yeah once
it became a department we could have
students we could have courses this
students contribute a lot to the
development of the field so it became
richer much more exciting and the early
graduate students went off and started
their own departments which is hard you
know they had to try to work their way
into the field by the by the late 60s it
was at first the only department
actually in the world that was dealing
with this kind of thing but there were
foreign students they went back to their
own countries gradually by the 70s it
was kind of you know they're at least
bits and pieces all over the place did
you do much pushing to make it a
department or did Morris do that or I
mean sir who did the more motivational
more exhausting dirty words he did
busted that yeah luckily for me but it
wasn't that we were pushing against it
there was no resistance to it now it's
kind of a sound like an interesting idea
fine let's go ahead and let's just
somebody has a she ate a kind of
critical mass right and and work through
it was a pretty limited bureaucracy in
those days I mean the you know the move
from working in an office at orally to
talking to the president was a very
brief move you know not a lot of stages
in between
as I said most people sort of know each
other yeah I love to talk a little about
that same period but the other side what
it was like to be an anti-war activist
at MIT in the 60s and 70s we have to
remember the environment the warrant of
it actually started in 1962
that's when Kennedy started the bombing
of South Vietnam I chemical warfare to
destroy crops and livestock to rounding
people up into camps and so on but there
was no protest I mean just non-existent
there's a very classic period all over
the country at the thing I mean the
first talks I was giving were somebody's
living room or at church with four
people or something like that by the mid
sixties some activism was developing
actually in 1965 the pisses on my own
time at 90 with MIT it was a started
organizing national tax resistance or
trying to and within a year or two it
was much broader resistance fact by 1968
I was coming up for a try federal trial
that was expanded and I was giving lots
of talks and so meanwhile I introduced
with a friend is also on the faculty we
introduced undergraduate courses on
social and political issues so Louie
Kent but it was I did it on my own time
he did it as part of his it sort of fit
in this department but for me it was
just you know my own time and by the
late 60s hundreds of students I mean
while the the mood and the university
was changing it was student activism was
kind of taking off here was late but by
1968 it was substantial there were major
events that took place which had a big
effect on the Institute so in there were
just a small number of students who were
active but they kind of galvanized the
place
Mustard's in late 1968 or so on there
was a late 1968 there was a student
decided I didn't think it was a good
idea that they went ahead to set up
what's called a sanctuary for a deserter
there was a Marine deserter yeah talked
to him made sure he understood what he
was doing understood the consequences
and so on
they just set up a room in the Student
Center and had a press conference
nobody came to they were said well care
we're gonna stay with this Marine
deserter until the FBI comes and picks
him up within about within about a week
the Institute was half shut down oh yeah
half the student body was over there all
the time it was 24 hours the seminars
rock music everything of the kind that
was going on in those days and it had a
tremendous effect on the student body it
had an effect on the Institute one of
the effects was that it just raised in
the student body and some of the faculty
and awareness that we should be thinking
about what we're doing and then came
March 4th March 4th 1969 when the
Institute was closed for a day just for
seminars and discussions and meetings
about the uses of technology do how do
we think about the consequences were
doing instead of just you know making
stuff we asked what's for what we should
be doing shoot me to make something else
I was really this you know individuals
had thought about things like this but
this was really the first time that
there was a and organized concern about
it and out of that grew a lot of things
in fact the Institute just changed
radically and I think these became
central topics the Union of Concerned
Scientists came out of that Henry
Kendall who was Nobel Prize physicist it
had been a pentagon planner you know he
was working on planning bombing and
Indochina but he kind of I remember we
talked about it yeah just go he went
through a personal conversion and
thought got it change this and he became
a leading figure and
and the physics department in what
became the Union of Concerned Scientists
and a lot of other things developed out
of it but and it did change the
atmosphere of the Institute a lot so
these are no kind of like this did you
and Jerry Wiesner ever sit down and talk
about what was being done and how it was
being done did did he reach out to you
because mrs. students got more well he
was not very happy I mean he was you
know kind of on the extreme Devesh side
of the sort of Kennedy administration
but and he never really accepted the
fact that the students and the activists
considered him a kind of a collaborator
because he thought he was taking a
strong stand against you know War
nuclear weapons and so on but from the
students point of view that and the
activists point of view that wasn't the
case and it was never really a
reconciliation no so but you weren't
altogether comfortable I think with some
of the aggressive tactics that the
students used in the end though there
was by the late 60s I mean the student
movement we really had a very brief
existence you know a big effect but a
brief existence a couple of years so so
it started in the early 60s civil rights
movement and so on but gradually grew by
the late 60s a huge phenomenon by 1969 I
was falling apart it literally I mean
the November actions I guess that's just
that but it was you know it was that but
a lot more the main in the president's
office yes I was happening here Columbia
in other places I it wasn't a favorite
myself and like this tactics but
students for a Democratic Society SDS
which was the nationwide student
organization had a rapid expansion in
the late 60s but by 1969 was collapsing
it broke up into two wings that one of
them sort of Maoist and the other the
weatherman and we had a lot of work
government yep trying to talk students
out of going in those directions I mean
you can understand the attraction you
know people desperate upset
but did they get angry with you for
trying to talk yeah we had a lot of
confrontations and conflicts yeah your
friend was right involved in this but
well a lot of them but the face of the
criticism the MIT ended up setting up
the what was called the pounds
Commission house mission was sent over
to advise it on what it should do with
with the two research labs that we
Rosina's being instrumental to varying
degrees in the war effort well it was
your name - yeah were you surprised that
you were off no no hesitation about
serving her well I had no hesitations
because I had arranged to teach in
Oxford for a semester I was the John
Locke lecture at Oxford and that was the
semester in which they wanted the pounds
Commission to me so actually the be
flying back and forth
well the Dean really pleaded with me to
be on it so I had four transatlantic
trips a week teach in Oxford come here
go to a committee meeting go back the
next day detox read again lenses went on
for about six weeks so your hesitation
was just that you weren't here and it
was I wasn't here and I didn't want to
give up I had promised the semester
Oxford I didn't want to give that up and
the John Locke lectureship no I think it
but and I was giving talks all over
England at the same time it wasn't just
teaching because you know the pounce
Commission was set up to try to head off
a confrontation that nobody wanted I
mean the protests against the labs were
building up to the point where they were
going to lead to a confrontation the
administration didn't want the students
didn't want so what you do is you set up
a committee you know and the committee
was going to review the state of
Pentagon related activity at the
Institute I think we have just a minute
or two to sum that up well you know
briefly it turned out roughly actually
nobody even knew what the finances were
the finances of the Institute were
not even anybody's head they were just
kind of chaos ton of money was pouring
in it was it turned out roughly that the
two military laboratories were
approximately half of Institute
expenditures but nobody really knew if
they were contributing to the Institute
or taking from it like how much did the
library contributions matter so that had
to be sorted and of the academic side I
think about 90% were was Pentagon based
but there was no classified work going
on on campus
I mean indirectly everything could be
were related it was except in the
political science department none of
that had they were working on
counterinsurgency under what was called
a Peace Research Institute with closed
seminars and things like that but
elsewhere was in the labs on the other
hand the labs are very closely
integrated with the Institute so for
example my wife was a programmer at
Lincoln labs and I was in orally but it
was no particular barrier in fact people
would go up and back freely but the real
issue in the pound's Commission was
whether to separate the laboratories
from the Institute there were sort of
three views that came out there was what
was called the Liberals who said yeah we
got to separate him from the campus that
were the Conservatives had keep them on
campus there were two or three of us one
student one me who were called the
radicals who agreed with the
Conservatives where to keep them on
campus so that people know what's going
on and it's a focus of attention and
concern and you think of it let's not
hide it somewhere where the same
relationships are going to continue but
under an apparent administer of great
will we lost the Liberals want they
would formally say but it was an
interesting time however that's it's
about the time of the May 4th and these
are the developments and didn't make a
change
