in March that was the 40th anniversary
of the public announcement that the US
is attacking South Vietnam the u.s.
pilots are bombing South Vietnam but
they began to use chemical warfare for
crop destruction drought started driving
millions of people into concentration
camps this is all in South Vietnam no
Russians no to Chinese not even any
North Vietnamese assuming they're not
allowed to be in their own country just
a US war against South Vietnam openly
announced no commemoration after 40
years because nobody even knows it's not
important if we do that to other people
that's normal it's if they do something
to us that the world is coming to an end
but if we do it to them it's so normal
why should we even talking about it and
likewise in Japan I see it's better in
Japan Japan was defeated and defeated
countries are forced to pay some
attention to what they did victors never
I mean take a look at the Tokyo trials
you know I'm undoubtedly the people were
guilty of all kind of crimes but the
trials were a total farce I mean from a
legal or any other point of view they
were disgraceful the and did anybody try
the u.s. criminals in fact uh you know
it's kind of interesting the way the
Nuremberg Yuli the way the principles
were constructed they had to decide at
Nuremberg what's gonna count as a worker
on and there was a very explicit
definition and it was conscious you know
it's not hidden a crime is a war crime
if the Germans committed it and we
didn't so for example bombing of urban
concentrations was not a work right
because the British and the Americans
did more of it than the Germans did so
therefore it's not a work right and
German submarine commanders were able to
bring testimony in defense by American
submarine commanders who said yeah we
did the same thing and they were there
for free because it wasn't a crime
so if they would and and it gets him
worse than this I mean for example
opening the dykes in Holland was
considered a work right properly but in
North Korea a few years later after the
US Air Force had wiped out the whole
country there's nothing left to bomb now
they started bombing the dams that's a
huge work run it's much worse than
bombing the dikes it was described but
it was described with pride you know if
you read the official Air Force history
or the Air Force quarterly and so on
they describe it and gruesome detail but
about what a great achievement it was to
bomb these dams to see the huge flood of
water or scooping out valleys and see
the rage of the people said they're
Asians who depend on rice and you know
here we're really getting them where it
hurts and it's just like racist
fanaticism but praised that's just a
couple of years after the they hanged
German leaders were doing much less than
that
