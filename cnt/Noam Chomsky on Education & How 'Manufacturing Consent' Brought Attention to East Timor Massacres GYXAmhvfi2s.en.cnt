michel gondry is a director and animator
of the new film is the man who is tall
happy we turn now to Noam Chomsky it was
the premiere of the film here in New
York and they spoke together at the
after the film showed this is noam
chomsky responding to a question about
his own education the truth is I have
absolutely no professional credentials I
literally which is why I'm teaching at
MIT with it in look that's absolutely
true they didn't care it's a
science-based university they didn't
care if you had a guild card something
or other so we saw a little of it there
but I hated high school it was in it was
the academic high school in the city the
one that all the kids went to who were
going to go to college teachers didn't
really have to work very hard because we
were going to pass the exams anyway and
I couldn't stand it this is 1945 there
were no questions about going to some
college isn't somewhere else you lived
at home you worked you went to the local
college period local college happened to
be the University of Pennsylvania as a
high school student looked at the look
through the catalog looked really
exciting all these great courses and all
sorts of different fields I was really
looking forward to getting out and going
to college after my first year of
college each course I took in every
field was so boring but it didn't go to
the classes in the way I was post quite
interested in chemistry but the way I
passed the chemistry course was because
I had a friend the young woman about my
age who took extremely meticulous notes
and red and blue and so on and she lent
me her note so I didn't have to go to
class and I could pass the exams you had
to go to there was a lab and I knew you
know if I try to carry out a lab
experiment it's not going to work period
but there was a lot man you
it was obvious what the answers had to
be so I just filled in the answers and I
never even went to the lab and then I
had my comeuppance when I had to apply
the next semester because I was charged
seventeen dollars which was a lot of
money in those days for lab breakage and
I couldn't tell them look I never went
to the lands so I had the pitiful but it
sort of went on like that I never really
had an undergraduate degree by the time
it was I was I started mainly taking a
scattering of graduate courses without
much background in them I then was lucky
enough to get for your fellowship
graduate fellowship just did my own work
and essentially never had I never had
much of a formal education it was a one
of the greatest education educational
experiences I ever had in those four
years it was at Harvard was to have a
desk in the stacks and those days the
stacks were open not anymore graduate
student had a little desk in the stacks
and he had the whole of widener library
this amazing library there he can kind
of walk around and pick things out from
all kind of place things you never heard
of and pursue them that was fantastic
experience I think it's a great way to
get an education and then I was again
very lucky I got to MIT which is a
research institution they didn't care
what didn't care about credentials you
could work on what you wanted to and
turned out very well but the it's just a
series of accidents I think very few
people are lucky enough to have an
experience like then so I'm not
suggesting that you know to go to
college and do your work and get your
degree noam chomsky at the premiere of
the film is the man who is tall happy he
was also asked to talk about his role in
the making of another feature length
film manufacturing consent released in
1992 known began by talking about one of
the filmmakers Peter when tonic who died
last month on November eighteenth
actually I
can't really claim to have worked with I
spend a lot of time with him and enjoy
talking to him very imaginative
thoughtful dedicated person who spent
really spent his life not only then but
for many years afterwards doing a very
admirable work of all kinds often turned
out in documentary films but on serious
issues which were hard to investigate he
was did a lot of courageous imaginative
work as far as that film is concerned I
had about as much to do with it as the
moon has if people take photographs of
the moon you know I i was giving talks
and giving interviews Peter and Mark
Ackbar was no much call and technically
producers was they come around and film
and we have some interviews and they put
it together and I have to admit I never
saw it I can't stand watching myself so
I never saw the film but I'm told it was
a pretty impressive film they did a very
good job I know one thing that they did
that I was very pleased about was to
take one issue that I'd been spending a
lot of time working on it was a very
difficult case though there were a small
number of people working on it none of
us ever thought it would get anywhere it
was the case of East Timor which may be
you know about which was invaded in 1975
by Indonesia with a strong us support it
led almost quickly to virtual genocide I
don't like the term genocide much but
this one came pretty close maybe 200,000
people killed out of a population of six
or seven hundred thousand all with full
us port us could cut it off in two
minutes England France others also
joined in to try to pick up a bit of the
Spoils indonesia's a rich country lots
of resources a lot of incentives to
support them and there was a very small
number of people we're trying to work
and try to bring some attention to it
see if something could be saved from the
wreckage went on for a long time Amy
Goodman here and was one of the people
in 1991 who she and Alan there and went
and were practically beaten to death in
a demonstration they got it's a very
good work and got some a lot of
important publicity and now finally in
1999 President Clinton under a lot of
pressure international and domestic
essentially called it off with a phrase
he essentially told the Indonesian
generals games over they left that's
what it means to be a powerful state
there's a lot to learn from that but one
thing I I was pleased about in Peters
film is that they emphasized this and
did very evocative an imaginative work
about it which I think probably an
informed plenty of people about it it
may be saved a lot of lives Noam Chomsky
