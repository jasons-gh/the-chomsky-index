up next we sit down with prominent and
controversial academic linguists and
philosopher Noam Chomsky artis marine
import and I have spoke with a renowned
political activist about the world's
most recent development stay with us RT
is sitting down with world renowned
scholar linguist author and MIT
professor Noam Chomsky professor Chomsky
thank you very much for taking time to
speak with our teeth glad to be with you
the first to show ever to speak with you
about is the recent clashes that have
taken place on Wall Street between
Americans who are turning out to
demonstrate and police officers from
what i read you recently sent a message
to support the activists of this group
called Occupy Wall Street you've called
them courageous and honorable you can
you talk to me about your take on Occupy
Wall Street well the wall street is just
a shorthand for the financial
institution the banks are bigger and
Richard before corporate profits are
reaching record levels and for much of
Enda unemployment stays at about the
level of the Great Depression real
unemployment these people are saying oh
let's blame the culture and the
institutions behind them so fiscal
policies like taxation rules of
corporate governance deregulation and so
on it does set in motion a vicious cycle
which is getting worse and worse in New
York so walk down the streets you can
see it a very serious poverty on the
other hand phenomenal wealth right side
by side very much like a third-world
country so what you see if you go to
sub-saharan Africa meanwhile
infrastructure is collapsing schools are
collapsing and all of that increases the
it keeps the cycle going and then
factorizing well it's about time for
some protest what may be new in the
coming year for the twenty twelve
election is that many including yourself
have speculated and is
that campaign spending for the u.s.
election 2012 will exceed 1 billion
police friendly to Kennedy that is a
massive you're probably moderated net
and where does that come from well yeah
basically a lot of it comes from
financial institutions actually look at
the two thousand eight election at
what's one Obama what gave him the
election was primarily financial
institution contributions they preferred
him to McCain expected to be paid back
and they work and the next one will be
even worse incidentally that's only a
part of it in parliamentary systems
including our own up till maybe 20 years
ago positions of influence in a
functioning part of a parliamentary
system let's a chair of a committee
comes from principal at least from
experience senior the legislative
contributions and so on that's gone now
they're bought if you if you want to
become a chair of committee in the house
and the Senate you have to pay off the
party have to pay for it where do you
get the money to pay for same pocket you
don't so provides even more influence to
the already overwhelming influence of
concentrated capital so it's harder and
harder to distinguish between the
elected officials and economic
concentration it never was easy to
distinguish i should say this is not
something novel but now it's a reaching
extreme level well what's left of
america's democratic system if this is
the process that has been cemented in
place and what what is really left if
from every angle there is these managers
just take a look at public opinion
they'll tell you about two-thirds of the
public thinks of the entire Congress
ought to be thrown out doesn't mean it's
going to happen no but it means that the
system isn't working and the public
knows it the poppy
already have been favored ability rating
for congress is in single digit
president not much higher and the same
runs across all other institutions it's
a very widespread sense that everything
is going wrong that tells you the
democratic system is just not
functioning now in fact i don't want to
suggest that this is totally new so you
go back a century and you can still
predict throughout all this period
pretty well the outcome of elections by
campaign funding but there are degrees
and now it's gotten extreme the levels
to which the US is departed from other
capitalist societies a pretty remarkable
you are released a book recently called
911 was there an alternative focusing on
the US assassination of osama bin laden
and the continuity you say between
george shelley bush and barack obama the
killing of osama bin laden's an
interesting case it was done in such a
way as to infuriate the Pakistanis which
is extremely dangerous it's the most
dangerous country in the world and go
into it but you they have a professional
army committed to the sovereignty of
Pakistan if Pakistanis were already
overwhelmingly anti-american this shoots
it through the stratosphere the army is
bitterly angry not only at the invasion
of the country and the murder of someone
on their soil but also that they're
being pressured forced to take part in
an American war in Afghanistan some of
the actually conservative military
analysts who wrote about the bin Laden
assassination I quoted some of them
pointed out quite accurately that
there's a shift between the Bush's
policies and Obama is on this bush
Bush's policy was to kidnap people
whatever you thought about them take
them to Guantanamo or Bagram or some
other torture chamber
I'll try to extract some information out
of them we know what that was like
described it Obama's policy is just to
kill him you're killing them all over
the world no it's targeted assassination
campaigns you know even kidnapped them
and torture I'm just kill him and the
bin Laden assassination was a case in
point it's hard to remember but there
used to be a system of justice in the
West which said that a person is a
suspect until he's proven guilty up
until then he's a suspect he's innocent
until proven guilty well that's fun now
you just kill him if you think they're
guilty so he was apprehended the
resistance is alone with his wife of a
defense nothing highly trained commandos
could certainly have apprehended him
they didn't they were under orders to
murder him and then tossed his body into
the ocean acts that are almost designed
in such a way as to increase anger and
hatred throughout the Muslim world in
fact among anybody who's got their eyes
open you talk about the Obama
administration and how the u.s. actions
right now could be infuriating the
Muslim world the Arab world the Obama
administration has supported the
Tunisians has supported the Egyptians
has supported the Libyans in the
so-called Arab Spring the Palestinians
have officially submitted an application
for un membership and statehood the US
says that they will cast the veto
against it if they have to because they
believe that direct negotiation should
take place between house I'm Israel
before there's an independent Palestine
well first of all I have to make a
qualification of the United States and
its Western Allies did not support the
Egyptian in Tunisian the revolutions
they opposed them they said they back
the dictum in in Tunisia was mostly
France Sarah colony fix colony needed
was the United States Britain they
supported the dictators until the last
minute and when the army turned against
and it was no longer possible to support
them then they say okay what democracy
is wonderful and then they moved to try
to ensure that the regime's would stay
pretty much as they were insights a very
old pattern but putting that aside it's
true that the United States announced
that it would cast a veto for about 35
years the United States and Israel have
been rejecting a political settlement
that is supported by virtually the
entire world the Arab League the
Organization of Islamic states which
includes I ran a lot supports it almost
no relevant party disagrees with it
except that the United States and Israel
won't let it happen how about the fact
that Egypt right now and Turkey have
really suffered their relationship
Israel see that's an effect of the Arab
Spring what that what's happened there
are changes in the world what's
happening is Israel's getting farmer
isolated meaning the u.s. is getting for
more isolated for example a couple
months ago there was a meeting of the
the oligarchs people pretty much on the
economy they warned the government that
they better accept something like this
resolution because they said otherwise
Israel will be as they put it South
Africa nized even more isolated you know
boycotts refusal to load ships and so on
and our economy will collapse now it's
interesting that Israel's reacting
pretty much the way south africa did if
you look back at the history by about
nineteen sixty we have the records the
south african foreign minister called in
the American ambassador described this
to him and said we don't really care as
long as you back us because you're the
one vote that matters and that's how it
worked out right through the 1985 the
1980s UN embargo UN embargo corporations
were pulling out sanctions all over
boycotts
they were doing fine the Reagan
administration was backing them as long
as the US was supporting him nothing
happened then the u.s. withdrew support
and almost instantly apartheid collapsed
they're saying it's in Israel's best
interest and possibly the u.s. to allow
this Palestinian un membership will
stand look I thought for 35 years that
consents I'm stories now that it's been
for almost 40 years there's a choice
between security and expansion very
clear choice now Israel is like other
states it's preferring it effort since
the early 70s it's had a choice between
security and expansion can have peace
but not with expansion into the
territories which incidentally is
recognized to be criminal by everyone
including Israel they can get away with
it as long as the most powerful state in
the world Backson and as long as Europe
goes along the Europe is remarkably
cowardly them out like this but they
don't like to step on the toenails of
the Masters so they go along so you
notice the quartet has back the United
States they picked tony blair you know
off the comment on him but then I might
as well as pictured with to bring the
message it do what the United States
tells you stop this nonsense about
statehood and go back to negotiations
that's where we now stand it's up to the
people in the advanced industrial
countries to compel their they let you
go along the world professor Chomsky
thank you very much for your time yeah
you
