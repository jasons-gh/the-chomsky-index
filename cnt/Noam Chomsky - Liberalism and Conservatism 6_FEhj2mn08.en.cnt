I'd like to hear you speak on the terms
liberal and conservative you obviously
use conservative to in a much more
narrow sense well I use it as in its
dictionary since it's rather ambiguous
yeah in terms of what is to be concerned
right okay I mean the the the terms of
political discourse are at best not
models of clarity and in fact liberal
and conservative are interesting and
that they've just shifted around totally
what is now called conservative and the
dictionary sense was called liberal in
the late 19th century there's an there's
a whole set of ideas called classical
liberalism represented by figured by a
lot of Enlightenment figures some of the
most important for example or vilhelm
fund Humboldt who inspired John Stuart
Mill and Mill himself and you know it
goes back to lock in that tradition
classical liberalism nowadays that's
called conservatism it should be that's
what should be called conservator ms
used properly that's called conservatism
its opposition to state power you know
in fact the the in fact this is a lot of
what the part of the underlying
conception of the United States
government was before it became a state
capitalist system in the nineteenth
century
we go back to the 18th century the
conception was basically this we imagine
a society of essentially equal people
now in fact if you look it was equal
white male property owners but if you
put that aside a society of equal people
roughly equal and what barriers are
there to Liberty well slavery the church
and the state okay so therefore we got a
weakened state power weakened Church
power and in slavery ideas of that sort
are basically classical liberalism
developed in the with a good deal of
sophistication and a modern conservative
like say Taft wants to cut back state
power to cut back say state intervention
in the economy same with saying someone
like Mark Hatfield to preserve the
Enlightenment ID
of freedom of expression of freedom from
state violence of law law-abiding states
and so on and so forth that's roughly
modern conservatism there's almost no
conservatives these days as I said
Hatfield's one another you can find a
couple of others what the way the term
conservative is now used it's used for
people like Reagan that is people who
want to expand the power of the state to
increase state intervention in the
economy to protect the state from public
surveillance to destroy civil liberties
to tear the whatever there is of law to
shreds and so on and so forth that is
not ended with conservatism
now what about liberalism well
liberalism as I said used to mean what I
just described a modern term liberalism
however means something quite different
since I don't exactly win certainly
since the 1930s liberalism has meant a
commitment to the use of state power for
welfare purposes you know so New Deal
type measures and so on that's very
different from classical liberalism in
fact what it is is it's sort of sheds
off towards modern social democracy okay
now you can make some sense out of these
terms they all have some sort of vague
meaning but the new meaning of the term
conservative as applied to the
Reaganites that has no meaning at all
these guys are the opposite of
conservative in any sense on any issue
you can think of they are fanatic status
they believe in state power and state
violence an expansion of state power
they believe in lawlessness you know has
nothing to do with conservatism the fact
that you know you can even use the word
conservative to refute refer to this is
astonishing as I say if Robert Taft
heard this he would turn over in his
grave these are all the things he fought
against any conservative fought against
