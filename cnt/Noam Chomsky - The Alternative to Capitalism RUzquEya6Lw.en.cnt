first of all we should we should bear in
mind that we don't have a capitalist
system a no capitalist system has ever
survived it would self-destruct in five
minutes so what we have is a kind of
state capitalist system with the state
playing a substantial role in American
history of very substantial role in
economic development in production and
research and development a lot of other
times in bailouts lots of other devices
to keep the private sector viable so
it's a kind of a state capitalist system
like others that they vary a little on
how they do it so is there an
alternative to this of course for
example the alternative that was taken
for granted by nineteenth-century
workers before it was sort of beaten out
of people's heads by massive propaganda
they go back to the early Industrial
Revolution which was right around here
eastern Massachusetts I was the period
probably the freest press ever in the
United States there were lots and lots
of newspapers representing different
ethnic groups class workers all sorts of
people and they were there was a lot of
participation in direct participation a
very lively press widely read and so on
and if you look at the working-class
press they were expressing the common
view of working people namely that the
fruit those who work in the mills should
own them and run them yeah that's very
natural and as I say we've come close to
that a number of times
terrifying to private owners they also
held that wage labour is basically no
different from chattel slavery except
that it's temporary and that was such a
popular idea that it was a slip it was a
position of the Republican Party that
Abraham Lincoln espoused it and it makes
sense I mean there's nothing holy about
wage labor you
renting yourself which is not very
different from being a slave except that
maybe lens in time okay so those are
alternatives self-management the
democratic control of institutions
whether their communities or workplaces
or any others alliances among them
federal arrangements these are all
perfectly feasible alternatives there's
no economic or political theory that
tells us is anything wrong with them
they conflict with the structure of
existing power systems and therefore the
educational and cultural system tries to
drive them out of your minds and make
them seem and saying or crazy or
unthinkable but there's nothing
unthinkable about them and you can move
towards realizing them in fact even in
the United States you know major
discussion of these things there are
probably thousands of self-managed
enterprises not huge ones lots of them
and they're growing and they could as I
mentioned they could reach the scale of
say producing the green technology
high-speed rail and so on that the
country badly needs it's not a law of
nature that we have to import solar
technology from China you know poor
developing country or that we have to
get high-speed rail facilities from
Spain those aren't laws of nature those
are political decisions social economic
and political decisions that can be made
differently if they're made differently
enough we'll be moving towards a kind of
an anarchist type society
