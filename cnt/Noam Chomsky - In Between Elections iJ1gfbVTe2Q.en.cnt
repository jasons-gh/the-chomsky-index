first of all my own view as you may or
may not know is that elections are a
relatively insignificant aspect of what
we ought to be doing I mean they're the
propaganda system including the media
tries to get you to focus you know
laser-like on the fact that once every
four years you have a chance to vote for
two very similar candidates from the
business party that's not the important
form of political activism we want to
stop being a failed state and become a
Democratic Society the things are going
to happen have to happen in between the
four year period you want to say take
take Katie a take Katie the first
country in the hemisphere how was our
state elected our seed was elected
because in the slums and the hills of
Haiti where most of the population lives
there was actually a lively vibrant
civil society organized with a lot of
grassroots movements and other kinds of
activism and nobody was paying attention
to it because pay attention to what
those guys are doing but to everyone's
amazement they succeeded in electing
their own candidate and vote of the the
US had a candidate in that election a
World Bank official who everyone assumed
would sail through at all the capital
and everything else he got 14 percent of
the vote they succeeded in developing a
democratic society that could elect
someone of their own we can't even
imagine that we can take lessons from
Haiti about what democracy is and it's
not showing up every four years and
saying vote for me that's not what
democracy is it's all the things that
happen to build up a democratic culture
where you can run your own candidates
now you don't have to choose between you
know two men born great wealth and
political influence who went to the same
elite university and joined the same
secret society and our financed by the
pretty much the same corporate sources
that allow them to run yeah you can get
a Democratic Society
