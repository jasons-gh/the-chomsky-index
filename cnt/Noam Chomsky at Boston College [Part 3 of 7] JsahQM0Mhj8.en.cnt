that doesn't mean civil rights lawyers
it means lobbyists and a couple of other
concentrations of power mostly around
the financial services lobbying and so
on so that's what one would guess would
be the tenor of the actions taken and
everything that's happened since just a
course with it I mean the actions the
first action was a selection of advisors
well the first one was Joseph Biden Vice
President who's an old-time Washington
insider you know kind of a democratic
centrist sometimes a little bit to the
right of the main strongest supporter of
the Iraq war and in the Senate it's just
like a kind of kicking your supporters
in the face but people went along with
it the next major appointment was chief
of staff that's very important that suit
controls the agenda pretty much rahm
emanuel the strongest supporter of the
iraq war in the house also the recipient
of more funding from the financial
services industry than any other maybe
anybody in the house but certainly way
at the top himself as a background as an
investment banker he was asked an
interview with The Wall Street Journal
after his appointed in which he was
asked what are you going to do with the
wait what they called the left wing
Baron's in the Democratic Party like
Barney Frank the people who were talking
about cutting down the military budget
or shifting taxes so as to you know
encourage alternative energy and things
like that he said there's no need to
worry about them we're pragmatic will be
able to control and marginalizing that's
Rahm Emanuel then comes the economic
advisers of course the country's in a
hideous economic tast rafiq getting
worse who are the economic advisors well
go back to the investment theory of
politics the leading one was Robert
Rubin
he was Secretary of Treasury under
Clinton his main task is main
achievement was to undermine the
glass-steagall Act New Deal legislation
that protected commercial banks from
risky investments so it separated them
from investment firms you know insurance
companies and so on so the
glass-steagall Act protected them Reuben
was able to dismantle app so they all
came together the particular corporation
that that benefited was Citigroup which
was going to become a financial super
super market or something like that they
had a bank Sin City core which
incidentally had repeatedly been rescued
by federal bailouts under Reagan and
since but they were protected to some
extent by the legislation okay Rubin
eliminated the legislation quit the
Treasury became a director of Citigroup
which profited immediately from the
opportunity to pick up these extra firms
one international economist him canova
wrote at the time that this is an
obvious violation of the ethics
government act he ought to be on trial
you know but no so he's a director of
Citigroup you know what's happened to
Citigroup there the bankrupt essentially
so you guys have to bail him out that's
usual they've already gotten tens of
billions of dollars they've trying to
separate out the bank from the risky
side parts in fact going back pretty
much of what they were before they
coalesce and ribbon made his pile and
then retired or left and he's now the
leading economic advisor his disciple
well actually the next he was replaced
by Lawrence Summers he was the next
Secretary of the Treasury his great
achievement was to block congressional
legislation that was trying to regulate
exotic financial instruments
derivatives credit default swaps and all
that business so he managed to block
that so they're deregulated okay that's
the other another major element in the
current financial crisis nobody has a
clue who owes what to whom those are the
famous toxic assets which taxpayers are
now expected under Obama's program to
pick up and somehow and do something
with because you can't figure out who
owes what to whom you know now there
would be a way to figure it out and that
would be to take over the max I'm the
banking system is effectively bankrupt
so the taxpayers supposed to bail it out
that's the way our system works the cost
and risk or socialized profits
privatized not just in the financial
industries but everywhere so the natural
thing to do is for the foot you the
pocket in a Democratic Society the
public would take over the banks now
we're supposed to hate that idea it's
called nationalism nationalizing which
is a terrible thing that's just another
aspect of the fear and hatred of
democracy if it's nationalized it means
there's a Kremlin up there which runs it
and that's no good and that's probably
the way it would be here but in a
functioning democracy there would be
popular control of the bank's you know
that's the government what's the
government supposed to be in a
democratic society but those ideas are
completely foreign to our whole way of
thinking I mean you see this kind of
dramatically on April fifteenth you know
we just pay your income taxes the
picture that we live with here is
there's this alien force out there the
government you know it comes from Mars
somewhere and they're taking away our
hard-earned money so that they can you
know give it away to illegal immigrants
or something but suppose you had a
Democratic Society well you welcome
April fifteenth that's the day when we
get together and fund the programs that
we democratically have decided or the
right programs for our community that's
so foreign to the way of thinking here
it sounds like a different language okay
another aspect the same phenomenon the
we don't know the details of the current
they've already spent 350 billion
dollars giving it away to the banks just
given away you know nothing said about
it and the theory is supposed to be when
you give $350 to the banks they're going
to do what you would like like lend the
money I mean what world are you living
in you know I mean you gift for fifty
dollars to the banks are going to stick
up their pockets I mean obviously which
is what they did they recapitalised they
spent it on mergers and acquisitions you
know some lending to federally
guaranteed borrowers but not going to do
with the public wants why on earth
should that's not what the way a
capitalist society should work you know
it's not a benevolent society you're
supposed to do things for yourself The
Associated Press tried to find out
they're the only ones who inquired
apparently far as I could tell they did
try to find out what the banks had done
with it so they sent reporters to the
main banks and they were greeted with
kind of astonishment like what are you
doing here you know it's none of your
business what we do with the money that
we that you gave us you're supposed to
give us money and we do with it what we
feel like so go away not one bank is
willing to tell him anything most didn't
even let them in the door and it's
irrelevant well that was the first 350
billion dollars what's happening to the
next 350 billion well we don't know
because these things are done basically
in secret but it'll probably be pretty
much the same there's such popular anger
against the banks by now in Wall Street
all together the public just wants to
tear it down you know maybe they should
that so Obama had to make some kind of a
gesture and he did he said we'll put a
limit on compensation if you get a
bailout you can't get more than half a
million dollars a year that's probably
if that applies at all it will be too
maybe
half a dozen people there that's what
accountants and lawyers are for to
figure out ways of getting around that
which they almost certainly will so it's
unlikely that anyone is going to be
punished by being restricted to half a
million dollars a year but they had to
make a gesture for the rest we simply
don't know there's no indication that
the public will have anything to say
about what the banks do maybe something
but it's not clear what if anything and
that follows I mean when you're put into
office by the financial services
industry that's your constituency so
you're going to do what you can for them
Obama did have a meeting last November
of a couple of dozen advisors the
business press Bloomberg News ran
through the record of each person's
background and so on and it concluded
that these people should not be
preparing the next stages
