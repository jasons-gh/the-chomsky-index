Trump knows what he's doing when he
builds up fear of the rapists and
murderers and Islamic terrorists just to
give you an example a couple of weeks
ago Steve Bannon you know his yes kind
of Rasputin came down to Arizona where
we live in Tucson and there was a
meeting he ran a meeting at a very
luxurious gated community south of
Tucson not too far from the border
you know guards gates are very rich and
so on the perp had a lot of nice people
they were like Crisco botch this guy
who's trying to keep people from voting
yeah there was a good report of it and
kind of a independent Tucson newspaper
through Sun Sentinel had a reporter
there the goal of the meeting was to try
to raise private money to build the wall
because Congress is run by communists
you know there are not do anything
so all these super-rich people are
pitching in money to build the wall but
the discussions were interesting a
people were describing how frightened
they are I mean if there's anybody in
the world safer than them I don't know
how you'd find them yeah but these are
people who are frightened we got to
protect ourselves in fact there was one
legislator there who said I'm not only
in favor of the wall I think we ought to
have a wall from the border right along
the Arizona border against California
all the way up to the Canadian border
because these people are going to come
in from California you know yeah we've
got to protect ourselves and not only do
maybe we need an army to protect us
around the gated community but yeah and
when Trump talks to the public at least
according to the reports that come up
people resume ya know it's it really
works affected I never know what's Trump
whether it's an accident or whether he's
plant you know whether he really knows
what he's doing whether they just
latches on by luck to an issue that that
seems to resonate and he uses oh you
know and then pick it up he just tests
of the water
not very but meanwhile you have to
remember that his primary constituency
corporate power
yeah wealthy he's serving them with real
dedication we'd use would you say that
in terms of enemy I don't want to harp
on this too much but it in terms the
greatest danger if there is one of Trump
being president many people feel that
the fact that he's loose can and the
fact that he does no no no no reading no
knowledge about details about the world
around or certainly doesn't read or
listen to his advisers would you say
that's a bigger danger than the fact
that effectively he's apparently
implementing underneath all the noise
the the an agenda that that that you
worry about her not I mean there's a lot
of dangers with drunk the worst one
which overwhelms everything else is the
dedication to destroy the environment
yeah yeah I mean that just swamps
everything else that ought to be a
screaming headline every day wait I'm
surprised that if if if if private money
wanted to build the wall eight point six
billion is not enough money for that
could easily be done I mean more than
that spent on Elections that but but
interestingly enough when you put in
perspective talking about the
environment and talking about about
progress eight point six billion which
is what he's asking for the wall was
more is more than the entire amount the
entire budget of the National Science
Foundation I mean if we talks about what
is better for our security in the future
how about the subsidies to the fossil
fuel industry much bigger than that how
about the subsidies to the financial
institutions there's some good technical
studies IMF and others who point out
that the financial institutions which
are pretty much predatory they don't
they barely help the economy they may
harm it and they're a huge part of the
economy a huge they are maintained
effectively by public subsidy by the
implicit government insurance policy
which raises their credit ratings gives
them access to cheap money when you
count all the
it's pretty much their profits I mean
compared with this the wool and the
National Science Foundation aren't even
visible yeah yeah no that's I mean it's
interesting to think about that I mean
and similarly when we come to the
climate change and and although this is
it that's the the two things that ought
to be emphasized by the political
opposition if there were one or this
dedicated commitment to destroy the
prospects for organized human life
within a short period and the radical
intensification of the already extremely
dangerous arms continent
