ladies and gentlemen friends a very warm
welcome to this very special Pierhead
session tonight my name is Jane Davidson
and I'm the minister with a
responsibility for sustainability and
climate change in the welsh assembly
government but I think that I've been
given the privileged opportunity of
introducing our guest this evening
because when I heard he was coming I
said I studied him back in 1975 as the
father then of modern linguistics now
Noam Chomsky wrote a book actually in
the 50s are called syntactic structures
which has influenced huge numbers of
people in the context of the debate
about language and there was a
particular example that he used in that
book which is colorless green ideas
sleep furiously now I'd like to say to
you that my studying of Noam Chomsky led
me to a great understanding of issues
around linguistics I have to say that
that phrase just became a password
become between a small number of
students at Birmingham University at the
time in terms of our particular grouping
we condensed it to see g.i SF it was our
restricted code and anybody who knew
that was in with our in crowd so sadly I
can't give you any other linguistic gems
but to say that therefore Noam Chomsky
has influenced my life from the early
1970s interestingly enough in two
thousand he was top of the list for the
University of Minnesota's top 100 of the
most influential individuals in
cognitive science we are talking about a
man who has had fantastic influence on
language on politics on psychology
on other aspects of cognitive science
but interestingly enough when I did a
bit of delving I found that he was 10
when he had his first political article
published about the Spanish Civil War
and the rise of fascism in Europe he is
hero worshipped by the
anti-globalization movement John Pilger
Michael Moore the late harold pinter all
are among his disciples and it can't be
that many silver-haired professors who
have appeared on stage with rage against
the machine The New Yorker had him as
one of the finest minds of the 20th
century the New York Times describes him
as arguably the most important
intellectual alive and in the last six
months looking at his official site we
see interviews and writings on hopes and
prospects for activism at the sherrard
of israeli-palestinian talks WikiLeaks
cables reveal profound hatred for
democracy in the part of our political
leadership this is the most remarkable
regional uprising that I can remember
about Egypt and democracy uprising in
the USA but Wisconsin's resistance to
assault in the public sector the Obama
sanctioned crackdown on activists and
the distorted legacy of Ronald Reagan
now this is from a man in his 80s and
that is the kind of performance and
output that I think would shame most of
us so it's not surprising that he was
voted the leading living public
intellectual in 2005 Prospect magazine
in the UK and the New Statesman had him
as number seven of the heroes of our
time if I had had a better internet
connection coming back from command on
this afternoon I might have found out
who were the first six but if the
Guardian is right noam chomsky's here
tonight because of his engagement with
Cardiff University Green Party and
Friends of Palestine and he will be
speaking at a sold-out event in sindh
David's Hall tomorrow no I'm contacted
the students after a three-day sit-in a
couple of years ago where they were
protesting at the
universities investment in arms
companies and the protest forced the
university to pull the funds and invest
elsewhere he is known to be very
generous with his time answering
thousands of emails are sent to him
every week so from that virtual presence
to the real presence from that global
star to a local delivery and delighted
to welcome Noam Chomsky here to this
very special session here tonight when
you have your chance to ask a world
renowned linguist scholar political
analyst one of the most intellectual
influential intellectuals of our age
your questions please give a very warm
welcome to professor Noam Chomsky
right I'll need assistance in opening
the water but no a very warm welcome
here in Wales and I just wanted to take
chairs privilege this evening if I may
and start with a question around climate
change you said that the 2010 elections
in the United States could be an
interpreted as a death knell for the
species because most of the new
Republicans in Congress are climate
change deniers and you said that if this
was happening in some small country it
wouldn't matter much but when it's
happening in the richest most powerful
country in the world it's a danger to
the survival of the species with all
your experience of the world do you
think that the human race can save
itself from climatic disaster actually
there are two major threats to survival
of the species one of them is
environmental catastrophe the other
which is that around since 1945 is
nuclear weapons and they're both our
severe threats are severe and they're
growing in both cases back in 1955
Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein
came out but issued a memorandum they
wish they called on the people of the
world to face e to recognize that they
face a choice that is stark and
unavoidable either mankind will abandon
more or the species will be destroyed
and it's come very close several times
there it's actually growing today that's
one threat the other is environmental
disaster which people weren't thinking
much about
in the 1950s I have to say my own first
awakening to the question was in the
early 1970s when close friend of mine
well known climb an earth scientist head
of the earth sciences department at MIT
where i teach showed me some new
information that was coming out about
issues and global warming the
consequences the possibility of
reversing it and so any of us pretty
grim this was early 70s much better
understood now and the prognoses are
much worse and that doesn't seem to be a
lot of time to do much about it and
going back to the republican congress
what happened I suppose you know is that
of the new members of Congress virtually
all or climate deniers there and what
makes it worse is that many of them are
true believers so for example the head
of one of the subcommittee's on the
environment the new head of one of the
subcommittee's explain to the press that
there can't be a problem of global
warming because God promised Noah that
there wouldn't be another disaster so
forget it that again if that was
happening and say Minako it might not
matter so much but it's happening in a
country where half the population
believes that the world was created a
few thousand years ago exactly as it is
now with all the fossils and everything
else a third of the population thinks
that every word of the Bible is
literally true and maybe
ninety percent believe in miracles
two-thirds are expecting the second
coming it's in cross-cultural studies
it's way off at the extreme and
religious extremism actually this comes
right back to the English colonists and
in fact England is pretty far off the
spectrum too but the original colonists
were religious fanatics they were you
know waving the holy book when they were
returning to the they were the children
of Israel returning to the promised land
killing the Amalekites the way the Lord
told them and so on and so forth and
that's remained through the scotch-irish
immigration and right up until today
it's a it's a large part of the
population Nana it never was an
organized politically organized part
until about the 1980s what happened then
is that the Republican Party which at
that point with Reagan was no longer
really a because it was losing its
character as a political party it was
getting so deep into the pocket of major
corporations that you needed a telescope
to find them they're practically are no
moderate Republicans left that some of
the like say Eisenhower or Nixon for
example would be considered a raving
leftist and the political spectrum in
fact today's Democrats are what used to
be moderate Republicans and very few
exceptions there are a lot of reasons
for this go into them but it's has to do
with changes in the economy and
political changes and so on but it's
happening and they need a play need a
base they need a voting base and they've
tried to organize the previously
unorganized a very substantial religious
extremists we call it extremist
community into a voting base anyway
that's part of it another part which is
even more dangerous is that the major
corporations are have for several years
now
been openly advertising the fact that
they're carrying out large propaganda
campaigns to convince the population
that global warming is just a liberal
hoax now that's rather interest I mean
if you could pretend you're a Martian
and you don't care what happens it's
intellectually interesting because the
CEOs of those corporations have the same
set of values and understanding that
most of us have they know perfectly well
that it's real and that its grave and
that it will destroy what they own and
destroy the lives of their grandchildren
but they don't really have a choice and
that's what makes it dangerous the
position they're taking is a kind of an
institutional necessity not an
individual choice if they don't take
this position they'll be eliminated and
somebody also come in who will do it and
the reason is that in a kind of semi
market systems that we have not really
market systems but they have elements of
market systems that people in
decision-making positions say to see you
of a corporation they have a duty to
perform actually an Anglo American law
it's actually a legal duty but it's an
institutional duty anyway they have to
maximize short-term profit and market
share if they don't do that first of all
is illegal and secondly they'll be out
and somebody else will be in well if you
want to maximize short-term profit and
market share you don't want regulations
you don't want interference you you want
to be free to act be you don't want laws
even because you want to act in criminal
fashion which will often happens and it
means that you must ignore what
economists call externalities that is
the consequences of an action for others
that's a large part of the reason why we
have a financial crisis if you're a
investment banker let's say
you know goldman sachs manager or
something like that you have to
disregard what they all understand that
what's called systemic risk meaning if
you're a if you initiate a transaction
you do it in such a way that it's good
for you and if there's a risk you try to
cover your risk but you don't pay
attention to the risk the whole system
will crash and that's inevitably going
to happen and these it under these
institutional arrangements fact once
since the regulatory apparatus of the
30s 40s 50s has been dismantled yes you
have repeated financial crises you're
going to continue to happen well in that
case when you have a financial crisis
there's a way to rescue it you go to the
taxpayer the taxpayer bails you out
maybe they don't like it but that's
what's done so there's a possible answer
Goldman Sachs can make risky investments
risky transactions and make a lot of
money make a lot of profit because
they're risky when it all crashes is
going to do you take your copy of you
know Hayek and Milton Friedman you're
under the nanny state and they barely
out that happens repeatedly now in the
case of climate change that's it the
externality in this case is the fate of
the species so when you're making
decisions as a director of a corporation
one of the externalities you can't pay
attention to is what's the effect on my
grandchildren you have to maximize
short-term profit and market share in
this case there's nobody to bail you out
so there's no taxpayer can come and take
care of it after the crash comes but
these are institutional necessities and
that's what makes them so dangerous it
means you kids no point convincing CEO
that you shouldn't be doing this he
knows it already but if he doesn't do
what someone else is going to do
that's just the way the institution is
set up the way markets work and to the
extent that we have unregulated markets
which is partial but true you're going
to get more and more of this well these
propaganda campaigns in the last couple
of years have had a big effect you can
see it in opinion polls by now about a
third of the population thinks there's a
serious danger of global warming the
rest either outright deny at or say it's
not important and that that's
exacerbated by other developments so in
the midst of a serious recession and in
the United States for a large part of
the population it's a depression gets
back to the depression for example in
manufacturing industry unemployment is
at depression levels the levels of that
I remember as a kid in the 1930s really
serious and worse because the jobs
aren't going to come back because part
of the economic changes if part of its
been financialization of the economy the
other sort of corollary to that has been
export of production also for
institutional reasons to make more money
that way so the jobs aren't coming back
the depression logo people don't want to
hear about things that don't matter to
their immediate survival and there are
other factors that contribute but the
net effect is that a fairly small part
of the population roughly a third thinks
that this is a really serious issue the
former political party now call the
Republicans which have no programs
nothing just enrich the rich that's the
book that's the program they don't want
climate change on top of that kind of
change concerns on top of that there's
the religious element the subcommittee
chair who says God promised Noah and so
on and so forth all of this is combining
to yield to lead to direct policies you
can read them in the newspapers every
day Congress
the new Congress has cut off funding for
the international organization that
deals with climate change they're
eliminating the virtually eliminating
the Environmental Protection Agency and
just to show you how politics has
changed over the years that was
introduced by Richard Nixon he was the
last liberal president ever since then
there hasn't been a liberal president
literally one of his lip liberal in the
US since you know kind of social
democratic he was there's one of a
number of such initiatives of his this
is being shipped away virtually
destroyed the regulatory system and so
on and their other many other examples
well you know that has consequences one
of the consequences is it is a
potentially at death knell for the
species there's no way to resurrect the
destruction if this continues it's not
like systemic risk in the financial
system we get a bailout from the
taxpayer no bailouts in this case and
it's a combination of institutional
problems which means that the
institutions are going to have to change
if if there's a way out of this and
other factors that's the ones that I
mentioned they're combining in a very
dangerous way so it's kind of a race i
think if some Martian we're watching
what's happening here they'd be laying
bets on which way the human species is
going to destroy itself there's two
competitors one is nuclear weapons the
others environmental catastrophe and it
could well be one of the other actually
there's a rather grim forecast I think
the answer was no
thanks for that thing I think the
globalization markets poverty nuclear
weapons there is a huge amount for us to
talk about tonight
