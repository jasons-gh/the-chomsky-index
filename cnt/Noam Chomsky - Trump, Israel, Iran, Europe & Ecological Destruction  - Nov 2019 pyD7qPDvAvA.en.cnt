what's your advice to the ARP leaders
that took a finish from that there's no
advice to the leaders they know what
they're doing what the advice should be
is to the general population
[Music]
the leaders are sentenced to 20 years
many trauma listen child
what do you think about that situation
[Music]
pretty healthy is what I think about it
question is what to do about it the Arab
leaders are concerned with their own
interests our the wealth control
nominations I don't think they want to
attack you right but what they might be
provocative
[Music]
it's a great pleasure to be with you you
have always considered that humanity is
facing to to agree threats the
ecological destruction and the nuclear
threat let's start by the first one the
ecological destruction
dr. Chomsky as a philosopher do you
think that there is still a chance or a
possibility to make a balance between
the technological developments the
scientific developments and the effects
well I put it the other way scientific
developments are the only way for us to
escape the cash catastrophe which would
be from an ethical point of view utterly
disasters
it's science that will help us escape
the facts the only way for us to escape
the looming disaster of environmental
destruction and as I say from an ethical
point of view destroying the prospects
for organized human life about the worst
time that you can imagine but the only
answer to that problem is scientific
developments so for example if we can
move to sustainable energy it's because
of what science Chiefs not what achieved
in the literature Department are you
pessimistic the disaster is ready
imminent
I think the disaster is very close I
don't see any reason to challenge the
overwhelming consensus virtually a
hundred percent of the serious climate
scientists and they have plenty of
evidence that were moving to within a
generation or two we might reach total
order - me if something serious isn't
it's not being done conserving the
second trail the nuclear threat as you
know Trump withdrew from the deal of the
famous deal of 2015 but the lates even
proved that he looks like he could
engage a war against yarn isn't it a
positive mark in your view can we expect
a world more balanced it than well now I
don't think that the Trump
administration wants to attack it read
the consequences of that could be
they're unpredictable but they could be
devastating for example Iran has
sufficient missile capacity to attack
the air the Northeast areas of Saudi
Arabia this issue at the areas where the
oil where most of the oil is oil
facilities and also where the
desalination facilities or that would
correctly wait that's not you Raymond
they could the US would probably respond
with some devastating attack but then it
could easily spread and you know where
we'll go couldn't make Isis look tame
but I don't think they want to attack
Iran but what they maybe might the
provocative moves that they're making
might need to an accidental conflict say
in the Gulf of Hormuz which would blow
up without anyone's intending to be but
easily happen that Iran in a small boat
not users you know it you as your career
you know it will be a real disaster but
more globally the Middle East is the
Middle East North Africa or the Middle
East as you call it here in u.s. the
Middle East is very troubled are you
optimistic about its future with all the
cultural problems ethnical problems are
you optimistic dr. Tomsky it reminds me
what you said about Israeli society it's
with its cultural problems its internal
problems how these problems may have a
significant impact on its power
can we talk about self-destruction like
others let's just see rich problem but
that's not the most important I think
the problem with in Israel is the
European based religious population
which is expanding very quickly at our
current population which doesn't
contribute to the society that is
becoming an enormous factor and it's
undermining the secular character the
society instating to a serious and
terrible crisis for the there is the
Arab Jewish community is also
participating
Livni their own you know their own
elements for the elements I hope you
heard about the deal of the century you
don't even know whether it lists but
from the proposals that have been leaked
out it seems like an effort to eliminate
the Palestinian issue by sort of trying
to organize some funding that will
satisfy minimal Palestinian that needs
is no indication where that funding will
come and will to some kind of alliance
between Israel and the reactionary Arab
states one of the is very hard to find a
coherent geopolitical program behind the
chaos the trunk creates all over but
there is one as an effort to construct
an alliance of the most reactionary
States in the Middle East that would
mean the Gulf dictatorships CCS Egypt
Israel which is shifting far to the
right
beyond this Modi's in the or bonds under
a few others and to make that a kind of
an international base reactionary
alliance which would be the base of
trumps power could extend the Brazil
Wilson ro others this is pretty explicit
than Li the dictates of Steve Bennett
who was an advisor he talks about it
openly and it's probably probable that
that's in the background
people who are carrying out any kind of
to strategic analysis and trunk
administration that may not include him
he's doing something else probably
doesn't know about it doesn't cure but
meant for the Palestinians it means just
didn't mean everything there but Trump
[Music]
this is the classic caution the
traditional question how do you explain
not the silence but the complicity of
Arab leaders Arab leaders are concerned
with their own interests our wealth
controlled nominations for them the
they're compelled to show concern for
the Palestinians because they have to
keep their own populations quiet and the
population for the populations this is a
big issue but you know there's been a
kind of a tacit alliance between Saudi
Arabia and Israel since release insulin
7 1967 which is when US policy towards
Israel changed radically before then it
was but there was commitment but nothing
as extremists followed that and the
reason is in 1967 Israel provided a
great service to both the United States
and Saudi Arabia by destroying the base
of secular Arab nationalism which is the
main rival to Saudi Arabia radical Islam
that's an old conflict when the British
dominated the region they tended
overwhelmingly to support radical Islam
against secular nationalism when the
u.s. took over deducting pretty much the
same policy and that's understandable as
secular nationalism can lead to
independence development their lives at
Birth adducts radical Islam you can
assume
take care of Napoleon 911 was accepted
because it works my second time
and for them that meant by the post 1967
region in Europe for the first part of
US policy was based on three pillars as
they were cool one was Saudi Arabia one
wasn't read in under the Shah
the third was his room and the relations
between Iran and Israel were very close
a lot of this came out theoretically
they were war with one another but in
fact they had very close relations well
this came out after the short film lots
of information appeared but it turned
out that virtually all the Israeli
leaders had traveled to Tehran and they
were closely they were acting in very
close concert of many issues and Saudi
Arabia was sort of part of it on the
side and one of the this great deal of
the century a part of it is just to try
to bring all this name of the open buddy
right now of course but was the
reactionary Arab States and others in
the region the same context of all the
cultural problems more globally in the
world how do you explain the the
expansion of the right wing next time
that's happening all over the world but
also there's resistance to it happens
all over the world take a look right now
Chile masses that Hong Kong was lots of
uprising against harsh repressive
regimes
Lawson is the source of a lot of this
all over the world
the impact of the Neal the impact of the
neoliberal programs of the legend
eration which have had a pretty harsh
effect almost everywhere in the United
States for example and in Europe they've
led to high concentration of wealth
pretty much stagnation for most of the
population undermining of democratic
forms that is people angry resentful
discontent with established institutions
it's it's fertile territory for
demagogues to arise to try to turn
people's anger against scapegoats
usually people even more vulnerable than
your the immigrants Muslims African
Americans and others but at the same
time and it's it's leading to a kind of
a popular reaction which is seeking to
overcome the of these crises so for
example in Chile you may have seen the
one of the slogans of the demonstrators
is it's not 30 bases it's 30 years we
want to get rid of the legacy of the
Pinochet dictatorship which was the
first major experiment in neoliberalism
it was imposed by force Chile later
spread with Thatcher and Reagan to the
Western world and effects of elsewhere
the structural adjustment programs and
Latin American but several decades of
under development and although this is
piling up in many ways if you look at
the individual countries there are
specialists but this is a kind of an
undercurrent you see everywhere
it's you kind of contempt for the
centrist institutions that have run the
societies for many years this is a
pretty natural consequence of what the
policies have meant to people in Europe
the special feature the structure of the
European Union is deeply undemocratic
major decisions taken out of the heads
of people they're placed in the
bureaucracy of Brussels naturally
causative resentment especially because
the nature of the qualities which is the
austerity policies have been very large
other places there's initiatives but
this is a kind of an odd record and kind
of like the Arab Spring which may come
back it's undermining the democratic
forms it's because of neoliberal
programs it's also a representative
democracy crisis isn't it dr. Tomsky
listen Europe very strikingly so as I
say in Europe major decisions are made
said unrelated bureaucracy in Brussels
with ignore their banks looking over
their shoulders
now there's something not too different
in the United States and England the
effect of the neoliberal programs the
sharp concentration of wealth the
stagnation for the general population
has exacerbated features of Western
democracies that were already there
namely the overwhelming power of
concentrated wealth of corporate power
that's been exaggerated enormous
the only real period so if you know how
to tubes towards conquerors or people
single-digit support there's anything
you said that the offspring may come
back as you know the populations are
evolved against dictatorship and
authoritarianism but it went bad because
especially offshore politics now the
populations are taken hostage between
the authoritarianism and instability
what's the solution in your view dr.
Tomsky solution is did what was begun
with the Arab Spring but was aborted by
concentrated power to move the hunt
eliminate the autocratic reactionary
social structure at the introduce really
functioning democracy there were steps
towards that but they were crushed in
one or other way that turn is yet sort
of mildly developed in Egypt there
wasn't like but it elected the Muslim
Brotherhood which had its own kind of
autocratic repressive character that
unfortunately the military coup the
progressives part of the population
welcomed the military coup much of it
because they thought it would bring
democracy Egypt
that's quite an illusion military coup
introduced was probably the hardest
period in Egypt's history in Syria of
course everything
crash but I think the germs still
existed though probably come back up in
Egypt there were recently demonstration
they were crushed authoritarian leaders
took advantage from that situation to
supplies their people while the social
causes is increasing what's your advice
to the authoritarian Arab leaders
there's no advice the leaders they know
what they're doing what the advice
should be is to the general populations
there's the organizers carry out
significant actions to try to overthrow
the the dismantle the authoritarian
structure of the states in the economy
but that's in the hands of the
population the leaders are not going to
do it they're the ones that benefit
firmly fuck how about this happen you
know in Morocco to popular pressures it
was some relaxation of authoritarian
structures same in the United States I'm
in the United States in many ways is a
more civilized country that it was 50 or
60 years ago but that's not a gift from
leaders that's because of popular
activism which forced the leadership
class to yield to the pressures of the
population now that can go much further
there's actually great social tension in
Morocco many hundreds of political
prisoners men hundreds of peaceful
demonstrators from the reef region have
been arrested during last year's for
asking for drop hospital education their
leaders are sentenced to 20 years many
journalists in jail what do you think
about that situation dr. Tomsky pretty
healthy issue I think the question is
what to do
but I mean if you look at Egypt they're
about 60,000 but that's what popular
organization should be struggling to
overcome and it would be very good if
there were international so that the
Solidarity of this to support them but
the leaders are not going to do anything
you have to force above the leadership
and there's only one way that works
that's by popular activism which is not
easy you get shot by the police and
imprisoned and so on but over time it
can succeed if you look at history there
are many things that were repressive
systems that looked is this they've no
last forever
we're in need who return in the same
context no message from you to the
kingdom Ahamed the sixth yeah Kenickie
yeah sure I should think you would
essentially resign and favor the
Democratic Society but he's not going to
do it it'll have to be forced on him
popular pressure he's not asking for my
advice institution
thank you very much professor I hope you
enjoyed the questions you are thinking
