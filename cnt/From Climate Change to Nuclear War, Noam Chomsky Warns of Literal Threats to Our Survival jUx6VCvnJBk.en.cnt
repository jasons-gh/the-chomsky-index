this is democracy now democracynow.org
I'm Amy Goodman we return now to MIT
professor Noam Chomsky speaking at the
event the u.s. isolation at Marrakesh is
symptomatic of broader developments that
we should think about pretty carefully
there are of considerable significance
u.s. isolation in the world is
increasing in remarkable ways maybe the
most striking is right in this
hemisphere now what used to be called
our little region over here Henry
Stimson Secretary of War under Roosevelt
our little region over here are we
nobody bothers us if anybody gets out of
line we punish them harshly otherwise
they do what we say that's very far from
true during this century Latin America
for the first time in five hundred years
has freed itself from Western
imperialism last century that's the
United States the International Monetary
Fund which is basically an agency of the
US Treasury has been kicked out of the
of South America entirely there are no
US military bases left the international
organizations
the hemispheric organizations are
beginning to exclude the United States
and Canada in 2015 there was a summit
coming up and the United States might
have been excluded completely from the
hemisphere over the issue of Cuba that
was the crucial issue that the
hemisphere on which the hemisphere
opposed US policy as does the world
that's surely the reason why Obama made
the gestures towards normalization that
were at least some step forward and
could be reversed under Trump we don't
know on a much more far-reaching scale
something similar is happening in Asia
the as you know one of Obama's major
policies was the so-called pivot to age
Asia which was actually a measure to
confront China transparently one
component of the pivot Asia was the TPP
the trans-pacific partnership which
excluded China tried to bring in other
asia-pacific countries well that seems
to be on its way to collapse
for pretty good reasons I think at this
at the same time there's another
international trade agreement that is
expanding and growing namely China's the
region what they call their regional
comprehensive economic partnership which
is now drawing in US allies from Peru to
Australia to Japan the US will probably
choose to stay out of it just as the
United States virtually alone has stayed
away from China's Asian infrastructure
Development Bank kind of counterpart to
the World Bank that the US has opposed
for many years but has now been joined
by practically all US allies Britain and
others that's at the same time China is
expanding to the west with the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization the China based
Silk Roads
the whole system is an integrated system
of energy resource sharing and so on it
includes Siberia with its rich resources
includes Indian Pakistan Iran
will soon join it appears and probably
turkey this will extend all the way from
China to Europe the United States has
asked for observer status and it's been
rejected not permitted one of the major
commitments of the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization the whole of the Central
Asian states is that there can be no US
military bases in this entire region
another step towards isolation may soon
take place if the president-elect
carries through his promise to terminate
the nuclear weapons the nuclear deal
with Iran other countries who are
parties to the deal might well continue
they might even ignore Europe mainly
that means ignoring US sanctions that
will extend us isolation even from
Europe and in fact Europe might move
under these circumstances towards
backing off from the confrontation with
Russia actually brexit may assist with
this because Britain was the voice of
the United States and NATO the harshest
voice now it's out is Europe some
opportunities there were choices in
1990-91 time of the collapse of the
Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev had
recalled a vision of a common European
home
a an integrated cooperative system of
security commerce interchange no
military alliances from the Atlantic to
the Pacific the u.s. insisted on a
different vision namely Soviet Union
collapses and NATO remains and indeed
expands their right up to the borders of
Russia now we're very serious threats
are are evident daily well all of this
these are significant developments
they're related to the widely discussed
matter of decline of American power
there are some conventional measures
which however are misleading and quite
interesting ways of say a word about it
because there's no time but it's
something to seriously think about by
conventional measures in 1945 the United
States had reached the peak of global
dominance nothing like it in history it
had perhaps 50% of total world's wealth
other industrial countries were
devastated or destroyed by the war
severely damaged the US economy had
gained enormous Lee from the war and was
in the u.s. in general had a position of
dominance with no historical parallel
well that of course couldn't last other
industrial countries reconstructed by
around 17th 1970 the world was described
as tri-polar three major economic
centers a German base Europe us-based
North America and the North East Asian
area
at that time Japan based now China has
moved in as a partner conflict and
partner by now by that time us share and
global wealth was about 25 percent and
today it's not far below that well all
of this is highly misleading because it
fails to take into account a crucial
factor which is almost never discussed
though there's some interesting work on
it that's the question of ownership of
the world economy
take a look at the corporate the
multinational corporations around the
world
what are they owned well that turns out
to be a pretty interesting matter in
virtually every this increasingly during
the period of neoliberal globalization
of the last generation well corporate
wealth is becoming a more realistic
measure of global power than national
wealth corporate wealth of course is
naturally based supported by taxpayers
like us but it the ownership has nothing
to do with us
corporate ownership if you look at that
it turns out that in virtually every
economic sector the manufacturing
finance services retail and others US
corporations are well in the lead in
ownership of the global economy and
overall their ownership is close to 50%
of the total that's roughly the
proportion of u.s. national wealth in
1945 tells you something about the
nature of the world in which we live of
course that's not for the benefit
of American citizens but of those who
owned and managed these private publicly
supported private to quasi totalitarian
systems if you look at the military
dimension of course the u.s. is supreme
nobody's even close no point talking
about it but it is possible that Europe
might take a more independent role it
might move towards something like
Gorbachev
vision that might lead to a relaxed
relaxation of the rising and very
dangerous tensions at the Russian border
which would be a very welcome
development well there's a lot more to
say about the fears and hopes and
prospects the threats and dangers are
very real there are plenty of
opportunities and as we face them again
particularly the younger people among
you we should never overlook the fact
that the threat that we now we now face
are the most severe that have ever
arisen in human history
they are literal threats to survival
nuclear war environmental catastrophe
these are very urgent concerns they
cannot be delayed they became more
urgent on November 8 for the reasons you
know and that I mentioned they have to
be faced directly and soon
if the human experiment is not to prove
to be disastrous failure MIT professor

political dissident speaking Monday
