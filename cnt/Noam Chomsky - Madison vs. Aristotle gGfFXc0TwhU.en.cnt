Madison pointed out that the British
system would have problems if they
transferred it over here and that is
because the United States they did want
to make it he did he and other the other
founding fathers as they're called did
want to make it a more participatory and
democratic society but he said a
Democratic Society has a serious flaw
the flaw is that a Democratic Society
the people can participate and he said
suppose what would suppose I suppose
this would take place in England I
suppose for example in England that they
were really allowed people to vote which
they didn't he said well the first thing
people would do would be to a call for
what we nowadays call agrarian reform
that is they would call for changes in
the land laws which would grant more
people access to the highly privatized
and centralized land system and that
land was a crucial part of the economy
then and he says well we obviously can't
accept that you know we don't want to
have any system that will allow people
to participate and infringe on the
rights of private property and well so
therefore we have to be careful not to
allow a democratic system in which
things really function democratically we
have to make design a system in which
power is in the hands of the wealth of
the nation quoting the more capable set
of men those who are sympathetic with
the rights of property ok they must have
the power and the rest must be dispersed
and factionalized in such a way that
they don't really interfere with the
rights of power actually in Madison who
is no fool recognized that this problem
was going to become greater as time went
on as he put it if I couldn't read my
own notes
he said there's going to be an increase
in the proportion of the population that
Labor's under all the hardships of life
and secretly sighs for a more equal
distribution of its blessings ok this
an increase in that and if those people
really have an ability to participate
they're going to do things which will
infringe on the right of private power
and and private property on the wealthy
and therefore we have to design the
system so that doesn't happen
and indeed the system was designed so
that that wouldn't happen that's the
role of the Senate was to represent the
wealth of the nation and the role of the
separation of powers and so on and so
forth
how will it function you can argue it's
an interesting question but it's worth
noticing that this idea about the nature
of democracy has a long list this
problem in the nature of democracy you
know that namely if people can vote
they're going to vote in their own
interests and infringe on the rights of
private power and wealth that goes that
insight goes way back goes back to the
origins of political theory so you read
the first major book on political theory
and something like our sense Aristotle's
politics that's a core question of
Aristotle's politics
Aristotle distinguishes tyranny
oligarchy and democracy and as a long
elaborate discussion of each and favours
democracy it was perfect but he favored
democracy is the best system for him a
democracy meant was very straightforward
it meant the community of equals or to
be precise free men who are equals and
that phrase free men is rather crucial
but put that aside for a moment a
community of free men who are equal and
participatory and if unless it's equal
and they can't be seriously
participatory he noticed the same
problem that Madison did exactly the
same problem he said suppose that you
did have a democracy where everyone
participated but he had radical
inequality so concentration of wealth he
said well then the poorer part of the
population which is the majority will
use their voting power to for their own
interests to advance their own interests
instead of the common good of all okay
and the goal of the democracy for
Aristotle was to advance the common good
of all but if you had inequality radical
inequality well yeah the majority of the
population would vote for their own
interests which would not be the common
good of all so therefore you had to do
something about that same problem that
the Madison faced you know exactly the
same problem but they reached opposite
conclusions
Madison's conclusion was that we should
reduce democracy so that you don't get
the threat from the population
Aristotle's was the opposite you should
reduce inequality so therefore the
problem won't arise and it will be ahead
you could have a real participatory
democratic system so Aristotle called
for what we today would call a welfare
state he said that a democracy must be
based on use of public revenues to
ensure lasting prosperity for everyone
welfare state in other words and then he
describes in some detail how you could
proceed to do that in Athens do it
differently here but the same kinds of
questions and then if everyone had
moderate but sufficient income you
wouldn't have this problem that both he
and Madison faced but notice that their
choices were radically different one
choice was to aim for equality and
participation and democracy the other
the one on which our country was founded
was to reduce the threat of democracy
maintain the inequality and ensure that
power remains in the Senate you know the
capable class of men the wealthy part of
the you know the wealthy part of the
society that's now internationalized so
this huge financial capital is flowing
around the world is sometimes called by
international economists a virtual
Senate meaning it has the power to
ensure if you really liberalize capital
to ensure that no country will be able
to undertake social policies
that strike at the interest of the
wealthy because if any country moves in
that direction the capital quickly flows
out of it their country goes down to two
so it's a virtual Senate you know kind
of generalization of Madison's Senate
and the opposite of the Aristotelian
conception of democracy is necessarily
based on a welfare state and equality to
go back to that word freemen a democracy
for Aristotle meant men not women and
free not slaves you know our alien so
it's a sub part of the population but
it's a little hard to dump on Aristotle
for that since given that those
questions weren't even addressed and
badly addressed until this century you
know and still are far from address but
that's a significant qualification but
the principles are there and they come
right up to the present
it's also been understood and it by now
it's and this this battle sort of
struggle up and back between the two
conceptions of democracy is a large part
of modern history major theme of modern
history runs right through the
nineteenth century it's hard to remember
now but in the nineteenth century which
was a rather anarchic period in the
United States it was quite generally
assumed that you not only had to have an
equal and participatory society but you
couldn't but that even wage labor was an
intolerable infringement on human rights
that wasn't a radical position that was
the slogan of the Republican Party for
example you can read it in the New York
Times editorials in nineteen eighteen
seventy it was they slogan under which
many northern workers fought the civil
war it was Abraham Lincoln's you know
position wage labor is not very
different from chattel slavery
because it's a it's a fundamental
infringement on rights it was the major
theme of the working class press which
was quite lively around this area
run buddy you know women from the farms
partisans and so on their position was
look if you have a democracy the people
who work in the mills have to own and
you have to move towards real
participation and direct control and so
on and that remain major themes of
perfectly mainstream us thinking right
up until the corporatization of America
that hundred years ago when corporations
developed collectivist legal
institutions as they were called which
got enormous rights you know the rights
of persons but in fact well beyond
persons because they're immortal and the
huge comparison with persons that was
sharply attacked by conservatives a
breed that doesn't exist anymore but it
exists the century ago people who really
believed in classical liberal doctrines
they recognized that corporations with
themselves a major attack on markets and
that also an attack on the natural
rights doctrines on which you know
conceptions of human rights and Liberty
were developed that was a big change and
it's again not graven and stone these
were decision
