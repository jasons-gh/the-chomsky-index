also on your wall here I've never asked
you about Bertrand Russell this kind of
what's to say British Einstein genius
twentieth-century genius and mathematics
also unbelievably active militant
against war all his life he stayed in
William James's house in Cambridge in
1896 when he was 20 years old and he was
out in Trafalgar Square in 1962 saying
why does Jack Kennedy want to blow up
the world what's your connection well
first of all I've been very much
interested in his philosophical and
logical work but the other is exactly
what you're describing his dedication to
serious causes in World War one he was
in jail protesting the war he was pretty
much excluded from polite British
society and as a result and then again
as you say he was demonstrating in his
late seventies early eighties in
Trafalgar Square and about the Vietnam
War a nuclear war in fact he was asked
in I think late 50s he was asked once
why are you wasting your time with CND
demonstrations when you could be working
on logic and philosophy and doing
something of lasting significance and
his answer wasn't bad he said if I'm not
out there demonstrating there won't be
any around to read the logic and
philosophy that's a pretty good response
