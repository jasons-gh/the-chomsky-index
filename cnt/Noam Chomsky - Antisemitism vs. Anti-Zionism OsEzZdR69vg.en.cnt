how would you respond to the charge
that anti-zionism is the new
anti-semitism
actually the locus classicos
the best formulation of this was by
an ambassador to the united nations abba
evan
israel's ambassador to the united
nations
in an article that he wrote
about 45 years ago which i urge you to
read
which appeared in an american jewish
journal
congressweekly a major journal of the
more
liberal wing of the american jewish
community
he wrote an interesting article in which
he just he was then
u.n ambassador from the state of israel
he advised the
american jewish community that they had
two tasks to perform one task
was to show that criticism of the policy
what he called anti-zionism that means
actually criticisms
of the policy of the state of israel
were anti-semitism
that's the first task second task
if the criticism was made by jews their
task was to show that it's
neurotic self-hatred needs psychiatric
treatment
and he gave two examples of the latter
latter category
one was i have stone the other was me
so we have to be treated for our
psychiatric disorders
and non-jews have to be condemned for
anti-semitism
if they're critical of the state of
israel it's understandable why
israeli propaganda would take this
position i don't particularly blame
abba evan for doing what
ambassadors are sometimes supposed to do
but we ought to understand it
there is no sensible charge no sensible
charge there's nothing to respond to
it's not a form of anti-semitism it's
simply criticism of the criminal actions
of a state
period
