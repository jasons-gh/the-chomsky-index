uh one of the most important points that
stan makes in his book is that there is
if we hope to have if we want to have
any hope
of surviving global warming
and of course avoiding nuclear war
there's going to have to be a major
change in consciousness
that people are going to have to think
differently about what it means to have
a
decent uh fulfilling
life very sharp change is it going to be
piling up as many commodities as you can
in the back room or is it going to be a
world
of mutual support mutual aid
living comfortably but without
you know the overwhelming uh
pressures to accumulate more which will
it be
but you can't move to change of
consciousness
until you pass a first barrier
that is recognition that there's a
problem
i have to do that first now
we may not like it but we happen to be
living
in a country that's one of it's an
outlier
a large part of the population doesn't
see a problem
a large part of the prop population is
attuned to a malignant
duo in the white house
and the murdoch press now what they hear
echoing each other is there's no problem
don't worry about it it's all a liberal
hoax
let's just go ahead and doing what we're
doing and let's
they're trying to undermine the savior
who we adore
but they forget about uh if there's a
very clear lesson here
this goes on for four more years the
possibilities of change of consciousness
or of dealing with the growing crisis
are very
seriously impaired so
unless we can overcome this
malignancy we can but it's not
certain uh the chances of doing the
kinds of things that
stan is recommending are going to be
very sharply reduced
may be made impossible
stan if you could lay out
for us um exactly
what you think needs to happen as
the government and congress votes on
trillions of dollars being spent
where do you think um the
recovery needs to be what would be your
ideal
of what would happen that you could
never even have predicted as you were
writing this book
how do we turn this around let's begin
with stan and then back to noam
well i agree with a lot of the
the folks involved with the the green
new deal
that these trillions of dollars
of spending if they are spent on
the old ways of doing things old
infrastructure etc
uh it'll create a lot of jobs but we
will have actually added to the the
climate emergency rather
they're they're saying with good reason
that we should
put that money to create new jobs put it
into
building um more renewable energy and
green
infrastructure and that's the
um the green part of the uh green new
deal then
there's the new deal part of the green
new deal
with the the economic and justice
provisions
all of that is some um
there's really very little to disagree
with in that part
the uh green part of the green new deal
building up
um uh renewable energy
green infrastructure that is incomplete
because simply building more solar and
wind capacity
is not by itself going to drive fossil
fuels
out of the economy new sources of energy
tend to very much add
to the total energy supply without
displacing older forms of energy
what we're going to need is a direct
mechanism a statutory cap
on the total number of barrels of oil
cubic feet of natural gas and tons of
cold
that can come out of the ground and into
the economy
in uh in a given year and it
this is not cap and trade you might
rather
call it cap and squeeze because that
limit on the amount of fossil fuel
coming in
will have to be lowered rapidly year by
year
as much as five to ten percent of our
current
consumption uh taken out of
of the supply every year to
get um get the quantity of fossil fuels
down to zero
on which whichever deadline you want to
pick for
ipcc or the united nations emissions gap
report
but it's going to be in that range five
to ten percent every year
um now um if we do that and it's
successful and it's an
impervious cap the
um buildup of solar and wind and
other renewable energy green
infrastructure
will not be able to increase as
the amount of energy available
as fast as the fossil fuel needs to be
taken
offline so we're going to need to
be planning for um living
with diminishing quantity of energy
um during this transition and and uh
probably beyond
that um that sounds um horrible
but um you look we
we use about um uh
twice as much energy per person as
most countries in europe about seven
times as much per person
as the uh per capita consumption
in the continent of south america we
we can live on much less energy and
um have a um even better life
um i just wanted to apologize to our
audience i'm having a little trouble uh
hearing our guests but we're doing the
best that we can
um i wanted to ask noam chomsky
how the climate crisis compounded with
covet
compares to previous challenges
and if you can expand on if you see
any opportunities now in how to change
the world and what direction
um we would go in when i last saw you in
boston a few months ago
as we were so well it was a year ago as
we're selling or celebrating your 90th
birthday at a big event where people
will welcome you
you back to your hometown after you had
been away for years
you were talking about the new deal and
what it meant but if you could go back
in time
and share that analysis
the threat of environmental catastrophe
along with the threat of nuclear war are
new
in human history there have never been
such threats
uh we are facing the threat of
virtual extinction uh the uh
elimination of organized human society
in any form remotely like what we've
known
so for example the
nuclear war it's kind of obvious if
there's a nuclear war we're basically
finished
okay it's no escape uh some people will
live
but it won't be worth living the uh
if uh with environmental catastrophe we
have to face the fact that we are
approaching
a period of
global heat which is not
which is rather similar to about 125 000
years ago
though we're approaching it much faster
now that happened then
there could be a non-linear
escalation which gets out of sight but
we're approaching it
and at that time the sea level was about
roughly 25 feet higher than it is today
so try to imagine a world like that
uh it's unimaginable we're approaching a
world
in which if things continue on their
present course
latest scientific analysis suggests a
large part of the world will simply be
inhabitable in
50 years or so south asia a lot of the
middle east
much of africa what happens to all the
people there
i mean these things are almost
unimaginable
it has to be terminated quickly quickly
or we're basically finished as far as
organized human society is concerned
uh this is totally unlike any challenge
that has existed in human history i mean
you asked about my childhood 1930s
it was then a very grim period
the threat of fascism nazism
was spreading over europe seemed
inexorable it seemed like there's no way
out
uh turns out now we didn't know it then
that the us
government was also anticipating
that the coming war would end
with the germans in control of eurasia
all of it and the u.s controlling the
rest of the world
couldn't know that as a child in fact it
wasn't public but
you could see that it was pretty awful
this is much worse uh
the nazis controlling the world is an
indescribable horror
but organized society disappearing
is much worse uh we should recognize
that
this current generation has to face
challenges of a kind that never faced
before
not to turn to the new deal it's worth
remembering what happened it does
carry lessons for the kinds of things
that stan was talking about just now
and in his book in the 1920s
uh the u.s labor movement was destroyed
it had been cri it was a very vibrant
lively militant movement that had been
destroyed by
state corporate force often direct
violence
final blow was woodrow wilson's ridge
gear
it was a gilded age geared to
consumption for the very rich massive
corruption
not unlike today in many ways
1929 the depression hit
it was pretty awful we may be returning
to something like that
but then but it was much worse than
anything that exists today
much worse except in some areas like the
dust bowl
the agricultural system was collapsing
because of
the kinds of policies that stan
is deploring just do everything you can
to make money
if we wipe out the midwest agriculture
somebody else's problem
well it was everybody's problem and
turned down
the dust storms from the devastated
areas were reaching the east coast
it looked my family was first generation
immigrant
mostly working class mostly unemployed
in those days
by the mid-30s around 1934
things began to change as the labor
movement
reconstituted uh the cio was being
organized
there were militant labor actions taking
place
uh some of them got to the level of
sit-down strikes
a sit-down strike is a very serious
threat
to the ownership class it's saying
look we don't need you we can get rid of
you we'll run these factors by ourselves
which is probably correct they could
probably do it better but that
threat is serious uh there was a fairly
sympathetic administration
there were not just labor but political
parties were organizing and so on
there was a reaction of the new deal
it was very significant didn't change
its
basic structure of the society but it
developed
programs which engaged people to deal
with the problems at hand it offered
hope
so just to be concrete for to take one
example
several of my aunts were seamstresses
unemployed seamstresses but they had a
life
the life was in ill group the labor
union
for one it was not just labor organizing
it was mutual support it was meanings it
was
educational programs thinking what we
can do
at concerts uh weaken the country you
know
a whole life here's we can construct a
life for ourselves
based on the union movement and
this was true and in fact the general
feeling at the time
not the kind of parts of the country
that john steinbeck was talking about
but new york and the eastern
manufacturing areas there was a sense of
hopefulness
we can get together we can get out of
this somehow
it's quite different from now now
there's a
fear and disillusionment hatred of
institutions of distrust
distrusted one another
but it can be overcome it took about
five years to overcome it
in the depression period and we can't
wait that long
the pro the problems are too dire but it
showed that it could
be done so can the and i think we see
signs of those forces developing so the
activist movements that were kind of
brought together
under the umbrella of the sanders
movement which also
inspired others has had a big impact
the sanders campaign was an enormous
success
unprecedented success it's shifted the
entire arena of discussion policy making
uh well to the left the things that were
unthinkable like the green new deal a
couple of years ago i know
center of even the legislative program
certainly discussion
that's an enormous change and it
happened through
direct popular activism lots of it but
at the peak was
what the sunrise movement accomplished
just by sitting in
congressional offices and making it
impossible to ignore
uh support from young
legislators alexandria ocasio-cortez
others who
came in on the sounders wave move things
can be done again but it has to be done
and quickly
if we face another year
another four years of this malignancy
in the white house it's not going to
happen
that's got to we've got to get rid of
that
then prospects open up and there are
many things that can be done it's even
happening on the international scale
it's worth not getting any attention
here but in europe it is it's quite
important
uh there's a new progressive
international which you know about
which was just it's its opening
announcement was
about a week ago its first major event
will be in
september in iceland uh
international meeting iceland because
the prime minister of iceland is one of
the
founders of this movement it includes
the
since initiated by the sanders campaign
here
by the dm 25
janoswara focuses organization
across europe bringing in people from
asia
africa and so on dedicated to trying to
come
out of this crisis with the kind of
world that
stan was describing a world which is not
geared to profit for a few
and meaningless objects
traffic jams and so on undermining our
lives here
but to a decent productive uh satisfying
life at a level that's sustainable
with overcoming the gross
incredible inequalities and repression
which
were always there but were intensified
under
the 40 years of the neo-liberal plague
that's what it's committed to
uh unfortunately it's barely known in
the united states
that you don't find articles about it in
the new york times
not surprisingly but it's there that we
can make it real
uh but we have to it's going to take
plenty of work engagement uh stan
in his book estimates that i think it's
about a third of the population
will have to have a significant
reduction
in consumption levels something like
that
that's not going to be easy to
accomplish that third of the population
are not people living in slums they're
in the power centers
they wield the power in the country
and to tell them you're going to have to
face reality that's not going to
continue
that's like it's like telling people in
the 19th
telling the rich and powerful in the
1930s
you're going to have to accept unions
you're going to have to accept social
security
you're going to have to accept worker
activism decent wages and
safety conditions this is the same
escalated they were compelled to do it
because the only alternative they had
was losing everything
the workers would just take over the
factories they're done
it's a very fragile system of control
it's based on consent if you if the
consent breaks
it collapses and there are many options
so i think that's
the kind of struggle we're facing today
actually on an international scale
uh escalated in character because the
what's at stake is so much greater but
sort of the same in its general nature
now we have to be prepared for that it's
going to be a major struggle
stan cox in your book um the green new
deal and beyond
you have a chapter called off ramp
ahead and i'm wondering if you can talk
about
just that off ramp from the fossil fuel
economy uh putting the u.s
on an energy diet what that means
in light of what's happening today
and what the paths are you see
whether or not president trump remains
in office or whether there is a
democratic administration
well we've seen in in the news just
today
that um the rate of uh
world um uh carbon dioxide emissions
has dropped by 17 which is
uh pretty astounding of course
many many people have um paid the price
and
and and suffering and misery uh for that
to happen
we we have to do it i mean
we have to first of all resolve not to
um restore the kind of economy that
would
um start the upward march of emissions
again
but rather uh to have a much
more orderly humane
[Music]
reduction in in greenhouse emissions and
in general
ecological damage but so
when and and and uh gnome is right that
um we it's got to be different people
in in washington come january
and uh we'll just say when that happens
um then once we if
as i was saying we we have a cap on
gas oil and coal and it's and it starts
going down and we
are living on this leaner energy diet
um that's going to require a number a
number of things
we'll need a mechanism to steer energy
and resources
away from wasteful and luxury production
and toward
producing essential goods and services
now if that you know that may sound
downright unamerican
but america did just that during world
war
ii um often world war ii has used an
example for the climate movement because
of the big
increase in productive forces and so
forth
for the war effort and with an analogy
to
build up of a green economy but
i think the more important lesson
is that when faced with sudden
scarcity in that time it was
because of the war this time it would be
involuntary with regard to energy
that the so the economy in society was
almost totally transformed
you you had the war production board
who were very much micromanaging
production and and so forth
and then because people
this will probably be necessary again to
make sure that all
households have fair share of access
to uh energy and other resources will
probably require price controls and
and rationing and um all you know we've
done all this stuff before and there are
current
current uh strategies that have been
worked out in in the present day to do
it again
uh probably the the most comprehensive
and detailed
is uh the the climatemobilization.org
who have a very extensive um
plan for um dealing with
a um a future in which we're
cutting back on the throughput of
sources resources through society
and how to uh make that humane and
uh just and um and
um and then in addition to that
um we have the green new deals
um uh the parts of the green new deal
that are dealing with uh guarantee of
jobs or
or incomes or or workplace
democracy um human rights and i would
add
um a universal basic services right
rather than just
medicare for all all in essential
services are guaranteed
to everyone so um we're going to
need all of that um and
as i said um maybe the nation is now
at least the the part of the nation that
will um the vast majority of people who
would benefit from that
um or be ready to accept it
the um but it will recover the 33
percent
you're right um there um it it
that's going to be a tougher sell and
and they
hold the power but we've seen with the
um with the uh blossoming of the
uh climate movement over the past couple
of years that
uh and i think um anything will be
possible
um we're going to go to questions from
people who
are listening and watching all over the
world
um there are now 1500 people on
crowdcast and on democracy now
thousands more but i do want to ask
gnome
just a larger question about president
trump how you would
assess him right now as
people watch the leader of this country
we are not far
here in new york city from times square
where
um eugene recce has erected the
trump death clock not to be con
confused with the debt clock but
what president trump has done in
the midst of this catastrophe
well actually as you know there
is a famous clock the doomsday clock
set every january by
leading groups of scientists political
analysts
assess the state of the world and place
the minute
and a certain distance from midnight
midnight is nice to know you goodbye
uh it started in 1947
right after the bomb oscillated over the
years
but when trump was nominated was uh as
soon as he was
elected the minute hand went
very close to midnight almost as close
as it's ever been
after had been a year in office it went
as close as it's ever been to midnight
this year it went beyond where it's ever
been
in fact the analysts abandoned minutes
and moved to seconds 100 seconds to
midnight
now that's one assessment of the trump
administration
you can get another assessment anytime
you open the newspapers
let's take this morning let's imagine
that we had an independent press which
was describing things the way they are
okay what the headlines would say is
trump decided in order to improve
his electoral prospects to kill
uncountable numbers of people in africa
yemen and latin america that was the
news that came
on twitter last night well it wasn't
reported
quite like that but that was the essence
that was the content of what was
reported
what it said was he's going to get rid
of the world health organization
unless it does some ludicrous things
which have nothing to do with reality
and what happens if you get rid of the
world health organization
i mean there are huge numbers of people
in
africa and yemen the worst humanitarian
crisis in the world
other poor countries who depend on world
health organization
services for survival all sorts of
diseases
who is saving coronavirus is going to
hit them
much worse than if it's the developed
world
far worse so trump is saying on his
twitter account
let's slaughter them because maybe it'll
improve my electoral prospects
that's what the headlines otto have been
saying you can
take a look at what they actually said
it's essentially that
content this is every day
happen to be talking about this morning
what can we expect from
we have a malevolence that has taken
over the administration
of a kind that the world has never seen
i'm living
people doing hideous things but no one
committed dedicated with passion
to the destruction of human society and
that's what it means
to say let's race on with more fossil
fuels
let's open up new territories for
expansion
uh let's maximize the use of coal let's
eliminate the regulations that are
providing some constraint on this
let's do anything that matters in order
to get me
elected and powerful that's
the reality of what we're facing and the
world sees it
it's very clear but they can't do
anything about it
because the power is here uh
people talk about american decline but
they're not looking at the facts
the united states may be disliked even
hated
but it's feared especially in the hands
of someone like trump
uh so take say iran
trump decided that for his own
personal gain he would eliminate the
agreement with iran to that was working
very effectively in american
intelligence agrees
to limit any potential threat of running
nuclear weapons
so let's tear it up and let's impose
harsh sanctions to make the people
not the regime to make the people suffer
as much as possible
because somehow of course it doesn't
bother us we torture people that's fine
but maybe they'll exceed their demands
europe dislikes it
hates it they go along with it they
can't help it
otherwise they get tossed out of the
international financial system
now of course europe could take another
path but
they're not ready for it and nor is the
rest of the world
that's the reality that we face that
places an
enormous burden on americans
we are the source of this malignancy
of course it gives an opportunity to
means we can change the world
in a way that nobody else can that's a
tremendous gift but you have to take it
if you let it go to waste we're done for
it
i wanted to bring in some questions from
the audience
myra craig asks how can we seize
this moment a moment in time due to
covid19 when our skies are cleaner and
traffic is bearable we need to keep the
skies cleaner like this from now on what
can i do
as a citizen activist stan myra
asks
we can it's funny when i um
submitted the the manuscript of this
book the pandemic was just about to
start and in there
i was talking about um a lot of things
that
uh people can do including um
joining the these uh movements like
extinction rebellion and and sunrise and
um and one of the things i i was
talking about is kind of a consumption
strike and saying um it's hard to
imagine but just imagine what the
power would be of an almost complete
strike against any air travel
or driving the private cars and little
little did i know that not enough as i
wrote it i thought oh yeah right like
that'll happen
and and now it has happened so i think
myra is right
that um we need to look for
things that have happened now and and to
build on those
let me ask you another question uh
ulrich
eckel says the green new deal
um is firmly based on the traditional
capitalist growth model
if so what is green about it
let's put that question to noam chomsky
well actually it's not based on the
capitalist growth model
it's trying to undermine the capitalist
growth model
uh will it go as far
got some dissenting voices here uh
the basic idea is to uh undermine
the capitalist growth mile the model
that says
keep producing more increase gdp because
that increases profit
uh side effect of it is people
have to join by consuming more
remember we have bear in mind that
we're supposed to be a market economy
that's what you learn in school
but we have a huge industry in the
united states
enormous industry that is dedicated to
undermining markets
that's its main goal it's called the
advertising industry
markets are supposed to be based on
informed consumers
making rational choices this
industry is dedicated to turning you
into an uninformed consumer making
irrational choices
uh just go out and buy things that you
don't need and you don't want because
somehow you have to have it
but don't do the things you ought to do
the
questioner said we don't have any
traffic jams right
do we have to have traffic jams um is it
necessary to sit for
hours and a day uh you know fuming
because you're in a
gym now it's not you can have another
model
and we even came close to it and you
won't see it if you're looking at
television and looking at the ads
there you say no you've got to buy a
fancier car and so on
they don't say devote yourself to making
a rational
mass transportation system you're not
going to see an ad about that
that's not what the industry is for the
industry is making you
irrational and uninformed okay
you don't have to succumb to that so
this is an attack
on the capitalist growth model based on
undermining markets uh changing
people to be subordinate to
concentrated private power and their
need for profit
let's put aside all this nonsense about
markets
uh under my we got close to that
very close if there had been popular
consciousness and activism in 2008 and
nine
we could have achieved it uh
obama virtually nationalized the
automobile industry
it was collapsing so the government took
it over
there were choices one choice was
uh give it back to the former owners
maybe different faces
and have it continue to produce massive
cars
and have traffic jams of course that was
the choice that was taken
there was another choice now that the
government's taken over the industry
fine let's turn it over to the workforce
communities
have them deliberate on what kind of a
world you want to live in
do you want to live in a world with
traffic jams or
fossil fuels that are going to destroy
the next generation
or do you want to live in a world with
comfortable effective
mass transportation the same industries
could have gone that way well they
didn't
because of the lack of popular movements
forcing them to
but there's a corollary to that means if
the popular movements exist
they can go in that direction okay so
we're at a
turning point it's possible it's within
reach
as i say in 2008 it was almost in her
hands
and now popular movements have grown
they can do a lot more
not only can but must because
decent human survival depends on that
yes stan if you can elaborate and this
and i think this joins together with
another question from virginia hammond
and we're going to begin wrapping up
this discussion right now
but virginia writes our money system
gives the power and privilege to create
our money supply to the private bankers
who created his debt
the system demands exponential uh
growth um she writes exploitation and
transfers wealth from the many to the
few without changing the money system
how do we counter this demand for
continuous economic growth and its
degradation
of the planet
okay okay first the the um
the question that the
um first the question about
um the the green new deal and and
uh and growth it as it's being discussed
we don't know what final form it'll take
but it the
green new deal does it look like a
massive
stimulus plan and so
great care is going to have to be taken
to make sure
that that that kind of stimulus
will almost always uh create
more greenhouse emissions more resource
use more pollution etc um
so the um the
green you deal that that's why it also
has to have this
um reduction very very
steady quick reduction in the uh the use
of fossil fuels so that um
that that the stimulus will then
then go
on and not toward simply growth for uh
growth in whatever industries are
profitable
uh and and make the most money for the
the folks at the top and
um and as for um the the
money the financial system is
definitely is is a mess virginia there
and we've um
we've seen even just during the the
pandemic here
the um instead of just
um saying okay until we get through this
everybody gets a certain amount
of money every month to um
for subsistence we see all this
complicated thing of
going through the banks and and um these
business owners who have to be within a
certain size range
and they have to already have a
relationship with banks and
it's um it's a big mess and we
um uh send them
um a lot more money than uh than other
folks get and
but other folks get well uh you know
this last check
you know one month's rent and groceries
would uh
often uh eat that up um
i didn't discuss in the uh
in the book i didn't discuss modern
monetary theory
primarily because i i had limited time
to write um i didn't have time to
study it thoroughly and uh it's such a
contentious issue i knew whichever uh
whatever i said about it one side or the
other probably both
would dismiss the rest of what i said in
the book because
it didn't like what i said about it so
um but
i i think that we do and it's
really become clear now during the the
pandemic
that congress does just need to
appropriate money into existence to
make sure that people have enough while
they're
taxing it away from those who have too
much
that's kind of an emergency measure but
when we need
more um it needs to evolve further
as uh as we get out of this eventually
um finally this is a question from ian
brosetnum
he says i'm a sunrise movement organizer
at my local university things seem like
they're hopeless with regards to getting
things
passed in this country we've been
organizing spreading awareness but the
primary electorate chose biden anyway
i feel like i can't vote for either
general election candidate right now
you've called for biden as a lesser evil
but how can we young people really
support him
and we're going to end with that
question and i also want to let people
know that
we have an interview with you with
younom that we're running on memorial
day so i encourage everyone to go to
democracynow.org
but for this young organizer what do you
say
what do i say well first thing i would
say is you've had a tremendous success
uh these topics weren't even discussed a
couple of years ago
now they're on the agenda in fact
one success you've had is pressing the
democratic party
well to the left if you read biden's
program the dnc
program it's probably the most
progressive program since roseville
not because they decided they had a
conversion and decided yeah we want to
be leftists
it's because of the constant pressure of
groups
like sunrise many others that have been
pounding at the doors
and that forced them in that direction
exactly the way
in the 1930s a major industry
had to accept some degree of workers
rights
unions uh conservation corps which would
rebuild what was destroyed all kinds of
things they hated
but they had to accept them that's
happened that's
a tremendous success and it can continue
it can continue if there's a mildly
responsive
administration otherwise you're finished
if trump is in office there's rock solid
opposition furthermore a
race to catastrophe which may even pass
tipping points finally staffing
the entire judiciary from bottom to top
with ultra-right young lawyers
which will make it impossible for at
least a generation
to do anything anything no matter what
the people want no matter what you want
they'll block it at the judicial level
okay
so you have a choice right now you don't
have a choice of abstaining
that's not a choice if you abstain
because i didn't get everything i wanted
then
you're saying i'm taking a vote away
from the opposition to trump which
amounts to the same as adding a vote to
trump
so your choices are do i
add a vote for trump and ensure that the
worst will happen
and that all my goals will be destroyed
or do i hold my nose
take 15 minutes push a lever
and then go back to work that's what
should
those are the choices there aren't any
others
it's always been the case i mean
somebody could have said it
and some did in 1932
i'm not going to vote for this
capitalist pig roosevelt
i don't i don't care who it is they're
all just a bunch of capitalist pigs
so if it's hoover okay who cares
mattered a lot
in fact the same question arose at the
same time i'm
old enough to remember it in germany uh
stalin had uh ordered the communist
parties
to condemn everyone else's what were
called social fascists
they're all the same yeah the heck with
it
so i'm not going to join with the social
fascists to
build a unified labor movement which
would confront hitler
who cares they're all the same and
after them will come well we saw what
happened
i should say just in my lifetime this
happened again in 1968
i forget your age but you probably
remember that uh the
uh 68 there was a choice between
humphrey and nixon
two capitalist pigs i'm not going to
vote so you get nixon
and a couple of million corpses and into
china
well that's the cost i feel good
so a couple million corpses in china
well
okay it's a way of looking at the world
not a way i recommend and now the stakes
are much
higher the stakes are literally
survival you have another four years of
rock solid opposition race to
catastrophe
stuffing the judiciary so that nothing
will ever happen
we're in very bad shape on the other
hand if you
take what's called the lesser evil you
have
an administration which could be
responsive it's already been
responsively seen
you go back to work you can push it
further you can achieve the kinds of
things that stan's talking about
those are basically the choices
um i know i said that was the last
question but anna insists on her
question being asked
and that is can we see your dogs known
i think they ran outside because
somebody came to the door and they have
to scream at them
but maybe i could get the parrot to say
a sovereignty to all the people in
portuguese
he sometimes does it
well i want to thank you both for being
with us known world-renowned dissident
linguist author of over a hundred books
it's great to be talking with you again
and i want to congratulate stan
cox on his new book the green new deal
and beyond ending the cliven climate
emergency
while we still can and i also want to
thank city lights bookstore and
publishers founded by
lawrence ferlingetti who at 101 years
old
is still fighting for progressive social
change
through promoting important books like
stan's
so folks can get the book the green new
deal and beyond
uh it's great being with both of you and
again tune in
um every day to democracy now
democracynow.org but on monday on
memorial day
we spend the hour with our guest today
noam chomsky thanks all of you for being
with us uh
and to everyone be safe
thank you thank you
