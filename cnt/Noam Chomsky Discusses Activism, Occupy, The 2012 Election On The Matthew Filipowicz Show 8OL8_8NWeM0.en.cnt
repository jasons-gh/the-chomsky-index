all right right now here on the Matthew
Philip Ovid show we are coming to you
from the MIT office of professor Noam
Chomsky professor Chomsky is of course a
famed linguist a author and advocate a
political activist professor Chomsky
thank you so much for taking the time to
talk to me today glad to be with you so
we are about six weeks away from the
2012 presidential election I guess my
first question is do you personally see
any value in activists in progressives
focusing on national to party politics
and politicians I think they should
spend five or ten minutes on it seeing
if there's a point in taking part and
they carefully orchestrated electoral
extravaganza and my own judgment for
what it's worth is yes there's a point
to taken apart there's there's taking
part there's a between the two choices
that are presented there's I think some
significant differences and like if I
was personally was in a swing state I
vote against romney ryan which means
voting for Obama because no other choice
if I'm I happened to be in a non swing
state so i can either not both or but as
i probably will for Jill Stein green
candidate than the hopes that it might
be at the beginning of some genuine
electoral alternative over time but the
main concern but it really should be 10
minutes it's just a matter of deciding
should I spend this little amount of
time doing something which is not
insignificant but is of great importance
either the main point is to try to keep
working to change the society the
consciousness the culture so that we're
not stuck with two options both well to
the right of actually even where most of
the population is on most issues but
certainly where they ought to be
so if you if someone has spend rightly
you know 10 minutes just to make sure
that that the the worst of two options
doesn't make it especially again
engineer in a swing state what do you
feel what do you advise people to do how
do you advise people activists to spend
their time and an end resources I should
position spend their time on resources
on education on organization on the
choice of actions that are appropriate
to the circumstances there's no formula
for this so for example a year ago if
I'd been asked let's say in August 2011
would it make any sense to have a sit-in
in Zuccotti Park I would have said it's
totally crazy don't bother with it one
of the many cases where my tactical
judgment was shown to be very much off
base turned out to be spectacular
achievement tactics necessarily have a
kind of half-life you can't build a
movement on tactics they're valuable in
fact crucial and this one was remarkably
effective for something that by its
nature could only last for a couple of
months but then you have to go and find
other tactics that will carry forward
and that's what I think activists ought
to be doing the electoral season in the
United States not quadrennial
extravaganza typically tends to draw
energy away from activism because people
are caught up in the hoopla and
excitement and so on so there's
generally a kind of decline in activism
even in funding for activist
organizations but i'll be over and then
we have to get back to business and you
should be doing it right through as much
as possible so for example today there
isn't in the things that can be
exploited about the prop you know this
kind of spectacle if people are focusing
on some things and they can one
thing that can be brought out in
discussion and meetings and
demonstrations and so on is the huge gap
between public opinion and public policy
and also the what is meant by the very
easily demonstrable fact that most
people are so disillusioned with the
political system that they do regard it
is mostly a force okay what can we first
of all why is that the case and what can
we do about it these are things that can
come to the fore in the glare of you
know advertising industry propaganda I
think most people who listen to this
show understand why it is why that why
that case actually is then what do you
do about it I guess is though is that
it's the giant question I suppose
there's no single answer to what you do
about it so let's go back say 50 years
and take a look a little bit of modern
history the civil rights movement had
been was a struggle that you know went
back to the 18th century in many ways
very much alive in the 1930s crushed
revived again and so on as an hour say
1960 what do you do about it well a
couple of kids in black college and at
greensboro north carolina decided well
what we do about is sit in a lunch
counter again if you'd ask me they
wouldn't act like i fortunately didn't
ask me but they sat in and they're there
of course arrested brutalized that could
have been the end of it instead other
black students came the next day and
continued pretty soon you had freedom
buses Freedom Riders registration
campaigns Freedom Summer a lot of weight
young with the young people not hardly
going down after a while you had a major
mass movement which had partial success
by if you listen to the speeches and
Martin Luther King Day typically they
end in 1963
when King gave his famous I have a dream
speech well King didn't stop his life at
that point he went on to things that he
regarded is more important than even
getting voting rights in the south which
was important and he gave another I have
a dream speech which is rarely mentioned
it was in 1968 another day he was
assassinated it was too he was there in
Memphis to support strike of sanitation
workers public service service workers
he was on his way to Washington's gonna
lead a march to Washington which would
be a step in organizing a political
movement of the poor there's been any he
was dealing with class issues and he was
killed the March went on anyway his wife
Coretta King let it went through the
places in the south where they'd had the
major confrontation Selma and so on and
that up in Washington they set up tent
city resurrection city they lasted a
while but pretty soon Congress the most
liberal Congress in American history
sent in the police I think it's the
middle of the night drove them out of
City smashed up the tent city and drove
them out and that all that all that
barely gets discussed and the reason is
it was safer northern liberals it's easy
to denounce racist sheriffs in Alabama
yeah what makes us feel good you know
but when it gets to things that are
close to home like racism in the north
which is pretty extreme or fundamental
class issues or in King's case even
criticism boo Vietnam War which contrary
to mythology was supported by northern
liberals the that point things kind of
cut off so was the civil rights movement
of success well you know by the
standards of someone like with his name
address or canon of York Times a couple
days ago the civil rights musical
failure
that didn't break down the class
structure you know didn't carry out a
revolution as those a waste of time but
it's not the way social movements are
they can win partial successes there are
always also defeats the defeats teach
you something they should and you go on
from there to the next peak I mean
activism is kind of like sometimes been
compared with mountain climbing if
you're climbing a mountain if you ever
tried it you know that you see a peak
can you figure okay that's it and you
get to the peak and you discover that's
not it there's another peak much higher
right up there and then you got to go
for that one and that's what it's like
at a lot of the times you're kind of
knocked down from the peak okay you
learn from that and go on and but
there's no single answer going back to
your question in 1960 it turned out that
a good answer was sitting at a lunch
counter but nobody could say yeah that's
the right tactic you do the things you
can and some of them light a spark
others don't then you sort of go on from
there again I'm talking to professor
Noam Chomsky one of my things I mostly
focus on on my show is trying to bridge
the gap between activists and the
centre-left that should be theoretically
should be on the side you to the
centre-left what you consider Center
Democrats do you have any insight or
thoughts on how do activists reach that
specific population that that is
obviously a lot of them are in fear over
the the idea of and rightfully so the
fear of what a Romney presidency in a
Republican Congress would be but are
often way too dismissive when it comes
to the atrocities that that the Obama
administration has done that the
Democratic Congress is done how do you
bridge that specific gap and reach that
specific group of people do you have any
thoughts on that same way you try to
reach anyone else including the upper
right the Republicans
try to any activist has to begin with a
normal human sympathy of the people
you're talking to human beings there on
dell's they may not disagree they
disagree with you but maybe they're
right maybe the wrong but and you have
to approach them where they live not
somewhere else so there's no point
talking to the group you're talking
about here there's no point giving them
a speech in Swahili like you have to ask
what are they how do they perceive the
world and people perceive the world
their own ways and you have to try to
suggest that there other ways of
perceiving the world there's problems
out here that you will look at you ask
yourself whether the ways you're
perceiving the world are the proper ways
of dealing with these problems and then
courage people to think their way
through these issues that's activism and
there's no magic formula for it's
different in different places in
different times I mean sometimes the
best form of activism is something very
simple like suppose you go into a say a
downtown urban slum somewhere and you're
trying to organize people for think it's
very hard to organize from the outside
is the reason why you've I should pay
attention to you what's that guy coming
here would but if you can be accepted as
concerned with the community and part of
it and that's name step then that's what
you'll I saw a problem with the kind of
centre-left people you're talking about
because we are part of that community
basically recognizable part of it but
let's take that situation I mean people
typically feel powerless there's nothing
we can do you know the system is so
powerful and anytime we lift our fingers
we're going to be crushed so that's the
end of it well one important thing is to
try to show that there are simple little
things you can do but you can sit in a
lunch counter in a downtown slum in
Boston you can agitate to try to get a
traffic light where the kids across the
street to school and if you can succeed
in doing small things you
get empowered you say look it's not a
rock that can't be moved no there are
things we can do and if they're things
we can do you can move on to other
things and you just have to find your
way and that there are no magic formulas
it's a matter of sensitivity
understanding self-examination
self-criticism like maybe I'm wrong I
can learn from them too and I say it's
kind of like normal human relations what
would you know with the goal in mind
goal which could be modified in the
course of the work but if anybody's
looking for formulas nobody's presented
them cuz there aren't any there are some
ideas like you know Olinsky style
organizing or other proposals and
sometimes they were sometimes they're
right sometimes they are mostly
improvise earlier this year you wrote a
book on the Occupy movement we recently
just had the one year anniversary and
again I'm talking to professor Noam
Chomsky we just had the one year
anniversary of the Occupy movement I'm
curious on your thoughts of the movement
today considering that for the most part
their encampments have been have been
taken away and the police have come and
crack down on them what are your
thoughts on the movement as it stands
right now well those only said before
tactics have a diminishing returns you
can't keep up with them forever it just
becomes a nuisance and pointless so you
have to move on and the movement is in
to the extent that it's a movement um
it's a very broad very group
representing all sorts of parts of the
population and of course it's not just
here it's international I mean I've
given talks on occupy movements in
sydney australia and europe and so on it
spread like wildfire on the different
problems in different places and you
have to figure out ways to address them
the main problem is how do you engage
broader sectors of the population in
actions that will
advanced often quite common general
goals may be different specific ones but
general common ones like they're plenty
of like the kind of virtual criminality
of the financial system the shredding of
disappearance of the meaningful
functional democracy this scandalous
nature of the health system total
disaster point by point there are a lot
of things that can be done I try to you
know I'm that this enormous propaganda
attempting to get people to focus
attention on a minor problem namely the
deficit it's a problem but not major and
to avoid looking at the obviously major
problem namely joblessness and so I
think most people kind of understand
that public opinion polls show that
people regard jobs is the main problem
it's true that concern over the deficit
increase but I suspect that's a function
of propaganda because there isn't i'm a
lucky look at the media that's the only
problem with supposed to so i think you
can move out to break through that and
say look that's not the problem the
problems joblessness and the problem is
very concrete let me just young to be a
genius to look around the society and
say look something's going wrong I'm as
a huge mass of people who want to work
there's an enormous amount of work that
has to be done there are plenty of
resources it's the richest country in
the world and for some reason those
things can't be put together well that
tells you there's something deeply
pathological about the general
socio-economic system well okay what's
pathological about it that's what I
think ought to be people are the asked
to confront that includes the
centre-left educated segments you're
talking about are there other activist
groups that you find personally
inspiring that you see that are doing
consist
good work today are there other ones I
mean you know the Occupy movement is
evolving obviously with with the
realities that they're facing but are
there other activist groups that you see
right now that you think this is
something that other groups could
perhaps be inspired by and learn from
Watson I think if you counted noses
there's more activism today than there
was at the peak of the 1960's last
couple years of the 1960s by now there's
activist movements on all sorts of
topics as some of them really critical
significance like the environmental
movement so for example a few take you
read the New York Times the last couple
days front page articles saying
discovering that the Arctic ice has
receded much more rapidly than even the
most grim forecasts of computer
scientific computer modeling and the
same article say that the government and
corporations are reacting by trying to
make the problem worse that's not what
they say but what they say is they're
reacting by looking at the exciting
prospects of the drilling in the Arctic
so you can get more fossil fuels and
therefore make the Artic ice receding
faster so instead of having a disaster
in 50 years maybe we can habitant why
you have friends that's all together in
the same articles well you know that
there are movements working on that
that's a matter of survival yeah it's
another hour for good movements working
on it there now we happen to be very
atomized in this country so there's no
no there's no core activist movement
part of the reason for that is the
success the great right-wing success in
undermining the labor movement um the
labor movement historically was always
in the center of any major successful
activists move not the whole labor
movement least parts of it and you know
there's been a huge business led
struggle since the 1940s to destroy the
labor movement which terrified them in
the 1930s it was just too
soon to activists and started right
after the war taft-hartley Act and it's
gone right on till today and it's been
pretty successful it's also been
successful ideologically so people have
been kind of induced to hate and the
public service workers who happen to
have Union granted pensions like why do
they have a pension that I don't that's
been very good propaganda I'm the reason
they have a pension and you don't is
because they had unions and you own and
they gave up wages they're getting being
underpaid relative to their skill levels
and the compensation was Willie got some
security so you don't attack them
because they won some security by giving
up wages you ask what's responsible for
your plight like you know thanks
employer CEOs don't let them divert you
to this but the diversion has been
pretty successful I so for example in
Wisconsin election I have some
substantial number of Union voters voted
for wallet you look back to 210 election
here in Massachusetts replacing
kennedy's seat probably majority of
Union voters voted for brown because
partly because they were so
disillusioned with the way the Obama
administration that smashed every gave
up on actually worse than gave up
destroyed every promises made to them
when they worked hard and plenty of
disillusionment but these is a you know
with with a loss substantial not total
with substantial loss of the labor
movement or what you find is very
fragmented activism but a lot of it is
pretty significant the environmental
movement is one case one case that's not
discussed as much as it should be in my
opinion is the kind of work that garl
pair of its has been spearheading
Washington you've probably had him on
but the movement in around Ohio mostly
but they're elsewhere to develop the
a community and worker on the
enterprise's that's very feasible and it
strikes right at the heart of the
socio-economic system but it's tolerated
by power it does fit within market
systems you know acceptable markets and
easy you've got conservative legislators
supporting it and so on that makes a lot
of sense I mean why should a couple of
bankers de sus in New York decide to
destroy a factory in Ohio and set it to
Bangladesh or somewhere why should they
have the right even to make the decision
none of their business just because they
happen to in stock it's the business of
the stakeholders the community and the
workforce and people can understand that
and there's a lot can be done and that
could be done on a large scale if people
were organized so take say the auto
industry a couple of years ago the
government virtually owned it still does
on a lot of it it had been effectively
nationalized there were a couple of
things that could have been done one is
what was done reconstruct it and give it
back to essentially the same owners and
managers maybe a couple of different
names but and go on with its what it had
been doing enough but there were other
possibilities could have been given over
to the workforce and the communities and
it could have been helped to develop
things that the country really needs
badly like high-speed rail they workers
have the skills no country has the need
plenty of resources to change things
enormously well in order to do that
you'd have to have what's going on
around Cleveland how much higher level
but that just means you can achieve it
with more work and more organizing and
that's an important activist movement
there's plenty of others prison you know
the American prison system is another
huge scandal prisoner rights movements
there's significant issues of that
immigration
in fact the plant foreign policy issues
we could be heading into a major war in
the Middle East which is completely
avoidable easy methods of avoiding it
press doesn't report them nobody
discusses them except in may be
professional arms control journals but
just to mention the obvious whatever
threat you think he ran poses mostly
hyped but whatever threat it is could be
mitigated mainly ended by a method that
is Hezbollah whelming international
support overwhelming moved to establish
a nuclear weapons free zone in the
region there's actually a conference
coming up in December which will deal
with this it's been on the international
agenda for almost 20 years the u.s. kind
of formally accepts it but in fact it
rejects all kind of conditions or
Obama's imposed organic in a bush just
said the hell with we're not looking at
it the Obama administration a little
more forthcoming this video we're
looking at it's a great idea but we
can't do it not now you know maybe
someday and Israel has to be excluded in
fact just two days ago Israel announced
but it's not participating in the
conference well because it doesn't want
to be it would be coerced into doing
that actually it's interesting that a
majority of the population and Israel's
in favor of it but Israel is not a
democratic society anywhere in we are
well yeah this is major news I don't
know about you I couldn't find it
anywhere but unless there's substantial
popular pressure to get the US to end
its rejectionists stand on this policy
of blocking it conference won't get
anywhere and we may march on or maybe by
then we'll have marched on to a major
war which would be extremely destructive
something that can be done in fact
everywhere you look is endless things
that can be done you got to do them and
that requires no no magic learning about
things breaking through the doctrinal
very
there's even the information barriers
which is not impossible and moving on to
education organizing whatever activism
is appropriate you just got to feel your
way again I'm talking to professor Noam
Chomsky we're almost out of time before
I let you go I guess my last question is
are there is there anything specific
that gives you hope as someone who has
devoted decades to activism is that do
as someone who has seen victories and
defeats you know and again it's it's
it's you know as many victories there's
as many defeats and more defeats in a
lot of ways is there stuff today that
still gives you hope as an activist
number of things for one thing the kind
of inspiring the exciting image of
people struggling under really harsh
conditions and comparably worse than
anything we face and going on
courageously honorably and not giving up
that just is inspiring and they're all
over here and in other countries another
thing is just if you look over the
long-term trajectory it's basically
positive over time the rights have been
expanded deepened intensified the new
issues come up which weren't even talked
about before many many victories of them
even in recent years one enough so you
hardly have to struggle about them so
like takes a women's rights probably the
major achievement of the 60s and post
sixties movement which really civilized
society I'm at that struggle goes back
to the 18th century and it did take off
made a big move forward in the 1960s
it's hasn't you know pointy oh wait ways
to go but a lot of victories change the
society a lot a lot of things you want
to fight about there because they're now
accepted Morgan's they take the
environmental movement it didn't exist
in the 1960s so there was no movement
began around Earth days we've been
picking up now it's substantial problems
or recognized in ways they weren't then
so a lot of success but I think the
basic reason is just very simple you
have two choices you can say look
everything's hopeless so I got to do
anything and help guarantee that the
worst will happen or you can say well
things are tough but they've been worse
before and if we get engaged maybe we
can carry things forward between those
two choices there's no real choice
professor Noam Chomsky uh thank you for
your your AG and decades of activism and
work it's been an honor to be able to
meet you and talk with you thank you so
much and thank you for being on the show
glad to be with you again
