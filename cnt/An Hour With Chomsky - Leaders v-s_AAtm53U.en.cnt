you
I suppose somebody has a good idea so
suppose we're trying to organise
something and you have a good idea okay
then for that and we just think yeah
that's a great idea okay for that moment
you're a leader
okay maybe tomorrow he has a good idea
so he'll be the leader if we designate
somebody to be the leader we're gonna
follow them no matter what they say then
we're droll if you want to look up to
people you should look up to say the
snake workers people are really doing
the work in the South they had hard
bitter experiences not just them but
plenty of black activists and others
some white people joined them and that's
what you should really look up to as
soon as you start worshipping leaders
you're in trouble
why because they're gonna take power and
institute systems of authority and
domination now what you're after is
freedom and independence leader should
be representatives of the community
temporarily given positions of a degree
of authority under popular control take
Martin Luther King who was a very
important figure but he was kind of
riding a wave of popular activism if it
hadn't been for snake workers in the
south and Freedom Riders and black
students sitting in at lunch counters
and mass public demonstrations there
would be no mark Luther they'd be a king
but no he'd be listening to him what he
did was recognized to be dangerous by
power systems if you take a look at the
history of how King is regarded and
treated it's very illuminating I mean on
Martin Luther King Day there's lots of
elaborate rhetoric which typically ends
in 1963 with you know I have a dream
because that's kind of tolerable to
systems of power and domination maybe if
you like it but they can accept it on
the other hand what about what he did
right after that
poor people's movement organizing and
going to work to support a sanitation
workers strike that's that's not their
effect he gave a another I have a dream
speech the night before he was
assassinated but that's not quoted
that's for celebrities I think I mean
this is a lot of glorification of
there's a kind of a celebrity culture
which is magnified by media and so on so
you supposed to I mean I just saw
somebody just sent me a copy a poll in
The Reader's Digest
of the most trusted people in America
number one is Tom Hanks was it arrested
for what because he you know he played
in a movie you know but that's a
celebrity culture actually I made that
list somewhere but it's our yeah he's
ahead if I can contribute something okay
but I'm by no means a celebrity and
wouldn't want to be unfortunately can't
be I don't have the characteristics
in general I'd like to see people think
for themselves and not to succumb to
irrational pressures on the other hand
you know I've seen it a various I've
seen it happen in ways that I certainly
respect so take again civil rights
demonstrations I mean I remember just to
pick one personal experience and there
have been many days in you know the deep
south Jackson Mississippi did happen to
be you know major civil rights
demonstration during the day a lot of
violet a lot of brutal police violence
people getting beaten bloody you know in
the evening going to a black church
where there was a yes singing hymns and
songs and nothing especially religious
about it for most of the people but it
built a sense of community and
solidarity and support on emotional
grounds which enabled people to go on
for tomorrow
I have criticisms if people are not
thinking for themselves but are being
swayed by emotional appeals that they
have not thought through themselves
properly just in the case I mentioned
the emotional appeal was there but
people also knew what they were doing
and had decided why they're going to do
it and there are a lot of other cases
like that I've seen them in so-called in
indigenous communities and working-class
communities all over the place
