one of the things that personally is an
example of that is you know I can watch
talks or watch documentaries and think
about things like global warming and all
these big issues confronting our times
and then sort of racket it to one side
of my mind and then continue moving on
because it's I think that's what stops a
lot of us from getting involved because
the implications would be that we would
have to drop everything if these things
really were as dire as but of course you
know even the most dedicated people have
to do that I was in India I know if
you've been there but I mean it's just a
traumatic experience there's a lot of
wealth a lot of vitality a lot of
excitement and miserable poverty which
you just can't miss it's all around you
one time a couple of years ago I
happened to be there and I was driving
in New Delhi to a demonstration where I
was going to give the talk and another
person was in the car with me a woman
who was also going to give a talk there
she's a woman who had had taught in the
university she was patti university
position but she left in order to go
live in a poor village in one of the
poorest areas registan where she lived
in a hut what we would call the
describable conditions of working mainly
on women's issues and I think she'd been
there about 17 years by then so a really
dedicated person throughout her life in
through I noticed as we were driving
through this when you drive through a
city as soon as the car stops there's a
horde of miserable people who come
asking for a you know rupee a penny you
know showing a gipsy woman with a
starving child you know every AR you can
think of and she told me right away
don't give anyone anything because once
you do you can
make any dent anyway and once you do it
just get her mom but as we drove I
noticed that she wasn't looking out the
window
and I'd asked her you know I asked her
well how do you live with all of this
and she said the only way you live is
not looking
you can't look and survive so you have
to somehow ward yourself off just in
order to keep going and this is a person
who had dedicated her life at a level
that you almost never see but she's
right now we all have to do it you can't
survive otherwise but it's easy to the
bracketing so it's necessary in some
sense but it's very easy to overdo it
like take a little warming but you
mentioned I mean that's a really dire
catastrophe a Canada right now is on the
verge of destroying civilization and
it's almost literally true if Canada
proceeds with tar sand development in
Alberta the effects could be really dire
if Obama approves the XL pipeline which
will then accelerate the tar sands
development and that continues the
effects on human life it could be a real
a severe how much is being done about it
well you can tell me that it's this is
not small it's not like stopping a war
across the ocean is very important but
destroying human civilization is more
important and it's and that your choices
are right before us and you know very
well how people are dealing with it all
of us and for Canada it's particularly
important but it's much easier to
pretend I don't know anything about it
if you look at the window you've got to
do something about it and that's hard
some of us really suffer but not you and
me and the people we know we have a
fairly decent lives you know do a lot of
things we like to do
a lot of rewards and so on work we like
people we like and so on
and it's it's just easier not to face
the kinds of realities which would lead
us to giving it up even in part so what
do you draw you close the window we do
it all the time and as I say at some
level you couldn't survive if you didn't
do it like the woman in the car in New
Delhi she does it I respect that she has
to do otherwise we no way for her to
survive but for most of us we closed the
window much too early
