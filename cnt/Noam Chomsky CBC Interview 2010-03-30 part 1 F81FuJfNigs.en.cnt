I still had on power and politics the
thinker the professor the best-selling
writer Noam Chomsky is standing by we'll
find out why he says the international
community failed Haiti after the
earthquake controversial thoughts from
mr. Chomsky there is reading something
right before her interview he's coming
right up stay with us
tomorrow is the so-called donors
conference in New York a half day event
where UN member states including Canada
are to pledge billions of dollars in
support of long-term reconstruction
efforts in the earthquake ravaged
country of Haiti now despite the
outpouring of relief efforts and dollars
very serious doubts about the way
donations have been handle have emerged
and a distributed not long after those
efforts began among those critics is the
world renowned activist author and
academic Noam Chomsky he joins me now
from Boston to talk about that and some
other issues Noam Chomsky always good to
talk to you thanks for being here glad
to be with you let's talk about Haiti
shortly after the earthquake you did an
interview and you said this about the
efforts on the ground in Haiti you said
quote there is eight coming in we have
to show where nice people and so on but
the aid ought to be going to Haitian
popular organizations not to contractors
not to NGOs to Haitian popular
organizations they're the ones who
should be deciding what to do with it is
there a risk to the people of haiti
about how this aid has been handled and
distributed so far well it was it's
difficult to second-guess and unfair was
a very difficult situation but i think
that there were things that can be done
differently for one thing that was much
too much of an emphasis on security I
think that's generally agreed was needed
the aid should go to as that quote said
to Haitians they are the ones who should
decide how their country should be
rebuilt a lot of eight is going into
Haiti over the years it's mostly ended
up in the hands of those with the best
contacts those who are privileged those
with the facilities in general to the
very small wealthy elite that it's one
of the plagues of Latin America
particularly extreme in Haiti is a very
sharp differentiation between a small
often Europeanized or your
in white elite and the mass of poverty
now the patient people have done
fantastic jobs of developing civil
society the fact that they were able to
elect their own president in the first
free election which no and I thought
that was even conceivable there had been
mass graphic grassroots organization
going on in the slums and the hills know
he was paying attention to it and
without any resources they came in and
elected their own candidate with
two-thirds of the vote well he was
thrown out in a couple of months by a
military coup but that's one
illustration and there are many of the
capacity of Haitians to organize run
their own affairs do it effectively
design the kind of society they want if
they're given a chance and I think
that's where we're aids should be going
to Franklin shouldn't be aid it should
be reparations especially from France
and the United States which are
responsible driving virtually destroyed
the country and from the rest it should
be grants not loans it should be
associated with a elimination of
canceling of the debt which is totally
obscene and then to the extent possible
the assistance should be going to those
who have a right to make the decisions
about how to use it and are quite
capable of doing so well let's dig into
that one in terms of aid I mean you know
Canadians who and Americans who donated
hundreds of millions of dollars to Haiti
many it through organizations that
frankly have very good reputations World
Vision Oxfam they've been on the ground
for a long time these are these are
highly regarded NGOs they they have the
capacity and the experience to to do a
humanitarian aid work in emergency
situations and in long-term aid
situations are you suggesting that these
are not the right agencies to be
supporting now they're the ones you
mentioned are the right ones but there
are many who aren't
my daughter works for Oxfam she's been
in ad hating many times they're working
on projects and they're very good ones
so who's what's mines other law health
which well I don't want to insult
particular organizations but there are
some there's a tradition of NGOs which
end up using the money themselves or
living a high life or associating with
the powerful elites and those are the
one that's not true of Oxfam for example
it's not true partners in health not to
affect partners in health and ox are
both very striking and that they their
projects are too designed to enable
Haitians to take over and run them
themselves but that's the kind of thing
that should be done mr. Chomsky let's
talk about you you talked about the too
much emphasis on on the military you
wrote a petition you signed a petition
called emergency relief not military
intervention not long after the
earthquake what is the problem you know
Canada said to naval ships we sent our
dart team or disaster assistance relief
team partly to make sure there was
security what's the problem of doing
that the United States flooded the
country with thousands of soldiers who
were totally unnecessary in fact they
were blocking aid at doctors and the
activists on the ground were complaining
fact other countries were complaining
this is a complete disproportion what
the people needed was water food
medicines that there was they didn't
report any serious security problems in
fact rather strikingly in the chilean
earthquake that followed there were
serious security problems they had to
call in the army but that didn't seem to
be the case in haiti
