Could you please comment on the latest operations of Trump and his military-industrial complex in Syria and Afghanistan, and what do you think they want to achieve? 
You probably saw that the US uses the 21,000-kilo (kg) missile, the most powerful weapon in the world, which is second only to nuclear weapons, to bomb the mountainous areas of Syria and Afghanistan. You do not know what terrible damage it caused. 
In our society and culture, where to drop such a big bomb is an expression of courage. I don't know where it is or what damage it causes. Everyone applauds the president's heroic achievements. This is a cultural issue. 
Suppose this bomb really killed a lot of people in ISIS. Suppose it is so. I don't know what it will cause. I don't think the Pentagon knows. But if it is so, then besides murdering many people, what else has it accomplished? Is it effective? 
We have good reasons to ask what the expected effect is. We have 20 years of experience. What was al Qaeda (Al Qaeda) in 2000? It is a small group, trapped in a tribe somewhere in the northwest of Afghanistan (Pakistan). The Taliban tolerate it, but don't like it. If you can get rid of it, you might be happy. That was the situation before 9.11. 
What is Al Qaeda like now? Including its related organizations, its extension groups such as ISIS, it has spread all over the world! Southeast Asia, West Africa, and in fact, the most powerful Islamic radical terrorism in the world is West Africa. That was the consequence of the bombing of Libya, which sent weapons and jihadists to West Africa. 
In fact, we responded to (its) every action with violence and sledgehammer, and every time it expanded Islamic radicalism. Every time, if the goal is to eliminate a threat, what we do is expand it. This record is very clear, and it is not difficult to understand why. 
These things have their roots. If you don't deal with these roots, you just smash it hard, then you will only add support to it. And if we happen to kill a lot of ISIS elements, then you are very likely to spread their ideology and provide proof that Westerners want to eliminate Islam. 
We will not deal with the factors that led to the creation of ISIS and the factors that led people to join it. Then we will not involve the issue of principle first. From a tactical perspective, this is also an absolutely abominable way of dealing with radical Islamism. 
At the same time, we must also remember that we are directly supporting the (multiple) sources of radical Islamism. Most of them happen to be in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of radical Islamism, the roots of wahhabi salafi, and the divergence point of madrasser. 
And what did we do to Saudi Arabia? We pour weapons into Saudi Arabia so that they can use bombing and famine to create a terrible humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Is this the way to deal with powerful terrorists? 
What about the bombing of Syria? 
First of all, do we know what happened? Actually we don't know. We know that chemical weapons are being used. Before taking any action, we should try to find out what happened. Several people who are completely reliable have asked very serious questions. 
Lawrence Wilkerson, he was Colin Powel's chief of staff; Patrick Lang, he was a colonel of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and one of the leading analysts on Middle East issues for many years; Scott Ritter, defense intelligence The person who exposed the "Iraq has weapons of mass destruction" scam. They have all issued noteworthy reports explaining why it is necessary to question those claims to be "what happened." 
Just this morning, a very important article was published. It comes from Theodore Postol, an MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) scientist who is also one of the most incisive and successful analysts on military strategic issues. . . He analyzed in detail the report of the White House intelligence agent who claimed to be the Syrian (government), and then tore the report apart. He said that it is incredible that the intelligence agent would write such a thing. . 
So, what can we say? Let me add that there are many conspiracy theories about Syria reported in newspapers. For example, TIMES (The New York Times) has a large page on conspiracy theories about bombing Syria. 
They selected some completely unknown people with no credibility, and these people can tear the (White House intelligence) report to pieces. That report systematically avoids all reliable (information) sources, which raises some questions. A common problem is that before you file a retaliatory military action, you first find out what happened. 
situation. If you can be sure of what happened, you try to obtain international legitimacy to execute the action. Otherwise, it's just. . . . In fact, the attack on that airport was obviously just a display of meaningless force. 
So (this time the bombing) seemed to be for domestic audiences, saying to them: "Look, I'm tougher than Obama, let's do something else! 
No, this is not a solution to a serious problem. 
This is the same as I said before, if you look carefully at every question in the past, 
Whether it's the North Korean issue, the intercontinental ballistic missile issue, 
Khrushchev[a Khrushchev's arms reduction problem, 
It is the North Korean issue today. Almost all these issues have options for peaceful resolution. 
Take the 9.11 incident as an example, a major terrorist attack did happen. 
Is there another solution? 
One option is to consider Osama Bin Laden's extradition proposed by the Taliban. 
He was suspected, I emphasized "be suspected", 
Make this attack. 
Mentioned that the words "suspected" are important, 
, Because 8 months later, after the most concentrated international survey in history, 
The Director of the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) told the press, 
The United States suspected Osama bin Laden did it, but could not provide an argument. 
So that is just suspicion. 
So when you suspect that someone has committed a criminal attack, what do you do? 
Of course you try to catch him, 
Investigate him and bring him to justice. 
Is this possible? It is very possible. 
At that time, the Taliban made tentative suggestions, 
I want to know if there is a possibility of an independent trial of bin Laden, 
But the United States flatly refused. 
It did not request extradition, 
Because they have no evidence 
If you do that, 
Can the problem be solved without bombing Afghanistan? 
The bombing of Afghanistan was not only condemned by international relief organizations, 
Because millions of Afghan people were on the verge of starvation, 
No one knows what will happen, 
It was also denounced by some major anti-Taliban Afghan militants. 
The most important of them, 
And the most respected, is Abdul Haq, 
He was eventually killed when he returned to Afghanistan. 
He denounced the bombing of Afghanistan, 
He said that the U.S. just wants to show its strength, 
It is hurting the Afghan people by doing so, 
Is destroying us using our own internal power 
Efforts to overthrow the Taliban. 
He is widely supported by anti-Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, 
But these are not what we want, 
We just want to use force, full stop. 
We don't care about the consequences and don't ask if there is a peaceful solution, 
I cite some examples, but such examples are endless, 
They should be prominent in our thinking. 
The use of force will always cause various destructive effects, 
So we should always ask, is it possible to solve the problem peacefully, 
In order to do further exploration. This is often there, 
The facts are in these examples I have cited. .
