more free in just world in fact right
now what I hope for is a world in which
my grandchildren can have a decent life
and that's not obviously going to happen
there are really serious threats that
might destroy that possibility the
threat of nuclear war for example which
is very serious the threat of the
environmental catastrophe extremely
serious in fact there are now threats of
a kind that human beings have never
faced before they are on the wall you
can see a picture of Bertrand Russell he
and Albert Einstein in 1955 I published
a very eloquent - manifesto to the
people of the world and he said people
the world have to face make a choice
that is a stark and inevitable shall we
give up war or shall we destroy the
species and we don't really have many
other choices you could say the same
about environmental catastrophe shall we
decide to do something about it or shall
we create a world in which decent people
wouldn't want to live those are species
threatening choices of a kind that we're
never faced before and there are plenty
of others
