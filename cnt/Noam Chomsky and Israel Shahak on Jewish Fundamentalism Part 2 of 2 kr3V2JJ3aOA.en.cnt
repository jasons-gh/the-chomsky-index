Cuba United States and Israel were there
two voting against you didn't allude to
who may or may not have abstained that
that's not important the point is that
the sanctions and condemnation against
Israel
they're basically what kind of moral
yardstick do you think the United
Nations is when basically it's just a
body of Delegates selected by non
democratically chosen the governments
driven obviously by self-interest and
not moral altruism so how can we really
judge Israel or any other country based
up against moral based up against United
Nations resolution that's the first
question the second one is you argue
that the rich lifestyle of the Israeli
society is essentially supported by the
United States taxpayer we know that it's
something like three billion dollars a
year that the United States applies to
Israel that's about $600 per capita
enough maybe to buy a Nintendo a nice
stereo system if you're not spending it
on defense related cost the economy in
Israel is about seventy billion dollars
it's growing at about seven percent per
year I really don't see how that's more
than just a small subsidy at this point
in time and it continues to erode with
time as well how can you argue that the
Israeli economy is totally dependent on
is real support those are my two
questions well the as far as the United
Nations is concerned there were
countries that abstained all of whom
condemned the United States and we don't
worry about the UN we can ask about
countries like Canada England and so on
and asked what their opinion is I don't
know if their democratic by your
standards but if they are they bitterly
condemned the US the US embargo and
indeed so did George Bush in fact when
the torricelli bill which is what
they're talking about this bill which
was designed to increase the embargo and
to cut out about ninety percent of what
it could I was at food and medicine it
was vetoed by George it was proposed by
the Liberal Democrats it was vetoed by
George Bush the reason being it was so
obviously contrary to international law
that George Bush was opposed to it when
it came up in the United native flank
from the right
by Clinton during the 1992 election so
they passed it
it was immediately condemned by the
Democratic by our Democratic allies I
should say by the Western Hemisphere of
course the British ambassador who is
usually at the UN is usually so loyal to
the United States he practically you
know but suspect he gets handed his
messages from Washington he got up and
bitterly condemned that though finally
they abstained they don't like to step
on the toes of the United States that
openly so in fact world opinion on this
it goes from include say Britain Canada
you know George Bush and so on and so
forth but we do we do know we do know
what the we do know the voting record
and we do know what our allies our
Democratic allies felt they bitterly
condemned it because it was so obviously
contrary to international law okay
that's on the case of on the case of the
one hundred and one to two vote there
was one country that was willing to
stand up against all of world opinion on
this including the democratic societies
namely our subsidised client and that's
true on case after case for example the
United Nations passed the Security
Council passed a resolution a few years
ago calling on all states to to observe
international law didn't mention any
particular state in question but
everyone know who they meant it was
right after the World Court had ordered
the United States to stop it's as they
put it unlawful use of force meaning in
that international terrorism against
Nicaragua
the u.s. of course totally rejected the
the opinion it then went to the
Nicaraguan took it to the Security
Council the United Nations which voted
to call on all states to support
international law the u.s. vetoed it
then went to the to the General Assembly
where there's technically no veto
and the General Assembly passed a
resolution calling on all states to
adhere to international law mentioning
no one but the implication was
understood excuse me a second
excuse me a second right you asked your
question now I'm answering it the US was
able to pick up one vote well actually
the first time it came the US was able
to pick up two votes the United States
and El Salvador agreeing objecting to
obeying international law the second
time it came the u.s. today will pick up
one vote Israel and if you want if we
had time I'd go on and on now you know
if your standards are that the only
expression of decent human opinion is
the State of Israel and US government
yeah you have us in position if it's
anyone else if well if it includes for
example the votes of Canada England
France other Germany on and on saying
say that you should uphold international
law if it includes the world Court then
you're afraid you're off the wall on the
second issue if you want the first of
all they $600 a year is absolutely not
true US subsidies to Israel amount to at
the very minimum $1,000 per capita
Israel gets more from an S of the
minimum if we don't consider subsidiary
costs like for example one subsidiary
cost which is not counted is
contributions to Israel you can give
money to the Jewish National Fund in the
United States and the United Jewish
appeal and that's tax-deductible meaning
everybody in the country pays for it and
that money goes for the kinds of things
that Israel shall was talking about
for example if you look at the contract
of the Jewish National Fund with the
State of Israel originally signed in
1953 and then renewed what it says is
that that the money that they spend can
be used on quoting for people of Jewish
race religion and origin only okay
that's you American taxpayers are
therefore paying quite substantial sums
to the State of Israel for it to
actually to enough to a quasi official
agency is realized to farm out these
activities so that they don't literally
fall under the government which is then
used for the benefit of people of Jewish
race religion and origin and we can go
on with that
if you want an authoritative analysis of
the effect of this from a very
pro-israeli
scholarly source you can turn to down
the river tune of saffron
I guess it's originally Israeli judging
but not Israeli scholar who was a major
middle-eastern scholar who wrote one of
the sort of standard works on the United
States and Israel standard scholarly
works and he points out there that up
until the time he wrote I forget what
year it was he says all of Israel's
capital formation came from external
sources meaning basically the United
States very I'm little bit from German
reparations but primarily the United
States and that was long before the
major contributions that was before us a
so-called aid to Israel shot up in the
70s in 1978 Jimmy Carter raised it the
literally 50% of total US aid in fact if
you cut out us 8 the the United States
happens to have be have the the most
miserly record in the developed world in
foreign aid that's literally the case
but if you cut out the aid to Israel a
rich country the US isn't even there
it's not like around Zambia in absolute
terms and this but and this is a huge
flow of a there is no country in the
world I guess a fraction of it sometimes
Israel's called it like a State of the
Union but that's wrong because there is
no State of the Union that even gets a
fraction of the contribution that comes
from the taxpayer to the State of Israel
and that's an enormous factor in their
in in their economic growth I say Safran
called it equivalent the entire capital
formation that that's why Israel's a
rich country
for people to ask their questions from
the first step that way by the way God
sovereign conference
you guys
[Music]
yes first of all it did have a great
effect only the emigration has ceased
about two years ago the emigration and
by the way to add to comment of non
Chomsky the two billion of guarantees
are actually now sitting in a Swiss bank
and bearing 7% bearing seven percent
because the emigration has stopped but
it is very true that the emigration has
caused two effects one that most of
those people are secular and it is very
true that some of them are not Jews and
some of them have now are now living
religious life in Greek Orthodox Church
yes there are there are no two churches
in Israel who call themselves Jewish
Christian churches one is the Greek
Orthodox as another catolica Church who
say Mass in Hebrew and regardless of
Jewish Catholics but I don't know what
the ideology in government will do with
this but there is another factor which
they cost they are very poor by now
because mr. Robin happens to be the
prime minister who is the most devoted
to the economic ideas of mr. Reagan more
than I will say mr. Samir before him and
more before
any other prime minister let me just
point in substantiation of the fact that
during - and years and few months that
mr. Robin is prime minister the average
price price of housing in Israel rose by
56 percent imagine such a thing
happening because of this you have a
conflict between the their security and
their being object ly to great extent
object leap or the long term effect I
think will be judge a will very strongly
the long-term effect on Europe you have
to add other factor and there I think
great devotion to basic democracy not to
all democracy back democracy caused by
the revulsion of their form of the
Soviet regime will certainly be they
will support they will be against
tradition at war for democracy very well
I will
to me please
diversity
there are many other traditions
but the other part of the question is
this
from a practical point of view running
an apartheid state creation tremendous
pointed out there's no dominating a
reason from the American point of view
by the Palestinians
they'd only have to be for in Gaza
yeah yes I think yes the first question
was in the research in your tradition
but there is our diversity of modern
radical traditions existing as Europe
and it is true I and should I discuss it
through this an omission of my part and
the second running that apartheid state
creates a drain on people who are
running that state and I suppose it will
be for further development of ideas that
it will be in Israel of interest not to
run an apartheid state even if it wants
to to govern the territories you are
right about my own making the radical
and traditions of Eastern Europe this
was because of the demands of time I
jumped from orthodoxy which I said was
universally ruling the Jewish people
until about 200 years ago and I omitted
the revolt against I set about something
about reform and conservative by a metre
the fact that certainly many there was a
Jewish working-class movement there were
many parties there was the whole
literature created in English and in
Hebrew Eastern Europe is a rebellious
literature Ishmael day some of his
greatest creations are utterly
rebellious it still continues in Israel
and gives also to people like me part of
their strengths I omitted it because all
this was not possible in Orthodox Jew
days before liberation or outside and
because those who are putting Jewish
tradition above democracy are also
against this part of
Jewish tradition they are to give the
only American example or something
conflicting between Americans and Israel
the famous play Finland on the roof has
been really in my opinion falsified from
a wonderful book of Shalom Aleichem a
wonderful writer in Edy's who's worked
our little faithfully translated into
Hebrew and which are know by every lover
little really of Jewish culture and of
both literature if you go to mosque
Jewish libraries or general libraries in
this country you will not find a Salam
alaikum Abu a writer whose books were
literally when published in millions in
many millions because it's very critical
about Jewish tradition because in the
novel from which Fiddler's of a fiddler
on the roof was made he makes fun and
satirizes the Jewish tradition way
filler of the roof is sang a song of
price to tradition so you see it is true
I omitted I pointed to this but I make
it I think for the question and
certainly we are in a part we are a
power continued Asian of this tradition
but in the form of which it was
represented in Palestine this critical
and radical tradition carried a flaw a
flow meaning the idea jet the idea of
Jewish rule Jewish full possession I
should say not rule ownership of Jews of
all the Jewish nation of length of
Israel was taken by the first settlers
and by Chinese movement strayed from
tradition jumping over all
although radical and very positive
tendencies here I can find the best
explanation in one of our jobs because
we Israeli Jews continued the radical
tradition of the Jewish joking maybe and
the joke very famous in Israel may be
considered I don't know what self-hating
or anti-semitic in unity here United
States but nevertheless all Israeli Jews
or most of them know the joke that there
are some Jews who don't believe that God
exists but who still believe that God
gave to the Jews the ownership of the
Land of Israel so this will explain to
you that some secular Jews could
secularize the part of the Jewish
tradition and religion and use them in a
very in for very good secular benefit it
always reminds me of that saying which
was a Voltaire that when he asked
whether he wants his servants to be of
his range of opinions he said no no I
all my servants must be faithful
Catholics because otherwise they will
steal from me so here you have here you
have something I think which is very
similar now about the second it is true
to conduct apartheid state is a drain it
is a drain which is include which is I
think becoming greater because so many
Israeli Jews are traveling to other
countries specially in last 10 years and
are coming with the sense of observing
what they have what what they have seen
never jealous it continues it is now a
little it is now to some extent second
in domestic affairs it is a drain which
on the other which on the other part has
a satisfaction in the totalitarian
mental attitude particular of a true
believer a true believer which believes
in all this is not in case of course of
Christian true believers Muslim true
believers Buddhist true believers every
communistic true believers in the same
way has the sense that he has all the
answers from the past wise men of the
past have decided what is correct I
simply have to follow I have my own
interpreter I am very much afraid that
this feeling of happiness and certainty
can compensate for the drain however is
not a member of the Jewish religion
please not the religious organization
all of the truthfully I do not think you
have the right to do this unification of
the Jewish religion I don't think his
opinion should be taken with more credit
most credit and then the opinion of
members of Operation Rescue on doctors
perform abortion
I will point that the first critiques of
Christianity and of its treatment of
Jews were Christians and the opinion now
said would if logically followed yet let
us say Voltaire whom I now who quoted
now in an version that his critique of
Christianity should not be translated to
Arabic and published let us say in Egypt
because of the same principle if the
principle that required the person who
made the statement is intended to be
universal I have with him a disagreement
but if he will say that while critic of
Judah's would not be should not be made
in Israel but critic of Islam where
Islam I think is much more denigrated
here than Judaism and much less probable
should be then I have had much deeper
disagreement with cement
everyone should choose the view that he
prefers please
now I said about Egyptian who is telling
the Egyptians about Walters opinion of
Christianity while Christians infra in
Egypt are a minority and a man may be a
minority not in such a good condition
and what is more I am saying this
because lack of creditors of Judaism is
causing the oppression of Palestinians
is one of the most important causes of
oppression of Palestinians which which
out United States support will not
[Applause]
[Music]
settlement breeds to get the loan
guarantees now I'd like you just to say
something if you would about
[Music]
you are
yes the question was what is happening
after Oslo particularly in terms of land
confiscation what is the fate of
settlement whether increases or not
increases and what the settlers are
doing in Kiryat Arba and otherwise net
with there are more land confiscation
land confiscation going is going on
after Oslo all the time as well in fact
it's increasing I didn't mention it
because I think that if the amount of
length of confiscated in will increase
from 70 to 71 percent of 72 percent it
will not be a great difference I think
that the fate of empty land is much more
significant I am of course very aware of
the suffering of persons of whose land
was confiscated but I think that is the
most important problem is to see this is
to see in general terms and in terms of
a part right
additional confiscation of land are
additions to apartheid and it so should
we put the important fact is apartheid
exists now about the settlements
actually there was a limitation of our
settlements and it was due to mr. Bush a
few months after attaining power in
September 1992 Robin visited Bush and
they came to an agreement in which
agreement with Robin accepted only after
some strong pressure from Bush that the
settlement will be divided that first of
all no further settlement will be
established this was a great concession
maybe not important in apartheid terms
but under Samir and so on of course many
settlements may be in
be not effectual maybe not just what
every new settlements were established
all the time from that time the
settlements are divided into two parts
political and non-political in the so
called
non political settlements as agreed
between bush and robin settling goes on
between a settlement expands but no new
is being built and in the other category
Israeli government ceased to give the
enormous support that it gave that he
gave formerly in it does quite a lot of
it does give quite a lot of money but I
think that most of that money in the
year after Oslo is being spent on
demonstrating against Israeli government
itself is fully documented by Hebrew
press and not on the settling per
process well about Kiryat Arba and the
settlers and what has been done now I I
can I will say in general terms as the
situation in Hebron has not become
better and that I can refer you to a
long article about this which those of
you who received my translations whether
directly or the through from from my
publication here United States can read
it for themselves but I will also tell
you that the oppression of settlers in
have grown in Kiryat Arba
a minor part of oppression carried by
Israeli army that we should not remember
that the main work of oppression is
carried by army and
by Israeli soldiers and reservists and
of course by the civilian authorities of
the state a civilian and business and so
on it is the stage that oppresses it is
so that the state is using the settlers
especially around her Braun encouraged
by an additional oppression and on this
I will only answer the question in one
respect which will excuse me for being
selfish emphasize the point that I made
about the rule of law
about at the beginning of this year in
January there was a discussion in
Israeli media in radio press and
television
what Israeli army can do when a settler
from Kiryat Arba points his gun at a
Palestinian wielding with intention
possible intention to shoot at him
a culinary from Israeli army up to a
station actually a vice commander peuta
commander of brigade stationed in hebron
appeared on Israeli TV his words were
then reproduce by Hebrew press and said
if I will witness such incident the only
thing that I can do is to run as quickly
as I can and to seal the Palestinian
with my body because the standing orders
of the Israeli army prohibit me from
doing anything else prohibit me let us
say from this arm the settler before he
was he he he fired after he felt and
wounded he can be discerned but not
before this this is of course I can I
really don't need to emphasize that in
case of a Palestinian shooting at anyone
of course the directions are quite
different this will show you how the
rule of law even in the most basic sense
doesn't exist in territories officially
after the sanger committee report which
condemned this order and after that it
will be abolished
practically nothing was done not so much
because settlers are powerful because
well because this order is one of the
outward signs of the apartheid please
the security human mr. Johnson are
especially fond of quoting Voltaire I
mean again
we begin with the second part of the
question this is about the incident I
actually mentioned in the book that I
witnessed myself in 1965 in Jerusalem in
Katamon in the street called yo ostrich
very near a yeshiva girl and very near
my house
the that a religious Jew a song known to
me by the way since it was my own
neighborhood refused to to edit to use
his telephone to use his telephone
telephones well then relative around the
neighborhood in order to cause a lab
ambulance for saving for saving T then I
will go about welfare in vigil one
moment I am in the middle of answering
the question
I am after with plastic I am answering
in my own name and I am not used
specially in Israel to submit to Jewish
matys
now I didn't publish this after
witnessing the incident I went first to
the rabbinical court of Jerusalem I
obtained from the rabbinical court of
Jerusalem a statement that a Jew should
not violate Shabbat in - in order to
save non-jewish life with this statement
I went to Haaretz
not with the incident and I made scandal
not about the incident but about a
statement of rabbinical court of
Jerusalem signed by three rabbis this
was the scandal it is not true emanuel
jacob rivets with you with somebody
quote here is a well-known liar and
because of this and we he was chosen by
Margaret Thatcher as her great supporter
because it was met a lot and I would say
to you that if you look into his book
Jewish medical ethics not into his text
but into his biography you will find
biography you will find in the
bibliography articles in Hebrew which
don't appear in the text which say again
and again with literature again being
brought in the Hebrew pressing Hebrew
literature and by the way by professors
in Bar Ilan University jet a religious
meaning Orthodox Jew should not violate
Shabbat in order to save a non-jewish
life except when it is for the benefit
or Jews or for averting a danger of yes
and I will not and I will not yes I
answer the question and your and your
being now and very well the question
will not go away and you practically
agreeing the Jews will not save Jewish
life you now not change anything about
the statement of the rabbinical court of
Jerusalem will also not go away
[Applause]
now about I will answer I will also
answer about Voltaire
[Applause]
I will also because I don't want answer
the questions of a Nazi
[Applause]
and what and by the way if question sank
about the name why the cowards who
publish this about norm Chomsky and
Israel shahe didn't put any name today
[Applause]
if they are so much about the name why
you will not find here any name or
address a phone to which one can refer I
wrote that I wrote my name here and what
if you
[Applause]
now about Voltaire it is true that
Walter made many offensive statements
about about many groups including the
poorest a quarter it is true that you
that Walter has generals about the Jews
in offensive matter it is also true that
not only he didn't wanted them not to be
burned but we fought against any
discrimination of German and that you
oppose any case of injustice to German
Voltaire is also value of abuse
Christian religion and Protestant
religion especially in the most
atrocious way but when there was a case
of a Protestant named caliph he
protested against his execution in in
the way in the greatest way of which he
was capable I will jump for say about
Walter and about every great man that we
have to put his expression of first of
all we have to see how much he hated a
special group there is a very great
difference between a hating special
group such as one should not let us say
allow the use of telephone or other
instrument on Shabbat in order to save
them and there is a very great much a
great difference between only abusing
the group I am afraid that abusers of
human groups will exist in every society
what I demand I didn't speak to you one
word about those who are worshipping
goldstein I didn't speak to you one word
but now in answer to Walter I will about
a rabbis right now who are justifying
those nightmare
and margins s-pen madam my answer to
quotation about Voltaire will be another
quotation which you can read actually in
your library because it's from Jerusalem
for 7th of October of this year 1994 for
any concerns about rabbi called endo
Elba who also raises that he was even
inducted by the Israeli authorities
quote according to the indictment L Rabi
Elba circulated a 14-page halakha
consulate entitled clarification of the
hala hot religious rules pertaining to
the murder of Gentiles
according to Kiryat Arba sources this
pamphlet was circulated after Baruch
Goldstein till 29 Arabs in the mass Fela
case in the summary of the back page
headlines for the study but not for
practice Alva allegedly wrote that the
biblical injunctions are shalt not kill
is not applicable to a Jew who killed a
Gentile and this is not forbidden
according to the Torah elba also wrote
that there is a mitzvah a good deed to
kill Gentiles who are devoted to
religion that denies the fundamentals of
Jewish faith and the Eternity of the
Torah and who like missionaries and
Muslim who believe in jihad believe that
they are commanded to persuade others to
join the religion this mitzvah good deed
Elbe Road is applicable when Jews have
in their power to do this and when they
do not have to fear from the rest of the
world end of quotation I will first
emphasize I didn't say one word about
this in my presentation because I
emphasize to you that the most important
things are done by the power of the
state with the full consent of the
citizens in the same way it is not the
incident that I witnessed the answer is
I didn't ask
the name of the person but the ruling of
rabbinical court represented by state
which is important
the prohibitions of Shabbat returns to
saving anyone's lives but in the end the
results of many debates is that you must
save the person's life and I don't know
which sources you're choosing to put
here but that is what I have learned
from many many places well I I will here
answer that your statement is strictly
untrue in cases of danger to Jewish life
all means should be done including
valuation of Shabbat to save Jewish life
and if you want an argument you can buy
my book you can with it you can offer it
or advice and let the rabbi's answer it
yes and but I still know that after call
you and ask me question after I quoted
you one singular rabbi you didn't say
that you oppose him
you didn't say after I quoted now
something shocking in the name of rabbi
which in dicted by the state of israel
itself you could open your statement
that whatever other rabbis say you
oppose this rabbi you don't didn't do it
all right all right very well
then the Christians who support
Inquisition can use your argument duck
first aha
your presentation I use a fairly loosely
is to be a cesspool of misinformation
and distortions I have two comments
against this background first to the
audience please do not take what he's
saying at face value go out research the
topic go to library see if reality
corroborates what this guy is saying and
let the fast be my witness this guy
speaks the truth about Hoffman as
Halley's Comet visits earth more
importantly I have this state you sir
being Jewish when you use personal
pronouns such as me and us when you talk
about the Jewish people I've been the
visceral reaction I say to you what a
prime minister of being said the
daughter of Goldstein after the heinous
massacre at that bro
and that is we spit you out with every
minute of power we pass
[Applause]
I will certainly agree I will certainly
agree with the first part of the
statement go on and Rochelle make your
own result and see very well I will
point out that although Robyn made this
statement about Baruch Goldstein he did
make this statement about the many
rabbis and other religious figures who
supported Baruch Goldstein and in either
case in any case I am against beating
out any member from any from any nation
on authority of Prime Minister of
President and but if you want to speech
me out from Judah is that you represent
the de feeling is mutual
[Applause]
[Applause]
just when you're going so in the back
row yeah yeah ask something you call
that person and not see I think you're
doing
[Applause]
defense that defended Arabs by the way
many more than hundred thousand the
number of Arabs in Israel is about
850,000 have voting rights and many
other rights and they sit in Parliament
is very true doesn't change the
territory the situation that a colony in
Israeli army as I said again it again
who of course as a voting right cannot
use 70% of the length of west of West
Bank I emphasized even in jail and
respect there in the Israeli Army's are
very many Palestinians who is quite high
positions but since you began with this
I am saying something more about it
which means that although I will not
call state of in the State of Israel
proper I will apartheid but I will say
that it has some profit element the word
apartheid in full strength should be
reserved for the conquered territories
now why because let us say two people
who serve in the army about a year and
half ago when president a servicemen was
elected he wanted to nominate truth to
be a true scholar a retired Colin L to
be one of his official in his
presidential mansion
the authorities insist and the secret
police objected on the ground that every
non Jew whatever Jurong in the Army is
suspect to some extent president by
Israeli law has access to all secrets
and all information after some argument
which President try to persuade the
secret police he accepted their argument
and the man was not nominated which
means that the border of apartheid or
aspects of a part are much lighter but
the answer if the same argument would be
employed in United States and Henry
Kissinger could not become Secretary of
State therefore the situation even in
Israel itself is more close to South
Africa gian to United States by this
differential all about religion ravages
now I will I will point to you that
there are many discriminations in Israel
lighter than in in South Africa all the
territories but conversion religious
conversion will abolish them all because
of this I think that yet one can use in
about Israel the statement about aspects
of apartheid or something else and it
fully applies in the territories now
about my use of the terminology this was
invented by one of my friends and
teacher
general language many years ago who use
the term Judea Nazis very often and it
referred to the fact of denial of common
humanity in this not only to borrow
Goldstein and such an act common
humanity means to denial of basic facts
which even colonial regime is granting
or which came to pass during the
invasion of Lebanon or during the
Israeli support to Guatemala and many
things I think that the fact that Jews
have lost six million during the
Holocaust I am myself a local survival
has seen it all doesn't prevent Jewish
from becoming Nazis Nazis became Nazis
because that's the ideology and not
because they were Germans actually there
were Nazis of many nationalities as well
Jews can become Nazis in my opinion I
may be a right or wrong but in my
opinion opinion of very many people in
Israel headed by cross a label which
some Jews did become nauseous
I didn't order so this is their
difference in definition that is all at
least I will point the term Jewish
notches or Judean artists is very much
in common in Israel where I live most of
my time then it is used in here please
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the first part the first part of the
question which I will try to answer at
some length yes I am paraphrasing now
it's about Jewish tradition and how do
each transition can influence the
Israeli politics although a proportion I
will explain what apply high proportion
is the question is settled the Jews in
Israel are are not religious or not
Orthodox and the second example that the
questioner who said that is October
brought an example of a group which of a
Jewish ambulance service called hatzala
which of course highly value which runs
of ambulance service in New York and
answer to every call I will answer the
first the second question first much as
I value hatzala I have to point to you
the daily situation in Israel is
different for example a that ambulance
of the settlement centers of opera in
many recorded cases is not running on
Shabbat in very famous case in which
world collapsing over Arab caffeine is
Jerusalem the ordinary magenta with red
star of david' ambulances arrived at
once
it was a shocking case and this
ambulance waited for you hour for a few
hours therefore I am following the
Israeli examples which are well
documented I am very happy to learn that
Orthodox of New York are better
a few quarter this is in MIDI security
power problems meaning Joseph New York
feelings and self week and Jews in
Israel feelings as a strong it may not
be in your favor
I hope that on this point that that you
are right in a deeper sense that some
Orthodox rabbis about whom I never have
a rose in New York and change a ruling
which I took from the standard text and
from the Israeli practice of the last
years if so I would be very clear a P to
learn about now about the first part of
your question it is true that all polls
are showing that Jewish Israeli Jews are
divided into three major groups one is
Orthodox one is called traditionalist in
Hebrew majority I will explain it one is
secular we can have various polls but
the usual opinion is that there are 20%
Orthodox 40 percent secular and 40
percent traditionalist and 40 percent
secular now traditionalists are people
who keep very many of Jewish Orthodox
traditions but who violated also in
other in other ways the standard Israeli
expression or again a joke even those
are people who are feeling keeping
kosher homes obviously will be a
requirement then going to synagogue
every Saturday morning and then
afternoon going to see aware sports
playing which are played our afternoon
in politics traditionalists will be for
lost based on tradition it was I I will
not enter into party manipulation due to
this law by which
importance of non kosher meat was
the commercial but in electoral sense
all the people of traditional persuasion
and some secular to pursue have
supported it because they said if I want
to eat non-kosher meat I can do it
abroad when I'm traveling abroad another
verse in it says I can do it restaurant
but never in my home but some some
coercion must be in interest of Jewish
tradition therefore his not only
Orthodox I didn't attribute the power of
tradition to the Orthodox but to the
people generally as I now explain in
detail who while may be violating some
loss of Jewish tradition nevertheless
uphold it in the same way help very many
people who will break many Christian
Commandments will still apply Christian
tradition or religion to the question of
abortion please
[Music]
you went to
[Music]
I will ID if I was I think you
misunderstood me I didn't say that
organized user actually said Israeli
supporter because this applies as much
let's say to Pat Robertson and to Jerry
Falwell as it applies to any Jew have no
right to express their opinion or to
support Israel I said that I advised you
not to depend on their views because
their support of Israel make them
compensate and therefore their opinion
tends to be my opinion tend to be very
inaccurate and not by long experience
and but I certainly didn't idea right
now to express any opinion at n12 and
forever I will expect how I will expect
however that the opinions of a lot a of
of a person who will need will not wait
about what is happening in Israel to be
more dependable on the average we when
the situation in Israel and Middle
Eastern person coolly to be were more
dependable than the person who will
we offer what happening but still not go
over there and carry his conviction my
point was about his conviction I think
that an Israeli right-winger in Kiryat
Arba I may approach him as very strongly
but I will not deny some of the things
that I will not deny him is that he
fully carries out his conviction those
who are supporting the Kiryat Arba
Lesage supporters of Goldstein in New
York are not doing the same thing like
the supporter of Golson here at Arba
they are only giving money and because
of Jays I found that even with the most
extreme latekka Hani's in Israel you can
carry a sort of argument limited in
extension with the same kindness in in
New York or when he is visiting Israel
for a short time and the same thing
applies to every category meaning you
can and the could supporter in Israel is
in my view a much more interesting and
valuable person to discuss than the fact
that the person who support the same
view in United States and so on and on
through spectrum and I advise you to go
to the source now I ask you permission
to say something about money before
American money before you will and
elaborate on this my you see American
money in my opinion going to Israel has
two great faults which are not dependent
on the point that I made and the norm
Chomsky made that it is also used for
indirectly for settlements for all kinds
of aggressive politics
first of all American money is only used
only spent on the army the so-called
economic aid is not spent on it
economy I mentioned that guarantees have
not been used the economic age is spent
on to repair the depths of our acquiring
weapons what it means it means that
Israel the armies but supported about
half and half half by taxpayer money and
half by money coming from United States
which means in terms that the government
is in this very important respect not
dependent fully on the taxpayers and it
is more for more it is more powerful
that it should be certain it means
something that we in Israel are calling
militarization of Israeli society and
economy which means simply that many
people not at all of my opinion are
considering that the army is now too
great for the Israeli security means the
sine of this overgrowth is that by now
in the last budget from the Israeli
taxpayer monies we technology have spent
by Israel 58 percent of the Israeli army
budget is spent on salaries and pensions
well in 1967 the corresponding figure is
1961 which means that in addition to
everything it is my opinion and people
and opinion of people who are not in the
same of you know about Palestinians that
actually American support may make the
Israeli army larger but it is a quite a
question when it make make make it
stronger
first there's sort of a side question on
this undercurrent that keeps running
through about the right of people say in
the United States to criticize policies
elsewhere where Americans don't directly
suffer from them it's a possible
position that you might take and if you
took it seriously you would be writing
endless denunciations of everyone in the
press and the intellectual community all
of whom are bitterly condemning
Palestinians all the time that they
don't live in Palestinian refugee camps
you would use it to criticize anyone in
the United States who like me for
example who condemned the policy the
Soviet Union I mean I didn't live there
but I certainly condemned their policies
in fact I only hear this in one case
namely you're not allowed to criticize
the policies of the State of Israel
unless you live there you're allowed to
clear eyes of anything else you know
you're allowed to put eyes Stalinism
you're allowed to criticize said I'm
saying you're allowed to criticize the
PLO you're allowed to criticize anybody
even though you don't live there but one
exception holds now I think there's a
name for that it's racism and we should
accept that I think everyone has a
perfect right everyone has a perfect I'm
talking about you everyone has a perfect
right I well maybe I misunderstand you
but I thought that's what you were
saying anyway in any event maybe we
agreed everyone has a perfect right to
criticize any policies anywhere that
they think are wrong okay now in the
case of the United in my and referring
to the economy if the United States were
to give the I'm strongly I gave two
examples of opposition to aid to Israel
- one of them was quoting Human Rights
Watch the major international human
rights monitor which pointed out that US
aid to Israel is flatly illegal by US
law it's not the first time that's been
pointed out they just reiterated again
so let me repeat I'm quoting Human
Rights Watch major international human
rights monitor who pointed out which is
correct that you that US law is directly
violated by
every dollar spent in aid to Israel
because that law states explicitly that
no aid can be dish given except under
special conditions which don't apply to
countries which systematically carry out
torture and abuse of the populations
under their control including their
citizens and then they proceed the
document in hundreds of pages as but
Selim has done in Israel on as other
human rights investigators have done
that this is indeed true of Israel so
therefore one comment about US aid to
Israel which I made in which I repeat
that your request is that all it's all
illegal for that reason alone a second
comment that I made about aid to Israel
had to do with the indirect aid that
comes from the tax-free status of the
grants that are used in Israel itself
incidentally - for the benefit of people
of Jew of Jewish race religion and
origin I remember that's US taxpayers
who are paying that because that's
tax-deductible a tax-deductible gift
means it's spread across the population
by elementary logic so I'm opposed to
that kind of taxes I don't think that
say my taxes should be used within the
State of Israel to pay for development
to pay for the following situation so
let me describe it inside Israel not
outside under the territories of course
is much worse but I'm talking about the
State of Israel itself within that state
92% of the land is under the
administration of an organization which
if you sort of work out through the
whole complicated traces it's in print
if you like and I'll refer you to them
in fact turns out to be run by the JNF
the current kmut they have the you know
it's designed the laws of design so that
they have the governing position the
land administration and they are by law
by their contract with the state
restricting in the use of their funds to
people of Jewish race religion and
origin the same is true of development
funds development funds are funded by
the State of Israel through these quasi
governmental
tutions which have similar conditions
and which are paid for by US taxpayers
and that leads to the result that you
have just vast differences in in say
sewage education services and so on
between a Jewish village and a
Palestinian village right next to each
other within Israel and I'm opposed to
that kind of a with regard to the scale
of aid to Israel as I didn't really
criticize it but if you'd like it will
criticize it
I will criticize it because for several
reasons for one thing it because what
the 8 is first of all because of its
scale and secondly because of what it
goes for
so I will add my credit I haven't made
that criticism but I will make the
criticism I'll add it to my criticism
the huge amount of aid we give to
Colombia more than half of the military
aid in the continent and it happens to
be the leading human rights violator in
the continent in fact US aid happens to
correlate very closely with torture
that's been demonstrated over and over
the more country tortured citizens the
higher it's likely to get US aid within
our domains I opposed USA to saddam
hussein four years four years before
anybody was willing to talk about it or
even reported you will find in cases
that i make perhaps they only want to
even report it some of this and I
opposed it because I opposed we was
doing even though I didn't live in Iraq
and I opposed it because I don't want us
eight to go to Saddam Hussein
even though George Bush and James Baker
and so on thought is a great idea and in
the case of Israel I don't want first of
all the aid notice is not on the scale
of the rest of us of us or for that
matter of anybody's a there is no
country in the world that gets a
fraction of the aid per capita that goes
to Israel from the US taxpayer it's an N
it's in a corner by itself it's vastly
in advance of Marshall Plan aid Europe
it just is not in the same ballpark and
I should say that Marshall Plan aid to
Europe if you really look at it
most of it was aid from US taxpayers the
US corporations so for example too big
the 13 billion dollars of Marshall plan
to aid to Europe went straight to the
American oil companies as part of the
effort to sort of shift Europe over from
a coal to an oil based economy but I
only am proceed with that because
whatever you think about Marshall Plan
eight it is so minuscule as compared to
the aid we're giving to Europe the
Israel per capita that it doesn't enter
as for where USA taught ago I don't
think it ought to go to rich people
there's a small amount of the Israel is
one of the richest countries in the
world it's in the higher level of wealth
it happens to be extremely unequal it
has one of the highest levels of
inequality in the world right after the
United States in fact but it's also but
it's also a very wealthy country it's
it's one it's the first world now I
don't think that there are 11 million
children dying every year according to
UNICEF from easily treatable diseases
meaning a couple of cents a day I might
add personal cases even in my own
clothes experience but there are 11
million children are dying every year
from what the World Health Organization
calls a silent genocide that's where I'd
like to see the aid going not to rich
countries not when you asked me you
asked me why I'm criticizing da
right that's why I'm criticizing I'm
going because the aid is being given to
rich people to buy guns so they can
oppress other people to buy land to to
racist programs of the kind that I
described and not being given to 11
million children a year who are dying of
who are dying because a couple of cents
a day would be required to give them
salt you know so they don't get diarrhea
that's what I'm criticizing and in fact
we can come right here in the United
States the city of Boston where we live
which is one of the richest cities in
the world and maybe the world's leading
Medical Center house I haven't said a
hospital downtown which serves the
population not know the rich both the
Boston City Hospital and they a couple
of years ago had to establish from
malnutrition clinic why because they
were for the first time beginning to see
third-world levels of malnutrition in is
the richest country in the world
unparalleled advantages right a couple
of miles from us
there are children with third-world
levels of malnutrition the United States
has the there are two areas in the world
where hunger has increased in the past
several decades sub-saharan Africa and
the United States the richest country in
the world and it's increased to enormous
levels it's now estimated at couple of
years ago is estimated about 30 million
people there is no other wealthy country
that even comes close to that and many
third world countries don't so if we're
going to give aid there are plenty of
people we can give aid to not to people
I'm incidentally exactly as much opposed
then you can find this in print to the
aid that we give to Saudi Arabia not
only because it's a brutal and
tyrannical regime but also because that
aid happens to be aid from US taxpayers
to US corporations and in fact if we
actually trace back the so called aid to
Israel a lot of it is exactly the same
kind so the part of the aid that goes to
high-tech weaponry a substantial part of
that is what keeps places like MIT going
that is its aid to from the American
taxpayer to the wealthy in the United
States funneled through the Pentagon
system which was designed in large part
as a technique to you know to make sure
that the poor subsidize the rich and I'm
very much opposed to that including the
cases where it's called foreign aid so
for example a lot of the military aid
that we go to Israel because that
doesn't leave New York banks you know it
gets transferred to another account
namely the account of the US military
producers and there's all kind of
spin-offs to that like computers and
electronics and virtually every aspect
of the functioning economy and that I've
been criticizing for years contrary to
us aid is Roshan bother talking about
Munch's you know horrible thing in my
opinion but small potatoes similarly
when the u.s. cells aren't say when the
u.s. sells jet planes to Israel part of
the purpose of that is Export Promotion
or when it gives jet planes to Israel
part of the purpose is Export Promotion
if the u.s. gives jet planes to Israel
they will then be able to sell you know
not as good but relatively advanced and
very expensive jet planes to Saudi
Arabia which is one of the standard
techniques of recycling oil profits and
making sure that the profits from Middle
Eastern oil come right back here not to
the people of the region yes I'm opposed
to all of that I'm opposed to aid the
Israel's goes for those purposes so if
my feeling about Aid is it should not be
first of all it shouldn't be illegal
like we I think the American law on this
point is to the point we should not be
giving aid to countries with slaughter
and their citizens or torture their
citizens so not that Columbia and not to
Israel in fact not to most of the
countries we give it to because as I
said us eight happens to be correlated
very well with torture I'm not saying
that for the first time I've been saying
it you know all mine articulate life
many decades and with regard to aid to
to what is called foreign aid it ought
to be given to people and needed that
means not to rich people but the
suffering people there's plenty of them
here
there are many suffering much worse in
the third world and that's where our age
should be going not to rich people to
keep them rich
furthermore we should not be giving aid
for oppression we should not be giving
aid for keeping 92 percent of the land
of a country in the hands of a
particular subset of citizens namely
those of Jewish race religion and origin
same with development funds we should
not be giving aid to buy weapons we
should be giving aid to build hospitals
if we were doing those things I'd be in
favor of aid I also made another comment
about USA namely it is the most miserly
in the developed world and that is
intended as a criticism and furthermore
if we take off the what's called aid to
Israel this huge component of it which
shouldn't be called a8 at all because
it's going to a wealthy country for the
wrong for harmful and destructive
purposes then that little bit that's
left puts us totally off the spectrum ok
there's a criticism of foreign aid so if
plenty prisms of it and I will continue
to make those criticisms I think they're
accurate
[Applause]
let me take another well another
question because after the announcement
ends it's alright
please raise your voice I done hit
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I would it is on purpose that I quoted
discrimination done to Israeli colonists
that of course other soldiers in to
point up the discrimination is done to
people who fought in Israeli Arms Wars
and that are still discriminated and
therefore or who people who oppress
other Palestinians still discriminated
and because of this you cannot really
explain in my opinion or if you can I
don't accept your this your argument
that discrimination is done for reasons
of security they are quite enough cases
in which the reason actually increases
insecurity if Palestinian soldier and
the number of Palestinian soldiers who
serve in Israeli army is increasing by
the way this is due to Lee could it was
the Likud defense minister Moshe Arens
who opened the Israeli army in 1992
volunteers of our religion it was the
Labour government which until that time
prohibited Muslims except roses and
Bedouins
to serve in the army so you can count it
a sign of progress but even after this
people who serve in the Israeli armored
discriminated therefore it cannot be
security then Israeli Wars obviously is
last Israeli war the invasion of Lebanon
was purely a war of aggression and was
not was not motivated by any security in
the same way I will say that the world
of - as 56 another example in which
Israel and Elijah with Britain and
France in order to invade Nasser and to
topple Egypt and toppling Assad regime
it was done for ideological or maybe
also impaired a secret
but not done for security in many other
ways it can be shown that Wars in
general they are exceptions of course
they are I am NOT speaking about who
first war in 47 49 whose causes were
complex in many ways but further Israeli
Wars had mostly raisins which had not to
do with security
I accept your point about hatred I
actually didn't say in my presentation
that Israel induced hate Palestinians or
that the discrimination is inflicted out
of hatred they are of course haters but
there but their number is small and they
don't and those who let us say worship
Baruch Goldstein or rabbi al but don't
influence Israeli policy I didn't quote
them except when unser and after some
provocative question but I think that it
is that both in the Jewish case and in
the case of all other groups which
initiate horrifying policies let us say
in case of Arab states who initiated
most of Arab states which initiated
horrifying policies also but all others
said it was not hatred
it was ideology ideology doesn't meet
hatred I do a lot if you will look like
I say I will now specially take a far
away example the inquisitors we know
very much about the inquisitors they
wrote books and letters and people wrote
about them I think no serious scholar
will say the inquisitors were moved to
burn people alive by hatred they
considered that the good of religion and
also the good of society consists in so
harming and minority for the great
benefit of the rest
and I am also saying to you that those
people who are is my end of my
presentation support Jewish tradition /
democracy and therefore discrimination
are in the main not motivated by hatred
are motivated by the same reasons which
is usually not hatred which motivated
other regimes and other groups to
discriminate against other groups for
because they believe they truly belief
in a bad ideology that they adopted and
I will say further that in all in most
of the cases ideological oppression
which caused in so many cases I mention
Inquisition the adoption of a system of
regime which of which Inquisition was a
part role in Spain which was before this
a very flourishing country adoption of
ideology which then initiated a bad
policies of course first brings harms of
the enormous harm and suffering of the
oppressor but I try to show and now in
answer to a question I will bring be
explicit that in my opinion adoption of
this ideology and of this discrimination
will also bring calamity on us I mean we
may differ of course which from this
estimate but this is at least by opinion
yes it you are rides it is ideology of
Inquisition in case of many heretics was
to bring the G heretic to paradise and
if not this heretic by this example of
saving others from paradise
I say it with full understanding also of
course with full enmity they are the
bread ideologies in most cases are not
designed to cause harm I agree it is but
they still are bad and cause suffering
and discrimination I was asked a narrow
question but if you don't want to take
the opportunity to make a comment about
another one which actually is related to
what it's talking about you said that
Israel Israel wants nothing more than to
make peace with its neighbors which is
certainly true but remember that that's
universal everybody wants peace like
Hitler wanted peace and Mahatma Gandhi
wanted peace and everybody wants peace
question is what kind of peace now when
you said make peace with their neighbors
something is being slipped under the rug
there Israel has always wanted to make
peace with the states of the region I
just always wanted that so for example
to take what's been more or less
official Israeli policy since 1968
the alone plan it was designed to make
peace with the states of the region and
to keep Israel in control of substantial
parts of the Gaza Strip the West Bank at
that point was 40% it's now what seventy
five percent or something and
substantial parts of the Gaza Strip and
yes that's what Israel's always wanted
it's wanted to make peace with the
surrounding states but excluding the
Palestinians the Palestinians are to be
as the far the doves in the Foreign
Office said in 1948 either that to be
dispersed or to join to become human
dust and waste and joined the most
impoverished masses in the in the Arab
society and that remains the case the
current peace agreement is tailored to
really demand it's exactly the demand I
mean you know things have changed a
little bit if you look at the borders so
the borders of today are not precisely
those of the alone clan nor but if you
go from the alone plan in 1968 that's
sort of the left up to the Sharan plan
of 1992 which is the far right you will
notice they are all essentially the same
they include in fact we the same two
remarkable detail they always include
friendly relations with all the other
states and the territories remaining
under Israeli control with one exception
they all say that they don't want to
have responsibility for the dense Arab
population areas they want them to be
either stateless or administered by
someone else so Israel doesn't have to
worry about it but they want most of the
usable land they want the resources they
want by now it amounts to
well like seventy five percent of the
West Bank and about 30 percent of the
Gaza Strip at most of the water and so
on that's what they want but not
responsibility for the citizens that's
the kind of peace that has been wanted
from right after the June war up until
today and that's the kind that's been
achieved that's a kind of peace but as I
say everyone wanted peace in a range
including Mahatma Gandhi to Hitler
question is what peace and this
absolutely as long as the Palestinians
got nothing
Israel was perfectly happy about it
absolutely Israel's position Israel's
position from in fact if you want we can
go back to the origins of Zion you won't
go back to the origins of Zionism yeah
let's go back to 19 let's go back to the
first world war when high invites Minh
the leader of the Zionist movement wrote
in internal documents which have now
been publicized that the British had
informed him that there are several
hundred thousand Negroes living in
Palestine but that's a matter of no
significance and we can go on you know
right from there up to the present if
you like but yes their position has
always been that the indigenous
population have no right and that is
please the Palestinians be the palace
first of all they were not the
Palestinians who were in if the the the
Palestinians in the to the west of the
Jordan which is the relevant part were
the ones who have been dispossessed some
of them are in the State of Israel were
they no I'm not I'm answer you accept
that your question the look the state
these are people there is an area in sis
Jordans meaning west of the Jordan on to
go on on to the sea and Israel's
position with regard may I continue look
you you get hall and you give a speech
there's a position of there's sis Jordan
which is the Jordan of the sea and
Israel has had a fairly standard
position with regard to that for a long
time back to the days when they were
told by the British there were a couple
hundred thousand Negroes there but it
didn't matter the idea is that these
couple of thousand hundred thousand
Negroes basically have no rights in the
country where they live now Israel wants
that wants to take that country or a
large parts of it take control of its
resources establish a state which is a
state for the it's not it's not a state
for its citizens notice it's the
sovereign state of the Jewish people
like it's my state but not the state of
an Arab citizen men living in Israel and
uma fathan
and that that's what they wanted to do
it's changed over the years like for
example what we call the West Bank
happens to be half of lapel the original
Palestinian state the other half was
simply taken over by Israel and annexed
nobody even talks about that half and
that was furthermore done in collusion
with Jordan there was an agreement back
then to devote to partitioned the
Palestinian state in 1948 and that's
pretty much what happened coming up to
the present the reason why the United
States why Israel has been able to
pursue and in fact now achieve it's
completely rejectionist program is
because you and I pay for it it's been
US policy US policy has agreed with
Israel that the Palestinians have no
right in their original country only
Israeli Jews do that's the rejectionist
half of the diplomacy that I was
describing and yes in that sense the
u.s. is quite willing to make peace now
turning about the factory yeah
they always intended to take it they all
wait let you read Ben grins diaries read
Ben Gurion Diaries what he said is they
did not but first of all they didn't
well
furthermore I look you I would suggest
it you learn the history you can start
with ben-gurion stories I mean we go way
back if we like but let's go to 1948
when he said you know this is a base for
37 when the fuel Commissioner report was
first gave the first partition
ben-gurion said look we'll take whatever
small state they give us but we'll
continue to conquer we will continue to
conquer and ultimately we'll have a huge
state and in fact if you look at the
boundaries he had in mind
they included southern Lebanon southern
Syria you know society up to Irish I
mean they were all over the place so the
this is the fount that you know the the
founder of the state since then
ambitions have been slightly modified
and the policy slightly changed but the
essence remains the same how the
indigenous population don't have any
rights going back to the earliest
records time vitamin there's a couple
hundred thousand Negroes and their
situations of no significance up till
1948 when the Foreign Office says they
are human dust and they will disperse
along the wastes of society up until the
present when they are not to have the
rights of national self-determination in
any part of their original territory but
yes Israel's delighted to make peace
with its neighbors and always has been
as long as the Palestinians are out of
it turning to the factories the the
question you asked was a rather odd one
and let me read see if I got it straight
because it sounded really strange to me
and I don't want to miss miss state you
I described an incident I described the
case of the u.s. toy manufacturing
industry although this is a parable I
could have talked about a lot more it
happens to be primarily located in
places like southwestern China and
Thailand and so on
where to give the example I mentioned
hundreds of people in the last several
month in the last year or so
have been burned to death in factories
mostly women incidentally because are
the easiest exploitable burned the death
in factories where they were locked in
okay now your question was well am I
saying they shouldn't have any factories
at all
it's alright is that what you said yeah
okay so the choice is yours putting
forward of the following either we build
torture chambers and crematoria or else
we don't have anything and I don't think
those are the only two choices well I
agree then therefore you misstated the
question so now let's state the question
properly oh no I did not that's you're
actually I probably would say something
like that but that's your conclusion and
I would say it but I I would only say it
after documenting it I wouldn't give it
as a blanket comment so I talked about a
specific case namely the toy industry
and people and all of us were going to
avoid toys for Christmas and I pointed
out that those toys are mostly being
produced in hard chambers in places
where people are literally mostly women
locked into factories and then burned to
death if the factory happens to go on
fire now this is true everywhere so like
picks a Haiti okay I was in Haiti not
about a year ago and in Haiti where
there was incidentally no embargo that
was mostly fraud the u.s. broke it right
through in Haiti you find say a lot of
American sports equipment comes from
there like softballs and things bought
by the federal government incidentally
right in the middle of the so-called
embargo they were being produced by by
mostly women again working in factories
for five to ten cents an hour twelve
hour days no toilet facilities and so on
dipping their hands into unprotected
into toxic substances so that the
manufacturers
and advertise as they do here the
American manufacturers that they're
softballs are especially good because
they're specially bonded yeah they're
specially bonded because the women
working for five to ten cents an hour
putting their hands in the toxic
substances well is the choice either
that or nothing no furthermore when we
try to build factories there who we
doing it for are we doing it for the
mevs family the super-rich family that
owns these places or are we doing it for
people like somebody I interviewed when
I was in Haiti so one of the people I
interviewed in fact I was there to talk
to people who are underground you know
on priests in hiding there's a really
period of a really bad repression
priestess in hiding you know activists
hiding out somewhere and sewing one of
the guys I talked to was in fact one of
the leading labor leaders in Haiti he's
a man who I he was sort of limping
around when I saw him he had just been
in police custody where he'd been
practically beaten to death because he
tried to make a statement on a radio but
he's a brave man he was willing to talk
in public with Haitian police meaning
Merck murderers we treat you when I
trained and paid for around there ready
to go after him and he was condemning
those factories now and you can find the
same all through Southeast Asia you for
so you'd say in Indonesia where wages
are half the level of China that is
twice as bad as what I've just described
there's a there's a lively labor
movement trying to rectify these
policies and you and I at least if
you're an American citizen certainly me
are paying taxes which are blocking that
which are paying the security forces are
killing them our president is going to
go there in two weeks and he has already
announced that he will say nothing about
human rights practices so nothing about
the Indonesian workers who are trying to
overcome these conditions so the choice
is not as you put it do we build torture
chambers or nothing the choice is do we
interact with the world in a way that a
human being wouldn't be ashamed of
[Applause]
yes first of all it did have a great
effect only the emigration has ceased
about two years ago the emigration and
by the way to add to comment of non
Chomsky the two billion of guarantees
are actually now sitting in a Swiss bank
and bearing 7% bearing seven percent
because the emigration has stopped but
it is very true that the emigration has
caused two effects one that most of
those people are secular and it is very
true that some of them are not Jews and
some of them have now are now living
religious life in Greek Orthodox Church
yes there are there are no two churches
in Israel who call themselves Jewish
Christian churches one is the Greek
Orthodox as another catolica Church who
say Mass in Hebrew and regardless of
Jewish Catholics but I don't know what
the ideology in government will do with
this but there is another factor which
they cost they are very poor by now
because mr. Robin happens to be the
prime minister who is the most devoted
to the economic ideas of mr. Reagan more
than I will say mr. Samir before him and
more before
[Music]
other Prime Minister let me just point
in substance ation of the fact that
during - and years and few months that
mr. Robbins Prime Minister the average
price price of housing in Israel rose by
56% imagine such a thing happening
because of this you have a conflict
between je jure secularity and are being
objective standard scholarly works and
he points out there that up until the
time he wrote a figure what Europe was
he says all of Israel's capital
formation came from external sources
meaning basically the United States very
I'm little bit from German reparations
but primarily the United States and that
was long before the major contributions
that was before us a so-called aid to
Israel shot up in the 70s in 1978 Jimmy
Carter raised it to literally 50% of
total US aid in fact if you cut out US
aid of the the United States happens to
have B have the the most miserly record
in the developed world in foreign aid
that's literally the case but if you cut
out the aid to Israel a rich country the
US isn't even there it's not like around
Zambia in absolute terms and this but
and this is a huge flow of a there is no
country in the world that gets a
fraction of it sometimes Israel is
called it like a State of the Union but
that's wrong because there is no State
of the Union that even gets a fraction
of the contribution that comes from the
taxpayer to the State of Israel and
that's an enormous factor in their in in
their economic growth I say Safran
called it equivalent the entire capital
formation that that's why Israel's a
rich country
for people to ask their question from
the first step that way by the way my
job soprano hosted a conference
[Music]
yes
Cuba United States and Israel was a to
voting against you didn't allude to who
may or may not have abstained that
that's not important the point is that
the sanctions and condo nations against
Israel that basically what kind of moral
yardstick do you think the United
Nations is when basically it's just a
body of Delegates selected by non
democratically chosen governments driven
obviously by self-interest and not moral
altruism so how can we really judge
Israel or any other country based up
against tomorrow based up against United
Nations resolution but the first
questions that the second one is you
argue that the rich lifestyle of the
Israeli society is essentially supported
by the United States taxpayer we know
that it's something like three billion
dollars a year that the United States
applies to Israel that's about $600 per
capita enough maybe to buy a Nintendo a
nice stereo system if you're not
spending it on defense related cost the
economy in Israel is about seventy
billion dollars it's growing at about
seven percent per year I really don't
see how that's more than just a small
subsidy at this point in time and it
continues to erode with time as well
how can you argue that the Israeli
economy is totally dependent on Israel
support those are my two questions well
the as far as the United Nations is
concerned there were countries that
abstained all of whom condemned the
United States and we don't worry about
the UN we can ask about countries like
Canada England and so on and ask what
their opinion is I don't know if they're
Democratic by your standards but if they
are they bitterly condemned the US the
US embargo and indeed so did George Bush
in fact when the torricelli bill which
is what they're talking about this bill
which was designed to increase the
embargo and to cut out about ninety
percent of what it cut out was out food
and medicine it was vetoed by George it
was proposed by the Liberal Democrats it
was vetoed by George Bush the reason
being it was so obviously contrary to
international law that George Bush was
opposed to it when it came up in the
United Nate was he passed it anyway
because it was outflanked from the right
by Clinton during the 1992 election so
they passed it it was a immediately
condemned
a the Democratic by our Democratic
allies who votes the United States and
El Salvador agreeing objecting to
obeying international law the second
time it came the US today will pick up
one vote Israel and if you want if we
had time I'd go on and on now you know
if your standards are that the only
expression of decent human opinion is
the State of Israel in the US government
yeah you have a position if it's anyone
else if well if it includes for example
the votes of Canada England France other
Germany on and on saying say that you
should uphold international law if it
includes the world court then you're
afraid you're off the wall on the second
issue if you want the first of all they
$600 a year is absolutely not true US
subsidies to Israel amount to at the
very minimum $1,000 per capita Israel
gets more from an S of the minimum if we
don't consider subsidiary costs like for
example one subsidiary cost which is not
counted is contributions to Israel you
can give money to the Jewish National
Fund in the United States and the United
Jewish appeal and that's tax-deductible
meaning everybody in the country pays
for it and that money goes for the kinds
of things that Israel shall was
talking about for example if you look at
the contract of the Jewish National Fund
with the State of Israel originally
signed in 1953 and then renewed what it
says is that that the money that they
spend can be used on quoting for people
of Jewish race religion and origin only
okay that's you American taxpayers are
therefore paying quite substantial sums
to the State of Israel for it to
actually to enough to a quasi official
agency is relaxed to farm out these
activities so that they don't literally
fall under the government which is then
used for the benefit of people of Jewish
race religion and origin and we can go
on with that if you want an
authoritative
analysis of the effect of this from a
very Pro Israeli scholarly source you
can turn to down the river to nod off
saffron
I guess it's originally Israeli judging
but not his Israeli scholar who was a
major Middle Eastern scholar who wrote
one of the sort of standard works on the
United States and Israel would say by
the Western Hemisphere of course the
British ambassador who is usually at the
UN is usually so loyal to the United
States he practically you know but
suspect he gets handed his messages from
Washington he got up and bitterly
condemned that though finally they
abstained they don't like to step on the
toes of the United States that openly so
in fact world opinion on this it goes
from include say Britain Canada
you know George Bush and so on and so
forth but we do we do know we do know
what the we do know the voting record
and we do know what our allies our
Democratic allies felt they bitterly
condemned it because it was so obviously
contrary to international law okay
that's on the on the case of on the case
of the 101 to to vote there was one
country that was willing to stand up
against all of world opinion on this
including the democratic societies
namely our subsidised client and that's
true on case after case for example the
United Nations passed the Security
Council passed a resolution a few years
ago calling on all states to to observe
international law didn't mention any
particular state in question but
everyone know who they meant it was
right after the World Court had ordered
the United States to stop it's as they
put it unlawful use of force meaning in
that international terrorism against
Nicaragua the u.s. of course totally
rejected the the opinion it then went to
the Nicaraguan took it to the Security
Council the United Nations which voted
to call on all states to support
international law the u.s. vetoed it
then went to the to the General Assembly
where there's technically no veto and
the General Assembly passed a resolution
calling on all states to adhere to
international law mentioning no one but
the implication was understood excuse me
a second excuse me a second right you
asked your question now I'm answering it
the US was able to pick up one vote well
actually the first time it came the US
was able to pick up two
