I'm so first chunks you see it obviously
down to your questions the faux pas de
deux of it I'm not very good at press
conferences and just a little bit to the
floor and you can take a pop at the man
I believe is the world's most 42
academic pillow fight okay it's up to
you as funky I wondering what your
opinion all and such overly populist
left-wing agitators such as Michael
Moore on whether they're of any remote
help in the in America today well I
don't exactly know what overlaid
populists means he's trying to reach the
general public that's for sure I think
he's had a very significant way no I
don't know if it's the left he reaches a
general audience just out of curiosity
my food I don't see films much but my
wife and I went to watch Bowling for
Columbine and went purposely to a sort
of lower middle-class working-class
neighborhood see what the react more
interested in the reaction and in the
film and it was interesting I mean in a
way he was mocking their beliefs and
commitments but it was a pretty
fizzy astok audience whether because
entirely clear whether it was because
they were regarding it as satire and not
meaningful or whether they resonated
that what he was saying but he certainly
has has reached the very wide audience
not particularly the left but she's not
talking to told that they like guns but
and of course there's a backlash so
across the spectrum of educated opinion
from what's called left in the United
States like the New York Times which
recently was described as the most
left-wing institution on the face of the
earth by the president's economic
advisor a distinguished economist from
Harvard the so from the New York Times
over too far right there's a they
exploit his exploit him as a way of kind
of undermine anything he's speaking for
actually that's true in England too I
don't read the English breasts regularly
of course but I did happen to be your
last May when the can festival was going
on and I did wonder came close to
winning a prize that was a long
interview with him in one of the British
journals maybe the independent
recall which is a rather derisive
interview and i'll call the author but n
if he made a standard accusations that
were wise and his trustworthy and so on
them the proof that he lies the main
proof that he lies which was kind of
interesting is that he claims to have
come from a working-class background but
his father owned the house and owned the
car so he's lying his father's an auto
worker and he's claiming to come from a
working-class background we've told he
something about not about him but about
England about the way the notion class
has been eliminated from consciousness
so if persons working class he's not
working class if he happens to own a car
which every steel worker does but that's
pretty standard the kind of derision of
his somewhat class-based and somewhat
populist critique what the overall
effect is it's hard to say because the
propaganda is all on the other side so
what reaches readers of the press and
people watch television and so on as the
derision and the fabrication about is
this
untrustworthiness and so on on the other
hand II reached a lot of large audience
so it's a mixed makes to fit yeah thank
you any other questions it just yeah
drunk I want to ask about the Geneva
Accords you have recently and roast them
and I was wondering I mean how do you
see them as being any different from
what all the apartheid solution of the
peace process considering that the right
of return is given away yet the
settlements are not dismantled either
and I'm more importantly even the
resources in terms of water and all
these important resources I mean right
through the first of all I wouldn't call
the peace process it's unclear which
mean by the peace process but if what
you mean is the international consensus
of the last roughly 30 years on a
two-state settlement on the
international border if that's what you
mean let it be suppresses then the
Geneva Accords are fairly for close
approximation to it instantly I didn't
endorse them but I suggested is that
they are very appropriate basis for
negotiation which is why the United
States unilaterally and alone opposes a
Palestinian support them Israeli does
support on the Europe support some US
has blocked them and so therefore
they're out of discussion but there are
a sort of a natural evolution of the
negotiations that have been going
forward towards some sort of settlement
roughly an accord with the international
senses the actual proposals at the
Geneva Accords the wording which on the
right of return is ambiguous should be
negotiated and I think can be fixed I
don't really think that's the issue
because on the right of return there
really is no disagreement across the
board at least among people who care
about the refugees a fact of the matter
is the refugees are not going to return
the user except for a symbolic number
for quite a long time and it's possible
but the end of a long process of
accommodation and interaction and social
and political change there might be a
possibility but in the near term
foreseeable future it's simply deeply
immoral to dangle in front of suffering
people the belief that they're going to
get something which they never going to
get there is no international support
for the right of eternity is real isn't
very little Palestinian support at the
political as long as I try to be
realistic and if any support ever
developed which is hard to imagine
Israel would use its ultimate weapons to
prevent it meaning it could be nobody
left so therefore to tell the refugees
we're going to get help you at the right
of return is simply deeply immoral it's
not a proper way to deal with the
suffering of people who are really
living in misery they should not abandon
the right of return I think that's
correct just as the people who used to
live where I live and were mostly
exterminated by scotch-irish colonists
they have a right of return to but
they're not trying to achieve it so the
right of return is legitimate but
implementation of the right is a
different question could happen over a
long
purity but if we're serious it's not
going to it can't be an option for
negotiation now the serious issue is the
territorial where's the boundaries and
on that the Geneva Accords come closer
to the international consensus than
anything so far I mean the first ones
that call for a moderately serious
one-to-one land swap which means a
settlement roughly on the border with
some give either way and that's that's
actually the proposals that these are
the proposals that have been on the
international agenda for 30 years PLO
except to the Arab states except them
just reiterating them a couple of days
ago Europe Latin America essentially
ever the they're not perfect you know
but but that as a basis for negotiations
I think they're very sensible which is
precisely why the United States and
Israel unilaterally reject any other
questions in the UK do you think it's
more a part of the European community of
our an extension of America illness
another American state that's up to
Europe in you've got your fate in your
own hands you know Europe is a powerful
part of the world it's a comparable to
the United States or beyond it and just
that every dimension accept military
force which really doesn't matter in
most of these issues I so it's up to
Europeans whether they would like to be
sort of dependent clients of the US
military power were whether they would
like to join the large majority of
American public opinion which happens to
be strongly opposed to just about every
policy the US government if you look at
us public opinion it would it's very
similar to European public opinion on
just about every issue so when you talk
about the United States you're really
talking about us the u.s. bipartisan
very narrow bipartisan media elite
consensus just very remote from the
population and Europeans have to simply
say well which America my interested in
the America that's in favor of the Kyoto
Protocol that's against the use of force
and international affairs that wants to
join the international criminal court
that is in favor of spending on social
issues and not military and so on that's
the large majority of the population so
europeans can decide to i want to be
connected with them where do i want to
be connected with a lead power which has
succeeded in largely marginalizing the
population so that the political system
is completely dysfunctional failed state
denied respect and that's that's a
choice that your hands after me I mean
Britain has historically made the choice
of being us attack dog basically but you
know that's a choice not a necessity
guess he can't answered like to come
into the first time
do you think the best way forward for
something that bubble gums are sorry
what you think these are basically
forward for the left if it's a remote
proper gonna butt up against a lack of a
mass media outlet to represent the point
of view if you're thinking that carried
out at war under the misinformation on
weapons of mass destruction human rights
abuses I'm very hard to get your point
of your cross because I media switch
tightly controlled respect you know the
media overwhelmingly are instruments of
concentrated private state power so
they're doing their job I mean should
criticize it the not surprised by it I
mean any more than you should be
surprised by the fact that a major
corporation is trying to raise profit I
mean you can see you can be critical if
this that thing they're doing but not of
their policies I even be critical in
existence of the institution but that's
a little different right as for what the
best way forward for the left is I think
it's to recognize that the left is
really the center if you take unlike my
opinions I suspect probably worth of
ammonia in the United States and in
England I haven't seen poles in England
but I so much the same the United States
is very heavily pulled so we know a lot
of public opinion I'm right in the
ministry in fact in many respects the
public opinion goes beyond what I would
have said I mean I agree with it but
like for example majority of the public
in the United States I think that the
u.s. ought to give up the veto of the
United Nations and follow majority
decision I mean that is so remote from
discussion but you know it sounds like
it's from Mars well nobody could say
that or wednesday but it is the majority
of public
and it's the same on other issues I mean
say take the Kyoto Protocol Justin
others you read in the press that you're
through that the United States didn't go
a lot of rejected the kyoto protocol's
unilaterally everyone else agreed that's
true only in a very peculiar sense now
if you really despise democracy with
passion it's true the US government
didn't vote against it but the American
public is very strongly in favor of so
if the public is part of the United
States it's not true that the u.s.
opposed the public in fact is so
strongly in favor of it that a majority
of Bush voters assumed that he was in
favor of because it's such an obvious
thing to be in favor of and the same
goes through an issue after issue and
take just pure domestic issue so the
federal budget just came out a couple of
weeks ago you go through the federal
budget what it expanded what it cut and
so on if you look at public opinion
which is carefully study it's exactly
the opposite on every issue every issue
run through it if the legend says X
public says not X dramatically and in a
country where the public has been
largely excluded from the political
arena like the United States or England
to a large extent it sort of doesn't
matter on the meeting on recording
