on Monday over 2300 people packed into
the historic Riverside Church in New
York City to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of democracy now it was a
momentous occasion in part because it
marked the first time Noam Chomsky and
Harry Belafonte appeared on stage
together in conversation the two have
been longtime champions of social
justice Noam Chomsky is a world-renowned
political dissident linguist author who
gained fame in the 60s for his critique
of the Vietnam War in u.s. imperialism
he's Institute professor emeritus at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
where he's taught for more than half a
century Harry Belafonte is a longtime
civil rights activist immensely popular
singer and activist actor he was one of
Martin Luther King's closest confidants
and helped organize the march on
Washington in 1963 Democracy Now is Juan
Gonzalez and I sat down with Noam
Chomsky and Harry Belafonte on Monday at
Riverside Church now I just want to
start off by saying you have just
witnessed an historic moment is this the
first time Harry unknown that you have
met it's not the first time we met but
it's the first time we've shared a
platform together
it's a bit overwhelming a little
intimidating to sit with so much
knowledge and sensitivity anyway it's
nice to be with all of you so we have
this opportunity to talk with the two of
you at this critical juncture in US
history and the world Harry back in 40
before you went off to war you were
banned from the Copacabana as an African
American you come back in your
headlining there as one of the world's
great entertainers and musicians you
marched in Selma with dr. King and
whenever one of his closest confidants
Noam you marched against the Vietnam War
you thought you'd be spending years
maybe decades in jail even as you were
rising in your academic career at MIT
willing to give up everything you two
giants of many movements your thoughts
today in the age of Donald Trump defer
to you
[Applause]
I must admit that I had far more
commitment to the belief that in the
final analysis I met our extreme things
might be in America that eventually our
citizens would rise up and righteously
stop the enemy at the gate if not in
fact with them in retreat and each time
certain events took place we met the
horror and the terror not only I
referenced before the Sun I noticed when
I mentioned the fourth right wasn't
quite sure what I was talking about for
just for clarity uh as you know that the
last great cobalt torment was the Nazi
era was called the Third Reich and I
thought that we Authority cleansed
ourselves of that encounter and that we
would be much more resilient I think to
a degree we do it reveal some resilience
but the real test has not yet come until
the inaugural transference has taken
place and what concerns me is that uh
beyond the mischief of Trump and all
those in his cabinet and the people that
he's appointed into roles of leadership
I had never quite understood that we had
another severe unattended enemy
and that was our species commitment or
[Music]
weakness in the face of absolute greed I
think we have failed to come to circle
side conclusions because we have been so
contaminated with possessions and power
are being forgotten that da we have
destroyed our children or set the tone
for that I would welcome professor
Chomsky's point of view what I hope he
says something that'll make me dance out
of here well I should say that I was
somewhat immunized to the Trump
electoral college victory of course not
popular victories you know by the fact
that my wife was the only person I knew
who even before the Republican primaries
predicted that Trump was known a win
looking at the country somewhat from the
outside she's from Brazil and felt that
somehow she had her finger on the pulse
of a large part of the country and was
confident that this was going to happen
so I wasn't all that surprised or I
think it's extremely dangerous in many
ways like the ones I mentioned and
others that you're quite familiar with
on the other hand there's plenty of
opportunities we should bear in mind
that the country has become much more
civilized in the past 50 or 60 years a
meeting like this could not have been
conceivable in 1960 to 1970
the kinds of commitment and engagement
that you and many others like you are
committed to is something quite new and
there have been many advances and
achievement women's rights civil rights
generally rights of gays opposition to
aggression wave environmental concerns
didn't even exist at that time there's
been tremendous progress that means that
struggles today start from a much higher
plane than they did not many years ago
at the time when Harry was marching in
Selma it was a much harsher world than
it is today
the reason is that plenty of people did
commit themselves to constant dedicated
struggle and there were plenty of
achievements and that goes back in
American history no need to review it
but the earlier period is one of total
horror I mean after all the country was
founded unto incredible crimes
unbelievable crimes that one expert
virtual extermination of the indigenous
population it's kind of a migrant crisis
of the kind we don't think about the day
and a form of slavery which was the most
vicious in history and is in fact the
basis for a large part of the wealth and
economic development
the United States England France and
others that's history when Donald Trump
talks about making the country great
again for many people it wasn't that
great quite the opposite
but the point is there has been plenty
of progress because people people facing
much harsher conditions than we do
didn't give up that's an important
lesson furthermore even the election
itself suggests major opportunities for
one thing as you know the Democrats
actually had a considerable majority of
the vote and if you look at the younger
voters the people who will shape the
future
they were overwhelmingly addy Trump and
even more overwhelmingly Pro Sanders
we should also bear in mind what a
remarkable phenomenon the Sanders
campaign here's somebody unknown came
from nowhere practically no one country
knew who he was he was using words like
socialism which used to be a real curse
word nope no corporate support no media
support no support from the wealthy
everything that has always been crucial
to winning elections mostly we have
bought elections had none of it and
practically took over one of the two
major parties that could have taken it
over if they hadn't been fishin as you
know
[Applause]
it was primarily driven by young people
all of these are very hopeful signs
means there are plenty of things that
can be done there are opportunities that
can be grasped and no time to run
through them but there are plenty of
them and it's really very much in our
hands and among the younger of you in
your hands to carry us forward in this
long path long arduous path towards
trying to create a civilized society in
a decent world MIT professor and
political dissident Noam Chomsky and
world-renowned entertainer and activist

it was a packed house over 2300 people
this is democracy now democracynow.org
I'm Amy Goodman we return now to this
historic conversation between MIT
professor world-renowned political
dissident Noam Chomsky and Harry
Belafonte known around the world as an
entertainer and an activist they never
appeared on stage together in
conversation before Juan Gonzalez and I
interviewed them together I'd like to
ask both of you there's been a lot of
discussion in in recent weeks about the
role of workers or the working-class in
this election of Trump's supposed appeal
to white workers and Harry you know that
the civil rights movement as it was as
it was growing and developing needed and
was a fueled as well by progressive
unions like 1199 and the Auto Workers
and others that gave it strength and
organization and resources i wondering
how you're looking at this issue because
moment you mentioned all the young
people the problem is that the young
people the so-called creative classes
are increasingly concentrating in the
big cities they're in seattle and
they're in chicago and they're in New
York and and then the issue then is what
happens in the rest of the country you
know back in the 60s and 70s we used to
say you got to go back out and organize
organizing the communities from which
you came from how do you see this whole
analysis of the quote loss of the
working-class to sort of progressive
politics that you're hearing in the
commercial and the corporate press well
take a look again at the last few
elections in too many of the Trump
voters among the white working-class
voted for Obama they were deluded by the
slogans of the campaign you may recall
that the 2008 campaign was based on the
slogan Hope and Change well many people
voted and rightly for hope and change
the working class has suffered not
disastrously but severely from the
neoliberal policies of the past
generation pretty much from 1979 so if
he looks say just take the two thousand
seven the peak of what economists were
calling the economic miracle right
before the crash 2007 American workers
had real wages lower considerably lower
than in 1979 before these policies were
instituted they lost it listened to Alan
Greenspan who during the height of the
euphoria over the economy was called
Saint Alan in the greatest economist of
all time he testified to Congress
explaining the basis for the success of
the economy that he was running he said
it was based on growing worker
insecurity growing worker insecurity
meaning if workers are beaten down
enough intimidated enough and if their
organizations their unions are
sufficiently destroyed that they can't
ask for higher wages and for decent
benefits
then it's good for the economy creates a
healthy economy by some measure we know
the measure well all of this has
happened and the working class has
suffered from it they had a real need
for hope and change well they didn't get
hope and they didn't get change
I don't usually agree with Sarah Palin
but I think she she nailed it when she
asked at one point where's all this hope
e changing business there wasn't any
so no hope no change already it showed
very quickly in midterm and future
elections this election a con man came
along and is offering hope and change
and they're voting for it suppose that
people like you the people who form the
Sanders movement would present an
authentic constructive program for real
hope and change it would win these
people back I think many of the Trump
voters
many of the trope Trump voters could
have voted for Sanders if there have
been the right the right kind of
activism and organization and those are
possibilities it's been done in the past
under much harsher circumstances
organizing white working people in
Indiana is a lot easier than what the
Freedom Riders tried to do in the south
60 years ago much easier takes work but
it can be done my feeling is that a core
part of a progressive program is to
rebuild the organized structure of the
labor movement which all throughout
modern history has been in the forefront
of progressive change and that's not
impossible either it's been beaten down
pretty severely in the past generation
but it's been worse before they go back
to the 1920s a period which is not
unlike today in many ways the Gilded Age
you know the the labor movement was
virtually destroyed
Wilson Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare
practically wiped it out there had been
a militant activist labor movement there
was nothing left of it in the 1920s by
the 1930s it revived militant labor
action organization of the CIO overcame
racist conflicts laid the basis for the
New Deal programs which were highly
beneficial to the extent that they
remain they remain beneficial that can
happen again no reason why it can't well
in a moment Patti Smith is going to be
coming out on the stage to share her
talents but I wanted to wrap up with
Harry you know democracy now originally
came out of Pacifica radio which was
five stations WBAI in New York among
them and KPFT in Houston and KPFT is the
only radio station in the country whose
transmitter was blown up it was a few
weeks after it went on the air in 1970
blown up by the Ku Klux Klan and when
they got back on their feet and rebuilt
the Klan blew it up again strapped 15
times the dynamite to the base of the
transmitter and it took months to get
back on the air after that and I can't
remember was the Grand Dragon or the
exalted Cyclops because I often confuse
their titles but he said it was his
proudest act as he understood how
dangerous pacifica how dangerous
independent media is for people to speak
for themselves that's a story of history
though who would have thought in 2016
we'd be talking about the Ku Klux Klan
today when President when Donald Trump
was asked whether he would disavow David
Duke support you know he hesitated he
said he'd have to find out more from
David Duke or the Klan which you know
exactly who it was who is supporting him
maybe the only time he hesitated before
he spoke you know what was at which Klan
chapter he wanted to know in the United
States it was to make a decision but
what about this what about Donald Trump
the Ku Klux Klan
and the messages that he is constantly
putting out to lure more voters and
support I believe in Trump and bringing
a new energy to the realization of the
the vastness of the reach of the Ku Klux
Klan is uh not something that has been
out of the our basic purview of thought
the Ku Klux Klan for some of us is a
constant it has a constant existence it
isn't until it touches certain aspects
of white America that white America all
of a sudden it wakes up to the fact that
there's something called the Klan and it
does it's mr.
what causes me to have great thought is
something that's most unique to my
experience and as I said earlier tonight
at the doorstep of being 90 years of age
I had thought I had seen it all and done
it all only to find out that in 89 I
knew nothing but the most peculiar thing
to me has been the absence the black
presence in the middle of this
resistance not just the skirmishes that
we've seen in Ferguson and black lives
matter and I think those protests and
those voices being raised are extremely
important
but we blew this thing a long time ago
when they started the purge against
communism in this country and against
the voice of those who saw hope in a
design for socialist theory and for the
sharing of wealth and for the quality of
humankind when we abandon our visual a
visa our vision and vigils
on that topic I think we sold out
ourselves
a group of young black students in
Harlem just a few days ago asking what
at this point in my life was I looking
for and I said what I've always been
looking for where resides the rebel
heart without the rebellious heart
without people who understand that
there's no sacrifice he can make that is
too great to retrieve that which we've
lost we will forever be distracted with
possessions and trinkets and title and I
think one of the big things that
happened was that when black people
began to be anointed by the trinkets of
this capitalist society and began to
become big-time players and began to
become heads of corporations they became
players in the game of our own demise
and although I believe that the
professor chompy's Chomsky's evaluation
is a valid and a basis for great thought
I am looking at the victories that we're
having like a wandering just you see it
a few days ago Native American brothers
the fact that our Native American
brothers and sisters are stopped the
engine for a moment
is really a call for us to be reminded
that the engine can be stopped
and therein I find ah solace there and I
find the capacity to really do things
and create things that will make a
difference to you it appears we appear
to be headed ah I think people have to
be more adventurous the heart has to
find great a space for rebellion so
we pay a penalty for such thought
because I just recently reminded of
Florida goodman chaney
they sit ticularly close to my own
feelings and thoughts because I was one
of the voices that was raised in
recruiting those young students to
participate in our rebellion David
Goodman Andrews brother is here today
I'm sure that he's always at the right
places but I think that there are those
kinds of extremes that will be
experienced in the struggle but the real
nobility of our existence is how we
prepare to pay that price and I think
once the opposition understands that we
are quite prepared to die for what we
believe in
that death for a Cause does not just sit
with Isis but sits of people workers
Devo genuinely prepared to push against
the theft of our nation and the
distortion of our Constitution and that
for many of us no price is too great for
that charge
and we have great history to call upon I
mentioned a few before but we still got
a few left and I want to just take this
opportunity cause I know we're winding
down to just say to you Amy and do you
John that I've been through much in this
country I came back from the Second
World War and while the world rejoiced
and the fact that Hitler had been met
and defeated there were solvers who were
touched by the fact that instead of
sitting at the table feast at that great
victory we were worried about our lives
because the response from many in
America was the murder of many black
servicemen that came back and we were
considered to be dangerous because we've
learned the capacity to handle weaponry
we had faced death in the battlefield
every we came back we had an expectation
as the victors he came back knowing that
yes we might afford to end Hitler they
also fought for our right to vote in
America
and that in the pursuit of such rights
came the civil rights movement well that
can happen again we just have to get out
our own coats dust them off stop
screwing around and just chasing the
good times and get down to business
there's some ask and I had to be done
[Applause]
