well no thank you so much for welcoming
us here well I didn't have a chance to
talk to you thanks work here as on
behalf of the some progressive
University of Catalonia and as I
mentioned to you he's intent of
recovering the history of Catalonia when
workers and academics got together in
the summer to be able to discuss things
of the day
that was of course forbidden during the
dictatorship and then when in hunt in
2003 the left-wing parties recovered
government they renew again this
commitment and that we wanted to have
you there you could not make it but we
still hope that you'll be able to make
it someday so I wanted to chat about you
and also about United States because you
are indeed the best-known intellectual
abroad and sometimes people outside the
United States not fully aware what it
means that the best-known intellectual
our United States abroad does not appear
very frequently in the visual medium so
when we watch the TV CBS NBC and the
male channels you are not there and that
many people do not realize that because
the United States is frequently idolized
as extremely dynamic active democracy
and they not fully realize how this
accumulated bellary's within United
States how do you respond to that how do
you explain that well I should say the
place where I am most feared and
despised is probably left liberal
intellectual circles actually if you
want to see a graphic indication of this
you can take a photograph of one of my
favorite newspaper journal covers which
is
framed them posted right outside the
door it's the Journal of smallest the
Official Journal of left liberal
intellectuals American Prospect and the
cover depicts the terrible circumstances
in which they try to survive the
enormous forces that are virtually
destroying them if you look at the
picture there are two figures depicted
two faces a sneering angry on one side
is Dick Cheney and the Pentagon on the
other side is me you know they're caught
between these two huge forces it's
indicative of the paranoia and the
concern that there might be some small
break in orthodoxy the liberal
intellectuals typically are the it's not
just in the United States the kind of
guardians of at the gates you go this
far but not one millimeter farther and
it's terrifying to think that somebody
might do a millimeter farther and that
extends over the major media - so yes
it's a very free country in fact it's
the freest country in the world
I don't think freedom of speech for
example is protected anywhere in the
world as much as it is here but it's a
very managed society it's a business or
in society that carefully managed strict
doctrinal requirements no deviation from
them and tolerated it's too dangerous
and one of the reasons it's too
dangerous is that the political
establishment both political parties the
political class on many major issues
they're well to the right of the
population health care for example which
you've written about for decades the
population is to the left of the
establishment has been forever and the
same is true of many other issues so
permitting issues to be discussed is
threatening and permitting a deviation
from kind of a party line is dangerous
has to be carefully controlled so yes a
very free country at the same time very
rigid ideology yes
but surprising because from outside
impressing that many our European
colleagues in academia see United States
as a very servant stable political
system and in that respect there was one
thing that it was such a powerful
dominant class one of the things they
could afford so having more freedom and
have more critical voices in the media
ask you liked it that would be afraid of
if they are there for this terrible fear
that photograph indicates it and the
fear is slight deviation may lead the
disaster it's a typical to talk Terran
mentality
you have to control everything if
anything is out of control it's a
disaster and in fact the stability the
society is not so obvious so for example
a few and if that requires a lot of
suppression so take say that the
Pentagon Papers are quite interesting in
this respect these Pentagon Papers are
not declassified documents it's like
stealing the Ark and conquering a
country and stealing its archives it
wasn't intended for the public and there
are a few interesting things in it which
are suppressed the most interesting is
what happened is that the account at the
very end of the Pentagon Papers that
period they cover ends in mid-1968 right
after the Tet Offensive 19 in January
1968 which convinced the business
classes that the worst too costly it's
not worth pursuing
but those next few months there was an
attempt by the government to send an
extra 200,000 troops to Vietnam should
have raised it to practically
three-quarters of a million and there
was a debate and it's discussed there
and they decided not to do it and the
reason is that they feared that they if
they did they would need the troops for
civil disorder control in the United
States because there would be an
uprising of unprecedented proportions
among young people women minorities of
the poorer and so on they barely had it
under control and any move
- uprising and it continues you just
cannot let the population out of control
they have to be tightly disciplined one
of the reasons for the extraordinary
pressure of consumerism goes back to the
1920s is the recognition by the business
world that unless they atomized people
unless they drive them to what they call
the the superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption the population
may turn on them I mean right now for
example about 80% of the population
believes that the country and their
words is run by a few big interests
looking out for themselves not for the
benefit of the population about 95% of
the population thinks that the
government ought to pay attention to
public opinion the degree of a donation
from institutions is enormous but as
long as people are atomized worried
about maxing out the credit cards
separated from one another don't here
syrupy the serious critical discussion
wealth of idea they can be construed no
another thing that happens is an
idealization of the American system now
with the primaries that they have been
shown as a sign of vitality of this
democracy and here you have or the Obama
phenomena that in some way the masses
have mobilized and putting him forward
that is so contrary to that reality but
how do you explain these idealization of
the American political scene that is so
common in Europe the people have the
illusions you have to ask what's the
source of their illusions but it's clear
what's happening and the establishment
understands it very well so for example
there's one day it's called Super
Tuesday the February 5th there's a
couple of dozen primaries so big
excitement take a look at the Wall
Street Journal
it's a front-page story on Super Tuesday
big headline over the front pages issues
recede in 2008 election voters prefer
character well
issues didn't actually receive because
they were never there they're carefully
kept out of sight by the party managers
but it's true that they're in the
background and it's not that the voters
prefer character voters would be
perfectly happy to vote for the national
healthcare system that they wanted for
decades it's just that those things
aren't options the party managers were
basically the public relations industry
that sells commodities on television
they market candidates the same way they
market commodities you see an ad on
television you don't expect to learn
anything from it if we had a free-market
General Motors would post on television
the characteristics of the cars they're
selling they don't do that what they do
is try to create illusions complicated
graphics famous actress rock driving up
to heaven or something like that
the point is to delude and marginalize
the public when you market candidates
it's the same thing
want to keep away from issues too
dangerous public doesn't agree with you
on issues so what you have is the
character trivialities personal issues
did his pastor say something did Clinton
make a mistake when she talked about
Bosnia you know anything but the issues
so the population just didn't know what
the issues are and this is quite
miserable popular opinion in the United
States is a very well-studied
mainly because the business classes who
run the country want to have their
finger on the public pulse they gonna
control and propaganda if you can't
control people's attitudes and opinions
if they know a lot about them so we know
a lot about public opinion and it say in
the last election 2004 I think about 10%
of Bush voters even newest positions on
it
not because they're stupid or
uninterested but because the elections
are a marketing system there it is it's
a business run Society you market
commodities you market candidates the
public are the victims and they know it
that's why 80% think more or less
accurately that the country is run by a
few big interests looking after
themselves so they're not diluted they
just don't really see any choices now
the Obama phenomenon is an interesting
reaction to this Obama's handlers you
know the campaign managers have created
an image which is essentially a blank
slate the Obama campaign is the words
our hope change a unity can totally
vacuous slogans said by a nice person
looks for the talks nice and you can
write anything you like on that blank
slate and a lot of people are writing on
it their hopes for progressive change of
a basis for it in the campaign as The
Wall Street Journal correctly said
issues receive its character that's
upfront but yes it is a popular
phenomenon and I think it reflects the
alienation of the population from the
institution's they're grasping at a
straw here's a possibility that made
