allegedly our election oh the meddling
of Russia in our elections that has most
of the world cracking up and laughter
you know it's just a joke I mean
literally I'm suppose every charge is
correct let's say the most severe
charges are correct it's not even a joke
as compared with what we do constantly
like just take a minor example what we
do with Russian elections in the early
90s when Yeltsin was Clinton's favorite
he was supposed to be the you know the
the guy the hope for the future when he
destroyed the Parliament and overthrew
the formal democratic system he was
strongly supported by the United States
in 1996 when he was extremely unpopular
for pretty good reasons because the the
shock treatment the sort of free-market
policies imposed by American advisors
just wiped out the economy and led to
the death of millions of people it was
highly destructive I led to the rise of
you know the oligarchs many of them
former apparatchik and the communist
system who stole the resources it was a
total disaster and Yeltsin was the
symbol of it Clinton moved in very
extensive quite openly there wasn't
nothing secret about it very openly with
everything from loans to advice to
direct involvement to try to make sure
that our fair-haired boy one that's 1996
and these are minor examples I'm the
kind of thing we do constantly just
overthrow the government
you know institute a military
dictatorship and not in the distant past
and it just happened under Obama in 2009
in Honduras
there was a mildly reformist govern
the you know the tiny a lead of
super-rich who run the country didn't
like it he was kicked out in a military
coup the United States is one of the
very few countries that supported it and
claimed that the election taken place
under a military dictatorship was
legitimate
it's basically supporting a military
coup to overthrow parliamentary
government is that meddling in the
election you know it just goes on and on
like this that's a so as I say this is
just making the United States kind of a
laughingstock in the world even if every
single charge is correct most of them
have no basis
