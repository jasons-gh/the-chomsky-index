what are your voice on this Odin affair
and the NSA's our global surveillance
programs
I mean my own opinion is that Snowden
should be honored and here's doing
whatever's it is in order to tell him he
was telling Americans what the
government is doing that's what's
supposed to happen the garments as I
mentioned before always plead security
no matter what's going on the reflexive
defense is security but anyone who's
looked at first of all you take a look
at what he exposed at least anything
that's been published it's not any kind
of a threat to security with one
exception the security of the government
from its own population and in fact if
you look at anyone who's spent any time
poring through Declassified records you
have so many of you have you find that
overwhelmingly the security is the
security of the state from its own
population that's why things have to be
kept secret this are some cases where
there's authentic security concerns
would be pretty limited the plant the US
government in this case for the
surveillance and so on is that it's
security against terror but at the very
same moment the US policy is designed in
a way to increase terror them in the
u.s. itself is carrying out the most
awesome international terrorist campaign
ever I suppose the growing Special
Forces campaign that's a major terrorist
campaign all over the world and it's
also generating terrorists then you can
read that and you
that from the highest sources young
general mcchrystal scholars and also on
of course the drone campaign is creating
potential terrorists and you can easily
understand why no but if you are walking
through the streets of Geneva and you
don't know whether five minutes from now
there's going to be an explosion across
the street it's run a couple thousand
miles away and blow away some people and
whoever else happens to be around your
terrorist and you don't like it and you
may decide to react and that's happening
all over the regions that are subjected
to the Obama terrorking thing so you
can't seriously on the one hand mean not
only carrying out massive terror but
even the generating potential terrorists
against yourself and then claim that we
have to have massive surveillance to
protect ourselves against terror well
that's the joke should be headlines but
so this is what then comes the quick
there comes the interesting question of
extradition the US has just announced
again that they're going to punish
anybody who refuses to extradite Snowden
at the same time the US has wonderful
leaders in refusing extradition Bolivia
is an interesting case the US was want
to know impose pressure at least to try
to how much pressure we don't know but
pressure to try to block the Bolivian
plane because they want Snowden
extradited for years Bolivia has been
trying to extradite from the United
States the former president who's
already indicted in Bolivia for all
sorts of crimes us refuses tax
that's happening right in Europe Italy
has been trying to extradite 22 CIA
agents who were involved in an in fact
indicted for participating in a
kidnapping in Milan they kidnapped
somebody sent him off i think to Egypt
to be tortured the breed later he was
innocent but it's to extradite two
people involved the use of course
refuses and there's case after case like
this like don't waste your time on it
but there are a lot of cases where the
u.s. just refuses if I wanted the most
striking cases is Latin America again
not just the Bolivian that one of the
world's leading terrorists is luis
posada he was involved in the blowing up
a Cubana airliner which kills only three
people and lots of other terrorist acts
he's sitting happily in Havana in the
Miami his colleague or lon de Bush also
the major terrorist usually died was
happily their country a Cuba and
Venezuela are trying to extradite them
but you know that chance so for the u.s.
to be calling for others to extradite
Snowden's let's say a little ironic
he had lunch
