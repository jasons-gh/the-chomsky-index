the great humanist and linguist the
villain from humble the woods described
the core property of language as
infinite use of finite means that
comment has been frequently quoted often
misunderstood there's a crucial
ambiguity that could not be articulated
maybe not comprehended in his day it
didn't matter very much time given the
state of the art but it's of personal
significance today and we have to attend
to it
humble referred to the use of language
investigation of that topic the use of
language rich is far beyond the effort
to understand the nature of the means
that are employed when we carried out
that use the gap is enormous you can see
how great it is if you pay attention to
what has been achieved in the course of
the intense and productive enquiries of
the past years and what remains is
shrouded and mystery that has remained
impenetrable for centuries and perhaps
always will
yielding some insights into the what may
be essential the limitations of the
human capacity for understanding my mid
twentieth century the progress in
mathematics and logic that had provided
a quite general understanding for
precise understanding
of how a an infinite system can be
characterized by finite means rather in
the way that you cludes
axioms yield proofs of an infinite
number of theorems of geometry although
it's worth bearing in mind that even
this classical special case was not
fully clarified until about a century
ago by the 1950s the general problem was
very well understood my clothes are
sorry they say every computer is based
on these principles the and it's it also
became possible for the first time to
apply such ideas to the study of human
language and by so doing to address at
least a part of home bolts in sight but
it's important to stress only a part the
linguistic counterpart to the axioms of
geometry or arithmetic would be a system
of rules that determines the sound and
meaning of each of the expressions of a
particular language so for example the
expression that I'm now producing and
infinitely many others there's clearly
no limit on the length complexity of
sentences that can in principle be
expressed and interpreted by a speaker
of a language given sufficient time and
memory just as there's no limit on the
of the size of the numbers that a person
can add in principle but there's an
immense gap separating knowledge of the
rules and ability to use them in any
reasonable way is that we're not the
case number theory in geometry would be
trivial subjects they would reduce the
ability to memorize a short list of
rules instead of being among the most
difficult and significant to
sophisticated areas of human thought
with plenty of unknown truths may be
permanently unknown proving a theorem is
a creative act and the same is true at
some level of the sensible use of
linguistic expressions that was the
question that concerned humbled when he
spoke of infinite use of finite means
several centuries earlier with the same
question deeply concerned Descartes
that effect played a central role in
Cartesian philosophy we call philosophy
basically science Descartes took his
main task to be to provide foundations
for what we call physics or was then
called the mechanical philosophy the
founding doctrine of modern science it
held that the world is a machine
basically a machine of the kind that was
being constructed by the master artisans
the day quite remarkable machines which
stimulated the
imagination of the 17th century that
much as computers do today but they cart
believed that he had essentially solved
this problem but he recognized that
there were phenomena that in the
universe that transcended the limits of
the mechanical explanation that the most
striking example the one that he
presented as his primary example that
was in fact ordinary use of language
that is the ability of every human but
no animal or machine regarded as
machines the the ability of humans to
use language as in fact we all do
routinely producing expressions that are
new in our experience perhaps new in
history of the language but that are
appropriate to situations but not caused
by them for short distinction and that
our independent of any detectable
internal state that is with the internal
state and the circumstances fixed you
could decide to talk about the weather
or Cartesian science or any other topic
and we somehow know though how is a
mystery which utterances are appropriate
to particular situations that even
though not caused by them and in fact
the difference between appropriateness
to situations and caused by situations
including internal states that
fundamental it establishes the
difference between the dose the divide
between humans on the one hand and the
rest of the universe on the other
machines and animals which again the
Cartesians regarded as complex machines
incapable of free independent and
creative action as all humans are apart
from severe pathology it could perhaps
be mentioned that the similar ideas why
behind the libertarian concepts that
were developed by Rousseau Humboldt is
one of the founders of classical
liberalism and others they took for
granted the idea that cartesian idea
that creative capacity is at the core of
human nature and they hence concluded
quite plausibly that any social
educational economic political system
that represses or controls that creative
capacity is fundamentally illegitimate
and from that developed the libertarian
concepts that we know the same concerns
the lie behind Adam Smith's
a very sharp critique of division of
labor is far less known than the past
is that one reads in school where he
extols the its contributions much later
on and The Wealth of Nations he condemns
division of labor because he says it
will turn human beings into the most
stupid and ignorant creatures that one
can imagine that adds that in any
civilized society the state will have to
intervene to prevent this atrocity that
you don't read in school it's there and
arise from the same from the same
concept parties and concepts that
entered the Enlightenment then there's a
rich resonance beyond until the present
interesting to pursue it but with carry
us to for our field here welcoming back
that Descartes he was working scientist
and accordingly to account for what lies
beyond the limits of mechanism he had to
introduce a new principle kind of
creative principle in the metaphysics of
his day that meant a new substance race
toget Don's mind the new principle then
was a second substance and the thinking
substance which is distinct from body
physical material the first substance
governed by mechanical principles of the
scientific problem that Descartes
considered and others that the cart and
others considered was
forward it was determined to determine
the character of this newly discovered
substance and to show how it interacts
with the mechanical world that's the
mind-body problem as it was cast within
the modern scientific revolution of
course providing a new version to
traditional problems of body and soul
the project is now commonly ridiculed as
postulating the ghost in the machine but
there was nothing ridiculous about it
it was perfectly sound science Cartesian
observations about the creative aspect
of language use and other free acts of
will and choice these observations are
correct as far as we know and do indeed
lie beyond the bounds of mechanism even
though for reasons which were not
suspected at the time come back to them
so it made quite good sense to postulate
a ghost inside the human machine and
then come experimental tasks cartesian
science scientists who are well known
today but we're quite an important turn
to the question of how to determine
experimentally whether another creature
that possesses this creative capacity
possesses minds and they designed Trump
legs experiments and concluded
reasonably that if some creature that
could pass the hardest tests that it
would be only reasonable for us to
assume that it has a mind like ours not
back in the 17th century this
question was taking on considerable
practical and ethical significance
Europeans of course were just then
becoming to be acquainted with strange
creatures from across the sea
the ragged things Negroes envy and so on
then it was a great a serious question
to determine that which one's had Minds
not a small question the ones that and
mines had to be saved and Christianized
say what happened to them but that was
the test very benevolent novel
humanitarian intervention the and as a
number of distinguished historians of
philosophy have pointed out there are
crackin Richard walkin these conceptions
established at least the weak barrier
against racism the reason is that in
mind that does not admit of degrees you
can't have half a mind you either have a
mind there you don't have a mind no such
thing as a partial mind so you can't
have the kind of racism that establishes
a sharp divide between us the ones with
the others if they pass the tests the
Cartesian tests for possession of mind
the bear some resemblance to a popular
contemporary enterprise determining the
way it's put is determining whether
machines can think it's important to
understand here that the term machine
that does not refer say to a computer it
refers to a program that is a theory a
computer without a program to implement
may be useful as a paperweight or
something but it has no other function
it's the program that one is talking
about when you talk about the machine
the standard approach to this today is
often called the Turing test it's
derived from the imitation game that was
devised by the great mathematician that
Alan Turing I think one of the founders
of the modern theory of computation
among other contributions his imitation
game was designed to determine whether a
computer program can fool people into
thinking that the responses it produces
to queries are coming from a human being
the and there are very extensive efforts
to pass the Turing test in fact you
could win a big prize if you as the
these efforts typically overlooked
Turing's morning that the question
whether machines can think is
in his words to meaningless to deserve
discussion which is correct and overlook
that he did feel that the exercise might
be useful perhaps as a incentive a
challenge to develop more complex
computers and that's been more or less
truths as no other than the weather
value at all well while the Turing test
bears some similarity to the Cartesian
the tests it's a far less serious
Enterprise it's worth bearing in mind
that the Cartesian enquiries were pure
science sensible science was an effort
to determine whether an object has a
certain highly significant property
namely mind kind of like a litmus test
to determine acidity the Turing test has
no such significance as Tory made quite
clear and unfortunately has been
overlooked well while the Cartesian
project was quite a sensible one in
claiming the postulation of the ghost
and the human machine it didn't survive
very long it's in fact collapsed within
several decades in a way that was a
great surprise at the time and is highly
instructive for us though often
misunderstood Isaac Newton who studied
decartes physics in great depth you know
from his notebooks he demonstrated that
it did not succeed that the cart did not
succeed in his goal of providing firm
foundations for the mechanical
philosophy and far more significant that
Newton showed that the failures could
not be remedied not only is mind not
governed by mechanical principles but
nothing else in the world is either
there are no machines in the sense of
the related modern scientific revolution
Galilean Revolution was the only clear
notion with machine or now for that
matter
the framework of early modern science
from the time of the Galilean Revolution
simply could not be sustained and with
Cartesian physics and that was no small
discovery the framework that was
rejected that was refuted provided the
very criterion of intelligibility and it
was the conceptual basis for abandoning
traditional scholastic Aristotle based
science Galilean scholar Peter muscle
are the curves that by adopting the
mechanical philosophy on quoting him
thus initiating the modern scientific
revolution the Galileo had forged a new
model of intelligibility for human
understanding with new criteria for
coherent explanations of natural
phenomena for Galileo and his successors
the modern scientific
the true understanding requires a
mechanical model the device that has
skilled artisans would in principle
construct hence would be intelligible to
us so Galileo himself rejected the
traditional theories of tithes for
example because as he put it we cannot
duplicate them by means of appropriate
artificial devices and his great
successors successors adhered to these
standards of intelligibility and
explanation all destroyed by Newton and
it was therefore quite clear why
Newton's discoveries were so stridently
resisted by the most prominent
scientists of his day leading to a
debate that persistent long after
christiaan huygens the greatest
scientists of the day described newton's
fundamental concept of attraction as his
words an absurdity Leibniz charged that
he was reintroducing occult
ideas similar to the sympathies and
antipathies of the much ridicule
scholastic science and he was offering
no physical explanation of the material
world
Newton basically agreed with that he
stated very explicitly that he could
provide no physical explanation for
gravity that is that's actually the
context of his famous statement I make
no hypothesis he could
and a physical explanation Newton
furthermore agreed that the notion of
action at a distance which he was
postulating is in his words
inconceivable that is in his word so
great an absurdity that I believe no man
who has in philosophical matters a
competent Faculty of thinking can ever
fall into it by invoking the principle
he said we concede that we do not
understand the phenomenon of the
material world and as Newton scholarship
emphasizes and quoting again by
understand and Newton meant what his
critics meant understand in mechanical
terms of contact action their intuitive
concept of causation nevertheless
gravitational attraction is a fact
Newton stressed he explained that it is
necessary to invoke this absurd and
mystical notion this non mechanical
principle to account for falling bodies
planetary motion the tides any of the
physical phenomena that early modern
science attempted to address and for the
rest of his life he sought to discover a
way around the absurdity and failed as
of his successors the concept of mind
however remained intact it survived the
Newtonian revolution untouched so Newton
did not exercise the ghost is the
machine that the ghost as is commonly
claimed the exercise the machine so
there's no machines mind remains intact
leaves us with problems of understanding
it's also commonly believed that Newton
showed that the world is a machine
that's quite the opposite that he showed
that there are no machines not the world
anything else
however he did show something different
namely that the world is governed by
mechanical principles Newton by doing
that laid the basis for a very different
conception of what explanation must be
the world and follows rigid laws and
it's therefore mechanical in the sense
of following what's now called a
mechanical procedure but that's a very
different notion from machine and
mechanical
that was foreign to the founders of
early modern science Newton included
them for many years later Newton's
discoveries contributed to a lowering of
the goals of science something that was
already taking place through the 17th
century that is the recognition that we
must abandon the hopeless quest of
showing that the world is intelligible
to us it's not rather we must seek
intelligible explanations intelligible
explanatory theories that will provide
the best account of the workings of this
unintelligible world which remain
mysterious in a very deep sense
unintelligible as Galileo and the
founders of science understood the goals
of true savants the more limited goals
imposed by Newton's discoveries were not
entirely new now they have roots in an
earlier scientific tradition that had
abandoned the search for what were
called the first springs of natural
motion and other natural phenomena they
keeping to the more modest effort of
trying to develop the best theoretical
accounts that we can leading historians
of philosophy richard Popkin refers to
this approach as the constructive
skepticism formulated in detail by
Meyerson and Gassendi and developed
further and David Humes mitigated
skepticism essentially the can
very you this Popkin describes this
conception science proceeds by doubting
our abilities to find grounds for our
knowledge while accepting and increasing
the knowledge itself and recognizing
that the secrets of nature of things in
themselves are forever hidden from us an
approach she says which was to have a
great history in more recent times in
fact that's modern science well as I
mentioned the the ghost was left intact
in Newton's discoveries and also left
intact that means unintelligible is the
creative aspect of language use the
primary criterion for mind in
experimental Cartesian philosophy Newton
himself was basically a Cartesian he was
concerned with the matter he speculated
that what he called spirit quoting him
might be the cause of all movement in
nature including the power of moving our
body by our thoughts and the same power
in other living creatures though how
this is done and by what laws we do not
know we cannot say he said that all
nature is not alive going a step beyond
that John Locke was at the same time
added that we cannot say that matter
does not think that's a speculation
called
Locke suggestion in the history of
philosophy as Locke put it just as God
had added inconceivable effects to
motion it is not much more
from our comprehension to conceive that
can if he pleases the super add the
Faculty of thinking Locke found this
view in his words repugnant to the idea
of senseless matter but held that
nevertheless we kind of reject it yeah
basically from Newton's Fiat Newton's
reasoned when Newton had after all shown
that there is no intelligible concept of
matter or body or physical so we can't
dismiss the concept of thinking or
living matter
well what suggestion was in fact very
quickly taken up right through the 18th
century that David Hume concluded that
motion may be and actually is the cause
of thought and perception others motion
being that mysterious unintelligible
phenomenon that's the fore of the
physical world the others observed and
quoting that thought which is produced
in the brain cannot exist if this organ
is wanting and there is no longer a
reason to question the thesis of
thinking matter therefore continuing it
is necessary to consider the brain as a
special organ designed designed
especially to produce thought just as
the stomach and the intestines are
designed to operate the digestion of the
liver to filter back quoting the French
physiologist philosopher companies just
as foods enter the stomach and leave it
with new qualities so impressions arrive
at the brain through the nerves then
isolated and lacking any coherence the
organ the brain enters into action axon
and it soon it sends them back changed
into ideas in which the language of
physiognomies and gesture or the signs
of speech and writing manifest outwardly
we conclude with the same certainty that
the brain digests as it were the
impressions that is that it organically
makes the secretion of thought century
later Darwin put the matter succinctly
he asked rhetorically why is thought
being the secretion of the brain more
wonderful than gravity a property of
matter sensible comment it's kind of
interesting to see how these ideas are
treated today the last decade of the
20th century was designated as the
decade of the brain
many intensive studies it concluded the
decade concluded decade ago with a
volume of studies by distinguished brain
scientists and philosophers the volume
was summarized by distinguished
neuroscientist Vernon mount Cassell he
wrote that the leading thesis of these
researches is that things mental indeed
minds are emergent properties of grains
though we do not yet know how these
emergencies take place the word yet is
misleading we make
no reason to believe it other prominent
scientists and philosophers have
expressed quite similar ideas in recent
years describing the same thesis as an
astonishing hypothesis of the new
biology a radical new idea in the
philosophy of mind the bold assertion
that mental phenomena are entirely
natural caused by the neuro
physiological activities of the brain
opening the door to novel and promising
inquiry is a rejection of cartesian mind
dualism and so on all of these proposals
are rather odd they all reiterate and
often in the same words that
formulations from centuries ago after
the traditional mind-body problem became
unform ulill with the disappearance of
the only coherent notion of body can't
have a mind-body problem if you don't
have bodies for example the conclusion
of the eminent scientist philosopher
Joseph Priestley late 18th century that
properties termed the mental reduced
somehow to the organical structure of
the brain Locke's suggestion essentially
a conclusion stated in different words
by humans are when many others and a
conclusion that's almost inescapable it
would seem as were the collapse of the
mechanical philosophy that is of
intelligible physics well with the
belated revival of ideas that were
reasonably well understood centuries ago
the theory of mind
be pursued in many ways have liked other
branches of science it can be pursued
with the hope of eventual unification of
these endeavors that whatever form it
may take
and you never know the unification often
takes quite surprising forms the
unification of chemistry and physics for
example pretty recently actually in my
lifetime if you go back to the 1920s
there were chemistry was regarded
essentially is a kind of a calculating
procedure because it couldn't be reduced
to physics even Bohr's adams was
dismissed as just a calculating device
couldn't be reduced to physics and what
was said at the time is we cannot yet
reduce chemistry to physics the word yet
it was proven to be wrong it was soon
shown you would never be able to reduce
chemistry to physics the physics is
wrong it was only after the quantum of
revolution which introduced the totally
new conception of physics the chemistry
the virtually unchanged chemistry could
be unified with physics not reduced to
it might bear that in mind
the statements about whether mine and
yet you reduced to neurophysiology
understanding of the brain is far more
primitive than understanding of physics
was in the 20th century early 20th
century
so you'd hope for unification but can't
predict or even reasonably expect that
it'll be reduction well this current
enterprise renews a task that David Hume
undertook and when he investigated what
he called the science of human nature
seeking
the secret springs and principles by
which the human mind is actuated in its
operations including he said those parts
of our knowledge that are derived from
the original hand of nature that what we
would call now genetic endowment without
understanding it any better this inquiry
which human compared in principle to
Newton's a had in fact been undertaken
in quite sophisticated ways by the 17th
century English neoplatonist s-- very
interesting work that influenced current
in contemporary literature the general
inquiry in philosophy is called
naturalization of philosophy or
sometimes epistemology naturalized or
sometimes cognitive science but it's the
classical post-newtonian inquiry well to
summarize briefly I think it's fair to
conclude that the hopes and expectations
of the modern scientific revolution were
dashed by
discoveries leaving us with several
conclusions one conclusion is that while
our cognitive faculties are vast and
scope they are nonetheless intrinsically
limited some questions that we might
like to explore that may well be beyond
our cognitive reach the the standards of
success and may again have to be lowered
as has happened before or most
dramatically with the collapse of the
mechanical philosophy modern science the
hopes of modern science another
conclusion is that the mind-body problem
can be put to rest doesn't exist there
is no realistic alternative to Locke's
suggestion thinking matter and adopting
it opens the way to studying the mind
just as another branch of biology as
much as the study of the body below the
neck metaphorically speaking
a great deal has been learned in the
last half century half century of
actually a revival of forgotten
traditional concerns of the
going back to the early Scientific
Revolution and the Enlightenment but
many of the early leading questions have
not been answered and may never be
it's also worth for bearing in mind that
this last conclusion is quite strongly
suggested by the Italian revolution that
was quickly understood by leading
thinkers so David Hume far from being a
great philosopher was a historian there
was a long history of England and in his
history of England of course there's a
chapter on Isaac Newton who he called
the greatest and rarest genius that ever
arose for the arm of ornament and
instruction of the species and that Hume
concluded that Newton's greatest
achievement was that while he seemed to
draw the veil from some of the mysteries
of nature he showed at the same time the
imperfections of the mechanical
philosophy and thereby restored nature's
ultimate secrets to that obscurity in
which they ever did and ever will remain
and others agreed it's classic 19th
century history of materialism but
readers Munga as they didn't English by
Bertrand Russell he observed that we
have so accustomed ourselves to the
abstract notion of forces or rather to a
notion hovering and mystic obscurity
between abstraction and concrete
comprehension that we no longer find any
difficulty in making one particle of
matter
act upon another without immediate
contact through void space with no
material link and then he adds from such
ideas the great mathematician
and physicists of the 17th century were
far removed they were genuine
materialists who made immediate contact
the condition of influence in this
transition he writes is one of the most
important turning points in the history
of materialism and in fact the deprives
the doctrine of much of any significance
these conclusions are commonplace among
serious historians of science so fifty
years ago
Alexander Kor a great historian observed
that despite his willingness to accept
the conclusion that Newton had
demonstrated that a purely materialistic
pattern of nature is utterly impossible
than a purely materialistic or
mechanic's mechanistic physics as well
Lutins mathematical physics required the
admission into the body of science of
incomprehensible and inexplicable facts
imposed on us by empiricism by what is
observed and our conclusions from these
observations
well these conclusions about the
fundamental limits of understanding
appear to be radically incompatible with
the views of leading contemporary
scientists and philosophers one highly
regarded very recent study
physicist David Deutsch argues
forcefully that the search for
explanations which is the root of all
progress and distinctively human they
said it not only that search not only
conforms the universal laws of nature
but is unbounded in scope
progress and seeking good explanations
need never come to an end that
conclusion widely endorsed seems to
conflict with the claim of David Hume
and others that Newton left the veil
over fundamental mysteries of nature
restoring in Humes words restoring
nature's ultimate secrets to that
obscurity in which they ever did and
ever will remain however the appearance
of inconsistency is deceptive and is not
recognized because of the common failure
to understand what happened in modern
science for long as reasons we've just
gotten accustomed to accepting it like
post Newtonian science generally Deutsch
and others who speak of the unbounded
ability to seek explanations have
tacitly abandoned the quest for
intelligibility that was the driving
force of modern science from Galileo
through Newton beyond the fundamental
mysteries of nature may remain forever
presumably will remain for
whereas unintelligible to us as action
at a distance was for Newton and the
great scientists of his day and still is
to us but Newton's explanations are
quite intelligible though they have
exactly the fundamental gap that Leibniz
and others recognized and that Newton
accepted they do not provide a physical
basis for the explanations that nor does
anything since the goals of science have
been radically lower there is however a
new question that arises why should we
assume with which and many others that
the capacity for explanation is
unbounded we have to accept that we
cannot understand the mysteries of
nature but is it true that the capacity
for explanation is unbounded there is a
line of thinking that goes back to the
great 19th century philosopher logician
charles sanders purse and it's quite
common today at which to the line of
argument holds that the Darwinian theory
of evolution guarantees that result that
is natural selection provided the
intellectual capacities to solve the
problems that nature poses to us not
really to solve the problems was their
permanent mysteries but at least to
provide explanations that are
intelligible there's the belief that
there may be questions that are beyond
our cognitive reach that's
now derided as mysterion isn't term for
which the theory of evolution puts to
rest these again are very strange
inclusions the humans were not selected
to develop quantum theory didn't do any
good for hunter-gatherers Darla or for
us for that matter in our lives Darwin
and his successors have sought to show
something quite different namely that
humans are organic creatures a part of
the natural world and therefore like all
other creatures their capacities have
scope and limits that includes their
cognitive capacities and the limits of
human cognitive capacities are often far
weaker than those of other animals of
their birds for example that have a
memory that vastly exceeds theirs by
huge orders of magnitude in fact but
they can't deal with variaty birds with
very elementary numerical or of course
linguistic problems contrary to a lot of
contemporary illusions I should add and
just as they can't swim they will add
use language anymore they can swim and
for the same reasons the reason is that
scope and limits are intrinsically
related the scope requires rich
structure otherwise you don't have any
scope and that same structure imposes
limits no way out of this these things
are logically related so there's no
reason to escape that humans
miraculously escaped these general
properties
the natural world which means that
humans mysterion ISM is just normal
rationality that may well reach beyond
the necessary abandonment of the search
for intelligibility that animated the
modern scientific revolution nature's
ultimate secrets presumably will remain
impenetrable to to our understanding but
maybe also to our search for
explanations and in fact our cognitive
limits may render us incapable of even
asking the right questions for what it's
worth those conclusions seem to me quite
plausible one intellectual grounds and
also have to admit rather appealing as
well
