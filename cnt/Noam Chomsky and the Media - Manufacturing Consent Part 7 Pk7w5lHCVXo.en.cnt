its identity and if there's a listener
supported radio station you're that
means that people can get daily every
day a different way of looking at the
world not just what the corporate media
want you to see but a different picture
a different understanding not only can
you hear it but you can participate in
it you can add your own thoughts you
know and you can learn something and so
on well that's the way people become
human you know that's the way to become
human participants in a in a social and
political system mid Robinson and this
is non corporate news what is non
corporate news and why is it necessary I
didn't want to just show another film at
a library or something I wanted to make
my own statement I thought it'd be more
fun to do and perhaps I get other people
involved in a project besides showing a
film we could we could make a film or
video the local cable stations hooked up
to three communities Lynn swampscott and
Salem so that's 30,000 people it or
thirty thousand homes i'm not sure but
i'm sure a lot of people see it it'll be
a kind of people who don't go out to to
see a film it'll go right into their
houses so if they're flipping through
the channels they might be able to get a
completely new idea of the world so
there's kind of networks of cooperation
develop which I mean I care for example
is a collection of stuff from a friend
of mine Los Angeles who does careful
monitoring of the whole press in Los
Angeles and a lot of the British press
which you read and select us selection
so I don't have to read them you know
the movie reviews and the local gossip
and all this kind of stuff but I get the
occasional nugget that sneaks through
and that you find if you're carefully
and intelligently and critically
reviewing a wide range of creswell their
fair number of people who do this and we
exchanged information we wrote this a
two-volume work
we saw one another for a couple weeks
gentlemen that we were getting started
but then we wrote two vines essentially
without seeing one another just by phone
by even by mail and exchanging
manuscripts and but this takes a lot of
a lot of communications I'm now on my
Chomsky file is a couple of feet thick
the end result is that you do have
access to resources in a way which I
doubt that any National Intelligence
Agency can duplicate a little on
scholarship so there are ways of
compensating for the absence of
resources people can do things like for
example I found out about the arms float
I ran by reading transcripts of the BBC
and by reading an interview somewhere
with an Israeli ambassador in one city
and reading something else in the
Israeli press know okay the information
is there but it's there too fanatic you
know somebody who wants to spend a
substantial part of their time and
energy exploring it and comparing
today's lies with yesterday's leaks and
so on that's a researcher and it's you
know it just simply to make any sense to
ask the general population to dedicate
themselves to this task on every issue
I'm not given the false modesty there
are things that I can do know that I can
do them reasonably well including
analysis and
you know study research I mean I know
how to do that sweating and I think I
have a reasonable understanding of the
way the world works as much as in when
he can yeah and that turns out to be a
very useful resource for people who are
who are doing active organizing trying
to engage themselves in a way which will
make it a little bit of a better world
and if you can help in those things or
participate in them well that's you know
that's rewarding I wonder if you can
envision a time when people like myself
again been naive people will this world
can again take pride in the United
States and is that even a healthy to
wish now because it may be this hunger
for pride in our country that makes us
more easily manipulated by the powers
that you talk about I think you first of
all have to ask what you mean by your
country now if you mean by the country
the government I don't think you can be
proud of it and I don't think you could
ever be proud of it or it couldn't be
proud of any good it's not our good
and you shouldn't be States or violent
institutions the the government of any
country including ours represent some
sort of domestic power structure and
it's usually violent the states are
violent to the extent that they're
powerful that's roughly accurate you
look at American history it's nothing to
write home about you know why are we
here we're here because say some 10
million Native Americans were wiped out
that's not very pretty until the 1960s
it was still cowboys and Indians in the
1970s for the first time really it
became possible even for scholarship to
try to deal with the facts as they were
for example to deal with the fact that
the Native American population was far
higher than had been claimed millions
higher maybe as many as 10 million
higher than it been claimed and that
they had an advanced civilization and
that there was something akin the
genocide that took place now we went
through 200 years of our history without
facing that thing one of the effects of
the 1960s as it's possible to at least
begin to come to them to think about the
facts well that's in advance do you
think that this activism 20 years ago
has made it a difference in how our
society operates now it has not changed
the institutions in the way they
function but it has led to very
significant cultural changes I remember
these movements of the sixties expanded
in the 70s and expanded further in the
80s and they reached into other parts of
the society and different issues these a
lot of things that seemed outrages in
the 60s are taken for granted today so
for example take the feminist movement
for example which barely began to exist
in the 60s now it's part of general
consciousness and awareness the
ecological movements began in the 70s
the solidarity mood world solidarity
movements were very limited in the 60s
it was really Vietnam and in the 60s
also it was a student movement as you
say now it's not now it's mainstream
America
if there is what dissidents now than you
can remember why do you go on to write
that the people feel isolated because I
think much of the general population
recognizes that the organized
institutions do not reflect their
concerns and interests and needs they do
not feel that they participate
meaningfully in the political system
they do not feel that the meteor telling
them the truth or even reflect their
concerns they go outside of the
organized institutions to act we see
more and more of our elected leaders no
less and less of what they're doing
that's this medium does that very
striking in fact the presidential
elections have been almost removed from
the point where the public even takes
them seriously is involving a matter of
choice what do you think about what goes
on in the way it's kept in private I
think yeah they should come out I know
people dig we should talk the pieces
George Lewis well it means that the
political system increasingly
increasingly functions without public
input it means to an increasing extent
not only do people not ratify decisions
present but they don't even take the
trouble of ratifying they assume that
the decisions are going on independently
of what they may do in the polling with
ratification would it would be what well
ratification would mean a system in
which there are two positions presented
to me the voter I give in to the polling
booth and I push one or another button
depending on which of those positions I
want that's a very limited form of
democracy really meaningful democracy
would mean that I play a role in forming
those decisions and make them creating
those positions and that would be real
democratize not very far from that but
we're even departing from the point
where there is ratification when you
have stage-managed elections at the
public relations industry determining
what words come out of people's mouths
candidates decide what to say on the
basis of tests that determine what the
effect will be across the population
somehow people don't see how profoundly
contemptuous that is of democracy the
solemn moment is near the first the
swearing in advance
please move to your seats for the first
time in this century for the first time
in perhaps all history man does not have
to invent a system by which to live we
don't have to talk late into the night
which form of government is better we
don't have to rest justice we only have
to summit from within ourselves this is
a time when the future season or you
could walk right through into a rubber
ball tomorrow through the door creaks
president briefed on the networking

on effort by the stage coconut thousand
points of light energy organization that
are red like stars throughout the nation
doing good to the world to we offer new
engagement and a renewed now
strong to protect the people of this era
never only hurt them
hi ro printer we have been people have
such
make kinder the face of the nation and
gentler the face of the world referring
back to your earlier comment about
escaping from or doing away with
capitalism was wondering what scheme
workable scheme you would put in its
place me well well what I would but
really you know I jest to others who
might be in a position to set it up and
get it going well I mean I I think that
what used to be called centuries ago
wage slavery is intolerable I mean I
don't think people ought to be forced to
rent themselves in order to survive I
think that the economic institutions
ought to be run democratically by their
participants by the communities in which
they exist and so on and I think
basically through various kinds of free
association distort they have there been
any sustained examples on any
substantial scale of societies which
approximates into the anarchist ideal
there are small societies a smaller
number that have I think done so quite
well and there are a few examples of
large-scale libertarian revolutions
which were largely anarchist in their
structure as to the first small
societies extending over long period I
myself think the most dramatic example
is the perhaps the Israeli kibbutz in
which for a long period may or may not
be true today really were constructed on
Anika's principles that is of direct
worker control integration of
agriculture industry service personal
life on an egalitarian basis with direct
and in fact quite active participation
in self-management and where I should
think it's primarily successful
a good example of a really large scale
anarchist revolution are largely
anarchist revolution in fact the best
example to my knowledge is the Spanish
revolution in 1936 and in fact you can't
tell what would happen that panic is
revolution was simply destroyed life
force but during the period in which was
alive I think it was it inspiring
testimony to the ability of who are
working people who organize manage their
affairs extremely successfully without
coercion control how far does the
success of libertarian socialism or
anarchism is where I've really depend on
a fundamental change in the nature of
man both in his motivation his altruism
and also in his knowledge and
sophistication I think it not only
depends on it but in fact the whole
purpose of libertarian socialism is that
it will contribute to it it will
contribute to a spiritual transformation
precisely that kind of great
transformation in in the way humans
conceive of themselves and their ability
to act to decide to create to produce to
inquire precisely that spiritual
transformation that social thinkers from
the left Marxist tradition from Lex
Luxembourg say on overthrew
anarcho-syndicalist have always
emphasized so on the one hand it
requires that spiritual transformation
on the other hand the its purpose is to
create institutions which will
contribute to that transformation
you've written that in looking at
contributions of gifted thinkers one
must make sure to understand the
contributions but also to eliminate the
errors in them and of your ideas what
would you guess would be discarded and
what would be assimilated by future
thinkers well I mean I would assume
virtually everything would be discarded
for example and here we have to
distinguish I mean the work that I do in
my professional area I mean if I still
believed what I believe 10 years ago I'd
assume the field is dead so I assume
that when next time you read a student's
paper you're going to see something that
has to be changed and you continue to
make progress in dealing with social and
political issues in my view what is at
all understood is pretty straightforward
I don't think they're there may be deep
and complicated things but if so they're
not understood the the basic ways to the
extent that we understand society at all
it's pretty straightforward and I don't
think that those simple understandings
are likely to undergo much change the
point is that you have to work that's
why that's why the propaganda system is
so successful very few people are going
to have the time or the energy or the
commitment to carry out the constant
battle that's required to get outside of
the
macneil/lehrer band rather or somebody
like that the easy thing to do you know
you come home from work you tired at a
busy day I'm gonna spend the evening
carrying out a research project so you
turn on the tube
probably right if you look at the
headlines in the paper and many watchin
Scorchers cuz cuz that's that's
basically the way the system that
document works sure the other stuff is
they are just gonna have to work to find
modern industrial civilization has
developed within a certain system of
convenient myths the driving force of
modern industrial civilization has been
individual material gain which is
accepted as legitimate even praiseworthy
on the grounds that private vices new
public benefits in the classic
formulation now it's long been
understood very well that a society is
that is based on this principle will
destroy itself in time it can only
persist with whatever suffering and
injustice it entails as long as it's
possible to pretend that the destructive
forces that humans create are limited
that the world is an infinite resource
and that the world is an infinite
garbage can at this stage of history
either one of two things as possible
either the general population will take
control of its own destiny and will
concern itself with community interests
guided by values of solidarity and
sympathy and concern for others or
alternatively there will be no destiny
for anyone to control as long as some
specialized class is in a position of
authority it is going to set policy in
the special interests that it serves but
the conditions of survival lalong
justice require rash
social planning in the interests of the
community as a whole and by now that
means the global community the question
is whether privileged elite should
dominate mass communication and should
use this power as they tell us they must
mainly to impose necessary illusions to
manipulate and deceive the stupid
majority and remove them from the public
arena the question in brief is whether
democracy and freedom are values to be
preserved or threats to be avoided in
this possibly terminal phase of human
existence democracy and freedom are more
than values to be treasured they may
well be essential to survival
he's up there thinking for himself and
he's deciphering this tremendously over
weighted body of information which he
puts into an order and gives you the
feeling that you can do the same thing
that the whole thing is decipherable and
he also gives you the sense that there
is a source there's a center to the two
a dissenting population although we feel
that there's no center and I think that
is what i reactivated in me and a desire
to get back it get reacquainted with the
political scene after 30 years of
alienation from it you do hundreds of
interviews and lectures and on you
dealing with massacres in East Timor and
and invasions of Panama sets are pretty
horrific stuff death squads what keeps
you going I mean don't you get burned
out on this material well you know it's
mainly a matter of whether you can look
yourself in the mirror I think oh gotta
go
okay you can say
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
we're a bit sleepy
this train has been mourning since
hometown
Oh
okay come past hour that yes that is
true oh sorry I'm making me answer that
suction worked did we hit it in do
matter well we did pretty well actually
that means less sports and that's fun
they don't know what's going on if the
people you what you say here today
there'd be a big change thank you I'm
not optimistic note mr. Chomsky thank
you very much indeed I r we go oh i
thought it was Sir sort of technical
sounding but um there wasn't much did
you ever think of running for president
I ran our president first thing I do is
tell me well not the vote for me
the skies and people still be people
sleeping it as a start expulsion of our
children thanks oh my god just save is
all know that pity them because they're
tenses Cody no there won't be no hand
from the game does throw all the boys
