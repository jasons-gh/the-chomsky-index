Shen's for example be doing if the
problem is capital for example why
aren't more entities like worker control
putative Li worker controlled pensions
investing the capital they have some
control over in supporting these kinds
of worker controlled alternatives well
first of all pensions are not in the
hands of working people the unions are
not popular democracy it's pensions are
in the hands of bureaucrats and money
managers and they're not about to hand
over power to popular organizations
Ashleigh clinics that's not entirely
true there are some interesting
initiatives
if they're going to get anywhere but
they're interesting the United
Steelworkers which is one of the more
progressive unions has recently made
some tentative arrangements with
Mondragon in the Basque Country this
huge in worker owned industrial banking
housing school educational cooperative
that could get somewhere and I mentioned
gar alperovitz is work he's discussed
very well the end participates in the
spread of worker owned enterprises and
mostly northern Ohio the old Rust Belt
they have a kind of an interesting
history and which relates very much to
this back in 1977 at the beginning of
the concerted effort to destroy
industrial production in the United
States and sort of beginning of the kind
of neoliberal assault on the population
we've been through in the past
generation a US Steel decided to close
its main steel plants in Youngstown Ohio
it was a steel town like other
working-class towns like Detroit it had
actually been built by the working
classes was their town they didn't get
the profit because there are tools but
they built it they want to keep it
us still wanted to sell it to close it
down and the Union offered to buy it
they had community support
they even had some support of I think it
was a Republican governor just bought
let the workers by the plant and keep
running it well us still didn't want
that in fact this is can pretty
consistent I mentioned de Ville ermine
before he's one is written about it
worked on it very commonly around here
to Eastern Massachusetts when workers
decide to try to take over an enterprise
maybe an enterprise which may be
perfectly profitable but not profitable
enough for the multinational who you
know who runs it maybe they don't want
to keep in their books when they try to
buy it which would be a good deal for
the multinational they refused to sell
it for class reasons they have class
interests they do not want to see the
spread of popular democratic
organizations for perfectly obvious
reasons this just happened and going but
I'll come back to Youngstown in a minute
but it just happened a couple of years
ago right here and Taunton there was a
small but quite successful manufacturing
plant made specialized parts for
aircraft doing pretty well but the
multinational didn't want to bother with
it so they were going to close it down
the Union you know UE in this case I
tried to buy it
multinationals usually refused to sell
it and there wasn't enough support
popular support to push it through if
there had been an Occupy movement at
that time real I think that's something
they might have pushed through
actually on a much larger scale a couple
of years ago Obama virtually
nationalized the auto industry not
entirely but virtually there were a
couple of options that one option was to
restructure it use taxpayer funding hand
it back to the original owners or other
people just like them maybe a different
face but you know bankers CEOs and so on
and then have it continue to do what it
had been doing before building cars
that's what they chose there was another
option I hand it over to the workforce
have them build what's needed in the
country which is not more cars for
traffic gems but high-speed mass
transportation the United States is very
backward in the world in this respect I
mean you can take a high-speed train
from Beijing to Kazakhstan but try to
take a train from Boston to New York
it's about as slow as it was 60 years
ago this is really backward the country
needs it and the the former auto
industry could have been handed over to
the workforce and given may be given
some support but probably less than the
auto industry got to do this but that
wasn't an option suppose there had been
a large-scale Occupy movement you know
significant it was significant but
broader expanded well I think that could
have been pushed through takes popular
consciousness there going back to
Youngstown the case went to court in
1977 the Union Union lost workers lost
and it was the steel mills were
destroyed but they didn't give up they
didn't just say okay we'll starve to
death or go somewhere else they began to
organize small worker owned enterprises
and they've been spreading around the
Cleveland area good
Youngstown good bit of northern Ohio
into other areas so it is taking place
but you know it's happening elsewhere
too in northern Mexico there are quite
successful worker owned plants it's not
easy because you know the the banks
don't like to give them capital and the
government doesn't like them and won't
support them again for class reasons but
if the sufficient popular support these
things can develop and it's not easy you
know it's hard work and the people who
organize usually suffer for it
but that's typical of almost everything
the civil rights movement the young
correctly any movement that has ever
gotten anywhere the people up front
usually take it in the chin you know
it's hard and that people have to be
willing to endure and for a longer-term
gain and that's not easy but it can
happen and it does
well like we're up in the 1930s that's
when I was kids deep depression and
plenty of suffering and there were
images that that kind of stick in my
mind you know people coming to my
parents were teachers so we had some
money you know not rich but got long and
in fact the whole family of unemployed
working-class kind of converged around
the around our house we had at least
something but there were images of
people coming to the door trying to sell
rags to try to get a piece of bread to
survive I remember riding with my mother
on trolley cars watching going past
textile plants this is Philadelphia and
watching women on strike being brutally
beaten by security forces my own family
was extended family was mostly
unemployed working-class and as I
mentioned very high culture as the New
Deal sort of began to having a impact
they were able to enjoy Shakespeare
plays in the park go to the budva string
quartet to my unemployed seamstress
aunts were members of the ilgwon you
know ladies garment workers union could
get a couple of weeks in the countryside
at a solidarity camp that that was life
a lot of it was Communist Party we're
not allowed to say anything nice about
the Communist Party that's a rule and
there were a lot of things wrong with it
and I've mentioned some of them now but
there were things that were right about
it like I said one was that it overcame
the amnesia that nathan talked about it
was always there you know people
remembered somebody remembered how to
turn the minigraf machine or organize a
demonstration and you went from a civil
rights demonstration to a labor
organizing to something else that crazy
international ideas
that was kind of in the back of their
minds it wasn't wrote was really going
on the destruction of the of the
Communist Party was quite important
killed off the radical continuing
element that kept a lot of the Left
traditions a twine you know the reasons
it was in the Cold War framework that
was all there as far as the anarchists
were concerned the place I learned about
that was by reading I went when I was a
kid I'd go to visit my relatives and he
soon as I got old enough to get on that
train about 11 or 12 years old and take
the train to New York and stay with my
relatives but spend most of my time down
on those of you know New York
Union Square used to be the place where
the anarchist offices were a fry or
about their stebih
others and lots of pamphlets lots of
interesting people but Quay Igor to talk
to a young kid you know so not hard to
have discussions then and down below
Union Square on 4th Avenue not today but
then there were rows of small bookstores
a lot of them run by European EMA grades
many of them Spanish refugees Spanish
anarchist refugees who were also quite
eager to talk and had lots of pamphlets
and the direct you know a real original
documentary material actually when I
wrote about this 20 years later I'd what
used mostly documentary material I had
picked up as a young teenager it wasn't
available a lot of it's available now
wasn't then and that was a pretty
inspiring picture I felt the Spanish
revolution at least I felt and feel was
a really inspiring moment which i think
is why it elicited such a vicious
response from every corner of power
that's quite important to remember
communists fascists liberal democracies
all combined on crushing this this was
something they couldn't tolerate then
they could have a fight later about who
books up the spoils
actually there were anarchist proposals
that I felt were not unreasonable
they're dispatched of course in the West
but for how to win the Civil War wisdom
anarchist thinkers like Camilla
billionaire II who was murdered by the
Communists in May 1937 one of the
leading anarchist thinkers he he
proposed that he had pointed out I think
has turned out quite correctly that
they'd never win a conventional war for
one reason because the commitment to the
war on the part of the population had
seriously declined after the Revolution
was crushed they had lost what they had
fought for and then care very much who
was going to pick up the spoils he
pointed out and uh and of course the
fascists were being directly supported
by by Hitler and Mussolini and the West
was not opposed to that yet its heart
you may forget now but the fascism had a
pretty good image in the West in the
late 30s Mussolini was that admirable
Italian gentleman as Roosevelt called
him Hitler was regarded by the State
Department as in the late 30s as a
moderate who was holding off the forces
of left and right so we shouldn't be too
critical of him the United States had a
Consul in Berlin
up until Pearl Harbor who was sending
back dispatches saying shouldn't be too
hard on the Nazis and doing some things
we don't like but they're still kind of
moderates his name is George Kennan you
don't read that in the bio
but that's not untypical of the period
Roosevelt for example bitter there was a
Neutrality Act theoretically that the
United States was not supposed to allow
the support for either side in the Civil
War and Roosevelt was very bitter about
any attempt to by somebody to say send a
pistol to the Republic I couldn't stop
it by force but he bitterly condemned it
on the other hand the State Department
couldn't notice what I was reading in
the left-wing press at the time and was
later conceded twenty years later that
the United States had authorized the
Texaco oil company which was run by an
outright Nazi open Nazi had authorized
them to they were they had a contracts
to ship oil to the Republic they
switched it to shipping oil to the
fascist forces which is the one thing
that Hitler Mussolini couldn't provide
they couldn't find that the left press
could find it but the State Department
couldn't well going back to burn re what
he proposed was that in Spain itself the
popular forces should fight a guerrilla
war that's an old Spanish tradition in
fact that's where guerrilla wars and it
were initiated under Napoleon
let's fight a guerrilla war in Spain
itself and in Morocco call for support
the Moroccan liberation forces that were
trying to free themselves from French
and British Imperial and Spanish
imperial control that was the base of
Franco's army they were Moorish troops
coming from northern Africa so his idea
was fight a Revolutionary War support
them in their efforts to overthrow
imperialist control that he thought
would erode the Spanish the fascist
armies just as in Spain itself the
popular forces were fighting but until
they were crushed well that's if you
read the scholarship on
on the matter up till today that's kind
of dismissed as a sort of a romantic
joke as the whole anarchist movement is
but I don't think it was that's worth
that was my initial exposure to hi I'm
just curious if you could address the
role of surveillance technologies and
increasingly the militarization of
police as far as moving forward in
radical thought today and in the future
kind of what you see that where that is
that well I think there are two things
to bear in mind about that the first
thing is that the phenomenon itself
shouldn't be at all surprising the
second is that the scale at least to me
is kind of surprising I hadn't really
expected that scale but the phenomenon
is normal and it's again as American as
apple pie you can go back a century take
say the Philippine war early in the 19th
century 20th century it was a vicious
war the u.s. conquered the Philistine
fill the Philippines killed a couple
hundred thousand people was a major
popular nationalist movement after the
military victory it had to be suppressed
and controlled and the huge pacification
campaign was initiated using the highest
technology of the day for surveillance
subversion of breaking up groups you
know building up hostilities all kinds
of things very sophisticated it was very
quickly transferred home it was used by
Woodrow Wilson and Red Scare the worst
repression in American history and
developed further sins it's had a lethal
effect on the Philippines
you know people mourn the typhoon that
killed tens of thousands of people that
doesn't happen in functioning societies
very striking in the Caribbean that when
a tropical storm goes through the
Caribbean
in Haiti the major victims of imperial
violence it's a vicious right next door
in Cuba three people died you know some
buildings are knocked over same storm
depends on the society
well the Philippines is a society that
we created have maintained it's the one
part of Southeast Asia that hasn't taken
part in the so-called Asian miracle you
know the not one of the Asian Tigers
there's a reason for that
good reason but these techniques but you
can be confident that any state or a
commercial enterprise any system of
power is going to use whatever
technology is available to try to
control and dominate its and what
amounts to its major enemy namely the
population that's what our systems are
going to do the scale of what was
revealed I think was a little surprising
but it actually shouldn't be and there's
more to come those of you who read
technical journals like say the MIT
Technology Review they should know
what's coming so for example just in the
tech review recently there's been
articles on things like there and
elsewhere on the hardware and computers
which is now being designed they blame
China but of course that means it's
being done 10 times as much here the put
in components in the hardware that will
enable the manufacturer to record every
keystroke everything that's happening on
your computer American businesses are
worried because if they have Chinese
computers they'll be picking it up at
the People's Liberation Army but they
don't point out that the American
systems are probably doubtless much more
advanced than doing the same thing
robotics as a field that's been worked
on pretty hard for many years here too
and one of the goals quite explicit
nothing secret is to develop a fly size
drones tiny robots which can you know
get on your on the ceiling of your
living room and carry out constant
surveillance and drones tend to go from
surveillance to lethal capacities very
quickly that we can expect that pretty
soon and these are things that are in
development any system of power is going
to use them and pretty strikingly G
Hadi's are going to use them one of the
things we're doing right now is creating
perfect technology for terrorist attacks
it's not a secret you take a look at
drone technology but right by today
already let's claim that for the three
hundred dollars you can purchase a small
drone online that's improving very fast
and for terrorist activities just
perfect if you want to get a picture of
it there's an article in this month's
leading journal of Foreign Affairs and
Britain the Royal Institute Journal of
International Affairs describing how we
are rapidly creating the technology to
permit massive terrorist attacks on
ourselves that's also typical power
systems seek short term power and
domination they are not concerned with
security it's contrary to academic dogma
easily show that they're interested in
power domination the the wealthy the
welfare of their primary domestic
constituencies which are wealth
concentrated wealth and if there's a
disaster in the long term it's not their
business you can show that it's obvious
with environmental issues it's the same
with nuclear weapons same right now with
drone technology so sure this stuff is
going to go on unless we stop it you can
stop it too
have to go on can you offer a critique
of startup culture and entrepreneurship
which which offers many of the
characteristic Eric turistic some
autonomy but isn't so seeming
characteristics
I mean startup culture is you know it's
ok people like their apps and so on but
it's based on very heavily on state
subsidy it's not it's kind of a narrow
form of entrepreneurship I so take for
example the Silicon Valley culture where
what are they using well they're using
computers or the Internet
mic electronics and so on and so forth
almost all developed in the state sector
for decades before it's handed over to
private power to for commercialization
and application so yeah there is
initiative there and people are having
fun doing maybe interesting things but
relying very heavily on the background
state subsidy which takes many forms
after everyone at MIT ought to know it
it's paid our salaries for years you
know it's you know for decades computers
in the internet and the whole base of
the IT culture were being developed
right here similar places and orally and
so on and finally after decades it was
handed over to Bill Gates and Steve Jobs
to market and commercialize and make
profits and make little things that you
carry around with you but so it's a it's
a kind of a it has entrepreneurial
aspects but it's a parasitic but it's
parasitic on much more fundamental
development the really hard work the
hard research and development the
creative work is is quite substantially
in the state sector and so it's not just
subsidy there are many other devices
of taxpayer support for private
enterprise one of the main ones is
procurement so for example in the early
60s at IBM through the 50s had learned
mostly in government laboratories and
places like this had learned to switch
from punch cards to digital computers
and they built the world's biggest
computer in the early sixties stretch
computer fastest computer but it was
much too expensive for business so the
government bought it that's the
purchaser of last resort and I think it
went to Los Alamos and that goes on all
the time procurements a major form of
public subsidy to private enterprise and
there are many other ways that's one of
the reasons why private capital does not
want markets they want markets for other
people but not for themselves for
themselves they want a a nanny state
powerful nanny state that will support
them what the significance of the
entrepreneurial culture is you can judge
I'm not overwhelmed by the fact that
there's thousands of new apps coming
today I think they're more important
things yeah
well you mentioned the Civil War and
there's ample evidence by now that there
was some very significant slave
initiative in the Civil War this is more
to say about that a lot more so take the
American Revolution to a large extent
that was a revolution carried out in
order to maintain slavery you look back
at the history in seventeen rounds 1770
the in Britain the legal system was
beginning to undertake strong
condemnation of slavery there was one
famous case Somerset case 1772 were
slave owners from the United States
brought their slaves with them to
England that one of them escaped T there
was an effort to his owner wanted him
back it's my property and it went to
court then went to Lord Mansfield famous
jurors who ruled that slavery is so
odious that was the term that he used
that it cannot be tolerated on English
soil crucially it could be tolerated in
the colonies but that's another story
but not on English soil and the the
United States was but the the founders
of the country are almost all slave
owners and they could see the
handwriting on the wall if the colonies
remained under British rule probably
these laws would apply here and they'd
lose their property that was surely a
significant element of the Revolution
and it runs right to the present I mean
right to this moment the Civil War is
still being fought simply take a look at
the electoral maps say the map of the
election in 2012 red states and blue
states it's almost identical identical
to the Civil War
it's the Confederacy which I'll call
themselves Republicans shifted names and
the rest which was the north the large
part of the motivation behind the effort
to shut down the government is just
revenge we want to shut down Washington
and win this war finally the United
States never developed class parties
like labor parties they didn't amount to
much but at least they were something
but the u.s. never had them it's always
had sectional parties and it's a
reflection of the civil war which has
never ended it also hasn't ended in the
prisons and elsewhere it's a very deeply
rooted thing in the society and hard to
exstrophy
