okay that's perfect thank you so much
okay I'm sure you get this all the time
but it's an honor to speak with you you
know you're I'll get started right away
I know your your your views on the state
of the world today and of humanity are
well documented it seems run a fairly
self-destructive path I'd like to know
what you think how change is actually
going to happen in the world there's
only one way that change has ever
happened with very rare exceptions
overwhelmingly in the past change is
taking place when people what we call
ordinary people began to mobilize and
engage dedicated themselves to a
struggle bullets from everything you can
think of can start with a few people to
take the anti-nuclear movement in
England cnv started with small number
you ended up with a huge movement the
civil rights movement in the United
States scattered individuals many people
really dedicated themselves with courage
and intensity a couple of black kids
sitting in a lunch counter North
Carolina Freedom Riders million south
pretty soon you had a huge mass movement
the women's movement which is had a very
significant effect on modern culture and
society that began small
consciousness-raising groups going on
with the demands and pressures finally
chief something and the thought the bit
different from the modern the great
modern achievement of European society
now being dismantled by the Brussels
your friends and the bank's the modern
welfare state largely through labor
activism over many years oh and like
wrote about changes there's just no
other way same here would you say
there's a conscious and concerted effort
to prevent that from happening or of
course our systems never say thank you
we're giving up our pow
so everything they can to retarded and
prevent it and that simply requires more
engagement it seems like conflict is at
the core of all the problems with
humanity both as are as individually and
as a species collectively what do you
think is at the core of that conflict of
each individual first of all there's
also plenty of cooperation there is for
sure there are conflicts when there are
different interests different interests
and concerns you can try to adjudicate
them sensibly or you can approach them
aggressively and that'll lead to country
take any case you like takes a problems
in Ukraine right now I mean there are
paths forward the imagine towards
peaceful reconciliation negotiations
taking in there are plainly different
interests and concerns or you can think
of ways in which they could be
accommodated of one possibilities to
pursue them the alternative possibility
is to try to exacerbate them say by
sending delegations to call for a
greater for rejecting the concerns of
the others and demand and solely your
own rights sending missile defense of
missile defense beast in Europe on our
side expanding the aggressive efforts to
incorporate Ukraine into a Western
system realizing that that's of course
severe and they're not realizing you're
not carrying the severe security threat
to the United States to Russia and on
the other side of say footin were to
give direct military support to
secessionists and eastern Ukraine which
apparently is not doing that would
exacerbate detentions they're always
alternative as you can follow we know
that but I'd like to head out to your
philosophical side
here you know I speak with a lot of for
this project I'm speaking with spiritual
leaders a lot of the top scientists in
the world a lot of some politicians and
and for people from every perspective
and they all seem to have their own
answer to what is wrong and what the
solution is and and it just seems to me
that that that as long as there is a
conflict and in turn would you say as
long as there's an internal conflict in
the human organism that that will always
reflect itself onto the world any person
you be my children everyone else is
complex enough so that we have internal
conflicts and we try to resolve them
that's pretty much the same as before
you can you can tear yourself apart or
you can try to find the constructive way
forward I don't think there's any deep
philosophical or spiritual issue here
something we're all quite familiar with
well you let's play like the spiritual
aspect or suggest that that the answers
must come with from within first that
you must examine yourself and and and
once you have a center once you have a
core value I mean you must have a core
value that that really up reflects in
everything you say and do I don't have a
Corvette you I don't think anyone else
does either we have many bad news of
Greater and Lesser significance on
sometimes we try and pick and flick with
each other so for example the freedom
speech is a very high value I think you
can preserve but it does run into
conflicts for example to you provide
freedom speech to people who are trying
to destroy the world would say right
that's a serious question and they exist
so for example the major a corporate
executive major sectors of corporate
power in the United States are working
overtime to try to ensure that their
profits in the short term book will be
max
by convincing people that either there
is no global warming or thur as humans
have nothing to do with it well their
quote there in fact announcing it kind
of a death knell for the species should
therefore in speech be guaranteed it's
chris a conflict of values i think it
should but can't argue that there's no
conflict of value and that happens over
time people are not simple enough to
have a single core value we have many
concerns many values many of them we owe
to assess the side that they're really
not valid always good to look into the
mirror to make sure try to see if what
you're doing is sensible and justified
question your own the reflexive
judgments you're on commitments that
always make sense but you can't be
paralyzed by you have to make decisions
in life constantly are matters small and
large well you think very measured in
very balanced and you're obviously in
the center of many world storms with all
the things that you've said you must get
a lot of flack how do you what do you do
internally to remain centered and and
reasonable or is it just your natural
predilection this plenty of inner
turmoil record talk people close to me
though no doubt it but I think it makes
sense to try to suppress it and attempt
at least make every attempt to address
criticism hysteria and shrieking
invective whatever it may be and there's
plenty of it to try to see if you can
find in a points that are serious enough
so that discussion and constructive
engagement as possible often there are
sometimes there's not in which you just
have to dismiss it was there a pivotal
moment in your life that put you on this
path
that that that made you see the world
the way that you see it today or was
that in an eight and an eight thing for
you don't I mean it's in aid for all of
us for the question is what stimulates
it brings it forward but so for example
concern for the fate of others sympathy
is it's been historically cold is
probably just in an eighth property Adam
Smith David Hume other pretty figures
and that for granted and that probably
right but it doesn't always manifest
itself and we will have our own
experiences and our own choices and
decisions far as I'm concerned it's from
early childhood I grew up during the
Depression quantity of suffering see it
very close by there were there was the
rising threat of fascism dark cloud over
Europe free frightening and even to a
child watching it and this thing shaped
of perspective of way of thinking about
the world do you get a sense of being an
historical figure in the world do you
get a sense of of that that you have a
purpose that you have a purpose in that
you are fulfilling it to some to some
degree all right many purposes and to
some degree I think they're being
fulfilled of the respect not so there
are many causes that I've devoted an
enormous effort to the felt that they
were totally hopeless sometimes they
work totally hopeful sometimes they
actually succeeded so it takes a one of
them if one in 1975 Indonesia invaded
the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor violent act of aggression worded
by the United States Britain every hour
now they carried out a gin literally
genocide or virtual against Idol assault
on the population may be wiped out
Porter Porter of them are more
her other words one of a small group of
people who were devoting considerable
effort to try to bring public attention
to this to try to bring about policy
change to try to save the remnants of in
this incredibly poor backward society
and come up to me it seemed impossible
but we kept at it and for a lot of
efforts on mine any others I finally did
succeed in pressuring the American
government call it all in September 1979
happen ever be sure as causes aren't
necessarily those so look in your in
your lifetime you've seen a lot of
change a lot of dramatic societal change
for the wrong date night 0 for 25 years
but you you've seen a lot of change over
your lifetime and you've been been
actively impassioned with it what have
you seen how has humanity progressed
over that time from your point of view
in quite a lot of progress so take we're
now sitting I'm in my office at MIT
University where I've been since
nineteen fifty-five when I came the
political science department was openly
funded by the CIA fordham secret through
the 1960s they were engaged the
department as an academic pardon was
engaged in counterinsurgency work in
South Vietnam villas with his end
students to the advisor for Coleman of
course this was all under the rubric of
a Peace Research Institute is the age of
or well of course there were closed
seminar secret seminars away discovered
when I was occasionally divided to speak
in 10 that would be impossible now as a
result of student activity mainly the
late sixties it was late he came
that's normal for students i have named
him for you now they succeeded in
changing the environment at the
university to the extent that by 1969
that were the first serious efforts
institute why full university to
consider the question which is really
not been publicly reading raised before
about uses of technology and uses of
science and their work it amuses in fact
they not to the point that it a day was
the classes were suspended for a day to
deal with position and then it continued
and it's over time change the atmosphere
of the university a substantially and
it's changed in other words so when I
came here in 1955 if you walked in the
halls you saw the white males
well-dressed and quiet differential
faculty with jackets and ties made sweet
I thought as well that was like 50 walk
down the hall now half women maybe
thirty four percent minorities casual
dress casual relations informal
interchange interaction of all kinds of
also then the UCD what you see a the
booths and ads for all kind of activism
and so on and so forth well that's a big
change and it didn't just out of here
happened across the country in fact
across the world to a large extent
that's significant and we can continue I
take what I was mostly engaged in in the
1960s and continue to be opposition to
aggression final digression worst crime
in the early 60s it was almost
impossible to arouse any concern over
the US invasion of south vietnam later
fall of Indochina just to give you an
illustration as late as october 1965
when the small heavy war movement tried
to join an international day of protest
that was called and have a demonstration
in the boston common in South Boston I
park place for demonstration that was at
over 1965 South Vietnam impractical
destroyed hundreds thousands American
troops works at North we could we tried
to have the demonstration but it was
worth enough physically broken up I was
supposed to be one speaker from your
word we were saved from real physical
attack by by state troopers of the
liberal newspaper denounced the
demonstration how dare you criticize the
holy state and so on Boston's a livable
city maybe the most liberal city in the
country March 1966 was the second
international day for this we realized
it couldn't have a public demonstration
as you sorts of issue so we try to
arrange in a church church must attack
10 cans tomatoes my wife mustard in
nineteen sixty five or so took Eric we
had two little girls took them to she
took them to women's demonstration in
Concord mass the traditional seat of us
pacifism there were women and children
just standing not saying much they were
in fact that was the early 60s couple
years later had a huge any warm which we
know that a big impact on ending the war
you read the Pentagon Papers they
terminate in early nineteen sixty eight
right after the Tet Offensive in January
68 the government was thinking of
sending much more troops but the
military was opposed they said they
would need them for civil disorder
control in the United States workers
from saying that affected the
end result was horrendous but if
affected come up to 2000 2003 march two
thousand three the US and britain
invaded iraq the worst crime of the 21st
century another major crimes of gresham
pretty horrifying consequences but it
was the first time in the history of
western imperialism that there was
massive protest even before the day the
world was officially launched and you
know a lot of people feel it didn't have
an effect went on anyway disagree with
that Bush layer their associates never
even dreamed of carrying out the
measures that John F Kennedy and Lyndon
Johnson used without a second thought in
the early nineteen sixties let's change
in attitude well it's not pure progress
by any means a lot of regression but
over time I think it's we've become more
civilized countries many but it's ironic
that we're standing on the precipice of
destruction of the species to some
extent I mean it seems that it seems
paradoxical that that while in one hand
people are more open and more willing to
accept new liberal ideas that were that
there's an counter force that seems to
be just as powerful how do you explain
the polarity using or there are
interests that do not want to give up
their power and their profit in the
United States and most important country
very major sectors of private enterprise
so-called private enterprise they
exported private enterprise the energy
corporations American Chamber of
Commerce which made business lobby are
quite openly our secret quite openly
proclaiming that they are carrying out
large-scale propaganda campaigns for
called propaganda PR campaigns to try to
convince the public that either there's
no
global warming just climate always
changes and so on or else you don't have
nothing to it or why because they're
being threatened their profits are being
thread and these are corporations it's
been you know billions of dollars in new
exploration trying to exploit new
sources of the fossil fuels that are
about to destroy us and in fact if you
look at the scientific evidence there's
pretty strong consensus that unless most
of them feel well majority stay in the
ground but a human life in any
recognizable forms do so sure these
conflicts are there and they reflect the
moral calculus of Anglo American
capitalism the profits tomorrow outweigh
far outweigh the favorite Rancho that's
it and men and those who accept that
moral calculus yes we'll use the power
that they have which is enormous to try
to drive us all over the press you know
I know you've got much time and if one
question I really want to get in you
know you're obviously a very eloquent
and intelligent man and them if you had
if you had the ability to make a public
service announcement to humanity what
would you say to humanity what would you
say say tip to people right now what I
would say is all the problems in the
world and there are plenty of them that
are two that cast a shadow over
everything unless they're solved nothing
else is going to matter I'm not no
matter how serious it was a one is
environmental catastrophe the other is
the threat of nuclear war which is very
real it's a miracle that we've escaped
since 1945 let the record it's just shot
unless these two problems I did I can't
recall a statement of Bertrand Russell's
pictures right over there looking at me
around nineteen sixty I guess he was
asked why he was spending his time
marching in the streets testing
nuclear weapons when he could have been
developing that his philosophical and
scientific views and making a lasting
contribution to civilization and his
answer was something but I think that if
I don't march in the street there isn't
blooming anywhere round who appreciate
and that where it's now a more severe
situation so the message people the
world I think it should be take a look
at the faces your friend children or
imagine with them do you want them to
have a decent existence or don't you
care that's a choice awesome awesome
thank you I think I don't have much time
I've got can ask you a personal question
how are you dealing with old age holding
all these e 5 is old well I'm sure that
some things aren't working as well as I
used to and and just the sense of
mortality do you get your sense of
mortality as you as you get older when I
was about 10 years old I used to have
horrifying thoughts about how awful it
would be I mainly because if I die it
would mean that this sparked of
consciousness disappeared and how do I
even though that the rest of the world
continues to exist that used to really
troubled me around that age nizhny got a
little over and in terms with it doesn't
bother me anymore so how did you resolve
that just by recognizing that it's
that's the dust that's the way we're
world that's the way life works so you
have no sense at all of not i will see
an afterlife because that sounds too
religious but you have no sense of what
happens to your energy after your
physical body dies do you have any idea
about that expiry a few Barry but if he
composes introduce more life and what
about spirit do you believe in that
there is a spirit that there is a noam
chomsky spirit that that upon the
physical death that that spirit is
intact in some form for every person
there's some kind of legacy that you
leave
I the impact of what you've done for
example to go back a couple of minutes
did you care for your grandchildren
enough to do something to retard
disaster that'll live on positive and
negative so what would you like your
legacy to be I'd like it to be there
several domains race back to my main
intellectual interests are professional
work which is pretty exciting I think
could be carried forward in ways which
will give us quite a lot of insight into
the kind of creatures human beings are
I'd like to see that pursued maybe I'm
on the right path maybe the wrong path
for whatever it is like to see that it
to be carried forward for significantly
but in the human domain the main of
human life it's basically we've been
talking about to whatever extent there's
a positive impact in securing decent
human life saving people's lives and
ensuring that they have the assessments
the rights that every person should have
to the tiny extent that can contribute
to that like that to the legacy food you
know somebody might mentioned I was
speaking with you today someone asked me
I asked them could you give their
question that you particularly wanted me
to ask and he mentioned that dumb is
there a question that hasn't been asked
of you that you would like to answer
that should have been asked of you I
mean you seem to have an opinion on
everything and you have a view and
you've considered a lot of things is
there something that hasn't been asked
as much as it should be yeah one
question his nest as much as it should
be is why throughout my life have I
delayed so long and becoming engaged in
things of immense significance and I can
give a case after case please do so
watch that white wine well they take the
Vietnam War which and so needed my
energies in the 1960s in fact I was just
about to go for a long prison sentence
probably
ended by the Tet Offensive but at the
time to become involved in involved
seriously early sixties time to become
involved with ten years earlier takes a
environmental issues the time to become
involved at the very latest was the
early seven I do very much go last 10 or
15 years give him mention case after
case is that because you're really
self-absorbed in your in your career or
are with it you're just unaware these
issues are our stomachs care of personal
deficiencies lack of knowledge
interesting we want something else what
kind of things were all familiar with
what keeps us from doing the things at
some level we know you do and you feel
like now you're doing everything you
should be doing or you feel like your
questions could be a snow ya gotta go ya
ok well thank you thank you very much
truly it's a pleasure to speak with you
baby buggy I finally / yes thank you
you
