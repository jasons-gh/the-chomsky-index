not any purpose to them speaking of the
civil rights issues
that's my last question the gay marriage
issue that Obama supports that's getting
a lot of attention obviously it looks as
though you know that is the direction
that he you know wants America to grow
into a well so what are your feelings
about that he didn't want to affect it
was against it at first
we put in his his views have evolved on
the subject and that's also true the
Republican right wing their views are
evolving on the subject and they're
evolving for a very simple reason if you
take a look at the popular opinion it's
way ahead of them on this issue and they
can't be that far beyond public opinion
not as far as it's not a class issue so
you know the corporate elite couldn't
care less I'm in a facility as on the
sexual appears but so for them it's not
an issue not so therefore it can easily
go forward it's important on the yeah
integration but what doesn't illustrate
any commitment to civil liberties mr.
Johnson thank you so much reshape your
time very very much younger
