there's a common confusion outside of
serious biology I mean natural selection
is a factor in evolution no serious
biologist doubts that but it's one of
many factors yes for example mutations a
factor yeah I mean there are many other
factors for example you just take a look
at her you know our own genetic and down
it a lot of it comes from transposition
when you when you talk about the other
mode
you think that we have a way to
comprehend the world within ourselves or
we can only comprehend the world up to
this limit that's just him that's Newton
and you know so you try to discover what
is this cognitive endowment that we have
that it is a fixed cognitive endowment
is not really arguable unless you think
we're angels yeah but if we're part of
the organic world we have fixed
capacities just like I can't fly you
know these capacities have a certain
scope when they have certain limits
that's the nature of capacity or organic
capacities then comes the question okay
what are they in fact of one of these
striking things is what I just mentioned
we are cognitive endowment sort of
compels us to regard the world in
mechanical terms we know that's wrong
yeah but we can't help seeing the world
like that if you look at the moon rising
in in the early evening at the horizon
it's big yeah they get smaller and
smaller it's called the moon illusion we
know it's not true but you can't help
seeing it yeah well I thought of it a
lot and I know it's one of the products
but I think I'll bring Zumba it's like
if you see the world through a window
which is a far distance and you will see
a bridge in the distance well the window
didn't meet you I don't sure that you
would fear the bridge is much bigger
than what it is I mean now you're trying
to give an explanation and there's been
a lot of work on what the explanation is
but whatever and it's not so trivial but
whatever the explanation is we can't
help seeing it okay let me just see it
just like we can't help wrecking that
the world works by
physical interaction contact some other
part of our brain tells us it's not true
because of theories that have been
developed that say it can't work like
that yeah but that can't change our
perception and interpretation because
that's just fixed understand it's a tree
does it mean that our brain is equipped
with a fixed capacity that tells us this
is a tree here's another question where
it's good to be puzzled how do we
identify something as a tree it's not so
simple so for example you plant a tree
say a willow tree which is a good
example it grows at some point you cut a
branch off it and you put that branch in
the ground suppose it grows and becomes
exactly identical to the original tree I
suppose the original tree is cut down is
that new one the same willow tree why
not it's genetically identical it has
all the same properties but we know it's
not the same tree why not I mean and if
you go further it turns out our concept
of tree or rock or person or anything is
extremely interested and furthermore it
see here's another what I think it's
just a classic error that runs right
through philosophy and psychology and
linguistics right up to the moment
that's the the idea that words say
meaning bearing elements
likes a tree or a person or John Smith
or anything pick out something in the
extra mental world something that a
physicist could identify so that if I
have a word say cow it refers to
something and you know a scientist
knowing I think about my brain could
figure out what counts as a cow that's
just not true that's why you have
classic books with names like words and
object word and object coins major book
words and things of Roger Browns major
book that referential assumption it's
simply false about humans it's true of
animals like as far as we know of animal
communication yeah that's actually true
but for humans it's simply untrue
every infant knows it and that poses a
huge evolutionary problem where'd that
come from it opposes an acquisition
problem a descriptive problem an
evolutionary problem it's never been
looked at because everyone assumes well
there's just a relationship that's like
assuming things move to their natural
place we're never going to have a real
understanding of semantics unless those
illusions are thrown in I was young it's
like you get the representation of the
world by symbols first like logically
you would see a dagger and then you
would see the ring of a dog or make the
connection but in your life you get
exposed to a representation of a dog in
a very actually simplified way and then
you go to the or let's say you go
outside and you see a real target that's
really that's not the way it works yeah
that's very common sense or just false
no I'm not I'm saying it's how its
exposed like it makes sense and every
work on philosophy or physics says
exactly that this just happens to be
false and furthermore every infant
noticing fairy stories are based on the
fact that it's false like it take if a
fairy story that any child understands
no no things a child beneath it's a real
dog what I'm saying is like it's not the
point we do not identify dogs in terms
of their physical characteristics what
we identified dogs for example in terms
of a property of psychic continuity like
if which turns a dog into a camel and
then some fairy princess kisses the
camel and turns back to a dog it's been
a dog all along even when it looked like
a camel and that's the basis of
fairytales I was not saying that it's
Noah T is not a physical property it's a
property we impose on things so
therefore there is no hope for finding a
way of identifying the things that are
related to symbols by looking at their
physical properties their individuated
their identified in terms of our mental
constructions so they're basically
mental objects
and that means the whole referential
askance eped has to be thrown out now
you have to look at the relation of
language of the world in some different
fashion so and do you see we constructed
the world in mirroring this image we had
in our mind we do it but we don't do it
the way philosophers and linguists think
we do it
we certainly do it so for example sure
we see the world in terms of trees and
dogs and rivers and so on but then the
question is well what are those concepts
now the standard assumption is those
concepts are linked to physical
identifiable physical things in the
extra mental world and that assumption
is just false
and unless we rid ourselves of that
assumption we won't be able to
understand the way thought and language
relates to the world but that's a topic
that's just taboo and in philosophy in
psychology so they're stuck there like
mechanics free Galileo where everything
went to its natural place as long as you
keep to that for thousands of years you
know we can understand the mechanics of
the world
that's why I think these are the kinds
of reasons why it makes very good sense
to think back to the earliest stages of
the Scientific Revolution not Einstein
that's too sophisticated let's go to the
earliest stages where people had that
incredible intellectual breakthrough and
they said let's be puzzled about what
seems obvious so it why should we take
it to be obvious that if I let go of a
ball it goes down and not at all I mean
sort of obvious but why well as soon as
you're willing to ask that question you
get the beginnings of modern science if
you're not willing to ask that question
you say well it goes down because Long's
on the ground no science develops you
talk in length about how we try to
interpret the world and how we ought to
throw away what's believed in like we
seek a philosophy you say why do we
recognize that this is a different tree
when it's been cut and he grows and it's
identical since then I R read about
genetics and that's
a clone basically when you reproduce a
sexual reproduction so it's a clone so
it's potentially identical but my only
the only answer could given was that I
know it's a different tree because I saw
somebody come and cut it and then grow
again
so I was thinking it's probably less
trivial there's a lot well actually I
think there's a real point there part of
our concept of a tree has to do with a
certain pretty abstract notion of
continuity so the original tree has a
continuous existence which we imposed on
it because genetically speaking the
branch that was cut off is a same object
but when it becomes a tree doesn't have
the kind of continuity that we interpret
as continuity and the different
intelligence but interpret continuity
quite differently and say that the new
one is the real tree that's our
conception of continuity and it's a very
complex one so for example there's a
children's story which my grandchildren
like liked when they were little it's a
story about a donkey named Sylvester and
something happens and it turns Sylvester
into a rock and the rest of the story is
the rock Sylvester trying to explain to
his parents parent donkeys that it's
really their babies Sylvester that's its
children's story to have happy endings
something else happens and it turns him
back to Sylvester and everybody's happy
well the children understand that the
rock although it has none of the
properties of the donkey physical
properties and has all the properties of
a rock is really Sylvester and for
example if he was turned into a camel
later his son would be a jar he's got to
come back and be what he is elastic all
right what that tells you is that
without any instruction of course an
infant understands a certain special
kind of continuity it's a very specific
kind even more much more abstract even
in the case of the tree but there's a
kind of psychic continuity that we
impose that's a part of the
interpretation we impose on the world
- I identifies the objects that are
around us whether it's persons or rivers
or rocks or trees or anything I think I
have an example that maybe make me
understand the concept when I meet a
friend that I didn't see for twenty
years on his appearance it's completely
different
first I feel I'm meeting a different
person and then in the course of the
conversation and it's generally 20
minutes 30 minutes this person become my
friend and the old image of my friend
like his picture become younger than his
so I readjust and I was wondering if
this is a phenomenon that everybody
receive all the time I mean we hear but
is this the same phenomena that we apply
to object the same is with object like
the tree or a river as I take the
Charles River over there the river going
that's the building what makes it the
Charles River you can have substantial
physical changes and it would still be
the Charles River so for example you can
reverse the direction still be the
Charles River you can break it up into
tributaries that end up somewhere else
and would still leave the Charles River
you can change the content so maybe you
build a manufacturing plant upstream and
the content is mostly arsenic let's say
well it's still the Charles River well
it's on the other hand there were very
small changes and little you can make in
which guys won't be Charles River at all
so suppose you put panels along the side
so it goes in a straight path and you
start using it to ship Freight up and
down it's not the river anymore it's
gonna help oh yeah and I suppose you
make some minimal physical change almost
undetectable change which hardens it
it's called a phase change undetectable
but it makes it glass basically and you
paint a line down the middle and people
started using it to commute to Boston
a highway it's not a river no somehow we
can go on and on like this we understand
all these things without instruction
without experience they have to do with
a very complex notions of continuity of
entities a physicist cannot detect
because they're not part of the I mean
of course the physical world is part of
them but it's only one part a major part
of how we identify anything in the world
how elementary is the mental conceptions
that we impose on interpreting very
fragmentary experience and our
experience is indeed very fragmentary so
visual experience is just you know
simulations of the retina but we impose
an extremely rich interpretation of it
including things like say continuity
actually a lot of science fiction is
based on this so if you you know
somebody's in a spaceship and they go
somewhere else and they reappear
well I watched my kids watching these
things they understand immediately that
it's the same person who appeared over
there though there's no continuity on
the other and I asked them sometimes
well suppose that he had this color
rotation or whatever it's called and he
appears over there I suppose he's still
here which one is the person that
definitely you get confused yeah you
don't know because our conceptions don't
give an answer to that actually there
are classical philosophical problems
that are based on this one famous one
what's called the Ship of Theseus goes
back to the Greeks
suppose that Theseus had a ship and he's
on the ocean and one of the boards falls
off so he throws it into the sea and
they put another board they're still the
Ship of Theseus well suppose this keeps
happening until every board has been
replaced
still the Ship of Theseus suppose
someone on the shore has been collecting
all these boards and reconstructs what
in fact was the actual original ship
that's not the Ship of Theseus it's the
one that the thesis is on even though
it's the other one that's physically
identical to it this one isn't so
there's no point trying to solve the
philosophical problem the problem is in
Epis term illogical wanted something
about the nature of our cognitive
systems so it appears that far has
understood non-human animals have a
direct connection between the symbolic
representations in their mind and
identifiable physical events in the
world so you take a verb at monkey which
has alarm calls and apparently those
alarm calls are triggered automatically
by a certain movement of leaves in the
in a tree which they give a predator
called and apparently it's reflexive
