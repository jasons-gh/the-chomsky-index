hi I'm a sky here at MIT with professor
Noam Chomsky a political activist
professor of linguistics philosopher num
Chomsky thank you so much for taking the
time to speak with me today good to be
with you I just want to get into some of
the recent things happening that are
hitting the news right now we have a new
pope I don't know if that's a big thing
for you or if it's interesting at all
but it seems like Pinterest so he read
the New York Times report this morning
of course couple pages of the Pope at
the bottom of one column it quotes the
mothers of the plaza you know that
Argentine mothers have been trying to
gain some attention to the tens of
thousands who were tortured and murdered
and it mentions that he was they're not
happy about the appointment was that his
role was in protecting priests and
objecting to the atrocities was minimal
at best and it had a lights by problem
at the catholic church right now in
general right it's a mixture and a lot
of the the catholic church was in the
forefront of defense of rights and
liberties with those people who were
mostly slaughtered in Argentina to
there's a picture of some of them there
who were slaughtered by us run forces
and El Salvador there was a major war
against the church it was initiated it
after Vatican 2 in 1962 a Vatican 2 was
very important event it essentially
tried to restore the Gospels to the
church theologian Hans kung who was
defrocked by the Vatican afterwards
wrote that
since the 4th century this was the first
time that the church was becoming the
Church of the persecuted not the Church
of the persecutors and that set off
major war in which what happened is that
the Vatican to with its return to the
Gospels that called for what it was
called the preferential option to the
poor and it was particularly strong in
Latin America were bishops ratified and
a couple years later priests nuns lay
people went out into the countryside or
going to admit with peasant groups
organized them partly in base
communities that were called to read the
Gospels and to think about what it meant
Gospels are a radical pacifist a
document so in never very popular on the
powerful including Rome when it took
over the Christianity but and then
invited peasants to think of ways to
organize to protect their own rights
miserably repressive society so so as a
South American of being the first South
American Club obviously I do you see
this as a significant change for the
church I know the significant change
came very quickly the Vatican lined up
with the United States United States
provided the muscle they provided they
assisted in trying to beat this heresy
back they don't want to have the Gospels
be let's you're taken seriously and
there's a whole long bloody list of
religious martyrs that follows many of
them killed by the United States and so
I most live in fact well the otic
Vatican on the side tried to eliminate
the prominent liberation theologist this
was called trying to eliminate them in
one way or another and there's no big
secret about who was responsible the US
Army takes credit for Oh
School of the Americas which trains
Latin American officers killers mostly
and it's talking points its advertising
point says proudly that the US Army help
defeat liberation theology that did find
blood shed behind it the new pope was
not he was opposed to liberation
theology he didn't shoot people but he
didn't defend dozens of priests who were
being murdered in Argentina for others
and that's the reason for the complaints
by the protests by the mothers and other
civil libertarians and just now the word
on South America obviously that seems
like a region undergoing a lot of change
we have the death of if you go shop is
in Venezuela I what do you see as the
future of that country right now I mean
that's a pretty big deal is that right
now well then as well as part one part
of what has been a much broader change
all over Latin American Chavez played a
role in it or serve in Israel itself it
was a significant role but he also
significant in helping to bring about
some form of unification of the
hemisphere and move towards freeing
themselves from Imperial control but it
was not the only ones happened in the
most of the countries and it's dramatic
the past 10 years I've seen a change of
actually historic significance I mean if
you back to the conquistadors 500 years
ago since then latin america's pretty
much been in Thorold Western Force the
United States and more recent times now
it's pretty much free well what will his
legacy and B is that will it be more
that of being an oppressor or one it
being a liberator I mean because you
have such a bizarre I thought was so
interesting to look at some pictures of
the funeral you had Jesse Jackson there
you had a Sean Penn and then you have
off Medina jog had this incredible range
if people from all that's the way it's
presented you have you also had
the president Brazil president Chile
very right wing president of Columbia
also very right wing also ball they are
in fact most of Latin America was there
in fact about the only countries and
Adams you're missing where the United
States and Canada President of Mexico
was there also conservative and all of
this is whatever one thinks about him
it's a in recognition of the role that
he played in turn forward this historic
liberation of Latin America it is it
fair to say that he was a damaging
figure those who served me destructive
to the ridge oligarchy through us power
and he had harmful effects in other ways
and by no means that i had like frat
freedoms their question for his ability
bit of the truth he yeah i was a strong
opposition for us bitterly attacking him
all the time there's much more of an
opposition for us and there is a most of
that that's nicely written right i mean
those that my understanding was that it
was mostly meeting britain press that
was free but to being TV channels were
increasingly strike global vision which
is cable TV a huge audience was very any
to Chavez I mean said he was criticized
Ferdinand for summary there is some
regression of the press but it's mostly
kind of verbal intimidation and said
there was one channel RC TV that's the
famous foods and on what is that bad
night which was shut down actually
wasn't shut down was moved over to cable
that's not considered a huge punishment
in most of the world and I continued the
function and I was asked about the time
I said I agreed that it was the wrong
thing to do and then it couldn't happen
in the United States but I added
something which prevented my comment
from being published I said it could
happen in the United States because if
say CBS had done anything like what RCTV
would have done had done you wouldn't
wait a couple of years for their license
to be shifted the cable because the
managers and owners would have been
lined up before fires squad shot they
supported I supported the overthrow of
the government of cool that overthrew
the government they helped the coup I
suppose that that happened to hear well
they're saying if a major network was
opposing US policy in the same way even
sit hasselt it was a military coup in
the United States which overthrew the
throughout the government kidnapped the
president disbanded Congress disbanded
Supreme Court fact all institutions I
suppose that CBS was helping it out all
along that applauding it and then it was
overturned by popular uprising that what
would have happened to CBS okay that's
why I say I agree that it couldn't have
happened to hear all right because it
wouldn't have arisen because we have
been killed right away I don't want to
make it sound as if there's in fact I've
personally been involved maybe more than
almost anyone else and protesting some
human rights violations which I think
we're pretty serious however on the
overall he it's hard to deny the
positive aspects of his legacy if you
read say I'm to its credit the new york
times ran an op-ed by Lou la the most
influential figure and South America and
take a look at it he was strong esporta
Chavez not on critically but it's quite
a lot of dairy description he poverty
was very harshly sharply reduced
literacy increased sharply health
benefits
extended the much of the population it's
but it's charged here regularly that
Venezuela had a very low growth rate
under Chavez and I'd say well with all
that oil income must been terrible but
take a closer look the coup first it was
the coup of course harmed the economy
then there wasn't a capital strike the
oil industry which was private was shut
down by school hero labor strike it's
actually the technicians of the owner to
the capital strike which walked oil
export there was huge capital flight
from the country after Chavez finally
took over the oil industry if you count
economic growth since then that's quite
respectable you could say it would be
better this money of inefficiencies lot
of crime a lot of corruption summer this
kind of healthiest element to it which
generally but there were positive
aspects that you can see it in the
reaction he's enormous boredom of the
poor majority is do you think if they
had a more open leader or a different
type of leader that might be supported
that that Chavez is just kind of what
they know so that's why it's important
they know a lot bit list through
dictatorships formal democracies in
which they were totally repressed this
is the first government everyone
concedes that gave the population a
sense that of empowerment that there's a
government for them fact if you look at
there are polls they don't get reported
here but there's a very respected
polling agency in Chile let you know
barometer than they do regular polls and
popular attitudes throughout lobman are
kind of in turn quite serious on
the measures like support for democracy
or support for the government or
happiness you know things like that
Avengers what else right quite I Andhra
Chavez it's not insignificant you and I
can think what we want the important
thing is with Venezuelan stick and a lot
of them hate him with a passion
including so it's a dangerous thing to
hey I guess not at this point but it
would be a dangerous thing to Haven mad
as he was in power right I mean it
wouldn't be a dangerous thing nothing to
happen to also there's like judge yummy
yeah yeah yeah that's the case I've
worked on human truffle years yes there
are couple of cases I've been very much
involved in it but for the most part
opposition is pretty free and open it's
not like to the US domains where people
get slaughtered it's not like that
painting you can see over there if you
look behind it which is about El
Salvador us that given to me by Jesuit
priests depicts the murders the
archbishop murder of the archbishop
while he was reading mass that's the
beginning of the decade of the 80s the
Reagan decade then the end of the decade
1989 depicts six leading Latin American
intellectuals Jesuit priests and their
house key for a daughter their brains
were blown out by elite forces armed and
trained by the United States acting on
the orders of the high command close to
the American Embassy they had just
returned from special training renewed
training at the John F Kennedy School
Special Warfare went back got their
orders to blow the brains out of leading
Latimer
intellectuals and did it the u.s.
embassy kind of denied it nobody really
denies it anymore but I bet you can't
name one of them if it happened takes a
walkie everybody would learn about it in
fourth grade very far the modern age but
it happened under US and it's all over
dozens of free skilled in columbia in
fact is a trail of blood miserables
trail of blood a lot of it church
martyrs most of the usual victims
peasants workers and so on that's all
under the USCG event as well that there
there's think to criticize and about it
it's nothing like neighbor in columbia
right next door or hundreds thousands of
people in killed as the second-largest
displaced population in the world in
large part because of american chemical
warfare it's called the fumigation but
in fact it destroys crops and then in
their number of times and it's sometimes
you go to the south and you can't even
go into the countryside was to danger
paramilitaries military of venality
guerrillas have turned into another army
attacking the peasant but since the
militarization sharp militarization
under Clinton and I think the latest
figures i saw about 150,000 killed and
last couple decades magnetism i'm
mentioning clinton how we're now of
course with President Obama how do you
feel about him in his second term I
supposed to lead like the first term
smoking burger in fact the shortly after
Obama's you see any kind of difference
do you see him doing anything different
from a foreign policy perspective agree
with Afghanistan or a rock or if you've
been Iran and of course there are
directors what's happened to attract is
absolutely
let me go back to nineteen ninety Saddam
Hussein was awful but we might remember
that he was one of the favors of the
United States in fact in 1990 of George
Bush the first was president he invited
Iraqi nuclear engineers to come to the
United States for advanced training in
weapons production that was part of the
affection for Saddam Hussein that's 1990
that most of his horrible atrocities
were already passed United States didn't
care about in fact denied them but 1990
he does it from the 90 so they were Iraq
was put under extreme sanctions us
uncaged sanctions devastated the country
in fact the administrators of the
sanctions respected international
diplomats tense holiday house most Bonin
both resigned in protest be called the
sanctions Jenna Seidel France opponent
wrote a very detailed book about it
which is mountains ever been mentioned
in the United review in the United
States then came the war which completed
it by now Iraq which had been the most
advanced country in the Arab world could
educate very good educational system
cloody higher education high literacy
and so on repressive undoubtedly but now
it's a it's a total ruin the educational
systems were destroyed the huge a
massacre of the educated class or uh
sliver of spell hundreds of thousands
killed he's huge the US invasion usj
invasion elicited a ethnic conflict
which had really not existed before fact
that communities were more or less
intermingled but then if again a total
hard it's now spread over the much of
the Middle East this is one of the worst
disasters the reach
has suffered for a long time there are
some Victor's that the u.s. was defeated
it had to abandon all its war aims of
Iraq was of course destroyed but their
victors the main ones who ran the end
result of the invasion as was not in an
unanticipated was to strengthen Iran's
influence she had government took over
Iran's gained influence not the only
other Victor is a better outside I don't
know the Iraqi government is now
supporting him so that's roughly the
result of George Bush number two's
policies in Iraq in it with regard to
Iran we're now imposing again very harsh
sanctions and as usual they harm the
population they don't affect the
leadership they need and strengthen it
if they didn't Saddam's keys but they
certainly part of the population so in
some ways does it affect the leadership
though if they're watching their country
lose value if they're watching
themselves become isolated from the
world they're not isolated from the
world the rice elated from the west they
remember the obsession with Iran is a
Western obsession as an online countries
which is most of the world strongly
support Iran's right to enrich uranium
the Arab world which is right next door
plenty of poles were taken by leading us
bowling agencies you know what people
think they don't like Iran possibilities
go back dislike you around but they
don't regard as a threat is it a fair
assessment to say that a nuclear Iran
would be a threat enough that that would
be something now yet they had an actual
weapon that there would be something
depends referred as a second I mean
nowhere near as much of a threat is
another
three right nearby that has a couple
hundred nuclear weapons in fact if you
Israel if you ask opinion in the Arab
world Arab world they do receive threats
the top one is Israel and the second one
is the United States those are the
threats they see that's instantly one of
the reasons why the US and its allies
are so opposed to democracy in the art
world because democracy means public
opinion influences quality they make
talk democracy but obviously opposed to
them and so it's basically a Western
obsession but is there anything to do
about it whatever you think the threat
is you know let's let's say there's a
threat I mean I think there's a threat
up first of all the government's a real
threat to its own population but that's
not unusual it's a harsh regime but
nothing like say our best friends Saudi
Arabia much larger but whatever threat
of the nuclear program poses are there
ways to deal with it Williamson very
plausible ways for example in May 2010
there was a agreement signed between
Brazil Turkey and Iran for Iran to ship
its low enriched uranium out of the
country to Turkey for storage and in
return the nuclear powers would provide
them with what they need for their
medical reactors as soon as that was
signed take a look the press immediate
the government US government bitterly
condemned Turkey and Brazil for
overcoming the threat the press
denounced Brazil and Turkey for their in
subordination the the head of the IE
Mohamed ElBaradei far ahead of the
International Atomic Energy Agency he
said the United States refuses to take
yes for an answer at that point the
foreign minister of Brazil Brazil
remembers our poster voice farm Ezra
Brazil was annoyed and he released a
letter from Obama to president of Brazil
and which Obama proposed this to Brazil
said look this is what we propose
presumably assuming that your ad
wouldn't agree and you'd make some
propaganda points but they agreed and so
therefore we denounced them on Obama
immediately went to the UN for harsher
sanctions that's you could try to read
renew that out of it work but you could
try how is a much broader proposal and I
very much more significant one which has
overwhelming international support
overwhelming so much so that the Obama
is compelled to formally say you know
nice idea but no no that's to move
towards establishing a nuclear
weapons-free zone in the region that
would be a broader frozen enormous
support is there any way part of their
way to do it let me continue last
December there was to be an
international meeting in Finland to
carry this forward in November early
November Iran stated that they would
attend the meeting within days Obama had
canceled the meeting and to that effort
that's a very concrete way to deal with
to move forward Americans can't for a
test about this for for very simple
reason unless there they carry out their
own private research programs they can't
know about it there was not a word about
any of this in the present that's a
interesting example of
if freedom that perfect is another no
government course but you can't know
about it presume you didn't of and
there's much more like this so there are
questions about who cares about the
threat there are questions about how the
threat could be addressed but they're
not part of the political system where
the political class or media
presentation would they work when you
don't know until you try it wasn't right
think about a couple of his quick
questions if you were say editor of the
New York Times today you are controlling
the current US media what would be the
biggest change you would make to what
would that how that might look around
right at the edges what ought to be on
the front page big headline saying Obama
kills best method for dealing with what
he calls the greatest threat to world
peace and then you run through what I
just described which is right in front
of us now you know okay that would be
one thing more so for example take
domestic issues the Unites is a heavily
polled society we know what people think
it has a lot of literature about it in
the political science profession take
the biggest domestic issue right now
we're kind of no suffering under the
sequester asked it with a deficit how do
you deal with the deficit well what does
the public think about this mostly it's
a system the deficit isn't a big issue
the public thinks the major issues jobs
which requires stimulus which in fact
requires a bigger deficit because that's
the stimulus they don't feel that the
deficit is much of an issue and they're
not alone what most of the business
press agrees with that but I think now's
the time to push the accelerator we'll
worry about the very plater well who
cares about it the bank's the investment
firms of the very wealthy so therefore
that's the
the merit the public thinks in fact it
was just a study came out a couple days
ago by well-known political scientists
in page northwestern just looking at the
polls in more detail and finding out he
repeated what everyone looks bulls knows
that for the public overwhelmingly
issues jobs not the deficit and then he
stratified the responses by wealth it
turns out the wealthy I think the
deficit is the issue go down the wealth
level most the population thinks of jobs
well that tells you something about how
democracy works that would be a
front-page story that we can continue I
just my last question so we have
President Obama he's in his final term
what would he need to do to get a num
tomski approved legacy what would be the
biggest never a couple of example he
could they could use his power as
president it could have used his powers
president to push through a much better
health than he did I mean for example
but more comprehensive and our look I
mean at the time when it was pushed
through it's better than what existed
before just like improvement but one
possibility was to allow public option
his choice allow the public to choose a
national health care system of the kind
of just but every other country that's
very strong it was majority support for
that substantial majority support he
gave it away without even running didn't
have to of course insurance companies
wouldn't like it and so on but you don't
have to okay it seems like we have such
a momentum it's that difficult to change
that or worried enough where was the
momentum poignant started the first
place oh yeah that's a great I tell me
what's you know these are decisions that
are made decisions that are made or to
the cater to the wealthy and powerful
just look on the deficit right well I
know Chomsky thank you so much for
taking the time to talk to me but a
pleasure
