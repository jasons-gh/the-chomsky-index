all we hear are these people are trying
to get into our country this is a these
threats are coming from all over the
place why are they coming where are they
coming from so uh we want this really to
be like a discussion like very organic
and but I'd like to leave it at that
part and maybe have a professor Chomsky
if you if you like to talk about
neoliberal policies and stuff like that
my main contribution to this issue is to
have two daughters one of them avi who
you mentioned is one of the leading
specialists on this topic in fact you
just came back from a couple of weeks in
Arizona with students at the college
where she teaches Salem State and others
doing butter murder monitoring legal
work and nogales were a lot of
immigrants sir people are caught on this
side of the border put into what amounts
to cattle cars and trucked through
Nogales and dumped in Mexico on the
Mexican side there's things called court
cases but it's kind of like military
commissions doesn't count as a court
case and another daughter who just
decided he still was a brown student
incidentally and after graduating and
working at the American math society for
a while decided she wanted to live like
a third-world woman so she went down to
Nicaragua she's been living there
kids so they're on the other side Gabe
mentioned that most of this started in
the early 90s and the reason why it
started in the early 90's in fact 1994
the year when Clinton initiated
operation gatekeeper militarizing the
border was the same year that nafta
passed and it was understood that by its
a large percentage of its profits from
state subsidies thanks to ronald reagan
another free market a possible so it's
going to undermine Mexican agriculture
is going to drive people off the land
and they also understood that Mexican
businesses cannot compete with us
corporations huge US corporations which
are allowed to which are granted the
right of what's called national
treatment in Mexico so if say General
Motors invests in Mexico they are
entitled to claim the same treatment as
a Mexican company now that's a right
that holds only for corporations not for
people if a Mexican manages to come to
New York and ask for national treatment
if he's lucky he won't be in Guantanamo
but these are special rights granted the
corporations among the many that are
granted corporations well above those
that human beings have and NAFTA and
trying a lot of them they're also in the
World Trade Organization rules and in
the whole so-called neoliberal framework
well there's another factor throughout
the 1980s the US was carrying out
murderous terrorist Wars all through
Central America a lot of the people who
are coming or indigenous people from
farther south
amala saw that or these places were
devastated hundreds of thousands of
people were killed at all kind of
torture and terror is almost all due to
there have been truth Commission's
almost all the responsibility of the
us-run state terrorist forces or in the
case of Nicaragua contr army just a
mercenary force so the in some areas
like say the Guatemalan Highlands Mayan
areas it was real genocide you know I'm
the total devastation actually there are
Mayan communities around here they keep
kind of quiet because as undocumented
immigrants do and also around not too
well near where my daughter lives she's
working with Mayan groups that are up
there well these people were started to
were fleeing from disasters a part of it
was just the terrorist disaster of
Reagan's Wars part of it as the
neoliberal disaster that is the
imposition of a certain kind of economic
regime which required cutback in state
services that cutback in services for
the poor and the you know local
development and so on an acceptance of
what's called opening up which means you
give up to the highest the biggest power
so like us agribusiness or us
manufacturers who turned parts of Mexico
into assembly plants from which Mexico
gets very little but it's good for the
corporation's it's terrible for American
workers but that's not one of the goals
of policy I mean American in the United
States and for a majority of the
population real wages have pretty much
stagnated for about 30 years that's the
neoliberal period during the period of
financialization of the economy here and
hollowing out of production which means
you don't stop production but it's just
done elsewhere you know like Mexico
China Vietnam that's fine for the banks
and it's great for the owners and
stockholders but it's terrible for the
population here and it's much worse for
the population Mexico in fact NAFTA is
one of those rare treaties may be the
only one which is actually harmed the
majority of the population in all three
participating countries Canada the
United States and Mexico and of course
Mexico worst and in addition to that
comes the the treatise of the American
wars and Central America and all trying
to flee the timing of the militarization
of the border is not accidental and
American plant the American population
was opposed to NAFTA so were the
Canadians in Mexico we don't have very
good evidence but it looks like Mexicans
were opposed to so this was not an
agreement at least if people are part of
their countries it's called the North
American Free Trade Agreement I'm the
only accurate words in that Fraser North
American it was in mexico united states
and canada it wasn't an agreement if
people are part of their countries
because they were posed that certainly
wasn't a free trade agreement it has
highly protectionists tellement and a
lot of it isn't about trade at all like
for example granting national treatment
to US corporations as nothing to with
trade trade is put in there so you can
sort of sell it and free is put in there
make it sound good but it's a it's a an
agreement designed and the interests of
the people who designed it it's not a
great surprise it was designed by
multinational corporations and the few
states hours in particular that
primarily cater to their interests and
sure so they're doing fine after all
it's their treaty but the population is
not and there's actually nothing new
about this I mean these are truisms it
goes back to the origins of
industrialization if I can read about
this and Adam Smith which does a worship
Adam Smith that's what to read him too
dangerous the dangerous radical I mean
one of the things he pointed out is that
it he was concerned with England they
said in England and his Day 1776 this is
wealth of nations what he called the
principal architects of policy are the
merchants and manufacturers of England
and they Institute policies which make
sure that their interests are well
catered to however Grievous the effect
on others including the population of
England that's not their concern and of
course even worse what he called the
savage and justice of the British in
India he's an old-fashioned conservative
we had moral values you'd have to be a
diagenesis to find one today but he was
a real old-fashioned conservative he had
moral values and you could see
elementary truths like the fact that
policy is designed by those who
concentrate economic power in their
hands and they design policy for their
own good no matter what happens to
others that's secondary well things
haven't changed that much since 1776 now
these views are called you know radical
or Marxist there's some other bad word
but they're just truisms I'm in a free
country and learn in elementary school
how else could it work no it's amazing
that didn't work that way and NAFTA is a
perfectly good example it was designed
by now it doesn't have the merchants and
manufacturers it's you know financial
institutions and multinational
corporations but the logic is pretty
much the same what happens to the
population is what's called in economics
courses and externality if you've taken
an economics course you know that when
you make a transaction know by a car or
something the participants in a
transaction according to economic theory
look out for their own interests and
then they're kind of like side effects
what happens to other people that's a
footnote that's called an externality
you know the externalities can be pretty
large like say the current financial
crisis is an externality
when the goldman sachs and you know AIG
and so on make transactions they look
out for their own benefit they don't pay
attention to what's called systemic risk
the risk that the whole thing is going
to collapse and their right not to do
that because then since they are the
masters pretty much run the government
they can count on the government to
ensure that a taxpayer bails them out so
they should make risky investments and
loans because they got a insurance
policy from you so yeah that's the way
they do it and there are other
externalities which are even worse of
course the people of Mexico and
Guatemala and El Salvador in the United
States their fate is an externality but
so is the fate of our grandchildren for
example if you take a look today's polls
last couple of days their new polls on
attitudes of Americans towards global
warming and it keeps going down and by
now about a third of the population
think that they believe in anthropogenic
global warming humans have something to
do with global warming it's it's being
relentlessly driven down by a massive
propaganda viraj telling people it's all
liberal hoax so forget about it now you
know the guys who are running these
campaigns know perfectly well that the
liberal hoax is very real and it could
destroy the lives of their grandchildren
in fact could destroy everything they
own and in their personal lives you know
decent human beings they understand it
but in their institutional lives as say
executives of the corporation they have
to play an institutional role the
institutional role is maximize profit
and market share in fact that's a legal
requirement and ignore the externalities
well in this case the externality
happens to be the survival of the
species but the logic is the same the
same as systemic risk the same as Adam
Smith's Grievous effects on the
population of England these are inherent
properties of market systems and
implement efficiencies if you like but
they're massive well NAFTA had these
effects as anticipated forums began in
Mexico in the 1980s they were the result
of policies and actually what happened
is the World Bank and the US Treasury
and others had been through the 70s had
been trying to you know induce you know
the man the man there insists that third
world countries borrow like mad from us
lenders so they were tremendously these
usually third-world dictators they did
what they were told so they should
borrow from US banks and they did they
were hugely in debt American banks were
wildly overexposed to debt like
Citigroup which is collapsing now also
collapsed in 1981 and was bailed out by
your parents that's the way the system
works the the debt crashed when Reagan
came in actually Carter Lake Carter
early Reagan and Paul Folker you know it
was fed had raised interest rates very
high to wipe out inflation in the
American economy well us went into a
deep recession it's Reagan recession I
bet it pulled out its rich country on
the other hand the third world countries
couldn't their debts were indexed to us
inflation so as at the US dollar as it
went down they got huge debts which they
couldn't pay the punishment for that was
what were called structural adjustment
programs in the united states if the
rich guys crash the economy we bail them
out but in the poor countries if the
rich guys crashed the economy the poor
billed amount is called a structural
adjustment program being used stop
public services you need it cut back on
support for agriculture you put all your
money into paying debts
so on in fact the prescriptions for the
poor countries the exact opposite of the
prescriptions for the rich countries
here when you have a recession they
going to produce it a big stimulus you
know it builds out the bankers and so on
and so forth poor countries the opposite
you pay off your debts cut back
production you cut back services and you
suffer that's how you pay it off the
poor people the mass of the population
didn't they didn't the debts were not
owned by them you know they didn't have
anything to do with the debts the debts
were incurred by their wealthy rulers
but the poor pay it off it's a racket
the racket is known as the International
Monetary Fund the executive director of
it an American was honest enough to
describe it as the credit communities
enforcer meaning if rich banks here make
loans to third-world dictators and they
can't pay him back then the poor in the
country that borrowed pay our credit
creditors here and it's only so so does
the north american taxpayer they pay off
the banks to make sure that you know
they're doing fine it's just what's
happening before our eyes it keeps
happening regularly it's built into the
system it notice that this is exactly
the opposite of what a capitalist
economy would be a lot of talk about
capitalism which is mostly a joke I mean
in a capitalist economy if I lend you
money and you know that and I know that
it's risky you know so I'll lend it at a
high interest rate because it might go
sour so I make a lot of money for the
interest and if it turns out at some
point that you can't pay that's my
problem not in the international scene
if Citigroup makes a loan to Mexico and
those it's risky so they high interest
rates they get a ton of profit and then
it crashes it doesn't work like a
capitalist system they don't pay for it
they don't suffer for it the American
taxpayer bails them out and the poor in
the poor countries have to pay off
the debt by structural adjustment
programs so Mexico was every country
that's been subjected to these
neoliberal rules including even us has
suffered from it like growth radically
declined there will other macro economic
measures decline and pretty obvious why
but the rich did fine just like here
we're kind of like a microcosm of it
we're such a rich country it doesn't
have the same facts but it's basically
the same structure well okay here you
have a bunch of attacks on the country
south of the border the neoliberal
programs the terrorist wars the you know
the flooding of their productive
apparatus buy subsidized us agribusiness
by major US corporations they can't
compete with one of the obvious effect
is this going to be a flow of people
from the devastated countries to the
rich country which is responsible for it
so that's illegal immigration up until
the early 90s the border was pretty open
it was porous border same people have
done both sides they cross the border to
visit their families and that sort of
thing like other boarders it was based
on conquest the United States just
conquered half of Mexico what we call
the southwest is Mexico that's why the
city names you know san francisco to los
angeles orel Spanish names it was Mexico
we conquered it and it was a pretty open
border but once it was clear to the
Clinton administration that there's
going to be a flood of people coming as
a result of the policies they're
imposing a militarized the border that's
why it starts in the early 90s and it's
gotten harsher and harsher as the
effects get worse and worse the
punishment gets harsher and harsher and
it has an internal effect here it's a
way of disciplining the domestic
population so enough to tell you this
huge propaganda here to get people to
blame their plight on illegal immigrants
you know if I don't have a job and
my wages have stagnated for 30 years
because the Liberals are giving
everything away to the illegal
immigrants now you want to hear this
just listen to Rush Limbaugh you know
Glenn Beck Sarah Palin tea parties
that's a good way of making sure that
the people who you're smashing in the
face don't do anything about it and
blame someone else like the Nazis blamed
the Jews you know okay we blame the
illegal immigrants and the blacks
they're the ones responsible for what
we're suffering so it's a way of
controlling and disciplining this
population too and it's not that they
didn't know what they were doing they
know exactly what they were doing you go
back to the top planning it around
nineteen ninety you know at that time in
the government for example there was a
Latin American strategy workshop in the
Pentagon in 1990 where they were looking
over the long-term consequences actually
of us-mexico relations and they decided
that us-mexico relations were great it's
true that Mexico is full of torture and
starvation these insignificant things
but relations were great but they
noticed one cloud on the horizon the
cloud was what they called a democracy
opening in Mexico there might be a
democracy opening in Mexico which would
threaten the domination of us political
power over Mexico so you had to stop a
democracy opening well one way to do it
was NAFTA that in fact it was understood
that NAFTA I'm quoting now would lock
Mexico into the reforms term reform
doesn't mean reform it means you know
doing things our way that's called a
reform so it would lock Mexico into the
neoliberal programs by a treaty so if
the danger that was a democracy opening
took place there would be anything they
could do about it because it be locked
in by treaty okay that's NAFTA you lock
the program's in by treaty and then if a
dangerous democracy opening takes place
well we're kind of protected from it
this is the open thinking it's perfectly
sensible it's just Adam Smith's truisms
applied to the current period and it
shows up in all kind of ways I mean one
of the interesting ways it shows up as
in American law I mean you know you've
when you were in junior high school you
read the amendments of the Constitution
there is an amendment called the 14th
amendment which says that no person
shall be deprived of rights without due
process okay no person well that's no
good and the courts have since changed
that law in two ways for one thing they
both expanded and restricted the notion
of person so over the late 19th century
and primarily about a century ago
corporations were given the rights of
persons this infuriated conservatives
because they're the direct attack on the
principles of classical liberalism which
holds that rights in here in persons not
legal fictions that are constructed by
government laws but corporations were
given the rights of persons and slowly
that meant freedom speech freedom from
search and seizure you know on and on
and then when you get to the trade
agreements they get rights away beyond
persons as I mentioned so that's one way
in which the notion of person was
changed in fact one the fourth courts
that when the courts dealt with
Fourteenth Amendment cases was almost
all for corporations I'm the intent of
the people who initiated it was for
slaves to be protected by it but they're
poor and weak and so on so they had no
way of appealing the corporations are
big and strong so they did and the
courts gradually incorporated them into
the notion of person and now it goes way
beyond just last January the courts
Supreme Court gave corporations the
rights to buy elections you know
even so you can buy elections because
your persons persons have freedom of
speech and money is speech so you want
to buy election go ahead and do it so
that's one change in the notion person
the other change is what do you do about
people like undocumented aliens well
okay the courts have decided over the
years that they are not persons
literally so these people are being
picked up by the border control Patrol
stuck in cattle cars if they make it
alive and ship back across the border
they're not under the jurisdiction of
the Fourteenth Amendment because they're
not persons and in fact if you look at
what's going on Congress the two
political parties are sort of competing
with each other to see which one can be
more savage and denying rights to these
non persons who happen to be here
without papers and all of this goes on
at the same time that the courts and
much of Congress is granting more rights
to General Motors than General Electric
and the goldman sachs and so on because
they are persons in fact super persons
well that's our legal system and you
know nobody talks about it because
that's the way power supposed to operate
and you're not supposed to know about it
then I supposed to be able to read the
words of the Fourteenth Amendment
because that's too scary no so people
can scream about taking our Constitution
away from us but they're not talking
about this these are real things and
it's playing out in human lives the way
you're describing very brutally in fact
and it's this new law that's coming
through is a real horror in fact the law
that's coming through criminalizes
everybody in Arizona who looks as if
they might be latina I mean they could
have been born here their parents going
to be born here they have to walk around
with documents all the time I mean just
think I you'd feel if you had to walk
around with documents all the time
proving you're a citizen you know you
have to have them because the police
have the right to stop you if they think
you might not be pure white they were
right to stop you and demand that you
give proof of citizenship and if you
don't have to have it on you he can be
sentenced and furthermore other citizens
you know the blue-eyed blonde ones if
they see somebody walking down the
street and a police looks latino and the
policeman doesn't stop them they can sue
the police for not stopping and
demanding their citizenship so this
essentially criminalizes substantial
part of the population in fact the part
that comes from the country which we
conquered you know we conquered it and
took it and there's a lot of people
there who what we call latino and
background okay they are criminalized
and as you said this can easily extend
beyond in fact under Obama it's gotten
much worse I mean the number of raids on
to toss out undocumented immigrants has
increased pretty sharply under Obama in
fact it's about a week or two ago
there's a big federal operation which I
think the biggest one ever which
acquittal huge number of a lot of
planning caught a huge number of
undocumented aliens and ship them across
the border I mean these going to be
people who lived here since childhood
you know families jobs doesn't matter
they're not persons so we do what we
want to them well that's if we accept it
that's the society we live in
thank you for kind of illuminating a bit
of the background as to why we're seeing
the border look the way it does now
that's you know the economic policies
ask the political decisions that have
been cool it's a nut and so we're kind
of looking to have a bit of a
conversation now about what is happening
on the border how those broader economic
political decisions are as you after you
put it you know playing out and human
life and to kind of describe a bit more
about the work that the work that we're
doing what we're seeing on the ground
and how this all turns relate and so
we're hoping that kind of open it up for
questions but before we do that I
actually want to talk a little bit about
some of the abuse documentation work
that no more des does because that is
what runs through was doing actually
over spring break new more desperate
alternative Spring Break program we also
operate camps out in the desert for four
months out of the summer on when the
heat often goes over 110 degrees during
the day and the abuse documentation work
is is we're increasingly we're seeing a
lot of these patterns in terms of what's
happening with the raids and also
hearing stories of the abuses that are
happening in detention facilities and in
short-term custody the Florida patrol
and so volunteers with no more ducks and
with a lot of other organizations will
take you know when people are deported
they come back over the border a lot of
times at night they'll you know have
that medical care available to them
through a phone call home to maybe tell
their family what happened and it used
to be more so that a lot of the stories
that volunteers were hearing from
migrants that were being deported were
the stories of subsistence farming that
was pretty much undercut by these
broader policies on people that had that
have lost everything and had no choice
but to come north to try to take care of
their families and increasingly now with
you document a shin work
more stories of long-term residents that
had been living people that have lived
in the US for 10 11 15 20 30 years maybe
their entire lives aside from when they
were little kids and they came up with
or their parents who have been picked up
in either these ice roads or they have
been reported to ice by employers you
know if they are asking for an increase
in their wages or something like that
are caught up in the criminal system and
are being deported through some of the
subtleties of innovation long rest that
are reporting also that's that's one
element of it so profiles where we're
hearing a lot of stories of families
that are being broken up that are being
completely set apart and people that are
trying to get back into the u.s. to
reunite with with our their spouses and
their children and their jobs in and the
communities but we're also hearing a lot
more stories of extreme abuse at the
hand of Border Patrol officials and
people enemies detention facilities as
well so there's a lot of stories that
even came out of the spring break just
recently a border patrol officers
breaking bones of people that they
encounter of pushing people into cactus
but they know that they encounter in the
desert of psychological torture in terms
of see if you're picked up and it's very
very hot out there often and then you're
put into a truck crowded with a group of
other people and then the AC is turned
on you're already dehydrated and what
that does to your system people being
forced to sign documents that aren't
translated for them and signing if
they're well having their possessions
thrown away in front of them and so
that's another element that we're seeing
on that kind of this is changing with
this dynamic to a long of what's
happening on the border but also what's
happening in communities domestically
how families are being broken apart how
people are trying to get back in to see
their family and how bored of
militarization is is playing a part in
that so I just kind of wanted to
describe a little bit about that because
that's another element besides the death
pole which by all accounts is largely an
accurate because a lot of people that go
missing are never found but there's also
these extremely severe abuse
that are happening to people as well
that are crossing in and be picked up
well most of this is for you but just
one comment on the incarceration the
incarceration is a neoliberal phenomenon
if you go back to the 1970s before the
neoliberal programs were instituted here
the prison the rate of incarceration in
the United States was approximately the
same as you were a little bit on the
high end but pretty much the same and a
crime in the United States is pretty
much the same as other industrial
countries actually there's one exception
in the United States homicides with guns
but that's because it a crazed guns gun
laws but if you take that away you know
you look at the rest of crime it's
approximately like other comparable
countries and the prison rate was too
now the prison rate is about five to ten
times as high as other comparable
countries not because of more crime this
is a way of getting rid of the
superfluous population it's mostly black
or Hispanic mostly men and if you look
at the history of African Americans in
the United the reason was that as the
economy started becoming financially and
you know production gets hollowed out
there just aren't jobs for these people
they're superfluous I mean one of our
dependencies like Columbia the way they
handle it is by what's called social
cleansing you send out the military and
the paramilitary a murderer okay we're
more civilized so we thrown into prison
but the the pot the incarceration rate
has risen steadily from the late Carter
years through Reagan through Clinton
right up till today as the neoliberal
programs have proceeded so that's
another aspect of it and in fact if you
take a look at the history of
african-americans in the United States I
mean we all know that there was slavery
until the Civil War what very few people
know is that slavery was reinstituted
after the Civil War by criminalization
there was a compact between the North
and the South in 1877 after
the reconstruction was ended which
essentially allowed the south to a
criminalized black life literally some
black guys standing on a street corner
you can arrest him for vagrancy he looks
the wrong way or somebody claims he
looks the wrong way at a white woman you
can arrest him for attempted rape that's
really charge maybe ten dollars but the
system set up so he's in there for life
he has to pay the corrupt judge and the
lawyer it doesn't have it so they're in
there for life and they became a slave
labor force in fact a lot of the u.s.
industrial revolution is based on slave
labor from criminals in the south what
are called criminals and south like us
steel would go down there in a terrific
labor force the state gives you the
workforce free you don't have to pay any
attention to them you if they die you
get more that's an endless supply of
cheap labor and a much of the American
industrial revolution you know steel
mines and so on comes out of that well
that went on until the Second World War
the Second World War you needed free
labor for war industry so it ended and
there was a black migration to the north
and there were jobs because people had
to go into war industry the huge
increase in production and that
persisted through the post-war period
there was a kind of a post-war boom you
know went through the 50s and 60s when
say a black man could get it say a job
in an auto plant and get a pretty decent
life you know in my house and get a car
and so on well by the 70s I was over
policies changed now we direct policies
towards financial enriching financial
institutions and stopping productive
labor here what do you do with those
people stick them back in jail where
they're in fact again used for labor
force labor you look at the whole
history of african-americans in the
United States is it a couple of decades
which there was some sort of relative
freedom but that talk about the border
so if for example if this bill passes
very likely that the rest of the country
can see repercussions because it's
succeeding in Arizona we tend to get
like the harshest laws passed another
example for another example of HB 2008
which passed in November said that
anyone going to the park mr. Department
of Economic Security they're required to
like show their papers even if they're
only going to pick up like food stamps
for their kids for citizens love these
rights completely entitled to them so we
have a lot of really like crazy
immigration policy that just kind of
resonates from Arizona into the rest of
the country organizers are for try to
get people to understand that the reason
their wages have stagnated for 30 years
they don't have to do with undocumented
aliens and you know welfare mothers they
have to do with fundamental decisions
that are made by the Masters to shift
the nature of the economy to so that its
core becomes financial institutions you
go back to say 1970 the financial
institutions you know big banks and so
on maybe had three percent of corporate
profits and now it's close to a third
and a side effect of that is something
else goes what goes is production so if
you buy a car here evens the General
Motors car does a good chance was
assembled in Mexico not in a u.s. plant
and these are very concerned those are
the policies that are taking away sort
of more or less the kind of jobs he can
survive on raise a family on you know
and so on they're taking away those jobs
now it's an old process like New England
it used to be the manufacturing center
of the country but manufacturing was
shifted elsewhere back to the south
because labor was cheaper and in fact as
you can use slave labor
like criminalized workers so that you
know manufacturing declined in the set
and the north okay this is the same
process continuing except now it happens
to be across the borders and it always
was to some extent across the borders
but now it's much more so to even
cheaper labor under even worse
conditions you know you can make more
money out of them I mean China for
example working conditions are
horrendous that's why there's a labor
unrest all over China no but China has
become kind of like an assembly plant
into which the more advanced economies
of Asia and the United States send parts
and components and high technology and
they assemble it very cheaply for the
you know for Dell and HP and the rest of
them great for Walmart you know you get
cheap goods and working people here
suffered well you know those are the
things that people out understand it's
not and it's happening right before
their eyes like like it takes the Obama
administration out pretty much owns the
auto industry what are they doing well
they're closing GM plants when you close
a GM plant for example you know how to
destroy the workforce you destroy the
community I'm a lot of these communities
were built by the workforce in the in
the auto industry or other industries so
they're closing GM plants here at the
same time Obama's Secretary of
Transportation Ray LaHood is traveling
around Europe using federal stimulus
money to get Spanish corporations to
build high-speed rail facilities that
could very well be built at GM plant but
the banks and the owners make more money
out of it this way well you know people
don't understand those things for
example they ought to be taking over
this plants and you know producing it
themselves and they ought to be doing
things like what was happening in the
1930s there was massive labor unrest
formation of the CIO you know sit-down
strikes that's what led to me feel
halation it's got to be organized people
have to understand that it's not you
know there was a nativist movement then
to this all the floor of the Jews and
the immigrants and so on but I was
overwhelmed by a an active organized
labor movement well that's not happening
now but it ought to be and that's the
kind of thing that people who have the
kind of privilege that allows them to
work through these problems what we
bring to people not ridiculing in the
short term for example I think that we
should be rebuilding or productive
apparatus and D financial izing the
economy the most of the financial
institutions own doing and was useful
like when Goldman Sachs say what they're
being charged with now essentially
taking bets making bets against the
rotten securities that they're selling
so that when the securities fail they'll
be insured by the debt CDO is so cool i
mean is no contribution to the economy
from that but it's a way for financial
speculators to get rich as they're doing
so that stuff should all be ended you
know there should be banks that perform
the function of banks you know you want
some money to buy a car for somebody for
a bank or something at a reasonable rate
okay that's what financial institutions
would be doing as far as the productive
apparatus is concerned as to be rebuilt
now that things don't happen by
themselves there's a reason why say the
Asian countries are growing and
developing South Korea Taiwan Japan
China to an aggressor extent Singapore
they have government programs they're
strong government's which establish
industrial policies which target
investment and lay the basis for
productive growth now that's our history
too I mean if you use a computer in the
internet and take an airplane the
whatever it may be you're benefiting
from the state economy that stuff was
produced mostly in the state sector of
the economy not by entrepreneurial
initiative and consumer choice it was
done in the universities government labs
and so on under the internet was in the
state system for around 30 years before
it was handed over to private enterprise
so yeah we had an industrial and that
goes way back to the origins of American
history you know we have an industrial
system because we were highly
protectionists the state intervene
substantially and production in fact the
case of criminalizing black labor is a
case in point it provided a cheap labor
force for you know Andrew Carnegie and
so on so if you have a if you have a
functioning society with a strong
government and we would hope a
democratic government that's developing
programs of growth and development for
the population well you can get economic
growth if you the reason why the
propagandists for small government are
screaming about it is because they want
people to hate the government so and
that doesn't mean have a weak state it
means I have a strong state but for the
rich but cut back on you take a look at
the preppy you know you listen to NPR
forget Fox News listen to NPR and ask
what the prescriptions are of the
experts on how to deal with the deficit
every single one says we're going to
have to cut entitlements we're going to
have to cut medical care social security
and so on well you want if it's serious
about the deficit which you should be
there are ways to cut it back on a half
the deficit is not very spending we
spend as much as the rest of the world
combined in military spending that's
about half the debt the deficit the
other half of the deficit roughly is the
exploding medical costs from the highly
inefficient privatized health system
which has twice the costs of comparable
countries well that's not touched by the
health care reform because
matter what people want the insurance
company is going to make sure that
they're not touched so there are ways to
deal with these things they're going to
shift power going to shift power toward
the population and away from
concentrated concentrations sectors of
power now that's in the short term you
know those are things that you can just
legislate tomorrow in the longer term
I'd I agree with the workers in the
mills and around here in the late 19th
century who took it for granted that
those who work in the mills should own
them What Why should there be private
ownership of the mill in which you're
working and you should have the
industrial democracy just they should
have a popular democracy elsewhere
that's in the longer term but you got to
start somewhere and there are immediate
problems have to be dealt with real ones
I was like takes a environmental
catastrophe you know that's pretty
serious we don't deal with that when it
comes to worry about anything else and
it's being consciously exacerbated by
inherent properties of the market system
the ones I mentioned not because the
CEOs are bad people but because that's
their institutional role to disregard
externalities like the fate of the
species well we better do something
about that or there isn't going to be
much else to worry about um well first
of us as far as the Border Patrol having
a brown population about half of all
border patrols are like non-white and
doesn't really come into play when
they're you know apprehending my dress
there's no like you know you would
assume their solidarity but there really
isn't there's a big disconnect between
like Mexicans who believe that they have
earned the right to come here because
their family was born here and those who
have come here recently like I mean my
family is my family has been in the
United States for like 20 years but even
I see
like in my dad he he even has like some
racism and I think that it comes out of
an attitude of fear because no one wants
to associate with the underdog so
they'll put themselves in any position
of power that they can find it's also
one of the highest paying jobs that you
can find like it's very highly paid but
despite that it's such a stressful job
that there's a really high turnover rate
and as far as Border Patrol in the
organization interacting and we've been
dealing with increasing tension between
Norma deaths and the Border Patrol
because about a year ago like 13 people
were given tickets for littering because
we were leaving bottles of water in the
desert and this this like attitude is
still going on but we've had Border
Patrol for example so you can't do this
you can't leave bottles of water in the
desert because you're littering but /
the bottles in front of us dump them out
and make the bottles there so it's just
like an increasing tension which we're
trying to dissipate as an organization
because we don't we don't want to have
that tension we don't want to fight we
just want to be able to do our job but
there's a lot of like negotiation that
people are trying to happen like trying
to make happen but it's really difficult
because because of the high turnover
right there are so many new border
patrol agents all the time that it's
impossible to like build relationships
and that's actually done on purpose like
as an organization they don't want
Border Patrol agents to build
relationships with anyone in the area
that they're working in there's a policy
now where they move board replacement
because there's multiple sectors you
know Border Patrol e throughout the
country and we just operate within the
tucson sector which is the the most
deadly there's over fifty percent of all
the deaths that occur on the border
happen in the Tucson area and there's a
policy like on the books to switch
people's place in that's every six
months so you prevent them from maintain
a surrogate I really see a lot of border
policy and militarization about breaking
up communities and preventing
communities from organizing together and
I think that the racial component of it
is a really strong element and I think
that's what this legislative this new
legislation is also reflecting
so thank you for coming i guess i would
like to point out that no more deaths
always is taking volunteers like over
the summer if you want to come out
volunteer it's great you can just go on
our website and apply
you
