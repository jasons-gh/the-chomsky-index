the discussions about r2p or its cousin
humanitarian intervention are regularly
disturbed by a skeleton in the closet
history to the present moment not past
history throughout history to the
present moment there are a few
principles of International Affairs that
apply quite generally one is the maxim
of facilities that the strong do as they
wish while the weak suffer as they must
a corollary is what Ian Brownlee
distinguished international legal
specialists what he calls the hegemony
Allah proach to lawmaking the voice of
the powerful sets president
another principle derived from Adam
Smith's account of policymaking in
England as he put it the principal
architects of policy in his day the
merchants and manufacturers makes sure
that their own interests are most
peculiarly attended to however Grievous
the effects on others including the
people of England but far more so those
who are subject to what he calls the
savage injustice of the Europeans
particularly in conquered India Smith's
own prime concern a third principle is
that virtually every use of force in
international affairs has been justified
in humanitarian terms including the
worst monsters just to illustrate and
the standard scholarly study of
humanitarian intervention Shawn Murphy
Sykes only three examples of
humanitarian intervention between the
kellogg-briand pact and the UN Charter
Japan's attack on Manchuria and
Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia and
Hitler's occupation of parts of
Czechoslovakia
all accompanied by lofty rhetoric and
factual justifications and the basic
pattern continues to the present moment
the historical record is worth recalling
when we hear r2p or its cousin described
as an emerging norm in international
affairs in reality it has been
considered a norm as far back as we want
to go so the founding of this country is
an example in 1629 the Massachusetts Bay
Colony was granted its charter by the
king of England the stating that
rescuing the natives from their bitter
pagan fate is the principle end of this
plantation the Great Seal of the colony
depicts an Indian saying come over and
help us so the English colonists were
thus dedicated to their responsibility
to protect as they proceeded to
extirpate
and exterminate the indigenous
population in their words and for their
own good as their honored successors
explained in 1630 John Winthrop
delivered his famous sermon depicting
the new nation ordained by God as a city
on the hill that inspirational rhetoric
that is regularly invoked to this day to
justify any crime as at worst deviation
from the noble mission now there's no
difficulty adding similar examples from
other great powers in their day and the
Sun the powerful are free to say that we
should forget history and look forward
for the week it's not a wise choice
the skeleton in the closet made its
appearance in the first case considered
by the International Court of Justice
sixty years ago the Corfu Channel case
the Court determined quoting that it can
only regard the alleged right of
intervention
as the manifestation of a policy of
force such as has in the past given rise
to the most serious abuses and such as
cannot whatever be the defects in
international organization find a place
in international law from the nature of
things intervention would be reserved
for the most powerful states and might
easily lead to perverting the
administration of justice itself the
same perspective informed the first ever
meeting of the South Summit of 133
states that convened in April 2000 its
declaration surely with the bombing of
Serbia in mind rejected what it called
the so-called right of humanitarian
intervention which has no legal basis in
the United Nations Charter for the
general principles of international law
the word wording has been repeated since
among others by the ministerial meeting
of the non-aligned movement in Malaysia
in 2006 again representing the
traditional victims the same conclusion
was drawn in 2004 by the high-level UN
panel on threats challenges and change
the panel adopted the view of the ICJ
and the non-aligned movement concluding
that article 51 needs neither extension
nor restriction of its long understood
scope the panel added that for those
impatient with such a response the
answer must be that in a world full of
perceived potential threats the risk to
the global order and the norm of non
intervention on which it continues to be
based is simply too great for the
legality of unilateral preventive action
to be accepted allowing one to act is to
allow all which is of course unthinkable
the same position same basic position
was adopted by the world
sumit in 2005 the summit also asserted
the willingness to take collective
action through the Security Council in
accordance with the charter should
peaceful means be inadequate and
national authorities are failing
manifestly failing to protect their
populations from serious crimes now that
phrase sharpens the wording of article
42 at most in clarifying the conditions
for the Security Council to resort to
force and it keeps the skeleton in the
closet if and it's a large if the we can
regard the Security Council as a neutral
arbiter not subject to the maxims of
acidities and Adam Smith come back to
that there have been some departures
from the curfew channel restriction and
its descendants the constitutive act of
the African Union asserts the right of
the Union to intervene in a member state
in respective grave circumstances now
that differs crucially from the charter
of the Organization of American States
which bars intervention for any reason
whatever in the internal or external
affairs of any other state the reasons
for the difference are clear the OAS
Charter seeks to deter intervention by
the Colossus of the north and has of
course failed to do so up to the present
but after the collapse of the apartheid
states the African Union faced no
comparable problem now if the African
Union doctrine were to extend to the OAS
or NATO then its members would be
entitled to intervene within their own
alliance that idea yields interesting
and revealing conclusions which I don't
have time to go into but they would be
inoperative in any event thanks to the
maximum of acidities
now there is a high-level proposal to
extend r2p beyond the African Union
doctrine it's in the report of the
International Commission which advocates
action within area of jurisdiction by
regional or sub regional organizations
under Chapter 8 of the Charter that the
skeleton and the closet rattles rather
loudly at this point the powerful
unilaterally declare their area of
jurisdiction so for NATO it includes the
Balkans and Afghanistan and beyond the
secretary-general of Scheffer informed a
NATO meeting in June 2007 quoting him
that NATO troops have to guard pipelines
that transport oil and gas that is
directed for the rest for the west and
more generally have to protect sea
routes used by tankers and other crucial
infrastructure of the energy system the
expansive rights accorded by the
International Commission are restricted
to the powerful radically violating the
principles of Corfu channel and its
descendants and opening the door for
potential use of r2p as a weapon for
Imperial in intervention as will the
Corfu channel principle which runs right
through the world summit provides
considerable insight into the
selectivity and timing of r2p and its
cousin the alleged normative revolution
as it's described that took place in the
1990s immediately after the collapse of
the Soviet Union which had in earlier
years and provided an automatic pretext
for intervention however frail the
argument the Bush administration senior
bush administration reacted to the fall
of the Berlin Wall with an official
exposition of Washington's new
in brief everything will stay the same
but with new pretext so we still need a
huge military system but for a new
reason what they called the
technological sophistication of third
world powers we have to maintain the
industy defense industrial base -
euphemism for state supported high-tech
industry we must maintain intervention
forces directed at the Middle East
energy rich regions where the quoting
were the threats to our interests that
required military intervention could not
be laid at the Kremlin's door contrary
to decades of pretense so new pretexts
for intervention were needed and the
normative revolution soon took place the
natural interpretation of the timing
gained support from the selectivity of
application of r2p and its cousin there
was of course no thought of applying the
principle to the Iraq sanctions
administered by the Security Council
condemned as genocidal by the two
directors of the oil-for-food program
the respected international diplomats
Denis Halliday and Hans von sponeck
both of whom resigned because of their
genocide alaric tur funds fonox
detailed study of the horrendous impact
of the sanctions has been under a
virtual ban in the US and UK the primary
agents of the programs that were they
were administered by the Security
Council there's no thought today of
protection of the people of Gaza
that's another UN responsibility along
with the rest of the protected
population under the Geneva Conventions
also denied fundamental human rights in
these and numerous other cases the
selectivity conforms with considerable
precision to the maximum of lucidity and
the
vacation of the ICJ sixty years ago
perhaps the most striking illustration
of the radical selectivity was in 1999
when NATO bombed Serbia that's an attack
featured in Western discourse as the
jewel in the crown of the normative
revolution the emerging norm that was
when the US was at the height of its
glory in leading the enlightened states
leading the enlightened states the
leadership in the hands of an
enlightened idealistic new world bent on
ending inhumanity everywhere to cite
just a few of the flood of accolades by
Western intellectuals there are a few
difficulties confronting this flattering
self-image one problem is that the
traditional victims of Western
intervention vigorously objected
I've already quoted the stand of the
non-aligned movement Nelson Mandela was
particularly harsh and his condemnation
well that problem was not serious easily
overcome the views of the unworthy are
easily ignored as indeed they were
furthermore the bombing plainly violated
the UN Charter that problem too was
easily put to rest the as the Goldstone
Commission determined the bombing was
illegal but legitimate they reached that
conclusion by reversing the chronology
of bombing and atrocities which leads to
a third problem the facts which happened
to be very richly documented in this
case from impeccable Western sources and
what they reveal is unequivocal the NATO
bombing did not end the atrocities but
rather precipitated by far the worst of
them as had been anticipated by the NATO
command and the White House the
conclusions that are so richly
documented by the Western records are
reinforced by the indictment of
Malevich issued by the international
tribunal at the height of the bombing
with a single exception the crimes
charged followed the bombing and we can
be confident that the one pre bombing
charge the rechak massacre was of little
principal concern to the US and Britain
if only because at the very same time
they were not only condoning but
supporting actively supporting much more
serious crimes in East Timor where the
background of atrocities was
incomparably more grotesque than
anything that had happened in the
Balkans and this incidentally is only
one of many examples right at that time
well this problem too was overcome quite
simply by virtual suppression of the
animal record I do the case of East
Timor is particularly instructive just
add a personal note I testified about it
at the 4th committee in 1978 when
atrocities reached the level I'm quoting
of extermination as a crime against
humanity committed against the East
Timor Eze population it's the words of
the later UN sponsored truth Commission
and 1978 it was also the year in which
Britain and France joined the United
States in supporting extermination as a
crime against humanity and continued to
do so right through 1999 as atrocities
sharply mounted once again after the
final paroxysm of state terror in
September 1999 which destroyed most of
what remained of the country National
Security Advisor sandy Berger said that
the United States would continue its
support of the aggressors explaining
that I don't think anybody ever
articulated a doctrine which said we
ought to intervene whenever there's a
humanitarian problem so r2p vanished in
the standard way to end the atrocities
in this case would not have required any
action not bombing not saying
and the other act beyond withdrawal of
participation and that was demonstrated
shortly after Berger's reaffirmation of
u.s. policy when under strong domestic
and international pressure the President
Clinton formally ended u.s.
participation the invaders immediately
withdrew and a UN peacekeeping force was
able to enter facing no army that could
have been done at any time in the
preceding quarter century astonishingly
this horrendous story has since been
reinterpreted as a vindication of r2p
it's a reaction so shameful that words
fit well I mentioned that the consensus
of the World Summit adheres to the
curfew principle and its descendants
only if we assume that the Security
Council is a neutral arbiter it plainly
is not the council is controlled by its
five permanent members and they're far
from equal and operative Authority one
indication of the difference is the
record of vetoes that's the most extreme
form of violation of a Security Council
resolution the relevant period is from
the mid-1960s when decolonization and
recovery from wartime destruction gave
the UN at least some standing as a
representative of world opinion since
that time the u.s. is far in the lead in
vetoes Britain a second no one else is
even close in the past quarter century
China and France evita three resolutions
Russia for the United Kingdom 10 and the
United States 43 including even
resolutions calling on all states to
observe international law the skeleton
in the closet nods in recognition as the
maxim of acidities strikes again
American public opinion it brings up a
further consideration the
Maxim's that actually one way to
mitigate this defect in the world summit
consensus and it's a serious one would
be to eliminate the veto okay that's
incidentally in accord with the will of
the majority of Americans they believe
that the United States should follow the
will of the majority and that the UN not
the United States should take the lead
in international crises but that's not
on the political agenda because we run
up again against Adam Smith's Maxon
which ensures that such heresies are
unthinkable as much so as applying r2p
to those who desperately need protection
but are not on the favored list of the
powerful American public opinion brings
up an important consideration the
Maxim's that largely guide International
Affairs and practice are not graven in
stone and in fact they've become
considerably less harsh over the years
as a result of the civilizing effect of
popular movements and for that
continuing and essential project r2p can
be a valuable tool much as the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights is even
though states do not adhere to the u D
and some formally reject much of it
nonetheless the it serves as an ideal
that activists can appeal to in
educational and organizational efforts
often effectively and my suspicion is
that a major contribution of the
discussion of r2p may turn out to be
rather similar thanks thank you very
much
