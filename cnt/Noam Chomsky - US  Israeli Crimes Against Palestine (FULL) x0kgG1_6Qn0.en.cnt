well let me begin by giving credit where
credit is due to someone I rarely praise
in fact I can't remember when I ever
have namely the Jerusalem correspondent
of the New York Times
Ethan Brunner he had a good column this
morning it's worth reading
he's describing the the mood and Israel
on independence day and he points out
that the mood was on you unusually grim
in fact maybe uniquely so he refers to a
quite an interesting letter that was
written by one of the major Israeli
correspondents Ari Shavit in our it's
it's kind of a centrist correspondent
very influential it's an open letter
from Chevy to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and he says we don't really
know each other but you are you know who
I am and I never write letters to people
in the government but the moment is so
significant and dangerous that I just
have to write you the letter he has a
long open letter letter says that you
mr. Netanyahu or maybe the most hated
person in the world in Israel the left
hates you the right hates you while my
friends hate you I'm the only person
that doesn't hate you and of course all
the Arabs hate you and everyone the
United States hates you and the rest of
the world and so on and he says the
reason is because it's not your fault he
says you know I really like you I think
you're a nice guy but Israel's facing
maybe the worst crisis in its history
and we have to do something about it and
then he runs through the crises the
worst one he
it's just the general attitude in the
world toward Israel though he didn't
know it but the day after his letter
appeared there was a poll an
international poll by the Pew Research
Center which incidentally he's and
runner also refers to in his column and
the poll ranked was a global ranking of
countries as to what people think about
them in many countries and Israel ranked
way down at the bottom fact right next
to North Korea almost at the very bottom
and attitudes so the concern is
justified of course it's a lot of
paranoia and self-righteousness the
world doesn't understand us everyone
hates the Jews we're right about
everything but there's no point just we
can't go along just knowing that we have
to somehow do something little convince
the world there are some striking
analogies which Brenner didn't bring up
one of them is South Africa there are a
lot of analogies drawn between Israel
and South Africa most of them of pretty
dubious quality but one makes a lot of
sense it has to do with the history if
you go back about 50 years the mood and
white nationalist in South Africa was
very similar to this they they were
aware of it that they were aware that
their becoming a pariah society they
reacted very much the way Israel's react
me today a large-scale international
information systems effort to explain to
people it's not propaganda its
explanation just as it's called in
Israel to explain to them that
everything we do is right and just and
highly moral and you should understand
it and so on and also kind of circling
the wagons a lot of defiance shifts to
the extreme nationalist right right
nationalist movements and a lot more
it's all very similar at that time about
fifty years ago the South African
Foreign Minister in a conversation with
the American ambassador told him that we
know that there are strong resolutions
and the United Nations denouncing us the
past by most of the countries in the
world but he said that doesn't really
matter and his words were what matters
more than all other votes put together
is the position of the United States in
view of its predominant position of
leadership in the Western world so in
brief there's only one vote in the
United Nations that's yours
as long as you vote for us the rest of
them we don't care about that was an
accurate observation then that was
pretty much an accurate observation
today and it became much more so in the
case of South Africa as the
decolonization proceeded remember this
is 1960 the decolonization proceeded and
protests international protests against
apartheid were more intense
well actually the u.s. continued to
support the histories informative the
United States continued to support South
Africa the US government the apartheid
regime right through the period of
mounting protests at home to that
continued right through the Reagan years
into the late 1980s Reagan had to at
that time he already had to evade
congressional sanctions against South
Africa in order to make sure the US
trade increased as it did and he also
had to ignore even business opposition
just a little unusual by then the
business world late seventies early
eighties the American business world was
starting to disinvest they didn't like
what was happening they thought they
were they should get rid of apartheid
but Reagan overruled it and it was no
swamp
in the South African crimes with us
support dwarfed the crimes that Reagan
was responsible for in Central America
in the Middle East which were pretty
awesome but in South Africa was much
worse I'm just in the surrounding
countries Angola and Mozambique the
South African depredations were
responsible for killing about a million
and a half people and causing sixty
billion dollars of damage not a small
thing
and the US government not the population
not even Congress not even business that
continue but the government continued to
support it right through
now they had a reason and the reason is
familiar a justification the
justification was the war on terror what
we're told these days is that George
Bush declared the war on terror and
after 9/11 which is not quite accurate
Jiri declared it Reagan had declared it
and when he came into office in 1981
said a centerpiece of US foreign policy
is going to be state directed
international terrorism the plague of
the modern age retiring to barbarism in
our time and so on that's all been wiped
out of history for simple reason
reagan's war on terror very quickly
turned into a massive terrorist war with
enormous destruction and atrocities and
that's not a good thing to maintain
within history so it's kind of going
away except for the real world
so when Bush Reedy cleared it the
original had been forgotten defense of
South Africa was justified by the war on
terror 1988 the Pentagon declared that
the African National Congress Nelson
Mandela's a African National Congress
was one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world that was 1988 after
everything that happened in fairness I
should say that a year ago last May
Mandela finally was removed from the US
terrorist list so he can now travel of
the United States with a special
dispensation but that was 1988 and in
fact the apartheid regime looked
unassailable the foreign ministers
analysis in 1950 was pretty accurate as
long as they had that one vote the world
could be disregarded well at that time
for reasons which aren't exactly known
the US government policy shifted and
within two or three years apartheid had
collapsed that's gone that's a lot to
say about what followed not so beautiful
but it was certainly a major victory for
freedom and justice well those are
important lessons worth keeping in mind
and it's worth keeping in mind that
virtually without exception Israeli
actions and Israeli policies are in fact
joint policies their u.s. Israeli
policies Israel can go just as far as
the u.s. permits just as far as it
supports it and no further
I mean Israel doesn't does something the
u.s. doesn't like tells them loud and
clear and they withdraw quiet doesn't
matter who the president is under george
w bush there were some extreme examples
that in fact israel relies much more on
the United States for diplomatic
military and economic support than South
Africa did South Africa was getting
support from other terrorist states like
Britain and others Israel in particular
but the but Israel is really not it's
much more dependent on the United States
and it follows that any meaningful
change in the relations with Israel and
Palestine it's going to have to be based
on a change here in the United States
now there have been substantial changes
in past years so a meeting like this say
would have been inconceivable as
recently as five or ten years ago in
fact wasn't long ago that when I and a
couple other people tried to talk about
these topics we literally had to have
police protection and the meetings were
broken up these were my own University
MIT you know police protection meetings
were broken up
couldn't talk about it it's all
radically changed particularly since the
Gaza attacked last year which made a big
shift and attitudes and understand it
and it also means that actions are now
feasible that weren't even thinkable up
until recently so for example the kind
that we're taken with regard to South
Africa after decades of education and
protest for a long time but by 1977
Hampshire College I think it was the
first one did pass divestment resolution
and by the early 80s as I say it was
even congressional resolutions there's a
crucial example in fact is is just that
that divestment from the US corporations
that are involved in criminal actions in
the occupied territories there's that
focuses right where it should on our
activities focuses on us it's what we
should do anyway your responsibility is
yourself not other people's crimes and
it's also the decisive factor in what's
going to happen that's what we can
influence there is a brown group of
brown students for justice in Palestine
which is called for divestment from US
corporations that are involved in
criminal actions and the occupied
territories so in other words is asking
Brown University to keep to the law an
international will affect domestic law
that the actions are criminal is not
really in question the wall the
so-called separation wall
what are we called an annexation wall
that cuts through the West Bank as many
of you I'm sure know that was subject to
a decision by the by the world cork
International Court of Justice which
unanimously including the US Justice in
a separate declaration unanimously
concluded that the Geneva Conventions
applied to the occupied territories the
Geneva Conventions very explicitly bar
any transfer of population from the
occupying power to the occupied
territories so that means any settlement
anywhere in the occupied territories is
just illegal de-facto in violation of
international criminal law the u.s.
judge judge Bergen Thome declared that
includes every part of the fence that
goes into West Bank territory roughly
85% of it which is there not to defend
Israel but to defend settlers who were
there illegally so the wall is illegal
and the same is true of every other
settlement with regard to Jerusalem
which is the area of extreme intention
now the actions are doubly illegal a not
only in violation of international law
but even in violation of very specific
Security Council resolutions which the
u.s. in fact agreed to back in the late
60s in the early 70s when the United
States was still part of the world on
this issue departed in the mid seventies
but those resolutions still stand saying
that's dull criminality and it was
understood in Israel so in late 1967
right after the June 67 war Israel when
question of settlement and the occupied
territories is beginning to be brought
up Israel's top legal adviser their
mayor on who's a very distinguished
international lawyer is on the
national Commission's Human Rights
Commission's and so on he informed the
government that the Geneva Conventions
clearly apply to the occupied
territories than that any transfer of
Israeli citizens there would be in
violation of fundamental international
law the Israeli Attorney General
seconded that and if interestingly the
person was really in charge of the
occupied territories Moshe Dayan his
defense minister but he was responsible
for what happened there he agreed that
publicly said yes it's in violation of
international law but we're gonna do it
anyway because countries violate
international law all the time so we
will too and he was basically correct he
he probably not consciously but he was
essentially repeating what the South
African foreign minister said as long as
the master agrees it doesn't matter if
it's in violation of law I'm the master
happens to be a criminal state anyway
and if it authorizes criminal actions
we're okay
doesn't matter what the law says and
that goes until today very strikingly in
fact rarely really even gets reported in
fact mostly it doesn't but as I'm sure
you all know the big issue the big
international issue is Iran at its
possible pursuit of nuclear weapons
capability and you know a lot of
hysteria about that Obama just made a
big speech which presented a new nuclear
posture and said us that promises not to
attack not not to carry out a first
nuclear strike against countries that
don't have nuclear weapons with an
exception he said there were outliers
and the main outlier as he put it is
Iran so we can carry out a nuclear
attack against them even though they
don't have nuclear weapons
right through this period you know
Security Council resolutions and so on
there are other things going on so the
International Atomic Energy Agency which
is responsible for you know monitoring
the non-proliferation treaty last
September it passed a resolution calling
on Israel to join the non-proliferation
treaty and opened its facilities nuclear
facilities to inspection Europe and the
United States tried to block the
resolution but they failed and it passed
anyway well it didn't really matter
wasn't reported in the United States or
in England and one or two notices here
and they're also unreported except for
the mooning newspaper in Washington The
Washington Times was that Obama
immediately informed Israel that it
doesn't apply to them so they can forget
about it
at the same time the Security Council
passed a resolution which got plenty of
publicity it was described as aimed Iran
so it was good it called on all states
to join the non-proliferation treaty and
to settle their disagreements within the
framework of the of the UN Charter and
the non-proliferation treaty mean by
peaceful means
well those provisions were directed
against the United States there's only
two countries in the world that are
threatening the use of force which is
also criminal take a look at the UN
Charter which bars the threat or use of
force and International Affairs but
across the spectrum in the United States
the threat of force is considered
legitimate and often the use of force so
yes it's a criminal state across across
the spectrum and so the US and Israel
the only countries that are threatening
the use of force and in fact repairing
for it so they'll do it who knows but
without report here the United States
has recently sent to the island of Diego
Garcia in the end
Oshin has sent submarine tenders to care
for nuclear submarines the nuclear
submarines are undetectable and they can
carry nuclear weapons and it has also
sent to diego garcia the biggest bombs
in the u.s. arsenal short of nuclear
weapons would have called massive
ordnance penetrator
bunker busters they're called they're
aimed specifically Iran nobody else is a
huge 13 ton bombs which are supposed to
be able to penetrate deep into the earth
you know thousands of tons of reinforced
concrete it doesn't get reported here
but of course it's known to Iranian
intelligence and it's supposed to be
it's a threat of force actually Diego
Garcia the ago Garcia is an island which
isn't talked about much but it's crucial
to u.s. international aggression it's
the major base for the bombing of the
Middle East and Central Asia and so on
that it's actually was a british island
the british expelled the population on
orders of the master they appealed to be
returned and one in british courts but
as Diane said law it doesn't matter if
the master says no so they can't return
Jago Garcia is part of Africa the
African Union just a couple of months
ago established a nuclear weapons-free
zone if anybody were really interested
in stopping nuclear limiting nuclear
proliferation what they'd be doing is
supporting nuclear weapons-free zones
around the world
well Africa finally had one but they
can't implement it because of Jago
Garcia the United States and Britain
loyally trailing behind refused to allow
the nuclear free a treaty to apply to
Diego Garcia because they intend to use
it they do use it for storing nuclear
weapons I might use it for attacking the
outliers that's exactly not the only
case there's also a South Pacific
nuclear weapons-free zone which also
isn't in
because the US insists on excluding the
Pacific Islands which are used for bait
bases where the Us stores nuclear
weapons nuclear submarines and so on so
that's not implement come back to an
another important nuclear weapons-free
zone in a moment
anyway the outlier is Iran now actually
there are three countries that have not
thought they were signed the
non-proliferation treaty in nuclear
States Israel India and Pakistan all
develop nuclear weapons with u.s.
support and are still doing so Pakistan
it's one of Ronald Reagan's gifts to the
world India its accelerated in the last
couple of years there's an under Bush it
was a u.s. Indian treaty sign which is
in direct violation of all the
international conventions on
non-proliferation it permits India to
develop nuclear weapons in secret and it
permits the u.s. to help them by
providing them with nuclear technology
now the story is it's for civilian use
but everybody knows that the boundary
between civilian use and military
application is quite small and
furthermore even providing it for
civilian use permits India to divert its
technology and research to nuclear
weapons as in fact it's doing quite
openly so immediately after the Security
Council resolution I mentioned India
announced though it wasn't reported here
that it can produce nuclear weapons with
the same yield as the superpowers the US
and Russia Obama quietly informed India
that the Security Council resolution
doesn't apply to them
Pakistan responds to India's so they're
openly in fact developing new nuclear
weapons facilities
uranium enrichment and so on those are
the real threats of nuclear weapons in
the region the three countries that
refuse to sign the treaty and that are
backed by the u.s. that when they openly
defy the Security Council the
International Atomic Energy Agency and
so on not the out the outlier may be a
problem but that's a u.s. issue and so
the u.s. is not supported by the world
on this contrary to what you read so the
call for sanctions what you read is Iran
is defying the international community
the international community is a term
that has a rather technical meaning it
refers to Washington and whoever happens
to agree with it at the moment so the
international community excludes the
majority of states in the world the
non-aligned former non-aligned movement
which vigorously support Iran's right to
develop nuclear power develop as
permitted under the non-proliferation
treaty everyone agrees it excludes
a China and Russia its excludes India
which is opposed to sanctions excludes
Brazil which is pointedly
opposed to sanctions at Turkey the one
major Middle East powers doesn't want
sanctions in fact even the Arab League
which the u.s. is supposedly catering to
they just had a meeting and declared
their opposition to sanctions call for
diplomacy but nevertheless the
international community steadfastly
insists on higher sanctions incidentally
the American people aren't part of the
international community I haven't seen a
recent poll that may pinion may have
changed after all the propaganda the
last couple of years but in 2007 a
considerable majority of Americans
agreed with the world outside the
international community that has agreed
that Iran has a right same right as
everyone else
develop nuclear energy well there are
the outliers there was a meeting in
Tehran of 60 states a couple of days ago
it's very hard to find out who was there
because nothing's covered but there was
a meeting and they came out with a
declaration calling for an end to any
nuclear weapons and they called for
establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone
in the Middle East
that's an interesting proposal in this
case the u.s. population is
overwhelmingly in support of it and so
it's just everyone in the world who's
polled at least very strong support for
a nuclear weapons-free zone that would
mitigate and maybe terminate whatever
the alleged threats are of Iran
developing a nuclear weapons capability
they just called for it and the Tehran
meeting I don't think was reported here
there are two countries that have a
particularly deep commitment to this
namely the United States and Britain the
reason is because when the US and
Britain invaded Iraq they tried to
provide a kind of a thin legal cover for
it and the way they did it was by
appealing to a Security Council
resolution resolution 687 in 1991 which
called on Iraq to dismantle its weapons
of mass destruction and the US and
Britain claimed they hadn't done it we
know that was false but that was the
claim and that justified their invasion
of Iraq well if you bother reading that
resolution you'll see that it commits
the signers to establishing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East so
the US and Britain over and above all
others have a commitment to this and if
there was a real interest in
non-proliferation instead of just
rhetorical that's what would be pursued
well going back to Israel which is not
the only beneficiary of you
criminality India and Pakistan are too
but in the case of Israel they're immune
from the International Atomic Energy
Agency Security Council and in fact a
long record of us vetoes of Security
Council resolutions that charge Israel
with one or another crime actually the
USPTO's resolution charging itself with
crimes - if we had a free education
system in the United States everyone
would know that the United States is the
only country that has rejected oral
Court decision in the past it was one of
three Libya and Albania also hadn't
accepted them but they've since accepted
them so the u.s. is in splendid
isolation no that was a World Court
decision calling on the United States to
terminate its terrorist war against
Nicaragua of course totally rejected
that went to the Security Council there
were two resolutions calling on the wall
States didn't mention the u.s. calling
on all states to observe international
law the u.s. vetoed both of them France
and Britain politely abstained so there
are outliers in the world that Iran has
got an awful government that would he
doubts that but there are other outliers
maybe more significant ones certainly
more significant for us well it's going
back to Israel Palestine it's kind of
strange on the surface that the conflict
persists why does it why is it called
unresolvable you know toughest problem
in the world I mean there plenty of
problems in the world where it's hard
even to conjure up a solution it's to
imagine one in this case you cannot only
conjure it up but everyone knows what it
is and furthermore the whole world
agrees to it outside of the United
States and Israel and in fact it's even
got international law and it's supported
by the Arab League it's supported by the
Organization of Islamic states including
your
and supported by the relevant non-state
actors like Hamas the resolution visit
the basic contours are very well known
to state settlement on the international
border
June 67 border perhaps with minor and
mutual modifications that was the
official u.s. term back in the late
sixties and early seventies before the
u.s. departed from the world on this
issue so settlement on the international
border was a ceasefire line so kind of
messy with minor and mutual
modifications and various conditions
about Jerusalem refugees and so on well
well that's a solution but much like the
nuclear free weapons free zone there's a
barrier then it's right here the US
won't accept it and as long as the US
doesn't accept that Israel feels
entirely free to continue to violate it
now that's been going on since the mid
seventies in 1976 January 76 the major
Arab states brought a resolution to the
Security Council that calling for a
settlement roughly in these terms
recognizing the rights of every state in
the region including Israel to live in
peace and security within recognized
boundaries all the standard diplomatic
terminology it was vetoed by the United
States again in 1980 record and General
Assembly is similar a veto by the United
States is in fact a double Nieto may be
a triple veto first of all it doesn't
happen and secondly it's vetoed from
reporting and third is vetoes from
history so you have to look pretty hard
to find find out much about this that's
what it means to have overwhelming power
those are some of the prerogatives
overwhelming power and a very obedient
intellectual class which keeps things
quiet you know doesn't make sure that
young minds aren't distorted by knowing
too much about the world
the but in fact in this entire record of
35 years of us rejection ISM there's one
exception and a very illuminating one
it's in 2000 year 2000 it's not the one
people talk about everyone talks about
the Camp David negotiations which failed
but that wasn't the end of it after the
collapse of the Camp David negotiations
President Clinton recognized that the US
Israeli position that the negotiations
could not be accepted by any
Palestinians even the most were called
moderate ones fro us ones so Clinton in
December of 2000 is what he called his
parameters they were kind of vague but
somewhat more forthcoming he then said
that both sides Israel the Palestinians
had accepted his parameters both sides
had made reservations to them well they
met in Taba Egypt in January 2001
Syndicate to try to iron out the
differences the reservations and they
made quite a bit of success and their
last press conference we have a lot
about this it was internationally
monitored there's extensive reports from
Israel most of it in Hebrew but some in
English so we know quite a lot about it
they practically reached agreement in
their last press conference they said if
they had a few more days they could have
reached agreement on every issue pretty
much in line with the international
consensus you know tweaking it here and
there there were a few issues still
Israel called off the negotiations
prematurely and that was the end of
formal negotiations informal pretty
high-level negotiations continued
leading to some agreements the main ones
called the Geneva Accord it was rejected
by Israel ignored by the United States
so that's down the tube
all of this is quite significant it
means that a resolution in terms of the
international consensus is feasible if
the United States will permit it
unfortunately there's very little sign
of that well meanwhile the US and Israel
are just extending and deepening the
illegal occupation in 2005 September
August September 2005 Israel made a
sensible tactical decision the right
wing government Ariella Sharon's
decision the government decided that
doesn't make any sense to keep seven or
eight thousand Israeli settlers in the
Gaza Strip which by then had been half
destroyed taking you know maybe a third
or more of the resources and land and
protected by you know half the Israeli
army so he made the decision to transfer
the settlers illegally settling in the
Gaza Strip to the West Bank which is
much more important now it could have
been done just like that a flick of a
wrist you know but they decided to stage
what it was called a national trauma so
there was a huge trauma perfectly for
completely farcical if the if they'd
want to do it quietly all I had to do
was announce that on August 1st the IDF
the Israeli Army's gonna leave the Gaza
Strip at that point the 8000 settlers
would have climbed into the buses
provide trucks provided to them and they
would leave their subsidized homes in
the Gaza Strip to subsidize homes in the
West Bank but you don't get any
propaganda out of that what they wanted
was a trauma so it was staged you know
big front pic pictures on the front
pages of you know little boy pleading
with the soldiers not to destroy his
home you know Boston Globe and so on and
shouts of never again and
no more holocausts and it was pretty
effective actually it was a it was a
farcical repeat of a similar stage drama
in 1982 when they had at the part take
settlers out of Egypt out of the
northeastern Sinai there were
commentators in Israel who just
ridiculed it correctly like the late one
of Israel's leading sociologists
Kimberly died recently wrote it just
just ridiculed the farce as it should
have been done but it played it played
where it mattered here so never again
we've got to hold on to the occupy at
the West Bank
well after the withdrawal from technical
withdrawal from Gaza Israel maintained
its total control and it was pretty
vicious it picked up in intensity a
couple of months later when the
Palestinians committed a serious crime
there was a free election in Palestine
in January 2006 and they voted the wrong
way now that's not acceptable you can do
all kind of things but not that you
don't look the wrong way in a free
election so the u.s. quite openly Israel
to of course turn to punishing the
Palestinians for this crime and it
wasn't secret like you can read it in a
column in the front page of the New York
Times right alongside another column
which is lauding our magnificent
messianic pursuit of wilsonian ideals
and supporting democracy and so on
there's no contradiction so Orwell you
may recall had a concept which you call
double think double think is the
capacity to have two contradictory ideas
in mind at the same time and believe
both of them that's almost a definition
of the intellectual culture but this was
a dramatic case and immediately after
that crime they punishment to the Gaza
Strip sharply increased got worse later
I won't go through the details but it's
pretty awful
very savage siege brutality and so on it
peaked December 19 2008 with the latest
us Israeli invasion which was murderous
and destructive the invasion of the US
it's called an Israeli invasion it's a
u.s. Israeli invasion us arms US
diplomatic support and so on it was
given a pretext but every active
aggression has a pretext so you have to
ask does it mean anything actually the
pretext was that Israel was defending
itself against rockets from Gaza that
pretext is accepted by the human rights
groups by the Goldstone Commission by
about a hundred percent of commentary it
doesn't have a particle of credibility
Israel in the u.s. knew exactly how to
stop the Rockets there had been a
ceasefire and during the ceasefire
Israel admits it was not a single Hamas
rocket Israel violated the ceasefire a
couple of months earlier and the rocket
started Hamas called for renewing the
ceasefire Israel considered it and
refused well you know the use of force
when you haven't exhausted even tried
the peaceful means is just pure it's
just major war crimes I mean the
discussion about the war crimes in Gaza
is trivialism in comparison so Israel in
fact at a free pass from the Goldstone
report on others well since then the
savagery continues they won't go on the
details I'm talking too long that's
pretty similar in the West Bank the
restrictions are not quite as not a
severe in the West Bank as they are in
Gaza which has become basically
unlivable that's the point but they're
bad but Israel has finally understood in
the West Bank that it should do what
every colonial power has done they don't
punish the entire population ensure that
the elites are making out fine you
any third-world country you know under
colonial rule or neo-colonial rule and
there's a sector of wealth and privilege
which is you know beyond anything that
we dream of and israel's finally
understood that that's what you do so if
you go to Ramallah you can go to elegant
restaurants and you know go to the
theater it's just like being in Paris in
London you go a couple of miles away and
it's horrible but that allows the the
journalists and others to talk about the
wonderful achievements in the West Bank
well when you're running in fact Israel
is following finally the explicit
recommendation of Israeli industrialists
about ten years ago who urged that
Israel should move from with their words
from colonialism to neo colonialism it
should establish the standard
neo-colonial structures like this took a
long time to realize it but the doing
fact that's becomes even more like South
Africa South Africa relied on the ban
through stands and it tried to keep them
they weren't they're pretty awful but I
tried to keep them viable it needed it
that was their labor force so they kept
them going they tried to get
international recognition for them but
outside Israel no country recognized
them
but that's Israel's not doing it for all
the West Bank it's just doing it for the
elite sector in Ramallah where the
Palestinian Authority is well if you
want to maintain a neo-colonial system
you have to have a an iron fist say in a
military force and there is one it's
called it's the army run by general
Keith Dayton actually that's the more
mild of the military forces with the
better known one u.s. general runs an
army trained in Jordan with us Israeli
participation and support and it keeps a
grip over the population in fact Obama
the Obama administration was
particularly impressed
how will the army worked during the
attack on Gaza during the attack on Gaza
there were no protests in the West Bank
which kind of surprised everyone and
that's attributed to the power of the
Dayton Army which prevented any protests
so Palestine is really can't demonstrate
or anything they were not even allowed
to protest the destruction of the other
half of Palestine what's going on in
Gaza
John Kerry in particular the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee was
particularly impressed with this he said
finally he said Israel may have a
legitimate partner for peace
thanks to the success of the general
Dayton Army and suppressing the
population sufficiently so they can't
even protest against the massive
atrocities well let's turn finally to
the options for Palestinians what are
they here the discussion i think is
pretty misleading and you should think
it through one option of course is the
international consensus and there's a
barrier the US won't accept it but
that's our problem
now a very common view you hear it all
over the place now from Palestinians
from Israeli doves from the supporters
of Palestinians here that the
alternative to that is that Israel takes
over the territories it becomes a single
state and you can have a civil rights
struggle an anti-apartheid struggle
within this single state in which
Palestinians will be roughly half the
population and that's many of the doves
including Palestinian leaders think okay
that's better than the vanishing
two-state settlement there's only one
problem with that logic those are not
the two alternatives there's a third
alternative which isn't discussed the
third alternative is that the US and
Israel continue doing exactly what
they're doing and what they're doing is
very clear has a name from instr a food
all merit call that converges what you
do what Israel with us backing is doing
is taking over
everything behind Xing everything behind
the separation wall some of the most
valuable land all the water resources
that's quite crucial in this arid region
that takes over the Jordan Valley you
know more fertile territory kicks out
the Palestinians and runs some salience
a settlement said it's right through the
territories actually the three of the
big one east of Greater Jerusalem
Jerusalem's been sharply expanded this
one that goes almost at Jericho and two
others to the north one taking in the
town of Ariel the other town of to do me
a look at a map I'm feeling it a map it
looks as it doesn't penetrate through
deeply into the West Bank but that's
misleading because the area where it
doesn't penetrate is mostly rocky desert
where you can't settle the livable part
of the West Bank is broken up into four
major Canton's
what Arielle show wrong in fact the
architect of this called the banter
stance he was honest except that they're
not cared for as well the bantha stands
so Israel will take those no demographic
problem no palate very few Palestinians
if there are a few you kick them out no
problem of too many non-jews in a Jewish
state no civil rights struggle no
apartheid struggle that's for the
Palestinians they can rot up in the
hills Israel takes no responsibility for
them they can follow a proposal of Moshe
Dayan back in 67
the defense minister was in charge they
said we should tell the Palestinians
that we have no solution for you we're
going to treat you're going to live like
dogs and whoever wants to leave can
leave and we'll see where that goes well
yeah that's the policy and that's the
real alternative to his two-state
settlement there is no alternative of
the kind that's being discussed because
neither Israel nor the United States or
in fact anyone the world is know except
that rather they'll continue doing
exactly what they're doing now that's
not going to change unless there are
changes inside the United States as in
the current world scene it's hard to see
wherever we're
so the changes could come from and
that's kind of an optimistic conclusion
for us for people who oppose current US
Israeli policies because here is the one
place where we can influence what
happens and here is the one place that
matters that's where this is gonna make
a decisive difference now there are
implications for tactical choices I
think they should be pretty obvious but
I'll stop there sorry if going on to
them
[Applause]
you
I'll take a look at the history of
apartheid it's suggested no not exact
but suggested took decades of education
and organizing things of things like
this before the situation the United
States reached the point where Congress
the business world you know general
population was so opposed to apartheid
that the Reagan administration had to
lie its way around it to try to keep to
maintain the support well okay that's
one thing that could be done another
thing that could be done is what began
in the case of South Africa and the late
seventies namely divestment by then it
already had the support of a large part
of the population including
even businesses and pretty soon Congress
but the requirement that US corporations
divest from a white nationalist firms in
South Africa which they themselves are
already beginning to do under pressure
here okay that can be done now that's
that you can go beyond I'm there were a
number of international reports about
the Gaza attack that one of the most
important was from Amnesty International
not exactly an extremist organization
they called on the United States to
withhold all arms shipments from Israel
saying that the arms shipments violate
international law which they do and they
even violate US domestic law arms
shipments are supposed to be subject to
the condition that they are used only
for defensive purposes or for you know
internal security and the Gaza attacked
there wasn't had no defensive purpose as
I mentioned and certainly wasn't for
internal security and they were used in
commission of major crimes crime of
aggression lots of other were crimes so
there could be a popular movement here
to call on the US government to live up
to its own laws and to terminate arms
shipments and there's a lot of other
things you know so there's no shortage
of things that we can do well you know
it's no deep secret I mean like we're
doing right now
how did people have just taking a look
at the change just take the recent years
in the United States you can go all the
way back in history but how are you go
back further how a slavery overcome how
did women get the right to vote you know
how and they since the nineteen sixties
were women's rights pretty substantially
established not perfect but totally
different from anything before how our
civil rights achieved
how did environmental concerns begin to
be addressed not well enough but at
least somewhat and every step forward in
history comes the same way and people
like you do something about it and
there's it's very free country you can
do all sorts of things your people in
universities are extremely privileged
students for example or in the moment of
their lives
when they are most free they're sort of
out of parental control they don't yet
have the burdens imposed on them to try
to survive in a society where incomes
for the majority of stagnated for thirty
years because of government corporate
policies so you know they're kind of
free they do lots of things that others
don't have a choice about okay do them
yeah that's fine I think that's one of
the things you can do but there's plenty
more I mean we all know that a vote
doesn't mean much thank you it does hurt
[Applause]
I'm in more democratic countries than
ours that's understood like take say the
poorest country in South America
Bolivia I mean they had a pretty
remarkable election 2005 another one
just last year in which the majority of
the population indigenous people the
most repressed people in the continent
had by then organized enough to enter
the political arena and vote somebody
from their own ranks yeah not some rich
guy from you know went to skullenbones
yeah but they've elected someone from
their own ranks they formulated the
programs which the president is
following serious programs and the
voting was just one moment in an ongoing
struggle it wasn't I go to the polls I
push a button I forget about it for the
next four years it was there's just an
ongoing popular struggle about all kind
of serious issues you know access to
water control of resources complex
questions of ethnic and civil rights and
a complex society and they're at it all
day all the time okay that's functioning
democracy we've got a long way to go
well we've had it in the past but it's
kinda been suppressed and it can be
recovered and that's what elections
ought to be just a moment and a process
which goes on from there first thank you
so much for coming I've learned a lot
thing too what you shared with us my
question is specifically about Iran and
the nuclear weapons and the discussion
that you were having with regard to Iran
in the international community
I definitely understand the idea of a
country obtaining a nuclear weapon or
developing one themselves out of a form
of protection or to be on the same I
guess international status as other
countries who
considered superpowers are on the same
level as a superpower because they
themselves have nuclear weapons but what
do you do when a country is openly
trying to develop one or obtain one and
also open it open and openly threatening
to wipe out a country and claiming that
a country shouldn't exist I mean those
are two really big issues that we're
dealing with and I didn't really think
you addressed that and I was curious to
say well what do you do about countries
that already develop nuclear weapons
outside the framework of the
non-proliferation treaty and are daily
violating resolutions of the Security
Council and the International Atomic
Energy Agency that's the much more
serious problem that's a different
situation because back up those
countries aren't openly threatening to
wipe out another country nor is Iran
just take a look at the statements the
statements are that they don't think
they said in the actually goes back to
home a knee at the time of the u.s.
Iranian alliance the Israeli errata an
alliance and Israel didn't care about it
then and I keep being repeated this
statement is that you know in the course
of time Israel should no longer exist
well actually I happen to agree with
that too effexor to a lot of people in
Israel the ones who think there should
be a single democratic state
that's not calling for wiping anyone out
in fact Iran has supported the
international consensus on the two-state
settlement
actually there is there are two
countries that are not only calling for
some nation not to exist but are
destroying it they move the US and
Israel that's their position with regard
to the Palestinians and they're not just
saying
my stress they're not just saying it
they're doing it day by day that's the
meaning of the policies that are going
on right before our eyes
in Gaza and the West Bank which we are
supporting and paying for so sure you
shouldn't call for the destruction of
another nation and you shouldn't
implement that actually the official
position of Israel backed by the United
States they've slightly modified it but
back about 20 years ago their official
position the coalition government labor
Likud was that there cannot be I'm
quoting it an additional Palestinian
state between Jordan and Israel in other
words they declared and the u.s.
supported that Authority is a
Palestinian state namely Jordan some of
the Palestinians object you know they
say no no way man that's not our state
but who cares about them we say that's
your state and there can't be an
additional one well that goes well
beyond calling for the destruction of
another country I mean it's it's
analogous to saying that if somebody
came along suppose I fought and the
judge said the Jews don't need Israel
because they already have New York okay
I mean you know we'd call that a revival
of Nazism but that's the official you it
has been the official US Israeli
position so there's a lot to be
incidentally about Iran nobody in their
right mind wants Iran to have nuclear
weapons or anyone else but it is well
and it's a horrible regime undoubtedly
though there are worse ones in the
region which are our allies but every
everyone I'm not referring to Israel I'm
referring to the other Arab state I'm in
comparison with Saudi Arabia Iran looks
like a civil rights paradise but
the but it's awful you know no doubt and
as a way to deal with it like for
example of moving towards a nuclear
weapons-free zone but among strategic
analysts including Israeli ones there is
no real there's no real question about
why Iran is moving to nuclear weapons
capability which is not the same as
having nuclear weapons it's just being
at a point where he could have them like
most of the advanced industrial world is
in that position Japan Italy all sorts
of countries the reason is very simple
actually was described by one of
Israel's leading military analysts very
hawkish Martin fund Cray felt a couple
of years ago after the invasion of Iraq
he wrote an article in which he said he
doesn't know if Iran is developing
nuclear weapons and he hopes not but he
says if they're not developing nuclear
weapons they are crazy
that was his word they're not developing
they're crazy the United States is just
announced we're going to attack anybody
we feel like and invade you if we can do
it with impunity so you better have a
deterrent well maybe they're developing
a deterrent but no serious analysts
thinks that they would use nuclear
weapons now if Iran had nuclear weapons
and missiles which nobody sane wants
them to have I mean if they went as far
as even loading a missile the country
would be vaporized you know instantly
even if there was a suspicion of it well
you know the clerics may be hideous
people but they've shown no particular
inclination for suicide and destruction
of everything that they own and
everything they value the same is true
about leaking nuclear weapons to others
if there was any suspicion that they
were doing that you can say goodbye to
Iran so chances they're using it or you
know probably at the level of an
asteroid hitting the earth or something
like
but it's a serious problem in fact if
you look at the Israeli literature
they're pretty straight about it they
say the the real threat of an Iranian
nuclear weapon is not against Israel but
it's against Zionism that is what
they're afraid of is that if the region
becomes too dangerous people in Israel
are just gonna leave people who have the
capacity to more educated wealthier and
so on because they won't want to live in
a region with that threat and in fact
immigration is a pretty serious problem
emigration of the educated and the the
trained educated sectors so they don't
want to face that threat but I don't
think any serious strategic analysts at
least I've never seen one who thinks
that this the threat that Iran might use
a nuclear weapon I'm gonna do it total
suicide thank you
first thank you Anna good evening dr.
Chomsky um my question is concerning the
well just getting information how do we
how do we inform the intellectual
classes where do you find your
information and how do you how do you
access truth in in a media that's so
corrupt and overtaken by corporate
interests just how do you become a good
biologist you work you know I mean you
know that the important results aren't
like written in boldface I mean you know
the best biologist is not somebody who
read all the technical papers there are
and can't do that you have to know what
to look for and they have to like take
safety some of the things I mentioned
like the International Atomic Energy
Agency resolution on Israel that I
mentioned well I was lucky I happened to
be in Mexico the last September and they
happen to have an independent newspaper
in Mexico that's the only one in the
Western
hemisphere that I know a very good
newspaper you know big newspaper
second-largest in Mexico gets no
commercial advertising because business
won't advertise there but they subscribe
they they do very well just on reader
support and they happened while I was
there they happen to run an Associated
Press piece on this well you know I
didn't know whether to believe it or not
so when I came home I checked up
Associated Press which is on the
internet and now it's true then you know
I did a media search and I found out
that there was one mention of it in the
United States in the Muny paper in
Washington The Washington Times it also
won in the United Kingdom in the Irish
Times okay that's the kind of thing you
got to do on all sorts of issues if you
know what you're looking for and you're
willing to put the effort into it you
can find out a lot of things now for an
individual it's extremely hard I have to
be kind of a fanatic but if you're in a
group if you're part of an organization
it gets a lot easier I mean that's one
of the advantages of joining with other
people you can do a lot of things you
can't do by yourself so if somebody
finds something you disseminate it you
know others help out and pretty soon you
get things done and now one more thing
if you could just quickly repeat the the
column you mentioned in the beginning of
your if your top o the the this
morning's New York Times
Ethan Bruner thanks who I think is a
terrible correspondent but he have never
good you haven't had a good column this
morning good honest column he also did
his homework he dug up the Chevy to
article which didn't expect its own I
don't think it's in English some Hebrew
I believe and he also dug up that
international poll which I haven't seen
you reported anyway thanks for coming
again I've recently watched the I guess
the classic video of you with women F
Buckley debating the Vietnam War back in
the 60s so I feel like you've been asked
probably every question or Neath the Sun
so I guess
my question would be what what does noam
chomsky now wish that noam chomsky back
when he's debating buckling in the 60s
what is what did he wish he knew and if
you could also indulge us what is your
happiest moment in life
[Applause]
and I don't answer personal questions
well I don't actually remember I think
that debate was in 69 so I can't
remember in any detail but looking back
at the period in general my main regret
is I was much too mild I mean but I
should have been cold taking a much
stronger position he would disagree yeah
but if I was having a debate with some
soviet commissar and i criticized what
russia was doing he'd say it's too harsh
but maybe they have to remember that it
was not easy then in retrospect the sort
of fairy tale is that everyone was
opposed to the war that's absolutely
untrue i mean in the early stages of the
war in vietnam it was much harder to
talk about than it is to talk about
israel palestine today i'm in the as
late as October 1965 that's three years
after kennedy had launched a major war
against the south and in fact the South
practically destroyed we tried to have
our first public meeting in Boston
Boston's pretty liberal city and there's
a place in downtown Boston the Boston
Common which is you know dedicated to
open meetings so we figured okay we'll
take a chance and have a public meeting
on the Boston Common criticizing the war
very mild criticisms I mean it was
broken up by students if it wasn't that
there were a couple hundred state police
there we probably all would have been
killed
now the Boston Globe you know the
liberal newspaper a huge denunciation
how dare you stand up and criticize our
magnificent government and so on it took
a long time before any kind of a peace
movement developed and then if you look
at how it developed in fact you can read
this today in your history books and in
the press and so on what developed was
quite different in the elite culture and
in the popular culture if you look at
the elite culture
she's gonna read in history book or you
know in the newspapers and so on was
that there was a debate over whether the
war was winnable or not okay in fact
when people make analogies to
Afghanistan you know or Iraq they say
well you know is it winnable I mean
that's like a debate and the Nazi
General Staff after Stalingrad you know
did Hitler make a mistake in opening a
two-front war you know should we have
knocked out England first I mean that's
the kind of debate that takes place here
now decades after the Vietnam War that
try to find a check and see you know
history book press journals a debate
over whether it was simply a monstrous
crime the kind of crime for which Nazis
were hanged at Nuremberg go on I mean
insane today I mean it takes a Obama
he's considered a principled opponent of
the Iraq war you know a lot of praise
but what was his criticism his criticism
was that it was a strategic blunder like
Nazi generals after Stalingrad or what
you could read in Pravda in 1985 when a
lot of people were saying Oakland well
you have a strategic blunder to invade
Afghanistan but we don't call that
principled critique when others do it
and what we call it you know criminal
but to try to look at ourselves is
extremely hard I mean not just in the
United States almost anywhere your own
history is whitewashed
consistently amou even do it in personal
life if we're honest it's pretty hard to
look in the mirror but it's crucial if
you want to understand the world and
it's crucial for the entire world in our
case because the u.s. is so powerful
pardon sure what's your happiest moment
in life
that one as I said I'm not going to
answer sending an appropriate standard
and code of conduct and behavior in
international affairs especially in
times of conflict you use the Geneva
Conventions and then you apply it to
Israel especially in their last I want
to ask your opinion do you think that
these same conventions and standards
should be applied to Hamas even though
they are a non-state actor and don't
have conventional military forces and
also do you think the Geneva Conventions
need to be adapted today for the
question of asymmetric warfare well on
the second I don't see any reason
whatsoever why the Geneva Conventions
should be modified for what we call a
symmetric warfare a symmetric warfare
refers to our invasions of other
countries and resistance to the
invasions by people who were weaker we
didn't call it a symmetric warfare when
we were supporting radical Islamists to
try to drive the Russians out of
Afghanistan okay we didn't call the
partisans in Europe a symmetric warfare
when they were fighting the Nazis
isometric warfare means when somebody
tries to defend themselves against us or
our client and there's no reason now the
Geneva Conventions have to be changed
for that any more than there were when
they Nazis killed the partisans you know
so the second question know as far as
Hamas is concerned
Hamas is a political party okay and I
you can't really apply international law
to a political party you can say that
actions of the criminal of the political
party are criminal right and some of
Hamas is actions are criminal so sure
if for example take say the Amnesty
International report I mentioned it
didn't just say we should stop supplying
arms to Israel it said we should stop
applying arms to Israel and Hamas you
know supply arms to Hamas but if we were
doing it we should stop okay
so sure same standard should apply but
it's just you know it's so fantastically
disproportionate that it's almost
meaningless to raise the question I mean
if Hamas for example says we'll never in
it recognize Israel okay that there's a
political party has a right to say that
I'm a political party in Mexico says I'm
never going to recognize the United
States which sits on half of Mexico
obtained by conquest that's a legitimate
position the ruling party in Israel
McCune happens to have as its platform
you can pick it up in the internet it's
official platform is there cannot be a
Palestinian state anywhere in what they
call the Land of Israel shirt into the
sea okay it's a kind of like Hamas is
program plan nobody talks about it
because there are a lie and clients so
you can say whatever they want
yeah and they're not any talking about
it they're doing but sure if Hamas fires
rockets that stay wrote we should stop
helping them do that
and in fact we should take actions to
prevent them from doing it now we know
what the actions are except the
ceasefire
when the US and Israel did accept the
ceasefire the Rockets stopped and that's
officially conceded you can read it on
the Israeli government website official
website socially we should take actions
to prevent criminal acts by sub state
actors I know my name is David target
and
he's had about how what we can do about
political situations that we're hearing
about and actually the answer to that
question lies right here in this room um
18 years ago the East Timor Action
Network established if it's a core here
at an event that took place in Solomon
101 when Allan Nairn a journalist and
Amy Goodman another journalist had come
here to talk about a recent massacre in
East Timor one of the last massacres one
of the most recent massacres that was
part of an ongoing series of massacres
that had killed roughly one-third of the
population of East Timor and people here
actually it only took a few hundred
people there's only you know four or
five hundred people in this room got
together and figured out strategically
who to talk to you who to write to the
think Congress to end military aid to
Indonesia and that was actually the very
first step of the very first action by
the United States - it's a lie and say
that we really disapproved of what
you're doing in killing innocent Tim
Raines people and it was the beginning
of the end of the occupation and killing
more on right now right now we're back
then we're back in a similar situation
and that is that we're about to about to
resume military aid and I was wondering
what your thoughts about that word and
what we could do about that
yeah actually
[Applause]
pharming attendee east-timor Action
Network was quite an important action
the Indonesian invasion of East Timor
began in 1975 with strong us support all
the way through also support of Britain
and France and others Indonesia's a rich
country you know it's ten pages to be
friendly to them and as you said it
killed you know maybe the worst act of
genocide in the late 20th century or one
of the worst all completely with us
support opposition actually began in 75
but it was minuscule I mean talked to
people about it did build up and after
the dealy massacre the one you're
talking about when Alan Darren and Amy
Goodman were attacked by Indonesian
forces it did get some publicity and
groups and a town was formed and that
was extremely important and remember
that was 1991 and the killing went on
for another eight years the Clinton
administration strongly supported
support oh he was our kind of guy the
Clinton administration's said right
through 1999 atrocities and massacres
continued is particularly striking
because this was the same year that
there was a lot of agonizing about the
Serbian atrocities in Kosovo which were
not near as severe as what was going on
in East Timor of course the background
didn't even come close
finally there was a major massacre in
August 1999 and at that point
international protests and domestic
protests which by then had built up and
eaten had a lot to do with this
international fruit the protest against
Clinton was so strong that he took a
very simple step he told the Indonesian
army it's over literally they had sworn
they're never gonna depart this is our
province we're gonna leave soon as they
got you know but a word from the master
saying games over they immediately
withdrew okay that tells you something
that tells you for the first the
preceding 25 years
the United States could have stopped it
you know with the flick of her wrist you
didn't have to bomb 2/4 you know you
didn't need sanctions didn't anything
just stop supporting that's over it's
kind of a little like what happened with
South Africa and it could happen in this
case - what can we do now well protests
a bit my fee Allan Nairn who's pretty
much living in Indonesia now taking very
dangerous steps Ellen is a fantastic
person is now challenging the Indonesian
army to arrest him in Indonesia he's
publicly charging them with atrocities
that he's exposed and that's not a
trivial thing to do in Indonesia not a
nice place so he's protesting it quite
openly he's insisting on being allowed
to appear on television to denounce them
they don't do something about it and
he's calling of course for into military
aid to the to them and it down is to so
sure we can join those efforts and
support him he's still facing serious
danger
thank you so much once again for coming
today professor Chomsky and is a member
of brown students for justice in
Palestine we would really like to thank
you for your message of support but my
question relates towards the nuclear
weapons particularly American the
American facilitation of both the
expansion of weapons programs in Israel
Pakistan and India which all seem to be
rather schizophrenic given their
complicated histories not only among
India and Pakistan but particularly
among Pakistan in Israel and India's
vacillating relationship with Israel so
I was hoping you could comment on that
on the Israel into your relationship on
just all three in the wave all 3 and the
second I guess equally schizophrenic
policy of the u.s. supporting really
just brutal regimes particularly the
Saudi and like Arab monarchs who and the
Egyptian government who in no way
respect human rights and how that
facilitates American policy within the
Middle East and
it's very straight I mean let's take a
gypped yeah
one of the worst dictatorships in the
region very harsh brutal dictatorship
you all read about Obama's trip to Cairo
now how he was praised you know for
opening his heart to the Muslim world
everything's gonna be different you know
we love you and so on that what didn't
get much play maybe almost nothing is a
press conference where he was asked on
his way to Egypt what are you gonna say
about Egypt's as they put it
authoritarian regime I'm an
authoritarian is quite an understatement
but what are you gonna say about Egypt's
authoritarian regime take a look at
Obama's answer he said I don't like to
use labels for folks when a politician
pronounces the word folks you just get
ready for the next series of Lies that's
coming out otherwise you talk about
people but if you've heard of folks you
know so the next thing that came out is
he's a good man Mubarak he's running a
stable society and he's our friend so
I'm not gonna criticize anything okay
what do you think Egyptians or anybody
in the Middle East can how seriously can
they take his comments about human
rights violations in Iran how seriously
should we take them and Saudi Arabia
it's even worse you know so what does
this do for us I mean these are loyal
clients the Middle East energy reserves
are one of the most important issues in
the world you go back to the 1940s
high-level US planners we're talking
about you know this is what they called
a stupendous source of strategic power I
mean one of the greatest material prizes
in world history if we can control that
region we can control the world and so
on and that hasn't changed that's why
the US has the massive intervention in
the Middle East all the way
replacing britain which used to be in
the forefront and yes they support
dictatorial regimes and it's very well
understood you recall the george bush's
plaintiff question why do they hate us
and the answer you know they hate our
freedom and so on i mean the press was
kind enough not the report or
commentators that the same question had
been asked by eisenhower in 1958 he
raised the question why is there a
campaign of hatred against us among the
people of the Middle East not the
government's but among the people and it
was a little surprising in 1958 because
that was right after the US had
intervened to kick Israel in England and
France out of Egypt which they invaded
but still there was a campaign of hatred
well the National Security Council
released highest planning body released
the study of it and said it's true that
they said there's a perception in the
Middle East that the United States
supports the harsh and dictatorial
regimes and blocks democracy and
development and we do it because we want
to gain control over their resources and
I went on to say well you know the
perception is more or less accurate and
that's what we should do okay then
don't hate us because they hate our
freedoms they hate us because they want
their freedoms and they understand that
the u.s. supports dictatorial oppressive
regimes blocks democracy and development
and we do it because that's the way we
control things and it's the same today
actually after Bush's rather ignorant
question of the defense Science Board
one of the main advisory panels of the
Pentagon it came out with a study you
know why do they hate us study and they
said you know it's not our freedoms it's
their policies they hate our policies
for good reasons as long as we so why do
we continue the policy is when then we
know it's going to lead to hatred
because we're trusting the dictatorships
to hold down their
relations justice we're trusting Keith
Dayton's army to keep control of the
Palestinians so there'll be a legitimate
partner for Israel I mean that's our
policy not only there but all over the
world and we didn't invent it the
British did the same you know the French
did the same and so on those are
Imperial policies we were in favor of
them okay let's be honest about it at
least and not pretend we're some kind of
a messianic Wilsonian state or not three
countries with nuclear weapons the
Pakistan developed nuclear weapons
during the Reagan years and the Reagan
administration pretend that it didn't no
of course they know the reason is they
were supporting zeal Huck was the
absolutely the worst and most atrocious
of the many military dictators that
Pakistan had zeal Huck was also carrying
out radical Islam ization of Palestine
of Pakistan with Saudi support most of
this kind of intellectual roots of
terror go right back to Saudi Arabia and
they were giving plenty of money so they
were providing lots of funding for
developing you know Madras Fez actually
means schools but special religious
schools where the children are trained
just as an extremist you know all they
did was read the Koran and you know
learn about extremist versions of Islam
the Saudi versions and Reagan was
supporting that so we supported part of
his legacy is you know al-qaeda style
Tet terrorism another part is Pakistani
nuclear weapons and the reason for it
was you know they were the Reagan
administration was and also the
Democrats were very excited about
Afghanistan they were gathering up the
most extreme radical Islamist fanatics
they could find anywhere in the world
and sending him to Afghanistan and army
and with advanced weapons and so on the
goal was not to liberate Afghanistan in
fact the head of the CIA station in
Islamabad Pakistan who was running the
operation was very straight about it he
said we don't care one way or another
about Afghanistan the point is to kill
Russians and he said that's a noble goal
and that's what we want to do when they
got that goal they left Pakistan in the
hands of the u.s. back were Lords were
so vicious that when the Taliban came
they were welcomed so that's Pakistan
India actually the u.s. as long as India
was either neutralist or you know had
pretty good relations with the Russians
the US was opposed to their developing
nuclear weapons and imposed sanctions
but by the last 10 years or so India has
been drifting towards a closer alliance
with Israel and the United States so and
part of that context is well they can
have nuclear weapons if they like and
will support it the treaty that granted
in the the right to develop nuclear
weapons with our support has a somewhat
broader context for one thing it was
sold here straight out as a for
commercial advantage that opens up India
to arms sales from the United States
sales of nuclear technology and so on
you know like a big market and growing
country but also it has to do with Iran
I mean a centerpiece of US policy is to
isolate Iran now India is energy short
and the obvious way for them to get
energy is with a pipeline from Iran and
Iran Pakistan India pipeline because
Iran is rich in energy but the US
doesn't want that it wants them not to
get Iranian energy part of the way to
talk them out of it was to give them
support with developing nuclear energy
which meant freeing up nuclear weapons
development and actually the invasion of
Afghanistan
has to do with that too I mean in the
background of the invasion of
Afghanistan this goes back 20 years is
the idea of setting up a pipeline from
Turkmenistan Central Asia which is very
rich in natural gas one of the biggest
in the world a pipeline from there to
India which would run through
Afghanistan in fact it would run through
Kandahar was a place that's there now
planning to attack and that pipeline if
it could be established would have two
functions for one thing it would
undermine efforts to establish Iran
India relations and it would also
undermine Russia's efforts to maintain
control of its former you know parts of
what used to be the Soviet Union that's
a kind of a background consideration for
the invasion of Afghanistan nobody knows
just how significant it is but in that
context it's understandable can't
approve of it but it's understandable
why the US government both Republicans
and Democrats would agree to support
India's violation of the
non-proliferation treaty and develop
nuclear weapons as far as Israel is
concerned that goes back to the Nixon
administration Nixon administration made
a deal with Israel that if you're in
turn the details this is a the main book
about it is by an Israeli analyst of
Newark Cohen that's in English but what
he reports is that it's not on paper but
it's assumed that Nixon and prime
minister golda meir just made a deal
that the US would permit Israel to
maintain its policy of silence you know
not admitting that it has nuclear
weapons and not denying it and that the
US would not interfere with that and
Obama reiterated that after the
International Atomic Energy Agency
called on Israel to open up its
facilities so yeah it's a it's a client
state it's a valued
SLI so if they want to have nuclear
weapons okay you started addressing the
question but you've been talking
extensively about what international
laws we've violated and how we violated
them but maybe what what I would like
you to elaborate a little bit on is why
we violated them and as a follow-up to
that is what concern to local population
/ international law we would give in our
quest to global domination and our
access accessing local local natural
resources look I'm supposed some
unbelievably powerful country you know
from Mars that decided to take over US
agricultural and mineral resources
because they wanted them I suppose they
were powerful enough to do it what would
we say they should do we know what we
would say they should do okay same when
we carry out what's calling literally
called protecting our resources so you
go back to top US planners you know
George Kennan and the rest they say we
have to use force to protect our
resources which happened to be in other
countries but that's not like an
accident of history a Clinton for
example his official doctrine which was
worse than Bush's was but it was quiet
so no we made a fuss about it but the
official doctrine was that the u.s.
maintains the right to use force to
ensure our control over markets and
resources elsewhere okay that's our
commitment should we do that should any
other country do that I mean should
should do we did we support Saddam
Hussein when he invaded Kuwait why not I
mean he was trying to take control of
their resources which he actually had a
claim on you know there's a serious
Iraqi claim to a quake which was sort of
stolen from Iraq by the British to block
the Iraqi access to the sea when they
said
but did we say okay that's fine you can
protect your McCann take your resources
by invading Kuwait I mean we have a
principle about this and we apply it to
everyone except ourselves for our
clients okay that's should we do that
well you know it depends whether you
like to live in a criminal state in a
criminal society as far as why we
violate international law it's just
pretty straightforward because we can
get away with it this is nobody else in
the world does not do anything about it
and as long as the American population
is passive and obedient no but nobody
anything about it here
I mean takes a the the World Court case
that I mentioned to repeat the u.s. is
the only country now having lost the
companionship of Albania and Libya the
only country that has violated a world
court decision take a careful look at
that world court decision it's very
illuminating the court Nicaragua brought
a case to the world court run by a very
distinguished international lawyer
Harvard Law Professor
the World Court threw out most of the
case almost the entire case and just
drew a decision on very narrow grounds
of bilateral nicaraguan u.s. treaty
why'd they throw out the case because
the world courts rules require that it
cannot adjudicate
a conflict unless both parties agree to
the jurisdiction now when the u.s.
accepted world court jurisdiction in
1946 okay it added a reservation saying
that the u.s. is immune to any case that
relies on international law meaning
anything involving the UN Charter or the
charter of the Organization of American
States the u.s. is immune to anything
brought up under those conditions
meaning the US this is 1946 when it was
pretty much running the world
essentially said look we do not accept
jurisdiction we do not accept the
application
international law to ourselves so though
in the World Court
you know accepted that that's the way
it's a rules work and it even goes on I
mean in a couple of years ago I forget
early two-thousands Yugoslavia brought a
case to the World Court about the NATO
bombing of Serbia ok one of the charges
in the in the indictment the petition
that they brought to the court was on
genocide well the u.s. withdrew from the
court proceedings on the valid grounds
that when the u.s. signed the Genocide
Convention after 40 years
it added a reservation saying it doesn't
apply to us okay so we're free to commit
genocide well okay we're free to commit
genocide we're free to violate the the
UN Charter and any other international
treaty because we say so okay and we can
say so first of all practically nobody
knows it you know you have to be kind of
like a specialist in the topic to know
it I mean if we cared about our freedom
you'd teach this kind of thing in
elementary school but almost nobody
knows that except the few specialists
and it's if it's brought up it would be
considered perfectly legitimate i'ma
take say the International Criminal
Court when the International Criminal
Court was established a couple of years
ago it was not permitted to include the
crime of aggression the most serious
crime of all because the US wouldn't
tolerate that you don't want charges of
aggression to be floating around because
we do too much of it so that was knocked
off then even after that the u.s.
refused to accept the jurisdiction of
the court now the public wants to I'm
the public is strongly in favor of
accepting international jurisdiction but
elites are not so the u.s. rejected the
jurisdiction of the International
Criminal Court and in fact a couple of
years ago Congress passed a law which
the President signed which in Europe is
sometimes called the Netherlands
invasion Act
the law authorizes the President of the
United States to invade Holland if any
American is brought to the Hague to the
International Court to rescue them visit
I mean can anybody else even say that
you know okay if you're a big enough
bully and you have an obedient
population you can do what you like I
was I was thinking you talked earlier
that the USA in America and Israel we're
kin in hand together committing war
crimes and breaking international laws
and I know that the u.s. USA gives over
a billion dollars to Israel annually and
we as US citizens
we just paid we recently just did our
taxes and I couldn't help but think wow
some of my tax money is gonna go to
Israel to help kill my family and
friends in Palestine and then as
Americans we go and try to enter
Palestine / Israel and we were given
denied entry and our American
citizenship are stripped away from us
and we give no they give us no reason
why like they give no explanations who
are you referring to
um I guess a lot of my friends and
families who are not necessarily
Palestinian Americans but also Asian
Americans are just not allowed in not
allowed entry you mean yeah are given
denied entry but are given no
explanations that's the least of it yeah
that's
is there are few Jews were not allowed
entry like Richard Falk the UN
Rapporteur for Gaza or Norman
Finkelstein you know maybe others
Americans you know that to be Jewish but
sure that's bad but you know that
doesn't begin to compare with the crimes
that are being committed in the occupied
territories and certainly when you when
American citizens to pay taxes but not
only are they helping fund Israel but
though they don't know it they're
funding an organization which is
committed by law in Israel to work for
the benefit only for the benefit of
people on quoting of of Jewish race
religion and origin and that
organization is not a small when it
happens to control them about 90% of the
land in Israel and Americans are
contributing to that because that
organization has tax-free status it's
called the Jewish National Fund I mean
would you want to contribute to an
organization that is bound by law to in
say in the United States to control
ninety percent of the land for the
benefit of people of you know white
religion race and origin or something I
mean that's kept very quiet because of
Americans don't do anything about this
they wouldn't like it so okay that's the
task of people who care about the world
let people know
[Applause]
