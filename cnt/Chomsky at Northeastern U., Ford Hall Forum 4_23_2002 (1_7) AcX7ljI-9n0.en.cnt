thank you Tom and to the fort hall forum
Northeastern University I'm I have to
tell you I'm I'm smitten by the size of
the audience come to hear professor
Chomsky tonight I'm just so delighted to
see that expression of of interest in
the news that that statement that you're
making by by coming here tonight when
when I was a very young reporter with
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation I
remember being in the production area
one of the major current affairs
programs for radio back in the 1970s now
I was brand new and I was being shown
around and everyone was being very
polite to me and speaking in very soft
voices as you do when you're gently
trying to integrate someone into
something new and one of the senior
producers slammed down the receiver of
his telephone stood up and said all
right it was a sort of 1970s version of
yes everyone turned to him and he smiled
like this trophy fisherman and he said
we've got him there was a pause of
expectation in the room just like this
one now we've got Chomsky he said and a
sigh of satisfaction in the room now I
was a very young reporter I knew the
name but being the ace cub reporter
wanna be that I was I knew I had to find
out a little bit more about the man so I
thought well that's simple I'll just
read what he's written right 30 years
ago that was a full-time job even today
just keeping up with the writing of Noam
Chomsky is a full-time job he has
written over 70 books over a thousand
articles he writes about linguistics
philosophy intellectual history
contemporary issues international
affairs and u.s. foreign policy mr.
Chomsky was born in Philadelphia his
undergraduate and graduate years were
spent at the University of Pennsylvania
where he received his PhD in linguistics
in 1955 while he was a junior fellow of
Harvard he completed his doctoral
dissertation entitled transformational
analysis it later form part of a more
extensive work called the logical
structure of linguistic theory norm
tomski joined the massachusetts
institute of tech
nology in 1955 and in 1961 was appointed
full professor in the Department of
linguistics and philosophy from 66 to 76
he held the Ferrari p ward professorship
of modern languages and linguistics in
1976 he was appointed institute
professor a position he holds today in
the spring of nineteen sixty-nine he
delivered the John Locke lectures at
Oxford in January 70 the Bertrand
Russell memorial lecture at Cambridge
University in 72 the nehru memorial
lecture in new delhi in fact we were
just exchanging remarks behind the
curtain here about a trip that he just
completed in in india he is on the move
perhaps more than most reporters you'll
ever talk to professor Chomsky has
received dozens dozens of honorary
degrees from universities on four
continents he is a fellow of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences
and the National Academy of Science in
1988 he was awarded the Kyoto prize in
basic science that is the Japanese
equivalent of the Nobel Prize he has
received the Helmholtz medal the Dorothy
Eldridge peacemaker award and the ben
franklin medal in computer and cognitive
science now my sister is a speech
pathologist and she's particularly good
at her job so she understands norm
Chomsky on the topic of linguistics I
explained I was having a little bit of
truffle with that so she said she could
put it to me in rather simple terms she
said that almost everybody that you meet
who goes to school learns something as a
result of the way that Norm Chomsky
changed the way our education system
introduces us to language now what
introduced it what intrigues me as a
journalist about mr. chomsky's mind is
what he writes what he says about power
about the way in which power is used
about the way that it is abused and the
way it is often excused about this time
of year or so ago he was actually
talking about retiring I don't know if
it was in fact September 11 that kept
him at his keyboard and but I can say
that this nation and this world is a
much better place for having his
arguments and his ideas made as
available as they are so on the topic of
the emerging framework of world power I
ask you to welcome professor Noam
Chomsky
it's widely held that the post-september
11th world will never be the same and
there's no doubt that that 911 was an
event of historic importance however
it's less clear how it's going to affect
the emerging framework of world power
personally I'm rather skeptical I
suspect that we may discover down the
road that it has established more firmly
tendencies that are already underway in
our rather deep-rooted well to clarify
the basis for that judgment it's
worthwhile to think about a few
background issues in particular to
questions and I'll start with those
first is why is it a historic event and
the second is why did it happen I should
say that these questions themselves
often elicit highly irrational reactions
as if seeking explanations and trying to
place events in the historical context
amounts to what sometimes called
rationalization or implies that the
victims deserve to be murdered that's
very common but it's so outlandish that
it's hardly necessary to comment and
I'll put it aside its comment about the
people who raised the questions other
than that not worth discussing so first
why is it a historic event well the
answer that is simple it's because of
the choice of victims and not the nature
of the crime that much should be obvious
to anyone who's familiar with the record
of the past several hundred years which
it should be unnecessary to review
however it may be useful I think it is
to listen to some voices of the
traditional victims reacting to
September 11th so it takes a Latin
America particularly important to us our
shadows been cast they're very heavily
for a long time September 11th
atrocities were very
be partially condemned as they were
virtually everywhere but quite often
with a recollection of their own
suffering so in Central America perhaps
the leading research journal as the
journal of the Jesuit University in
Managua they described the events they
said the events of similar September
11th could be described as Armageddon
but added that we have suffered our own
Armageddon in slow motion referring to
the atrocities of the 1980s which was an
international terrorist attack condemned
by the World Court as you know and it
would have been condemned by the
Security Council if the United States
hadn't vetoed it and that was more
serious than September 11th tens of
thousands of people killed the country
wrecked may never recover so yes this
may be Armageddon but it's not new to us
in Panama a journalist radio journalist
like others bitterly condemned the
September 11th atrocities but added that
we're familiar with it he referred to
the attack the bombing of the body of
Sharia in November 19 December 1989 when
the United States invaded Panama and
that one bombing according to Panamanian
sources a several thousand people were
killed in the poor body Oh since it's
our atrocities we don't investigate and
nobody really knows the details but it
was certainly serious the that invasion
that that was operation just cause
undertaken by George Bush the first in
order to kidnap a disobedient thug who
was brought to the United States and
tried and is now in jail sentenced for
crimes that he committed almost entirely
on the CIA payroll well they remember
that and others refer to Operation
Condor and the atrocities in the
southern cone
again international terrorism because of
the u.s. involvement crucial involvement
and others speak of the international
terrorist wars of the 1980s in Central
America that left hundreds of thousands
dead millions of refugees and orphans
four countries ruined there were
international Gallup polls taken after
September 11th condemnation of the
atrocities was near universal on the
other hand there were very few places
where there was much support for a
military reaction some places in part
from a few places it rarely went above
about thirty percent rather legal means
the kind of means that Nicaragua
attempted to pursue but failed because
they ran up against a more powerful
force namely us that wouldn't permit
legal means
