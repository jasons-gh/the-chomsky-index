policy in his latest hegemony or
survival this talk from the United
Nations Correspondents Association in
New York City is an hour and 40 minutes
okay thanks thanks very much for coming
I should explain I guess to the members
of ANCA that there are many people who
are strangers in our Mis that's because
this is a joint event with the UN
Society of writers that in fact they
organized it hands Janacek who is the
president of the UN Society of writers
is here hands thanks very much for
organizing this are the TV crews really
now can we get going
yeah thanks okay the first time I met
Noam Chomsky was in 1984 in Nicaragua
when I used to write for the Guardian
newspaper in England which as many of
you probably know is somewhat
left-of-center and at the time I think
the analysis of the situation in
Nicaragua that norm and I were doing was
not very popular in the United States I
think we both subsequently felt
vindicated when the International Court
found against the United States
government at the time and even more so
when the iran-contra scandal blew and we
found out that the Reagan administration
had allowed a secret government to
operate from the basement of the White
House in contravention of statutes and
contravention of law passed by Congress
at the time I sort of uh naively thought
that that was the worst violation of
international law that I would ever see
by an American government but as Kofi
Annan has pointed out what we saw in
Iraq last year was also a violation of
international law and it is a violation
of international law by the US
government that brings us back together
again and I welcome no here thanks very
much for coming and do you want to speak
first or write them do you want to go up
to the podium there
okay that's right so I see some of you
have your tape recorders hell shunt them
over okay he's gotta wanna swing I gotta
work can you hear me back there yeah
okay so the wireless is working and
these things are all presumably working
everybody
national security team have their mic
well this is strikes me while I'm here
that this is about the time of the year
when my students are going around for
job interviews if they're lucky enough
to get them I say this is the time of
the year when my students are going
around for job interviews if they're
lucky enough to be invited and if they
are they're expected to give a talk
technical talk I have a few questions if
they don't consult too many people on
the faculty they may even be offered the
job and I guess that's the same format
so I'll try not to insult too many of
you and maybe I had a chance with the
award every self-respecting president
has a doctrine attached to his name
the for the current incumbent and
Washington that's been expanded from a
doctrine to visions and dreams as well
but most presidents it's just doctrine
these doctrines are interesting to
investigate they're often important I'm
sure it I'll keep just to the current
bush doctrine which happens to be
unusually prominent clearly articulated
very dramatically implemented so there
would be no doubt as to what it means
and
the widely discussed to an unusual
extent the Bush Doctrine has several
related components all of them clearly
articulated just quote the first and
most general component of it is that it
is our responsibility to history to
drive evil from the world and that's a
far-reaching doctrine a special case of
this has got to be relentless war on
terror and furthermore quoting any state
that harbors terrorists is a terrorist
state and will be treated accordingly as
we drive evil from the world the third
and more formal enunciation of the
doctrine is the national security
strategy of September 2002 which
effectively declared the right to use
force to eliminate any perceived
potential challenge to us global
hegemony as Colin Powell put it the u.s.
reserves the sovereign right to take
military action where and how it chooses
he happened to say that in Davos at the
World Economic Forum meeting eliciting
quite a negative reaction from the
people who the business press the
International Business press called the
Masters of the Universe only slight
touch of irony the national security
doctrine also at the same time the Bush
administration made it very clear some
of the first aspect of the
implementation of it was to make it
clear where they stood with regard to
international law and international
institutions even before Powell's
statement the government had made it
clear to the United Nations that it
could be
relevant that was the term used if it
endorsed what the US was planning to do
anyway or else it could be as Powell
explained the debating society but those
were in effect the choices be relevant
and endorsed what we're going to do or
you can have polite discussions
somewhere the very well one using the
handle okay is this going to interfere
with the other so I undo the other well
this this announcement to the United
Nations of its choice between relevance
and debating society actually has come
to thee is right on the front pages of
the new of the press in England not here
right now
in the Katherine John case I'm sure you
know Katherine gun is being tried
because she leaked to the British press
reports that she had seen from the
American Embassy calling on British
intelligence to illegally attack members
of the Security Council so that the
United States would know how to coerce
or pressure them into becoming relevant
that is inversing what the US was going
to do those of you who know the history
of the United Nations will recognize
that this is coming full circle the San
Francisco conference which established
the UN at that conference delegations
were also illegally attacked by the FBI
so that the US would be able to control
the proceedings properly so we know have
a nice completion of the of the circle
but that's expresses from the beginning
and dramatically today the attitude
towards international institutions and
international law and it's not very
surprising it's pretty much the way
anyone
predict that the world dominant power
would behave it may be surprising to
people who prefer illusions but
historically it's not a great surprise
the national security a security
strategy the formal version of the
doctrine it not only elicited great
anger among the international business
elite but also among the foreign policy
a lead at home so immediately after it
was announced in September 2002 the
major establishment journal Foreign
Affairs a few weeks later had a
Polishness next issue with the lead
article called describing what the
author called the new imperial grand
strategy and warning that it was going
to cause serious problems for the world
and for the United States the even
before the doctrine had been officially
announced it was clear it was gonna be a
Henry Kissinger had described the
doctrine as what he called a
revolutionary doctrine which undermines
of the UN Charter undermines
international law in fact undermines the
whole Westphalian system since 1648
which barred forceful intervention into
the other sovereign states of course
that was West Fed who was only for great
powers but this as he as Kissinger
correctly pointed out the new doctrine
simply tears this whole framework to
tatters which he thought was a good
thing he basically supported the
doctrine but like many others and the
many other of the critics and the
foreign policy elite criticized the
implementation said reasonable position
but not the way the implementation has
many flaws and we'll call cause all
sorts of dangers
he also Kissinger is a realist scholar
and he pointed out that we must not
permit this doctrine to be universalized
it cannot become a universal principle
the in simple words this is a doctrine
for the United States which it the right
to use force at will against perceived
or potential enemies is to be reserved
to the United States it can delegate
that right to some of its clients but no
one else should line up for the
privilege that's clear and explicit the
national security doctrine was
immediately followed by exemplary
actions to make it clear to the world
that it was meant seriously it's not
just rhetoric the most obvious of them
and the one that attracted the most
attention was the invasion of Iraq the
there were others that were to which
less attention was paid but that might
over the long term prove more
significant one of them was the
announcement just weeks after the
national security doctrine the
announcement by the Air Force Space
Command of that US policy in accord with
the national security doctrine was going
to shift from control of space that was
the Clinton doctrine to ownership of
space so from now on the US would own
space not just control it and then they
went to spell out it spelled out what
that difference is it means that any
potential competitor in space will be
destroyed and space means militarization
of space as they explained and it
we have docked the documents leading up
to it spelling it out it means placing
space platforms for highly destructive
offensive weapons nuclear and
non-nuclear this is under a first strike
doctrine which is official the world
will be under very tight surveillance by
hypersonic drones so you can tell if a
somebody's walking across the street and
Bangkok and so on and it means in
principle a command post could
instantaneously without warning attack
can destroy any place in the world
without much need for forward facing and
other annoyances and this system has to
be owned not just controlled that was
November 19 November 2002 the u.s.
continued meanwhile to oppose
unilaterally UN efforts to ban the
militarization of space that has been
going on for some years the most recent
case was last December and again
unilaterally with the reflexive votes of
Israel and I think Micronesia the u.s.
opposed the otherwise unanimous decision
to reserve space for peaceful uses this
has been going on for some years now UN
disarmament Commission's have been
deadlocked over Washington's refusal
respect to Clinton to ban militarization
of space however the advance from
control to ownership is a substantial
one and in line with the national
security doctrine and very ominous in
its implications I mean others plainly
don't just say that's fine
Russia has already responded by sharply
increasing its military spending its
offensive weaponry
it has move
to launch on warning automated response
systems which were dangerous enough in
the past and are far more dangerous
today with the deteriorating command and
control systems of this Russian state as
the economy collapses just to cheer you
up you may recall in 1995 what before
the deterioration had set in we came to
minutes from a missile launch which
probably would have destroyed much of
the world went when account there was a
ten-minute countdown
after the Russian computers had
misidentified a space rocket as a
missile attack it was aborted in two
minutes short of flight instant
retaliation presumably go beyond what
Eisenhower predicted in nineteen in the
1950s that any such exchange would be
mean the destruction of the northern
hemisphere we've gotten much more
violent and powerful since then these
dangers are being enhanced Russia has
also moved to a first-strike doctrine
China is responding the same way as
predicted what's called ballistic
missile defense is understood both by
adversaries and by advocates in the
United States as being an offensive
weapon it's called a shield a sword not
just the shield on both sides and the
reaction to it is to build up offensive
military forces very threatening with
the obvious ripple effects don't
actually go into it so these are all
severe challenges threats being
significantly escalated all implementing
the same thinking can't just attribute
it to the Bush administration mentioned
as roots before but the sharp escalation
of it is significant very significant
the
moon shot that Chinese and American moon
shots are very likely related to this
the moon is if any of this gets off the
ground to use a appropriate metaphor
probably the moon will be used for
military purposes as part of the
militarization of space system and the
Chinese challenge to land a shuttle is a
challenge to the US official position of
ownership of space which does not lead
to attractive consequences if you think
it through
well let's get back to Kissinger and the
justification for the revolutionary new
doctrine and its implementation in Iraq
the he gave the conventional
justification the justification is that
Iraq possesses weapons of mass
destruction and is connected to terror
well it's by now clear even from the
scandalous Hutton report that bush and
Blair and their associates sexed up the
intelligence reports borrow the
notorious BBC phrase which elicited
interesting hermeneutic disquisition
from Lord Hutton as you may have seen if
you put yourself through the pain of
reading the report but that the
intelligence data was sexed up is not
seriously in question and the purpose
was to establish that Iraq was dangerous
imminent threat because of its weapons
of mass destruction and its ties to
terror recall that that was presented as
the only question repeatedly the only
question
by Colin Powell Jack Straw and others
and rather clear that they had they had
to know at that time that any evidence
they had was shaky at best now we know
how shaky but what is important is what
they knew then well
the failure to find weapons of mass
destruction has been significant but I
think its major significance has been
somewhat overlooked the main
significance of the failure to find
weapons of mass destruction is that the
bars for aggression have been lowered
so the original doctrine was what
Kissinger and the national security
strategy stated state countries that
have weapons of mass destruction are too
dangerous if they're you know rogue
states or whatever well now you have to
change the doctrine and it has been
changed so it is now just the possession
or the intent or ability to produce
weapons of mass destruction is
sufficient to justify aggression the
supreme crime of nuremberg that's a
significant change because almost
everyone has the ability the high school
and your local community probably has
the ability to produce chemical and
biological weapons and the intent was
just subjective evaluation which means
that anyone is subject to attack now
that's been made even more clear just a
few days ago by Condoleezza Rice who
reviewed what are now the official
reasons for that justified the attack
against Iraq and it's worth looking at
them not as a criticism of her but to
see what the conditions are that are now
accepted for free aggression according
to her Iraq the attack on Iraq was
legitimate because it had used weapons
of mass destruction in the past she
omitted conventionally the word
with our support those are never added
secondly it had attacked neighbors twice
again omitting the fact that the first
attack was with our support and the
second attack was followed by us
authorization to saddam hussein to crush
a shiite rebellion which might well have
overthrown him a fact which is has an
eerie similarity to what's happening
right at this moment as the US the CPA
is desperately evading the call of
Iraqis for an election because in which
the Shiite majority would obviously
dominate so that's the second reason the
third reason is that Saddam Hussein
allowed terrorists to run in his country
and was funding terrorists outside of
his country well she didn't bother
providing evidence for that we do have
evidence namely
that was that it was false but that it's
but that now something like that is true
so the evidence that we have and
intelligence agencies and independent
analysts pretty much agree on this is
that before the US invasion Iraq had
kept quite far from the international
terrorist organizations but after the
invasion predictably Iraq itself has
become a terrorist state a another front
in the war on terrorism and that
recruitment for al-qaeda style groups
has significantly increased so as
predicted the war did increase the
threat of terror and indeed succeeded
for the first time in turning Iraq into
a nest of terror fourth she there her
fourth argument is that Iraq has refused
to account for its weapons of mass
destruction and said I'm concealed his
programs well that's partially true
actually Iraq was more
closely investigated by inspectors than
other countries which have anything like
comparable programs but that aside there
is another country in the region which
has refused to account for its weapons
of mass destruction and concealed its
programs even though it's well known
that it has hundreds of nuclear weapons
and is producing chemical and biological
weapons and is regarded as extremely
hazardous in fact by the US military
command the Strategic Command stretch um
but that one doesn't count because
that's a u.s. client so it's there for
free of any of these obligations another
US ally as we have has recently been
made public that was known for a long
time Pakistan has been openly involved
in illegal proliferation for years it's
all been quite public inconceivable that
US intelligence agencies didn't know the
worst of what's now being exposed was in
the late 80s in the early 90s and it's
hard to imagine that the National
Security Adviser at the time or the head
of the Pentagon didn't know what was
publicly available on the streets of
Islamabad meaning that the current
Secretary of State and Vice President
had to know about this right at the time
there's no fuss being made properly
because it is indeed some stream ly
dangerous well those are the four
reasons for attacking Iraq run through
them they in fact eliminate any barriers
to the use of force at will almost no
pretense lift well let me drop that and
turn to the corollary the idea that
states that harbor terrorists must be
attacked to eradicate evil here we have
to make an exception we have to agree to
exclude the category of harboring
government of
officials if we open that door
the doctrine instantly reduces to
absurdity so let's not talk about
harboring government officials who are
large-scale terrorists and keep to
harboring what are called sub-national
terrorists those aren't at the level of
state planners or heads of state so what
about heart which countries Harbor
sub-national terrorists well there are
many charges about pre-invasion here act
kind that I've mentioned that you've
heard but they're rather dubious and it
isn't but there's much point paying much
attention to them because there are some
very clear cases of harboring terrorists
therefore terrorist states where this is
no controversy so take for example a
current a case that's currently timely
the case of the Cuban five which ought
to be front-page news everywhere their
appeal is coming up in about two weeks
what are the Cuban Five well as I'm sure
you know the United States has been
engaged in large-scale terrorist attacks
against Cuba since 1959 the US
government direct participation in those
attacks ended in the late seventies at
least officially but and since that time
instead of directly attacking Cuba the
United States has been harboring
terrorist networks that attack Cuba well
again this is not particularly
controversial its accepted for example
by the FBI and the Justice Department so
it takes a Orlando Bosch there's no
living happily in Florida he is accused
by the FBI of about thirty acts of
terrorism quite serious ones like
blowing up Cubana airliner with killing
seventy three people and many others
some committed on US soil the Justice
Department US Justice Department
regarded him regards him as a dangerous
terrorist whose presence in the United
States is a serious threat to the United
States and says that for 30 years he has
been engaged in implementing or
organizing terrorist activities George
Bush the first gave him a presidential
pardon at the request of his son the
governor of Florida so that major
terrorist is now carefully harbored in
Florida what about the Cuban 5 where do
they fit into this in the early 90s when
it was clear that terrorist attacks were
going to go on from there
Cuba Cuban agents infiltrated Florida
terrorist groups for several years at
one point they the Cuban government
informed the FBI that they now had
large-scale information about terrorist
groups operating in the United States
the FBI sent high-level officials to
Havana where they were given thousands
of pages of documentation and hundreds
of hours of video and audio tape
documenting terrorist actions being
planned and some carried out in Florida
and the FBI did react namely by
immediately arresting the people who
gave them the information that's the
Cuban five they reacted by leaving the
terrorist cells untouched and not
pursuing the information but arresting
the informants who had infiltrated them
and provided them with the information
three are now facing life sentences
several spent a long time and went off
whatever that is in solitary confinement
their wives are not allowed to visit
them though visas the you know the
government insisted on trying the case
in Miami the request for a change of
venue was turned down the foreman of the
jury
and by saying that I regard Castro as a
communist dictator and other members of
the jury went on the prosecution
conceded that they couldn't prove the
case but a Miami trial was sufficient so
that's the case of the Cuban 5 now
coming up for appeal
why is Cuba such a target for u.s.
terror well actually that was explained
nicely yesterday in the lead story of
The Wall Street Journal they look at the
lead story you see it described it says
that Cuba has been dedicated to the
cause of derailing the u.s. agenda in
Latin America and therefore is a
justified target for attack actually the
author of the story probably didn't know
it but he was virtually quoting from
declassified CIA documents 40 years
earlier which explained the reason for
the attack at that time extensive
terrorist attack on Cuba on the grounds
that Cuba the that the very existence of
the Castro regime is successful defiance
of US policies going back 150 years so
it just can't be meaning back to the
days of the month or a doctrine when the
u.s. intended to take over Cuba so no
Russians nothing like that so obviously
that can't be accepted and the wall
street journal' more or less has it
straight when they say that the crime is
the dedication to the cause of the
railing the u.s. is agenda in in latin
america the same article of the Wall
Street Journal goes on to say that
Chavez in Venezuela is the heir apparent
to Castro's cause of D railing the u.s.
agenda and latin america which makes
venezuela the successful existence of
that government
an unacceptable successful defiance of
US policies going back 150 years with
consequences that will be familiar to
people who know about the history of
this region and again it's timely just a
few days ago a Venezuela sought
extradition of two military officers who
had fled Venezuela after they were
charged with setting off bombs in
Caracas there now here Venezuela's
asking for extradition to more
terrorists harbored here for the moment
I will see what happens with that this
is connected with the military coup a
couple months ago which was openly
backed by the Bush administration
although it drew back when aroused an
enormous opposition in Latin America and
the military coup was overthrown
according to the British press very good
correspondence in the British press of
Latin American specialists they claimed
to have amassed evidence that the coup
was instigated or at least in part
instigated by three major figures of the
Bush administration who have a long
record of involvement in terrorist
crimes in the 1980s namely Elliott
Abrams Otto rife and John Negroponte II
their involvement in terrorist crimes in
the 1980s again isn't controversial for
that we can turn to the World Court
judgement that Tony mentioned and to
Security Council resolutions endorsing
the World Court judgement which of
course were vetoed by the United States
with Britain politely abstaining well
just to draw some conclusions the Bush
Doctrine quite directly implies that the
United States is a terrorist state and
should be treated accordingly
obviously harboring terrorists my a few
examples could easily add many others
just add one more right across the river
there's a leading terrorist being
Harvard Amano al constant who was the
head of the paramilitary organization
that was responsible for killing
thousands of Haitians during the in the
period of the military junta which was
supported not so tacitly by Bush one and
even more by Clinton Haiti has asked for
his active sentence did him in absentia
they've asked for his extradition
repeatedly they never get a response the
general suspicion is that the u.s.
doesn't want to extradite him because in
a trial connections with the his
connections with the US intelligence
will come out but whatever the reasons
are
he's another terrorist Harvard here one
might say that killing several thousand
four black people doesn't really count
as much of a crime so maybe it's not
like other cases of harboring terrorists
I won't go into that well without
continuing it's it's not very hard to
evaluate the doctrine of driving evil
from the world if we accept the
condition of universality but as Henry
Kissinger accurately pointed out that's
an error the doctrine is holds only only
selectively the power is a doctrine that
the powerful may invoke but not anyone
else
so therefore you could say that all the
examples I've given are completely
irrelevant and any others like them as
for the imperial grand strategy this i
think its implications are as
revolutionary as Henry Kissinger
indicated I think a good case can be
made that the implications go far beyond
and that it should be a matter of
rather considerable concern thank you
very much I hope we have time for a few
quick questions
[Applause]
I know Hannah chick wants to present you
with the medal of excellence but I think
there are a few people who want to ask
some questions and normally I I give
myself the right to ask the first one
but today I won't hug the microphone and
I'll go to Ricardo I'll die of not Emacs
first
hi mr. Chomsky we got all that from not
Emacs I won't trust good joke brave
questions what is in your view the risk
of four more years of Bush both inside
the United States and for the
international system what the impact
will be and secondly do you think Kofi
Annan should cede to us pressure to send
back you and personnel to Iraq and does
he have any room not to say having to
say no it's very hard to predict the
weather and predicting human affairs is
extremely difficult but there is a fair
possibility no possibility beyond what I
think any rational person would want to
accept that another four years of the
same policies it could be extremely
dangerous for the country and the world
and could cause may be irreparable harm
remember we have a lot of evidence it's
not just the past four years the same
people essentially were in office for 12
years 1981 to 1992 and there is a rich
record of what they accomplished it is
not discussed in the United States
because we have a kind of a principle
here that you're not supposed to look
into the mirror it's not unique to the
United States
but very striking here so anything that
happened in the past didn't happen okay
because we've changed course or some
miracle has taken place
so we're therefore not permitted to
carry out the rational approach that we
would to anyone else
I mean if Saddam Hussein appears in a
trial and says well why are you bringing
up all that old stuff from the 80s
doesn't mean anything now I'm a nice guy
I just had a born-again experience and
you know I'm going right to heaven we
wouldn't even bother laughing but when
that is done year after year after year
as it is by our own leaders we applaud
okay that's what it means to be a
disciplined intellectual and if we don't
want to accept that discipline we can
treat the matter just as we would in the
case of Saddam's crimes or Stalin's
crimes or anyone else's we can ask well
what did they do during those 12 years
and what are they been doing the last
four years the more reactionary it's a
reactionary selection from the first 12
years and it's clear enough now they
have a domestic agenda which is not
hidden I mean they're trying to unravel
the progressive legislation of the past
century to overcome the achievements of
popular struggles hard ones to gain some
benefits for people what we call a
minimal welfare state to transfer power
into the hands of unaccountable private
tyrannies in one way or another every
aspect of the program is like that
internationally they have the programs
that I've described they may back off
from them because they may find them
unfeasible but the programs are clear
and that's only part of them I mean also
program is about international economic
arrangements I think these could be very
dangerous in fact the kinds of programs
I've just talked about could literally
lead to destruction of the species you
know again you can't put a probability
on that we don't know what the
likelihood
of a devastating nuclear war in 1962
right when literally the world was one
word away from a nuclear exchange one
Russian submarine commander
countermanded in an order to shoot off
nuclear torpedoes during the Cuban
Missile Crisis which very likely would
have led to a devastating nuclear
response and then on and on and in
Eisenhower's destruction of the northern
hemisphere one word that was 1962
January 1959 1995 was much more
dangerous far greater destructive
capacity at that point we were two
minutes away as these threats are being
increased militarization of space alone
is increasing the threats significantly
and you know rational people don't take
chances like that and no matter what
your subjective probability is but it
will increase well you know basically no
one has a right to be in Iraq but Iraqis
so they should take the lead in
determining what happened what the
invasion has left such wreckage that how
Iraqis might decide to deal with what
remains you know I can't say we know
what they say in polls you can make your
own judgments from that in recent Iraqi
polls the most favorable rating for a
foreign leader is Jaxy Iraq the but by
about 5 to 1 they regard the u.s.
British forces as occupiers not
liberators right after Bush made his
speech about how we're changing course
once again and want to bring democracy
to the world
actually reiterating what Reagan it said
20 years earlier and everyone else after
that speech which was greeted with the
usual reverential law in the United
States there was a poll in Iraq about
asking you know Iraqis why they thought
the US was in Iraq and some agreed with
President Bush and the commentators here
one percent one percent thought that the
goal was to bring democracy to Iraq
about 70 percent thought it was to
control Iraq's resources and to reorder
the Middle East and consistently with
the goals of the United States and
Israel actually their responses were
more nuanced and sophisticated when it
went further it turned out that about
half although one percent thought the US
was trying to bring democracy about half
thought that the United States wanted
democracy if the US could control it now
that's the sophisticated response the
one that's based on history the one that
is understood by everyone in Latin
America for example or the one that
Iraqis understand perfectly well from
their own history I'm Sarah Lee were
free you know under British rule since
the 1920s but they know without reading
British secret records that they were
granted freedom on the grounds the
internal British records that they would
be an Arab facade behind which Britain
would rule with various constitutional
fictions and so on and same in Central
America in the Caribbean yes you can be
free and democratic as long as you do
what we say and I presume that's the
reaction of Iraqis and usually the
victims have a reasonably good
understanding of the world the people
holding the hammers and guns usually
don't understand very well but I think
we should try to respond to their
understand and if they want UN officials
there a UN force there okay I mean if
they want a military forces from the
region to try to control the miserable
security
situation that's resulted from the
invasion okay that's their decision if
they want to accept the economic program
that has been rammed down their throats
by the CPA
which no sovereign country would accept
just opening the country up to complete
purchase by foreigners meaning the
mainly US corporations they decide they
want that like they want to commit
economic suicide all right fine
if they decide they want the kinds of
social and economic programs every
sovereign state with any independence
pursues that's fine too then we throw
that out my child he was in this room
not so long ago and he told us he loved
the program he may I mean that program
will have we know what that effect what
effect such programs have those are the
programs that created the third world I
mean if anyone knows any economic
history knows that say 200 years ago
there wasn't much difference between
what's now the first world and what's
now the third world actually India and
China with the commercial and industrial
centers of the world Europe was kind of
backwards in most respects but now
they're very different usually different
how did it happen
the European states the developed States
England United States France Germany
Japan the one country that resisted
colonialism up to the East Asian you
know Tigers without exception they
radically violated the principles of
economic liberalism they insisted on
massive state protection and subsidy
just as the US economy does today it
they were very highly protectionist an
interventionist on the other hand they
forced what is now the third world to
accept economic liberalism program he
wants an extreme form of it and it had
the predicted effects so at the end of
two hundred years of British rule India
was not the commercial industrial center
of the world anymore
which Britain was stealing technology
and so on it was an impoverished the
peasant country with mortality rates
about the same as they'd been 200 years
earlier began to develop afterwards
somebody could follow its own principles
however in every one of these
third-world countries everyone there is
an elite which is extremely wealthy and
privileged serves the interests of the
foreign masters and they do just fine
you know you go to the poorest country
in sub-saharan Africa and there are
people living at a lavish lifestyle we
can't dream of so in Iraq too under this
system there will be such people the
ones working with the foreign bankers
and international investors and with
Halliburton and so on we don't have
local managers know I'm running out of
time there are various people who want
to ask questions
I see three hands but I can identify I
think they're more back there I'd like
to take three questions and then I think
what I should do is allow those who want
to leave to leave so I'm gonna recognize
the Financial Times the Iranian news
agency in tempo and any others who want
to ask any questions I'll ask you to
pause well have they will be the medal
ceremony those who want to leave can
leave and those who want to stay and I
saw more questions if you if you can do
it then well let you do that the other
thing is perhaps I can ask you to be a
type refrain your responses never hear
that
[Music]
actually I was gonna ask two questions
so I'm just gonna ask one now very
specific question I was very interested
in the stuff you're saying about space
do you have a sense of where the debate
is going now in the United Nations in
terms of its - something I haven't
followed enormous didn't hit our radar
screen oh and what's gonna be coming up
over the next year
Thanks well we can that's very easy one
to answer just take a look at the last
debate was December at the General
Assembly it's the first committee I
guess the committee on the space and
disarmament which is essentially the
full General Assembly was last December
there were several resolutions that came
to the fore
one was a reiteration of the effort to
ban militarization of space I remember
the numbers but I think it was voted
something like you know 174 to 3 or
something like that not a u.s. Israel
and some Pacifica Pacific Island there
was another important resolution which
called for removing weapons of mass
destruction from the Middle East and
that was also voted overwhelmingly I
can't I don't remember the numbers but
overwhelmingly with the u.s. Israel and
maybe a Pacific Islands opposed but you
can look at the debates they're right
there on the you know on the UN record
and that's been going on for years the
the the first committee this the
disarmament and Security Committee I
think it's called has been dealing as
been meeting regularly for seven years
and has been hung up on the question of
militarization of space everyone on the
committee's led by China but it's been
essentially unanimous has been trying to
put some teeth in the 1967 Outer Space
Treaty which does loosely reserve space
for peaceful uses and they want to
enforce that and strengthen it and it's
been blocked all the way by the United
States all the way and there is no
reporting on this
it states actually virtually none had
some friends do database searches you
know you find a little newspaper in Utah
that's mentioned it or something so it's
basically unknown but it's public new
coming the disarmament committee will
continue to meet and the General
Assembly will continue to meet but they
can't do anything if the United States
vetoes it I mean the same is true on the
Outer Space Treaty itself there is a
1967 Outer Space Treaty which is not
terribly specific but the implication of
it as is to prevent the use of space for
military purposes for a long time nobody
did much with it a few years ago effort
started coming along in the General
Assembly to ratify it again re verify it
the reason was the recognition that the
u.s. intends to violate and it's come up
year after year forget how many now that
one the US doesn't vote against it
abstains everyone votes for it and the
US and Israel I abstain okay Israel
doesn't matter but a u.s. abstention is
ineffective veto a double veto the u.s.
abstention vetoes the proposal and
vetoes it from history which is why you
don't know about so it's not reported
and not discussed and so on so the
double veto has succeeded in blocking
efforts to so I said abstain but when
the u.s. abstains it's in effect to lead
to it's because that means not going to
happen okay when the most powerful state
in the world says look I mean do with
this that's infected veto and in fact a
double veto because reporting is also
effectively veto and it disappears from
history the and and that's in the course
of the issue of militarization of space
for probably five or six years now this
goes back to the Clinton administration
among all of this completely public
incidentally
so if you read the if you look take a
look at the website of the Space Command
that's open back around 1997
it's a Clinton year era the Space
Command announced clearly its programs
over then control of space not ownership
of space now it's up to ownership for
control of space very elusively I mean
what kind of reading like a little
Maoist book it said the US must control
have military control of space to
protect our investments and commercial
interests and then it went on to give a
little bit of history it said in the
past countries needed armies and navies
like written to control their commercial
interests and investments and now the
next frontier is space and we're gonna
take control of that to control our
commercial interests and investments ok
very frank then they also pointed out
here they agree with US intelligence
projections that the process of
so-called globalization will have
exactly the opposite effects of what is
predicted and they it will increase the
it will lead to a widening economic
divide a growing gap between the haves
and the have-nots the US intelligence
projections are the same it'll lead to a
growing economic divide also financial
volatility meaning lower growth and in
this case of in situation with the
growing with a widening economic divide
and a growing number of have-nots it's
gonna be harder to keep them under
control so therefore we knew new devices
like for example militarization of space
during a news agency a professor what
would be the role and situation of other
players such leaders of Russia China
France and others when they have to give
up to some kind of compromise or what
nobody has to do anything what they are
likely to do is pretty much what they
are doing
Russia as I mentioned has in the last
year has sharply increased I think by
that thirty percent its military
spending for offensive military purposes
new offensive weapons and so on
China is widely expected to do the same
or maybe already be doing the same in in
part in just in reaction to the
ballistic missile defense development I
mean everyone involved in that has
predicted that of course China is going
to respond by increasing its offensive
military capacities others will respond
in other ways I mean nobody is going to
say thank you please cut my throat if
you announce that you're going to attack
people at will and destroy them at will
they are likely to find some mode of
response that's why many international
well known international scholars have
said that these policies in Crete or
tend to increase proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and to
increase terror those are reactions that
people can use and sooner or later
weapons of mass destruction and terror
will come together maybe right here it's
just a matter of time so those are
possible reactions there are other
things going on as well
I mean militarily the world is unipolar
no question about that
I mean the u.s. probably spends as much
as the rest of the world combined there
close to it in military force and as far
more advanced for example there isn't a
space race now because there's only one
country racing when the u.s. is talking
about going from control to ownership
it's not as if someone else is
interfering with the control they're not
so overwhelmingly ahead from a military
point of view but not economically
economically there's have been an are
three major economic centers or less on
a par your Europe Northeast Asia
Japan China South Korea others
interacting with them they're kind of on
a par Europe is an economic unit of the
same category as the United States
Northeast Asia is the most dynamic
economic region of the world it's it
also happens to have about half of
global foreign exchange reserves the
former head of the Clinton's Council on
economic advisors Laura Tyson really
recently described the International
economy in four simple words she said
America spends Asia lens and how long
that's going to go on nobody knows but
it it's it's an area which has reserves
which is growing fast which already has
a greater GDP than North America does
Europe is the same Europe countries of a
lot of talk has approximately the same
growth level productivity growth level
per capita as the United States and can
go off in its own direction these are
issues that go way back to the end of
the Second World War I mean it's right
throughout the Cold War one of the
concerns of u.s. planners was that
Europe would become what was called a
third force would go off on its own well
that still remains the end of the Cold
War had changed that and now there are
comparable problems in East Asia a lot
of the maneuvering around control over
Middle East oil and the lesser but
significant central Central Asian oil
resources a lot of that maneuvering
including Iran has to do with who's
going to control those energy resources
because whoever controls them if the
u.s. controls them as it intends to do
it will have what George cannon once
called veto power over the decisions of
other actors that was 50 years ago it's
even more the case now so a lot of lot
of alternative implemented
something for example with the treasure
of the world the war in Iraq what do you
think fine I mean there's a lot of
studies this by and large the media
transmit a doctrinal position which is
shared by state power by corporate power
and by the media elites themselves were
part of it it's easy to document it if
you want to and if you want a close
analysis concerning with concern with
Iraq I'd suggest that you take a look at
one careful study done by which you can
pick up on the web done by the most
important public attitudes study program
in the world it's the program on
international policy attitudes of at the
university of maryland p IP a.org you
can pick it up they did a study about a
month ago or so called misimpressions of
iraq okay in which they investigated
beliefs that are so obviously outlandish
that there's no serious debate about
with the true or false and those are the
misimpressions of direct and they
evaluated them among the public they're
extremely high but then in response to
your question they traced those
misimpressions to media sources turned
out if you're getting people who are
getting their news from Fox News about
80 percent had at least one serious
misimpression many more people who were
getting their news from major print
media you know a leaf print press about
fifty percent serious misimpression
those who are getting it from National
Public Radio about 25 percent serious
misimpression these incidentally are
missed impressions that I don't think
anyone would have in Europe or Asia or
anywhere else and that's misleading
estimate as they point out because about
20 to 25 percent of the public somewhere
in that neighborhood are getting their
information from talk radio you just
turn that on and you'll find out what
that means
and among young people when you'd sort
of break down the demographics forgotten
the numbers but I think a majority from
say 18 to 22 roughly that range are
getting their news from comic shows with
better on television late at night you
know these political comic shows well
you know taking out that piece of the
population but this is an indication of
the way effectively the corporate media
transmitted the kind of propaganda line
not because they are subordinating
themselves to it but because they agree
with it mr. Chomsky we clearly could go
on all afternoon here there are a lot of
people I could see who would like to ask
questions but we don't have time and
hands Janacek does want to give you your
medal for your sterling work over the
years I'm gonna allow my colleagues who
need to go off and file to leave and
we'll go to the medal ceremony and then
those who want to stay and ask some
questions perhaps we might be able to
squeeze in a few before lunch
professor Chomsky it's a great honor for
us that you accepted our invitation but
even more so that you accepted our Award
of Excellence which the Society of
writers has been giving annually to
outstanding literary and political
figures for their contribution to peace
and understanding in fact over the past
15 or 17 years so far and it was
previously awarded to international
statesmen such as Mikhail Gorbachev and
great writers like Norman Mailer the
members of the Society founded in 1989
our diplomats and journalists accredited
to the United Nations as well as
individual staff members with a
distinguished literary record we deeply
believe that there is a link between
politics or diplomacy on one hand in
literary art on the other because there
are many things that you cannot say in a
political or diplomatic fashion you need
a literary element and this is one of
the things that we have admired about
you for so many years it's not only what
you say it's how you say it and you can
see what a response you have and you
never raise your voice and you never
swear and you never hit the table with
your fist you always keep calm but
persuasive persuasive indeed and this is
why the citation for the award which is
a medal I will take I will show it which
is a medal on a blue ribbon with
inscription x-men take office
which I would say translated as from the
spirit of the world but there are also
other interpretation but what it means
really is the conscience of mankind and
that's what it's all about professor
Chomsky we honor you today in gratitude
he have kept the flame of reason and
common sense alive when they were
threatened you stayed calm in the clash
of civilizations but recorded the
conflict in a uniquely somber and
persuasive style your voice is heard all
over the globe they have earned the
respect of millions eager to find the
truth in a troubled world there is no
better place to express our respect to
you than here the United Nations whose
spirit and principles you represent
[Applause]
now I know how my all right well we're I
mean we're gonna be taking the professor
upstairs to have some lunch shortly but
are there any more questions
does anybody well I only seem I only see
I see three hands so I'm going to take
those three questions and then I'm
afraid that's going to be it and you
leave the the pioneer of India thank you
Oh yesterday George Bush he announced
his budget and there's a increase in
defense spending how alarming is that
can you comment how alarming is the
increasing defense spending well I mean
it's Salar mning in many respects for
one thing
spending on one area provides what are
called forgone opportunities means you
don't spend on another there are very
serious problems in the country that
require major spending I don't have to
enumerate them and there if you have
more spending for what's euphemistically
called defense you don't spend on those
other things so those problems get worse
and they are serious the military
spending itself has two functions one
function is of course intimidation and
domination
it's what's described in
say they Clinton area zero Space Command
document the public document brochure
that I quoted to use military force to
secure us investments in commercial
interests and now that means in accord
with the national security strategy as
by now sharpened according the right to
attack anyone you like without you know
without pretext and in accord with the
means now available with ownership of
space and so on so that's one aspect and
we don't have to talk about what that
implies it's not pretty
however there's another aspect of
military spending which is often
suppressed it keeps the economy alive
now this is not what's called the
military-industrial complex that's wrong
what's called the new economy you know
that everyone is so proud of what Alan
Greenspan hails as the result of the
entrepreneurial spirit of the free
market and you've heard all of this
stuff almost all of that comes out of
the dynamic state sector of the economy
that's one reason why the third world
became the third world while the first
world remained became the first world
the first world relies on a dynamic
state sector no country more than the
United States so take a look at all the
things you're you use you know computers
electronics generally the internet trade
which is based on containerization
containers biotechnology run through the
list they almost all derive from the
state sector the public there are
devices by which the public pays the
costs and shares the wrist and then if
anything comes out of it it's handed
over to private power so like say the
Internet
it was for 30 years it was in the state
sector
that's when all the hard work was done
around 1995 it was marketable so was
handed over to private corporations
computers throughout the nineteen fifty
in the 1950s computer was something
about the size of this room with vacuum
tubes blowing up all over the place and
paper floating all over during the 1950s
under the pretext of air defense the
places like MIT we're able to get
computers down to the point where you
could sell them to somebody
the first mainframes company was a
spinoff from that around 1960 that's why
IBM has shifted from making typewriters
to making computers they were part of
this and it's the same with almost the
entire dynamic part of the economy
furthermore this goes way back in
history so the if you go back a century
the major engineering problems
metallurgical and engineering problems
and mechanical problems the major ones
the hard ones that had to do with
putting huge guns on moving platforms
which were able to hit another moving
target meaning naval guns that was an
extremely difficult problem required
complicated engineering electronics
metallurgy and so on and it was carried
out primarily by the English and the
Germans then under the rubric of defense
but then of course it's spun off into
the automotive industry and all sorts of
other things that gave the economy of
that day economic historians of
technology point out maybe accurately
that space that the problems of space
today are comparable to the problems of
naval gunnery done 100 years ago and
will have the same effect
so that's without proceeding that's
another part of the defense's so-called
defence system it's a way of socializing
risk and cost and creating the profits
future economy everyone you know I mean
this is all kind of suppressed in a way
so we talk about free markets and the
entrepreneurial spirit and everything
else but the actual way the economy
works is crucially like this and that's
part of the military system too you
could ask is it a good thing you know is
it nice to have computers and the
internet and so on well maybe maybe not
but the real question is is that the way
to do it I mean sure the decision to
spend public funds to develop computers
rather than say a health system should
that be made by deceiving people into
believing they're being protected from
enemies or should it be made by the
people themselves who are evaluating
these decisions in other words do we
believe in democracy if we believe in
democracy back in the 1950s there
wouldn't have been you know an air
defense system designed to create
computers that IBM could later sell
there would have been a public informed
discussion of whether we want our
resources to go into having pcs 25 years
from now or have a decent health care
and school and transportation system I
mean I know which way I would have vote
it but that's for people to decide and
those decisions are taken out of
people's hands in large part through the
military system it's another one of the
devices for undermining democracy and
for creating a particular kind of
private run economy in the future
that's quite apart from its role and the
use of military force so all of this has
to be considered
I was just wondering would you have any
comment on the price there Childress so
far on the presidential race well no
it's not a great secret that in the
United States elections are basically
bought large part of the population
accepts that as true so right before the
2000 election before the election so no
Florida trickery you know no Supreme
Court before the election about 3/4 of
the public regarded it as mostly farce
some game involving rich contributors
party bosses and the public relations
industry huge public relations industry
which trains candidates to keep away
from issues to present what are called
qualities you know I'm a nice guy to
invent to talk about that I use but to
keep away from the issues that are
important to people and if even if they
talk about those issues to do it in such
a way that nobody can figure out where
they stand which was essentially the
case that's the attitude about 75% of
the public and it's not inaccurate and
the result is that whoever can flood the
can flood the propaganda system
overwhelmingly pins to win you look at
the statistics over the years it's
dramatic now in a democratic culture
that concentration of power could be
overcome so to say take Brazil recent
case I'm in Brazil concentration of
capital concentration of media is worse
than it is here it's a much more
repressive state than here here the
state is minimally repressive by
comparative standards nevertheless
popular organizations were able to reach
a level of activism engagement in which
they were able to overcome these
consequences in the United States right
now that's just not imaginable it should
be but it isn't in order to reach the
level of say Brazil we would have to
have a reconstruction revitalization of
a democratic culture that has been very
severely eroded consciously eroded I
mean it doesn't just happen by itself
and that's a hard word it's not going to
happen by this election so this election
will be like this
one I presume in which it'll be bought
who's my buy it well you know the Bush
administration has money coming out of
their ears the financial industry loves
them the pharmaceutical industries you
know just salivating over the wonderful
gifts they're getting the rich in
general are getting an enormous gifts
from the administration and they're
going to pay it back because they want
to they want this train ride to continue
fantastic for the extreme rich wealthy
the financial institutions other top
sectors of the economy they love it
so they want it to stay and that means
in the last no matter what Democrat is
nominated in the last couple of weeks of
the election campaign you can expect
huge PR campaign I mean we can yes
here's one guess as to what it will be I
mean was pulling it out of a hat I mean
if I was Karl Rove you know say planning
what's gonna happen the last couple of
months I'd say well you know here's a
nice scenario let's right before the
Democratic convention
let's either kill or capture Osama bin
Laden
almost certain they know where he is you
know how hard can it be to find somebody
in a small area of Afghanistan or
Pakistan so let's wait until right
before the Democratic convention
suddenly killer captures that Osama huge
victory in the war on terror
let's if they carry runs let's paste
this achievement alongside of a picture
of him standing next to Jane Fonda and
stabbing our brave boys in the back and
you know on and on then on to the
coronation right here in New York by
accident timed with the anniversary of
9/11 I don't have to tell you what
that's going to look like yeah I mean
you don't have to be a PR genius to
figure out how to do this so something
like that will presumably have
and unless there's some very surprising
changes I it's very hard for me to see
how it can fail I hope it fails you know
I had said I'd just take one more but
how can I turn down a request like that
so I Greek newspaper Illinois to be a
professional many people claim that the
Republican Party has become the official
party of the Religious Right what are
the consequences of this in the
following year and the second part is
why the underworld movement in the USA
was not successful in stopping stopping
the war in Iraq why couldn't separate
the public opinion again I mean the
Republican Party is basically a party of
the super-rich and they have to have a
popular base and one way in which
they've organized the popular base is
what are called in the PR industry
values keep away from issues and focus
on values in other words don't let
people think about the fact that a job
don't let him think about the fact that
in the 20 years since the Republicans
basically took over with a little
interim average real wealth has actually
declined for about ninety percent of the
population
don't let them think about that don't
let them think about the fact that
Americans have the highest workload in
the world the lowest benefits the least
social you know the only country with
basically no advanced country with no
health services you can't take care of
your
don't let people think about that sort
of thing let them think about rising to
heaven when all the evil has been
destroyed and these souls are saved okay
or let them think about having a lot of
guns that they can run around with and
killed all the aliens are gonna attack
them or something like that they don't
think about those things but keep away
from the issues okay don't let them deal
don't deal with the fact that they
really oppose these internet these
corporate run globalization systems
everybody opposes them so let's not talk
about them and if I let's just keep away
from all the issues and focus on values
so yeah you get a mobilization of the
extremist fundamentalist group which is
big in the United States this is this
goes back to the art its origins not new
and it goes back to the origins of the
country this extreme fundamentalist
strain I mean the people who conquered
New England you know early at the
pilgrims I mean they were raving
fundamentalist a lunatic you know who
were waving the holy book declaring
themselves the children of Israel and
exterminating the Amalekites story okay
and it's for various reasons that stayed
like that it didn't become a major
political phenomenon until Carter Carter
who I presume was sincere presented
himself as a pious Christian and that
clearly understood pretty well that
that's an electoral gambit that we can
use since that time just about every
candidate for president almost everyone
pretends to be a very religious you know
Christian I mean you know like Bill
Clinton made sure that every Monday
morning there'd be a photograph in the
newspaper about him lustily singing in
the prayers of the Baptist so and so
what's going on in his mind
anybody's a certain question but this is
just a precondition for entering the
political system ever since this was
discovered and it's a way of keeping
people away from the issues just like in
fact if you take a look at the last
election year 2000 Bush managed to get
roughly 50/50 split by getting a large
white working-class vote and where the
two main issues were not my job or the
trade issues I hate or that kind of
stuff the two main issues were
religiosity and guns
okay that's running a successful
campaign keep entirely away from the
issues that bother people and just go to
something you can throw them red meat on
so yeah that's a connection that's real
there was a second part of the anti-war
movement well I think it's a funny
question they asked I mean it's like
asking why in 1962 didn't the anti-war
movement succeed in stopping the u.s.
attack against South Vietnam well one
reason is it wasn't any any war okay
why didn't the anti-war movement in
France in 1950 prevent France from
reinvade in their former colony same
answer that wasn't any idea where
movement I mean by now opposition to war
has reached far greater proportions by
now you can have massive adding war
movements even before a war is
officially declared so so it's true it
you know didn't quite succeed in
stopping it but that's an enormous
change over earlier years in the case of
Vietnam for example it was seven or
eight years before there was any visible
anti-war movement by then South Vietnam
was virtually destroyed in the case of
the French conquest of Vietnam nothing
you know destroyed a couple of people
protested but no movement and those are
changes over the years when the Belgians
you know got rid of
took over the Congo see any protests no
it's just it's become a much more
civilized world since then so yeah we
should be thankful for that there's
never been anything like the protests
last February never here or anywhere
else
is it enough to stop another act of
aggression well maybe not but it's
certainly a lot better never was
hi my name is chika mama I'm a retired
librarian from the United Nations 1990 I
retired I do not represent any newspaper
I have a question that so which there
might not be an easier answer the Berlin
Conference of 1886 imposed boundaries on
African countries and with which we have
had to live what 20 30 years do you
think that the United Nations should
take the lead in freeing Africa from the
burden of these imposed boundaries that
have no logic whatsoever in
considerations of the ethnicities
involved the prime example is Nigeria of
course from which I come where we have
struggled with we've struggled endlessly
with the ethnicities the diversity is
which diversity is good in America
diversity in Nigeria has given us a lot
of trouble is it reasonable for the
world to lift this burden from off the
Africans shoulders so that peoples that
cannot live together
can peacefully be helped to separate if
they are if they have a potential for
viability in the intervening years
Czechoslovak little Czechoslovakia is
peacefully split into two things are
going on in Yugoslavia in the Soviet
Union where people have separate peoples
have separated not always peacefully but
I know in Nigeria Biafra tried to
separate and was crushed so my question
simply is should there not be an end to
the burden of the Berlin conference of
1886 thank you I actually think that's a
sub case of a much broader question that
first the narrow question should the
world overcome this problem for Africa
they say the UN I don't think so I think
those are problems have to be overcome
in Africa I think Africans should
overcome that problem in their way with
whatever support and sympathetic support
the rest of the world can give them how
are these problems as you say are not
unique to Africa these this is the
development of the modern nation state
system in the last hundreds of years I
mean
Europe which is the center of it was the
bloodiest and most savage part of the
world for hundreds of years
because Europeans were slaughtering each
other trying to establish a totally
insane system namely the nation-state
system which exactly as you say just in
Europe doesn't correspond with people
what people's cultures are what their
connections are what their languages are
whatever it's just some irrational
system of force and domination that is
imposed on people with tremendous
violence I mean that's how Europe
developed the kind of culture of
violence which allowed it to conquer the
world
they were very practice slaughtering
each other like the 30 years of war
alone you know the later the Treaty of
Westphalia probably killed about maybe
40 percent of the population of Germany
these are not little things and in fact
it would have gone which still would
still be going on a lot of talk in
political science about Democratic peace
you know them accredit countries don't
go to war well and look at the
statistics but there's one fundamental
reason why you're getting any results at
all
in 1945 Europeans you know the
democratic countries realized that the
next time they play their traditional
game of slaughtering each other will be
the last because they had constructed
means of destruction so fantastic that
this game is just over okay did it for
the last 500 years we can't debate so
we're gonna fight each other anymore
we'll fight defenseless people but not
each other you know go snow otherwise
it's over I can't do it so yes there's a
kind of a democratic peace does that
mean that for Europe this is the right
system no it's a highly artificial
system in Europe too that's why you see
in Europe in opposition to the
centralizing tendencies of the European
Union there are also regional tendencies
development so if you look at Spain and
England and other parts of Europe
there's a kind of devolution going on
into regions that are more autonomous
that are reviving independent local
cultures and languages and I think that
so much it's a very healthy development
in my view and not just free and this in
in the rest of the world most of the
conflicts that are going on not just
Africa Asia Middle East are the results
of Europe's forceful imposition of the
state system okay in a way which had
nothing to do with the people I mean
taking what's Iraq Iraq was created by
the British in order to ensure that they
would have the oil not Turkey and that
the country wouldn't have an access to
the sea so they could control it okay
and make it free and democratic yeah and
and that's the same everywhere you look
I mean
personal remark I'm happened to be under
investigation by the state security
courts and Turkey because of a talk that
I gave in the Arabic here southeast
Turkey in which I said something nice
about the Ottoman Empire you know I
didn't suggest that we should go back to
the Ottoman Empire you know a lot of
rotten things about it but I did say I
thought in many respects the Ottoman
Empire had the right idea it there was a
center which fortunately was very
corrupt so did interfere with people too
much all right but for the most part it
left people alone to run their own
affairs so you know an Armenian part of
its affairs and somebody else could run
something else you could travel from one
place to another without having a visa
you know and the local regions were
pretty much autonomous and federated and
related and so on and so forth and
that's pretty sensible way for the world
to be organized I think but that means
unraveling a complex system of
nation-states now very tightly linked to
private power because they're called
multinational corporations but they
heavily rely on their home state for all
kinds of support the financial cost and
risk provision militaries and support
and so on and so forth so this whole
kind of thing has to be slowly unraveled
and and I don't think there's any
formula for it it's really gonna have to
be done by people themselves coming to
terms with this just you know
destructive residue of history I would
take the United States
take the u.s. Mexico boundary okay
what's that
you know I mean half of Mexico was
conquered by the United States okay now
it's called the United States the
Mexican US border
like most borders was a result of
conquest it wasn't a natural border it
was a very porous border so people of
the same similar people lived on both
sides and they tended to move up and
back in 1994 something interesting
happened in 1994 NAFTA was passed with a
lot of rhetoric about how we're unifying
you know North America and so on and so
forth also in 1994 Clinton who was no
fool militarized the border for the
first time operation gatekeeper
militarized the border to make sure that
people wouldn't move up and back Capitol
yeah
but not people so we got to stop this
free movement of people looking back
across a rather porous border and impose
of a border that's semi-porous capital
goes up and back easily but not people
because these systems are not designed
for people they're designed designed for
capital and since then you get you know
hundreds of people being killed on the
border and so on and so forth well you
know that border shouldn't be there just
like other borders shouldn't but those
are things that are going to have to be
changed entirely through understanding
and social revolution of it and social
change I don't think they can be imposed
from the outside professor Noam Chomsky
it's been fascinating thanks so much
