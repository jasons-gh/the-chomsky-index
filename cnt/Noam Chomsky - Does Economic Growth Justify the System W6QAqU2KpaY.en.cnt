I I realized that a lot of our economic
system you know has a lot of flaws that
a lot of problem problems with it
you know like rage where that's not
particularly pleasant that you know the
rich have the big gap between like rich
and poor but I mean it's together now
because there's been like increasing
standards of living in America and isn't
in that one way like a justification for
it the why it's still around why
capitalism for Mayans tanika's triumph
and it's still no it's not I don't think
so I mean there was rising standards of
living in slave societies
slaves were much better off in the early
19th century than in the early 18th
century said in argument for slavery
well I'm it's a terrible argument you
know I mean UN any system in fact you
could give that argument for Stalinism
there was a very substantial economic
growth in Soviet Union it's the second
world not the third it was until 1989 it
was the second world not the third world
now it's back in the third world because
it's undergoing capitalist reforms
something you're not allowed to say
incidentally but if you read you'll
notice they've had ten years of
capitalist reforms which have driven
them right back into the third world
where they came from okay but if you
just look at it in terms of economic
growth it was reasonably successful
that's exactly what bothered Western
leaders and if you read the documentary
record right up to the 1960s where it
sort of runs dry at the moment you find
that the great concern was that the
second the Soviet Union was presenting
itself as a model for modernization
within a single generation and that was
raising all sorts of trouble not only in
a third world but even in the rich
countries I didn't care about Russian
aggression but they cared about or you
know Stalin's terror or anything and no
didn't bother anybody
in fact Truman admired Stalin you know
thought it's an honest man you know deal
with him and so on
he said you didn't care what happens in
Russia
you know and so on but the same with
Churchill incidentally who's defending
Stalin and cabinet meetings is a great
man and so on and so forth
I think it kills many people's they want
that's irrelevant the problem was then
they never expected them to be attacking
anybody you know but the but they were
afraid of was the economic growth which
was especially in the third world
considered quite impressive if this
system is so bad and everything what
hasn't there been excuse me
our system our system in slope is so bad
why hasn't why hasn't there been great
of movements to challenge it belly's in
challenged all the time I mean we have a
for example we have a very violent labor
history and hundreds of American workers
were being killed right into the late
30s and finally they got labor right
there has been a very extensive
challenge for this through the 50s in
the sixties the whole thing blew up and
in fact many concessions had to be made
and it still continues I mean we right
now happen to be in a period of
regression but as I say it's cyclic you
know it was much more regression in the
1920s when labor was really crushed so
yes there's always challenge and
struggle but when you say is the system
so bad I don't even know what that means
I mean slave societies went on for
centuries and centuries without any
challenge okay did that justify them and
in fact if you really want to be serious
about it the slave owners were giving
arguments rather like yours so slavery
very much like it take a read say George
Fitzhugh who was the leading spokesman
for the American you know South slave
owners in the south at the time when it
was becoming a serious issue like around
the 1840s he had pretty powerful
arguments in favor of slavery what he
was saying is he was saying as look the
reason you northers northerners are
against slavery is because you're an e
Negro racists we are not racists we
think that you should take care of your
subjects so we treat them nicely and we
even do that on
Namah crowns because there are capital
you know like if I on make an
anachronistic analogy if if I buy a car
and you rent a car okay and somebody
comes a year later and has a look at the
two cars which car is gonna be in better
shape
okay well mine because I own it so I'm
gonna take care of it not yours because
you rent it and you can just throw it
away and get another one
okay that's exactly fits Hugh's argument
he says look we own people you just rent
them so therefore we take care of them
we treat them well we respect them there
are capital besides we have human
relations with them we're pre-capitalist
we still have human relations you just
treat them as tools under wage slavery
and they're much worse off and so we're
the ones who are moral you're the ones
who are tomorrow and in fact under under
the slave system if you take a look it
was reasonably efficient you know
conditions were sort of improving people
live better slaves live better in 1850
than in 1750 okay everything you're
saying could stand is a perfectly good
art nanak could be a good argument for
slavery but was offered as an argument
for slavery similar arguments were given
for Bolshevism kartik say fascism and
why was Hitler so popular you know
Hitler was the most up through the 30s
oh there was the most popular leader
probably in German history well the
reason is he carried out a social
revolution people were living a lot
better I mean like not everybody you
know not Jews for example but people
were but Germans were living a lot
better it was very successful Hitler on
either understood or you know figured
out or his advisers did that large scale
scale state expenditures could rescue a
morbid capital economy from destruction
pretty much what American business
learned during the Second World War and
he was doing it and it was economy was
booming they were better off and so on
is that an argument for fascism
