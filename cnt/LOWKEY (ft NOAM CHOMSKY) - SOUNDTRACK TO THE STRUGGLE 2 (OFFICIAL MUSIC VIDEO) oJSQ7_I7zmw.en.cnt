you're listening to the soundtrack of a
struggle coup by Loki thank you for
joining us none in optimism over despair
you say it seems to me unlikely that
civilization can survive really existing
capitalism would you be able to explain
that statement for us really existing
capitalism is what we can see described
in the press day after day we me read
that the major banks like JPMorgan Chase
are increasing their investment in
fossil fuels including the most
dangerous like Canadian tar sands and
all of this is quite understandable on
the assumption that our that the
structure of our institutions is geared
to maximizing short-term profit and
power without regard to what might
happen for the world another 20 or 30
years that's both capitally well we
can't survive that
[Music]
is in the economic system via the
ecosystem how we gonna define deep when
the Seas have risen how can we define
quote when I sleeps commissions
groundout by Koch brothers box how can
the people listen Conn detoxifier as we
watch the sky fade to gray the source of
our coal for power killed the
nation-state sophisticated murder to
find this innovation corporations wine
and dangers to may need information a
man versus humanity to terrorists who is
search engine noise your thought pattern
better than you in an environment
resentful my blazing is essentially the
horizon is to rent you think your
silence will protect your subject to
propaganda that terrifies the slum but
we can jeopardize their coverage we
energize the numbers collective face all
day
you take your man or suffer Labour's
paradise the Sun and a pair
[Music]
my short hover in the eyes of a tad
retired fireman knowing he couldn't help
a child survive the frying pan when we
write we describe the Leviathan for Here
I am man of God
iron lion's diaphragm my salutations to
those with imagination
toom anticipated and that's no
exaggeration your flag doesn't exist let
me back up that's namely what happens to
the nation
as a tax haven pushing these buttons you
don't need a Braveheart context and the
Mediterranean to a graveyard capable who
drives crazy if they had a mother bury
in a new baby in the desert this common
sensical it's sensible to question who
seems to be a lesson is intellectual
repression who who fell against the
system that depraved you over voice
repel against the cell while a survival
still a choice
[Music]
the state committed suicide cannibalize
itself while the bank's treating
fictitious capital you like his wealth
your Lord Lobby system these corruption
is legalized privatized health care
elsewhere people died rebellion lives
anew those that dream of a better way
was used to be brainwashed reposed
visions of yesterday to choose to flick
the comfortable to comfort the afflicted
to many choose the opposite the spirit
contradicted bring the child to the
world where the future seems impossible
five trillion dollars a year subsidizing
fossil fuels and ripples in their rise
you shrug them just turn your back and
watch the family beg for help you want a
flat turn to ask Apocalypse Now we saw a
future in that damn building CEOs love
their prophet more than they love their
grandchildren we saw a future in that
damn building CEOs loving prophet more
than they love their grandchildren not
to be concerned about the future of
their gradual you have to put yourself
in the position of say Jamie Dimon the
CEO of the biggest bank JP Morgan Chase
as CEO he has specially two choices
but one choice is to do exactly what
he's doing
invest direct investments to promote a
profitable outcome who happens to be
dangerous fossil fuels do that
for the other alternative he has us to
resign and be replaced by somebody else
we'll do the same thing but this is an
institutional problem not an individual
