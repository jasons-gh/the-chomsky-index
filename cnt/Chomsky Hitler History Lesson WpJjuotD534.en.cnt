Before the rise of the Nazis, wouldn't you say meddling of Western powers, or U.S. powers,
had something to do with that because maybe workers parties wanted to rise up and
It's not a secret.
Again, we have plenty of internal records.
I mean, what's now called "appeasement," you know, bad thing, appease the Germans, that
was regarded as a sensible policy.
In 1937, the State Department described Hitler as a "moderate" who's standing between the
extremes of right and left and if he doesn't succeed, the left, the labor and disillusioned
middle classes might get together and maybe even move towards the Russians or something,
but in an event, have a worker-based leftist government which the U.S. won't tolerate.
Britain even worse, they didn't want it.
They had tight business interests with Germany, U.S. did too, but Britain much more so.
So they were much happier to work with Hitler.
In fact, you know, as late as 1938, they probably could have stopped the war.
could have stopped the war.
Germany wasn't ready for war then.
But they wouldn't do it.
A 1937 Report of the State Department's European Division described the rise of Fascism as
the natural reaction of "the rich and middle classes, in self-defense" when the "dissatisfied
masses, with the example of the Russian revolution before them, swing to the Left."\h
Fascism therefore "must succeed or the masses, this time reinforced by the disillusioned
middle classes, will again turn to the Left."\h
The Report also noted that "if Fascism cannot succeed by persuasion [in Germany], it must
succeed by force."\h
It concluded that "economic appeasement should prove the surest route to world peace," a
conclusion based on the belief that Fascism as a system was compatible with U.S. interests.
One of the books on this topic is: Thank God They're on Our Side.
And it shows you history that I don't think is being taught in school.
How greed has caused an enormous amount of misery throughout history.
And that the quest for stability is really continuing the status quo of greed with a
disregard for democratic rights of the people.
Look at what they're willing to do to keep down the people.
The so called quest for stability -- on who's terms?
That's the key.
