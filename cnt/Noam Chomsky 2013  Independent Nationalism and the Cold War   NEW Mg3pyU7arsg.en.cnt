we're set and if you wanted to scoop
toward me just a little bit over here
that was right yeah that's good and then
that's perfect and then you get a direct
your attention to edge yep as you know
and we will repeat the question in the
context so give you the question won't
be recorded examine young so mr. Chomsky
is good to see you thank you for taking
the time today and I see you've already
had acquaintance with John wrote the
action yes thank you tell us about that
well in the context of involvement in
the West Papua liberation movement we've
at contacts well the suppression of west
poplin independence and the atrocities
carried out we have to be right now at
the 15th anniversary of one of the
massacres and the support for it the
robbery of resources the sport forth by
Australia Western powers a major scandal
no 60 years Cold War didn't have much to
do with the Cold War I mean the Cold
War's always pretext for everything that
happened but it would have been pretty
much the same as Russia didn't exist
there was a general opposition to
independence movements third-world
independence movements very general and
she was kind of tacitly feels kind of
interesting look when the Cold War ended
at that point you really be get there
was a wonderful opportunity to find out
what the Cold War was about and it's
quite interesting that not only the
media but even scholarship don't look at
it so take 1989 for
and willful Falls the end of the Soviet
Union is imminent of course the US
reacted to that this is the first Bush
administration and it's all public they
reacted by a new national security
strategy at a new budget taking account
of the new situation no Russians I was
quite interesting it's very revealing
look at so the new strategy basically
said everything's going to go on way it
was but with new pretext the Russians
around anymore so we have to have a huge
military system not to defend ourselves
from the Russians because they're not
there but because of literally the
technological sophistication of third
world countries and if you are well
educated intellectually you don't laugh
at that point although if you've kind of
broken out of ideological controls you
collapse and laughter so we need this
huge system because of the technological
sophistication of the third world we
have to maintain what they called the
defense industrial base anyone who knows
anything about economic history knows
that that's a euphemism refers to
high-tech industry which is heavily
based on state subsidy and states for
the computers internet IT revolution
commercial aircraft a huge state system
we're supposed to believe we have a
market economy with entrepreneurial
initiatives and consumer choice and so
on but the reality is rather different
this place where you're sitting right
now mit is a good illustration of it was
right at the core of the creation of the
modern advanced economy through largely
state subsidy so we have to maintain
that but the most interesting part was
intervention forces we have to maintain
large intervention forces aimed at the
Middle East just as before why not
because the Russians there
they had an interesting comment I said
the Middle East where the serious
problems we faced could not have been
laid at the Kremlin's door in other
words we were lying to you for 50 years
but now we got to tell you the truth
because the clouds have lifted it's
because of what they called radical
nationalism like West bothell
independent radical nationalism means
independent nationalism and that can't
be tolerated because it undermines
systems of power case of West Hollywood
undermines Indonesian power indonesia
was a darling of the West after 1965
when so heart the coot game slaughtered
hundreds thousands of people undermined
the political system opened the country
up to Western exploitation rich country
and that was greeted with complete
euphoria in the West in Australia in the
United States they described the
slaughter accurately but said it's
fantastic gleam of light and Asia was
called in the earth times and others
said the same and after that Indonesia
can do what it likes if it wants to
crush and slaughter people and West
Papua of fine once it conquer East Timor
ever happened virtual genocide and fine
you can't talk about it in the West but
that's because of what was actually
recognized in 1989 1990 but fortunately
its priests is pretty free society those
Australia but it's a very disciplined
society intellectuals are disciplined
they don't report things like this so
try to find something in the media or
for that matter of scholarship about
what was revealed as the cold war came
to an end in fact it goes well beyond
that here there is a little bit of
scholarship if he believed any of the
propaganda during the Cold War what
would you have concluded about NATO
native was established
theory to protect Western Europe from
Russian words okay 1990 no more Russian
Court what happens to NATO expand do you
think why because that i don'ts nothing
to do with Russian word it had to do
with controlling Europe and creating a
military base for us power in the world
and so it expanded and it's an
interesting how it expanded we have the
records so well known there was a deal
made between the Gorbachev head of the
Russian Federation russia and the george
bush and james baker US president
secretary of state the deal was that
Gorbachev would permit a eastern Germany
to be unified with western Germany and
to be part of a military alliance NATO
which is quite a concession from Russia
point of view look back at the history
of the past century but he agreed on
condition that NATO would not expand one
inch to the east means it wouldn't
expand in eastern Germany will be
questioned anything beyond and Baker and
Bush agreed to that NATO wouldn't expand
one inch to the east firstly had
happened as it expanded the East Germany
then it expanded beyond the countries in
the Russian Federation zone by now it's
a global intervention force with the
official commitment to protect what they
call protect meaning control of the
world's energy system pipeline sea lanes
and zone that's official position
Gorbachev was pretty upset about it and
when he complained the u.s. reminded him
that this was just a gentleman's
agreement it wasn't on paper and if he's
stupid enough to believe the US
President and Secretary of State when
they promised something that's
problem well that's all of this is the
end of the Cold War it answers the
question was this a Cold War affair Cold
War was the pretext but it's pretext for
everything I overthrow parliamentary
government of Iran you know Russians
invade overthrow the government want a
mala the Russians cue the the Russians
whatever maybe hits the Russians the
pretext is gone policies continue
virtually no change and concession its
radical nationalism meaning independent
nationalism and in the case of West
buffer and his team were two of them it
was a question of supporting Lydia
murders and brutal and vicious suharto
regime which was opening up the rich
resources of Indonesia to the west and
incidentally Soeharto made another great
contribution there was a mass political
organization in Indonesia the pki was
called malice whatever that means it was
basically a party the poor and
Australian scholarship recognizes that
was a party of the poor in fact the only
mass party of the poor and the US was
very concerned that it might gain a
degree of political power through the
parliamentary system in fact that was a
large part of the reason why in 1958
Eisenhower initiated the biggest
post-war intervention up to that point
to try to break up the this was to the
Indonesian government to strip away the
outer islands where the resources were
make sure the US could West could
control them us could control them on a
failed but part of the reason he look
back to documents was a concern that
Indonesia was just two Democratic of
course it wasn't very democratic but it
was Democratic enough to allow the party
the port participate in
the parliamentary system and there was a
fear it might actually win so okay we
try to break it up well that didn't work
but 1965 so hard I took care of it it
was devastated demolished politics
really has yet to recover from any
serious way so sure this West Papua and
his team were the other cases that fall
right within that no Russians Russians
weren't any weirder so consolation the
context of cold war with Russia vs.
divided but in the context of
postcolonialism Indonesia was a creation
of the post-colonial the history of in
post-colonial history of Indonesia is
pretty interesting you go back to the
1940s 1945 the u.s. an overwhelming
power I'm just in comfortable I'd
literally had fifty percent of the
world's wealth and controlled the whole
hemisphere both oceans the opposite
sides of both oceans and the planners do
it they planned carefully you know how
to organize the world in the interests
of their own us domestic power like
every state that's what it responds to
and with regard to colonialism it was a
mixed mixed question the US was opposed
in principle to British and French
colonialism because they closed off
markets to us penetration in control
noth-nothing anti-imperialist it's just
was a restriction on us domination of
the world same reason they were opposed
to the West European labor movement in
fact one of the first things the US and
British forces did when they moved into
continental Europe was to try to destroy
the labor movement because I'm Social
Democratic purpose and so on just two
independent story in itself but they
were postcolonialism for simpler similar
reasons on the other hand they were also
opposed to third world independent so
there's a kind of a mixed story takes a
Southeast Asia and Southeast Asia at
first the u.s. supported
british and dutch restoration of control
over Indonesia but it's just in 1948
1948 there was a massacre muddy and
master Larkin so-called communists were
killed and US policy shifted they
figured okay scar knows the Nationals
leader he could be our guy so the u.s.
supported the end of Dutch colonialism
that kind of kicked the Dutch out of
Indonesia and it turned out they weren't
very happy about that a couple years
later for the reasons I mentioned was
too independent on the other hand take a
look at Vietnam right nearby at first
the u.s. was ambivalent didn't know
which but didn't like French colonialism
but it didn't want independence either
by about 1950 they had decided they're
going to support French colonialism and
go on from there for the Indochina war
in fact Indonesia was a large part of
the reason for the Indochina Wars the
the earth didn't really care that much
about Indochina it's not that
significant but they were concerned
about the demonstration effect it's what
Henry Kissinger later called the virus
that can spread contagion if you have
independent development in some place
maybe a small place others nearby i'll
say well you know when of us and presume
you get contagion that's a major theme
of the post ponial period gotta stop
contagion from spreading from viruses by
1950 they were concerned that Indochina
under Ho Chi Minh might be a virus and
they were afraid the virus would spread
that Thailand and Burma and Indonesia
Indonesia is really important because
there are rich resources and there were
even concerned that that might lead
Japan to what they called a comedy to an
independent Southeast Asia as its
technological center and that would an
effect restore Japan's new order in Asia
you as it fought the Pacific War to
block that
they weren't ready to lose the Pacific
War in 1952 Indochina with full of
horrors you know and in 1965 they got
what they wanted indonesia was under
control in fact it's quite interesting
that Mukherjee Bundy who was the
national security advisor for Kennedy
and Johnson and a historian serious kind
of in retrospect he said that they would
have been wise to end the Vietnam War in
1965 the reason was South Vietnam had
been probably demolished Vietnam was not
going to be a virus wasn't go Bay model
for anyone and Indonesia was secured by
sivart though by the mass slaughter so
there was no real point going on with
the Vietnam War at that point well you
know by then there was enough momentum
so it was pretty hard to pull out and
they went on for another 10 years but
that that's the reason and Indonesia was
very much at the heart of it so when
Indonesia carried out mass atrocities
internally or conquests externally with
even worse atrocities that's fine so you
get Western support for the new Cold War
the Russians just post colonialism
making sure that you don't get viruses
around the world same reason why
parliamentary regime in Iran was
overthrown in 1953 pretext Russians
reality they might load spruce control
we know have plenty of evidence for that
acted not total evidence because the US
government refuses to release documents
virtual documents from that period even
at 1953 but there's enough around so
serious scholarship those same with
homology or later gotta block same with
Cuba the same to the Tunisia in 1958
that on case after case that won't run
through them but that's the leading
theme actually kiss enters a virus
contagion
Peppa rhetoric was about chili under a
ND he said the IND regime could be a
virus that would spread contagion the
contagion is the recognition that you
can achieve progress through
parliamentary means social reform and so
on he said that might extend as far as
southern Europe he didn't think that the
Chilean forces were on land and rid you
know he's afraid of the contagion effect
it's enough he agreed with Brezhnev on
this the Russians didn't like like it
either they want to control for their
own reasons but that's these are
dominant themes of it's probably the
major theme of post-war history and it
goes way back in history of colonialism
standard benefits sensible I mean when's
the presented of the public it's called
the domino theory the domino theory says
you know if ho chi minh wins in
Indochina and he's going to get in a
canoe and come over and break your
grandmother or something so we got to
stop it in their butt and that's just
for public for the public but the real
domino theory is perfectly sensible and
it's that's why it providers theory and
that's why it keeps being replayed over
and over right now and say well John
Rodia tells me time I met John 10 years
ago an eel scam before his stroke and I
but even afterwards
he can't speak people say things like
Papua finished culture God 20 years is
that happening you know it's request
response of let me call the world where
it's you well unfortunately but what
will happen to this is the actual
populations their culture their society
under this very severe depression with
the corporate support you know call my
name western support and so on it the
prospects aren't very bright but you
really can't tell it takes a East Timor
close close out alone what happened
there what happened in the by the late
70s it was virtual genocide there may be
killed a quarter of the population it
looked totally hopeless I'm in the
number you could cap get it and you
could fit into this room the number of
activists who were working on it i can
name them for you practically in
australian here it just looked hopeless
well took a long time finally in 1999
there was another outburst of indonesian
violence and repression you know they
practically destroyed the capital city
through a couple hundred thousand people
in the hills us continued to support
them continue the national security
adviser for clinton sandy Berger said
you know we it's not our fear of people
carry out massacres and slaughter you
know we can't do anything about it we
gotta continue to support indonesia a
u.s. military forces were carrying out
joint operations with the indonesian
army after all of this happened finally
in September 11th Clinton was an
international conference
there was a lot of international protest
at that time the source of the rising
domestic protest partly it was the
activist movements that had been working
for decades partly it was far-right
Catholic groups and in the East Timor
was Catholic Indonesia's Muslim so that
complicated story can't go to the
details it was possible to get
influential far-right Catholic groups
put pressure on the government that all
of these factors combined Clinton
informed the Indonesian generals the
game is over a couple of sentences next
day they were through could have
happened for 25 years after they
withdrew a UN peacekeeping force
Australian but peacekeeping force
entered which was a good thing you know
take a look at how that's handled in
history let's handle is a great case of
humanitarian intervention on what it
really was with an extraordinary scandal
25 years the US continues to support the
crimes atrocities in virtual genocide it
could have stopped it in one minute you
don't invade anyone you don't eat
sanctions even threats just stop
supporting it's over that's what the
record shows and that's called
humanitarian intervention it's pretty
striking story of about intellectual
culture but let's turn to a Sipapu could
be the same and in fact the chances of
recovery of a culture or let me give it
one example from right here in this area
here when the colonists british
colonists came at one of the major one
of the biggest drives major languages
that was the wampa knock about a hundred
years ago they were gone I'm there's
some remnants around
language was gone now there's the first
native speaker of Wampanoag in a hundred
years six-year-old girl what happened is
that great linguist here can hail died
recently when people who created us
Australian equipment elaborate coverage
and linguistics and worked on land
rights and things but he and young woman
from the dr Jenny little doe were able
to reconstruct the language which hadn't
been spoken for a hundred years she
thought her her daughter had a baby and
baby grew up speaking wampa Don first
native speaker in hundred years to
revitalize the drive there so around no
revitalize the drive but that's look
like total destruction can't get worse
than that but it's reviving and there
are cases that are not that bad reviving
every little language and these are all
being wiped out but that's that's true
of most a vibration from its true of
linguistic but that's true if you go to
say California they're probably a
thousand languages they're almost all
gone but it's true in Europe to that
takes eight Italy you know there are
plenty of people in Italy you can't talk
to the grandmothers because they talk
the language which is being destroyed
one of the things that happens with
so-called increase of civilization but
it doesn't have to happen there's
revival to this case that I mentioned is
the most extreme that I know if it's not
the only one that takes a Basque the
bass was spoken it was banned but under
the fascist regime and it was spoken by
you know people's grandmother's up in
the hills it's not the national language
take Wales
you walk around the streets of Cardiff
listen to children coming out of school
they taught me well it survived this
lots of possibilities so I you know not
what we'd like it to be maybe but there
wasn't much groups it was individuals I
don't want to mention names but it was
actually right wing powerful right-wing
Catholics who were influential in the
Republican Party some of them had been
high up in the Reagan administration and
they got mobilized mainly on religious
grounds because you know Bishop bello
had won the Nobel Prize and they didn't
they got mobilized on the grounds that a
Muslim country was destroying it there's
no knowledge of what well that's all
good one take it tried it it go to the
Harvard faculty club and see if you can
fund anybody who knows anything about it
a little own the street you can't oppose
things unless you know something about
them you can't know something about it
if it's pressed but in the last 10 years
since nine eleven we've had as
increasingly militaristic surveillance
culture in America and do you think this
is a reason why places like West Papua
now are twisting in the wind because no
they were twisting and yes there is a
surveillance culture like it always has
been it's now expanded enormously under
Obama it's going through the roof but
take a look what happened before nine
eleven anybody ever hear of westfeld oh
no did anybody hear of East Timor no
actually that's it was real work to try
to get anything notice
about it so does this have something to
do with Americans you know your assent
risom no hospital was founded to the
British being bombarded in the Blitz we
responded to little Belgium in world war
one but we don't respond to places
because because we cared about Britain
and we cared about building on the other
hand we don't care about East Timor we
care about Suharto's Indonesia and it's
not the United States Australia's the
same Britain's the same I mean just fine
now the British are just barely
beginning to look seriously at some of
the crimes of empire there was an
interesting article in The Times
Literary Supplement very conservative
journal it was an article there about a
year ago by an eminent historian
historian of empire Bernard quarter and
which he was reviewing two books about
the early history of the British in
India and he said well if we look
honestly at this we're going to list the
British leaders among the great genesee
genesee dare you know the great genocide
it's of the 20th century that's today
centuries later same here you know same
with us Australia is quite interesting
very interesting with East Timor
probably know the history but during the
Second World War Japan was moving south
and powerful military force they were
threatening Australia it looked as if
they might invade Australia Tamar is
lies in between them there were a couple
hundred Australian they were going to
conquer Timor first then go on to
Australia there were a couple hundred
Australian commandos that's just the
scattering of them on the island to try
to block this powerful Japanese force
could have done they had a lot of
support from the team arethe estimated
about 60,000 demaris died
helping protect couple hundred
Australian commandos from and it did
safe to Australia from probable invasion
well there are people in Australia
remember who know something about that
you know their uncle told him story the
grandfather told him a story that's part
of the reason why there was a degree of
opposition to Australian support for the
horrendous Australia had the worst
record anywhere on the Indonesian
conquest of East Timor and there were
people who remembered it I'm in
Australia is the only country which
formally recognized East Timor as a
province of Indonesia actually the
person who recognized it was Gareth
Evans the prime it was prime minister he
signed to deal with us with Indonesia to
rob the oil of offshore and his team
were and that deal was the only document
on record which formally wrecked it
describes these tumor as a as a province
of Indonesia Gareth Evans is interesting
because in the West he's regarded as the
hero of responsibility to protect he's
actually one of the worst violators of
this principle but that's what's called
the good indoctrination in fact as it is
a picture that circulates in Australia
among activists of showing Gareth Evans
and his Indonesian counterpart Holly I
left us high fiving and drinking and
celebrating the treaty to let Australia
steal the resources of East Timor the
province of Indonesia actually there's
enough activism Australia so that Evans
was asked about this they hadn't
answered the answer was the world is
littered with cases of acquisition by
force so it really doesn't matter
this is the guy who's the hero of
responsibility to protect we have to
invade other countries because somebody
bad is doing something it takes a really
corrupt intellectual culture for this to
survive but that's ours and it's not
just the United States it's Australia
its Britain France it takes a France in
Haiti at France practically just you
know probably destroyed Haiti Haiti was
the rigid certainly Frances richest
colony may be one of the richest in the
world maybe twenty percent of France's
wealth comes from destruction of Haiti
when the French were finally kicked out
a 1804 they imposed harsh very harsh
sanctions including an indemnity the
Haitians had to pay the France for the
crime of liberating themselves it was a
very harsh indemnity which in fact
strangled Haiti 49 or 50 years probably
years ago the patient's government brief
period in which they were independent
very brief approach to France to suggest
politely that France compensate them
somewhat for this French government
considered it and rejected it with anger
how dare you even ask us the person in
charge of that committee incidentally
was reduced to break the famous of
anti-imperial activists the United
States is not alone this is as far as I
know universal
okay yes we've got over our time I we
just want to conclude you at one yeah
one one question i have is about John
Rome react and you know he loves to a
small group he belongs to a noble
tradition John rumbling there John room
because belongs to a noble tradition of
people who have resisted oppression
violence atrocities many of them
suffered severely some of them years
later honored that takes a nelson
mandela's probably on his deathbed he
was in prison for 27 years torture
brutality in 1988 the Reagan
administration and designated him as one
of the more notorious terrorists in the
world he just got off the US terrorist
list a couple of years ago Nelson
Mandela now he's recognized as a hero
with not a saint sometimes it happens
learn from East is East Timor unlawful
easton mar was as east timor a model of
hope i'm a country was practically
destroyed and maybe a couple hundred
thousand people killed out of a
population of 600,000 which devastated
but finally it did succeed in liberating
itself it's got plenty of problems in
plenty of problems internal and others
but it says it's pretty astonishing and
it yes it's a model of hope it's not the
only one it takes a nozzle Mandela if
you go back to late 1980s the cause of
anti-apartheid look real
hopeless I'm in the South African
military was overwhelmingly powerful
they pretty much crushed resistance
within that killed maybe a million and a
half people in surrounding countries
just the supporting terrorist groups us
was backing them Britain was backing
them it was overcome things happen the
final thing that you'd like to say about
John or about popolo that I think West
Byfuglien resistance with stands with
other cases of resistance two massive
terror and oppression as a symbol of the
kind of an inspiring symbol of what
humans can accomplish and it may yet
succeed if the West is willing to face
up to its own responsibilities and
actions it can succeed iris waited a
hundred years that one picture before oh
oh yeah I'm surrounded audience today
okay these are little leprechaun season
when were Morgan and go their perch on
come on over John
yeah all right everybody just sway a
little bit so we're not with me which
one the window yeah Oh silhouette that's
who all right all right marketing for
people oh yeah which for us for on the
end there okay okay don't you get over
