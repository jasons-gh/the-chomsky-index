this cross-border operation of Hezbollah
in 2006 was its first cross-border
action of any kind in six years since
Israel had withdrawn from southern
Lebanon where it had occupied southern
Lebanon with us support for 22 years in
violation of Security Council
resolutions meanwhile Israel daily
violates the border throughout the six
years as indeed it is doing today and
again that's with impunity and nothing
were they on if it's even mentioned well
these new crimes that began on December
27th there they don't fit easily into
any of the standard categories except
for one namely familiarity they do fit
into that category I've given a couple
of examples and there's time we'll
return to more literally the current
u.s. israeli invasion falls under the
category of terrorism at least according
to the US official definition of the
word but that does not capture the
enormity of the crime it cannot be
called aggression and the reason is that
it's taking place in occupied territory
that's accepted in the West passively
and it's basically beyond question it's
recognized by Israeli scholarship so the
most important case I know is a
comprehensive the one and only
comprehensive scholarly history of
Israeli settlement in the occupied
territories that's been translated down
to English called Lords of the land by
Ed Zaire tellin Akiva Eldar they point
out that quote after israel withdrew its
forces from gaza in august 2005 the
ruined territory was not released for
even a single day from israel's military
grip or from the price of the occupation
that the inhabitants
every day Israel left behind scorched
earth devastated services and people
with nearly with neither a present or a
future the settlements were destroyed
the Jewish settlements in an ungenerous
move by an unenlightened occupier which
in fact continues to control the
territory and kill and her assets
inhabitants by means of its formidable
military might which is extra exercised
with extraordinary savagery always with
firm us support and participation
crucial fact for us even before the
latest onslaught the US Israeli assault
on Gaza escalated in January 2006 a few
months after the formal withdrawal
because Palestinians committed a real
crime they voted the wrong way in a free
election and that's a serious crime you
have to they have to learn that like
others easy to add examples that there's
a cost to disobeying the commands of the
master who incidentally continues to
pray about is yearning for democracy
without eliciting ridicule from the
educated classes which is quite an
achievement of our educational and
cultural system one of many well since
terrorism the terms terrorism and
aggression are inadequate some new term
is needed for the sadistic and cowardly
torture of people who are caged with no
possibility of escape while they're
being pounded daily by the most
sophisticated products of US military
technology provided in this certain
knowledge that this is how they'll be
used happens to be in direct violation
of US law of course also international
law but for self declared outlaw states
that's just another
technicalities so there's no need to
comment on it just how serious these
weapons are remains to be completely
verified they apparently include white
phosphorus according to Human Rights
Watch which is another violation of the
laws of war and who knows what else one
of the heroic volunteers in Gaza a
Norwegian doctor my Gilbert describes
his sense of her as an all-out war goes
on against the civilian population of
Gaza he estimates that half the
casualties are women and children the
men who were killed are also civilians
by any reasonable legal standards almost
all he says that he has scarcely seen a
military casualty among the hundreds of
shredded bodies but that's in accord
with the gore Evan Evan principles which
are mentioned and in fact with
consistent practice his estimate is
confirmed by the UN humanitarian chief
john holmes who informed reporters that
it's a fair presumption that most of the
civilians killed were women and children
in a humanitarian crisis that is
worsening day by day as the violence
continued those who don't like that
story can be comforted by the words of
CP Livni who is the leading dove in the
electoral system who assured the world
that there is no humanitarian crisis in
Gaza thanks to Israeli benevolence like
others who care about human beings and
their fate Gilbert and homes called for
pleaded in fact for a ceasefire but not
yet the u.s. blocked the Security
Council from issuing a formal statement
calling for a ceasefire there was an
official reason which I'll quote there
was no indication that from us would
abide by any agreement all the
justifications that have been offer
for the lighting and slaughter this must
rank among the most cynical of course
that was Bush and rice there soon to be
replaced by Barack Obama who
compassionately repeats that if missiles
were falling where my two daughters
sleep I would do everything everything
in order to stop that he's talking about
Israeli children beyond that he's
maintained its silence a few days later
under intense international pressure the
US did back a Security Council
resolution which called for what they
called a durable ceasefire it past 14 20
United States abstaining Israel and US
Hawks were angered that the United
States did not veto it as the usual
practices the app station abstention
however does give Israel if not a green
at least a yellow light to continue with
the slaughter the resolution called for
stopping the flow of arms into Gaza
though not into Israel in fact vast
quantities of arms continued to flow
into Israel on December 30th three days
after the latest invasion the Pentagon
released the fact that huge that the US
has commissioned several German ships to
bring huge quantities of arms from
Greece Israel they're just what we
noticed they are they're labeled
ammunition i think it was 3,000 tons the
very few inquiries to the Pentagon about
what's going on Oh were answered with
assurance that the arms would arrive too
late to be used in the current assault
against Gaza which is probably correct
Madigan also said that they're not
really intended for Israel which is also
probably correct but rather they are
being pre-positioned in Israel
Israel is regarded as an offshore US
military base right in the periphery of
the most important region of the world
the oil energy producing region is one
of its contributions one of the services
the US power and the arms that are
pre-positioned there will be if the
Pentagon is accurate not for Israeli
violence but for us violence so the next
act of aggression in the region can make
use of the arms stored there for the
purpose that's much more if it ever gets
reported it will be you can predict that
it will be explained that this is to
defend to protect the free flow of oil
and to assure stability those are the
technical terms they used for aggression
and the criminal violence standardly
