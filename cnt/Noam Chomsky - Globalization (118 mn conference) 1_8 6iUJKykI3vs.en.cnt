good okay so Mike city wants me to talk
about globalization yeah I always just
do what I'm told so what globalization
the actually the best definition of it I
know of this I can remember it is by a
very well-known development economist
Canadian development economist economist
Connie and Gerald Hal Einar who tried to
summarize it in a little bitty which
went something like this
don't hold me to the exact words he said
the poor complain they always do but
that's just idle chatter our system
brings rewards to all at least to all
who matter essentially captures it ok so
the only question is the habit if we
complain why is it idle chatter who are
the poor who matters and so on so what
about that we're complaining actually
they do complain and they complained
very loudly and in very interesting ways
so for example in April of this year a
couple weeks ago there were major the
first-ever meeting of the heads of state
of the what's called g77
it's actually like 133 or so no
representing well accounting for there's
a difference accounting for roughly 80%
of the world's population they had their
first really high-level meeting in
Havana in April a week earlier the
foreign ministers had met in Cartagena
and Colombia and they came out and I
don't know why they selected Havana but
I wouldn't be surprised if it's a
solidarity gesture maybe
it was a very important meaning these
are what used to be called the
non-aligned countries in the days when
there was a space for non-alignment that
disappeared with the Soviet Union
there's no longer any space for
non-alignment and that means that the
minimal attention that was once given to
what's called the South has declined to
virtually zero you can see that in all
kinds of ways foreign aid all kind of
measures they produce this was there as
I said first really high-level meeting
ever so an important one they came out
with a long detailed declaration called
the declaration of the South Summit
which was highly critical of
globalization the particular form of
globalization that's being instituted
that's essentially corporate LED
globalization concerned with the
interests of investors and lenders
everything else is sort of incidental
and they called for a new era a new
global era which would be which would
have a different orientation which they
then spelled out in some detail the
basic idea is that the new global form
of global integration that they were
calling for would be would it give a
primary primacy to the right of
development in fact the right of
independent development for the
so-called developing countries many of
them developing downwards unfortunately
the poor countries the south of the
former colonial world and would permit
them to pick their own development paths
without any form of economic coercion or
pressure in terms of their own national
priorities and interests and opposed all
forms of they rejected completely all
forms of unilateral economic sanctions
about half the world's population right
now is under unilateral US sanctions so
that's what they're talking to and they
also reject
forcefully what they called this is
their phrase the so-called right of
humanitarian intervention which they
consider just old-fashioned in European
imperialism under a very familiar garb
of you know righteous moralism just as
it always been in the past that's the
gist of it and along you know developed
extensively it's not the first time back
in the 1960s early 1970s that the at the
time of the onset of the era that is now
called globalization in the West they
there was also a a kind of a South
Summit
an online meeting which called for a new
international economic order of a
similar kind not the same words in the
same details but roughly then and
including interesting proposals which
have had a lot of contemporary resonance
so that was about the time that at that
point that the this was after about 15
20 15 10 or 15 years of decolonization
and there was a lot of energy and
momentum and the non-aligned movement
which is essentially that decolonized
countries for the most part and they had
succeeded in getting the United Nations
to form the UN conference on Trade and
Development up debt which was formed in
1964 and remit to still exists and it's
the major independent semi independent
economic analysis organization in the
world in fact under UN auspices come out
with regular and sometimes important
reports unfed was formed in order to get
a mandate the mandate was to work on
methods of global integration
international integration that would be
very much like what I just quoted myself
some which would be concerned with the
right with the with the right of
development and in particular
independent development free of external
coercion and they came out with many
specific proposals of course this was
totally dismissed by the
countries that I've ever heard about it
anymore and I'm dead itself was kind of
marginalized just as every aspect of the
United Nations every institution of the
United Nations which to some extent
represents third-world interests
interests of the South has been either
eliminated or very far to the side so
I'm dead still exists but not a very
powerful form one of their proposals one
of them a particularly important one
which has lots of contemporary
implications was a proposal to stabilize
commodity prices the South with poor
countries are mostly primary were at the
time to some extent still are still
primary product producers every rich
country at say the United States or
European Union and so on has internal
programs to stabilize commodity prices
so there's various farm subsidies and so
on these are quite the very high in the
European Union quite high in the United
States they've actually increased very
radically in the last several years
right after Congress passed what was
called a freedom to farm act in 1996
which was designed to terminate
subsidies and all other interferences
with the holy Eve market and it did it
in the usual way by living to a tripling
of subsidies in the next two years
almost all going to agribusiness and
avoiding farmers but and the same is
true of other countries European Union
even where the United States the point
of to try to keep farm prices more or
less stable you know a great commodity
prices in general well that was the
proposal along to add except that they
were posing it for the poor countries
and there's a good reason for that I
mean if farm if come out of primary
product oscillate rapidly say coffee to
take a case that happens to be crucial
to the second biggest commodity and
international exchanges after oil coffee
if coffee prices should weigh up and
down that has an effect it does not
effect agribusiness particular
so big agribusiness can displace costs
you can take a loss here if coffee
prices go way down you can say take a
loss here when your make a profit
somewhere else or make a profit and some
other part of your enterprise and so on
on the other hand a small farmer can't
do that if you're a small farmer and
happen to be a coffee farmer and a
coffee producer say in Colombia or you
know Bolivia or somewhere and coffee
prices go down you're finished you can't
tell your children you know wait a year
or two maybe oh really then you know so
you have to do something else well what
else you do is move to price to crops
for which there is a stable market that
really one export crop for which it is a
stable market and it has to be grown in
the some of the major coffee producing
areas like the Andes like Colombia so
yeah that's what they move to and that
move was accelerated by other programs
including those that are central to the
so called globalization period oh
whenever I say globalization I mean in
quotes what's called globalization is
one specific modality of international
integration it is nothing wrong with
international integration fact a great
thing it's nice to meet people from
other countries and all sorts of others
but there are various waveforms of
possible international integration and
the one that's called globalization is
one particular like it's not the new
international economic order that the
south was calling for and it's not the
new global system that they're now
calling for it so differently this new
one the one that is called global the
official one another one that Thomas
Friedman writes laudatory books about
and so on that's the one that amongst
other properties are that a country have
to open up their room their borders to
free imports so they have to accept
imports from highly subsidized to US and
European and Canadian agribusiness which
of course instantly wipes out the
domestic production for domestic needs
and that means that poor farmers are
stuck one thing they can do is flee to
the cities which has been ice effect
that they create a massive labor force
which lowers wages and means that the US
and European manufacturers are by now
Japanese and Korean manufacturers who
wear the pudding say assembly plants or
whatever abroad can benefit from cheaper
labor and consequently wages can go down
and in fact do go down well the economy
blooms Mexico's a dramatic case but if
farmers don't move to the urban slums to
become an excess labor force they again
and try to produce something it can't be
commodities for the domestic market for
food because they'll be wiped out by
imported goods so once again they move
to they become what's called a rational
peasant in the technical literature a
rational peasant is a peasant who
understands that you have to produce for
export and you have to seek the maximum
profit ok so you sort of spell that out
for this for export stable markets
maximum profit well you get the same
answer as before cocoa you know poppies
and so on and that's what's happening so
the international globalization and
particularly undermining of the attempts
of the south thirty years ago to create
a form of globalization based directed
toward the interests of the developing
world that means on the almost the
entire world
one of the major consequences of this
and it so it's a big secret like you can
read it in standard books of political
economy and so on is to was to greatly
accelerate a drug product a production
of what we call drugs I mean they're not
the most lethal drugs the most lethal
ones are produced in places like North
Carolina but what we call lethal drugs
here they as as in pens have been driven
to it they're going to have no choices
in part by the choice
and it was a choice it's not an economic
law the choice by the powerful states
thirty years ago to institute a
particular form of international
economic integration what's called
globalization in preference to another
one which would have for example as one
of its properties and there were many
others things like stabilization of
primary commodity prices and the work
well of neoliberal programs like opening
up your orders to imports from
subsidized to Agra export from Agra
northern agribusiness that has the same
effect there's a lot more like this I
mean a lot of the of the what happens to
the rational peasants incidentally after
they've learned their lessons properly
you know they kind of like equivalent of
going to Harvard or MIT or Chicago
graduate school getting a degree in
economics so they become rational
peasants well once they've learned the
lesson they're rewarded they're rewarded
with helicopter gunships that you and I
pay for with chemical and biological
warfare including new experimental
biological techniques we'll have who
knows what effect and then and by what's
called here a drug war that's the reward
for having learned the lessons after
having been essentially forced into a
particular kind of production by the way
globalization works out that's one of
its less discussed features the pointing
back to the Declaration of the South
that we are complaining is they always
do what they're calling for now again is
a new international paper they're
calling for globalization for
international
