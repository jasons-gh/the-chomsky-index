hide the green you know inside the
protected area of Baghdad I mean I'm not
building that in order to tear it down
the major air bases that are building
their being built around Iraq are huge
facilities and they are not being built
with the intent of tearing them down and
they're supported by the Democrats they
fund them and the idea it clearly is to
try to figure out some way to establish
a client government which will be able
to function but but much like the
government in Chechnya functions you
know they're Chechens they have their
own security forces or like say the
Vichy government under the Nazis with a
French government French security forces
you know French police French officials
and so on the Germans or hanging around
in the background actually it's pretty
much the way Russia the Russians most
run ran most of Eastern Europe it was
Czech troops Polish troops and so on and
so forth so try to set up something like
that the traditional Imperial structure
but making sure that it's a base for us
power and that the u.s. controls it and
we don't really have to debate this any
longer because it's public not much of a
fuss was made about it in fact I don't
anything was reported but in November
last November there was a declaration an
agreement by george bush and what's
called the iraqi government which is a
you know a little enclave inside the
Green Zone never gets out sided which we
call the Iraqi government the client
government that follows our orders so an
agreement was made between them which is
interesting it permits the u.s. to
maintain effectively permanent military
bases and operations inside Iraq what
kind of protects but that's what it
amounts to and rather brazenly to my
surprise it says that the Iraqi economy
must be open to foreign investment
privilege in US investors that's unusual
to see such a brazen statement of
crash imperialism you know the US Iraqi
economy means oil they don't nobody
cares about the asparagus they grow so
it must be open to foreign investment
unlike other countries which have
control their own resources and it must
privilege US investors I mean now that's
more extreme than the most extreme war
critic ever sit and Bush under sorted in
one of his many hundreds of signing
statements a couple of months later in
january and we she said that he would he
sign some legislation because i'm not
going to live up to it and if I co I
won't live up to any legislation that
interferes with the US goal of
maintaining sort of permanent capacity
for military operations there and it
controls the energy resources well
that's totally different from Vietnam
that didn't us didn't care once the
country was destroyed and Laos was
destroyed and Cambodia was destroyed the
US didn't care very much what happened
happy to pull out this is just a
completely different situation both
domestically and in terms of the
geopolitics of it I think I'll see to
the other people that are waiting yeah
hi I really enjoyed your book
manufacturing consent and I was just
curious over the last couple days the
mainstream media has gotten behind this
irrefutable evidence that North Korea
has built a nuclear reactor in Syria and
that Israel was able to us successfully
wipe it out I was kind of curious to
hear your take on that and maybe cut
through or got through the propaganda
yeah that's a very interesting story
actually I've written about a little if
you're interested in Oh give some
references but I happen to be listening
to NPR on the way in here the evening
news and you know they had a one of
their sober intellectual reports which
was a perfect example of what John Burns
was describing have you have to cheer
for the home team it described about
half the story it said that you know
this all this is a very interesting
evidence that North Korea isn't living
up to its obligations and then there the
hawks who say we should you know break
goal a full discussion and attack them
or something and the doves to say maybe
we should give them a little more time
and so on well yeah it's probably true
that North Korea isn't living up to all
its obligations in its declaration but
it's also true that the United States is
not living up to its obligations in fact
in the rare reporting on this that you
can occasionally find the last report
was that the United stand alit snoo
clear facilities and produce a
declaration of its nuclear activities
and the United States would join with
the other six powers in providing Iraq
with fuel with other aid and the US
would enter into the normal diplomatic
relations and remove them from the
remove the isolation of North Korea by
taking them off the list of state this
war terror and so on well us none none
of that you know furthermore there's a
history of this the same negotiations
same agreement pretty much was reached
in September 2005 North Korea agreed to
dismantle to end all nuclear
weapons-related
operations or nuclear operations in them
all verifiably and the United States in
return would enter into diplomatic
relations remove the threats to Korea
and provided with a light water reactor
and a couple of other things and end all
threats okay that would enter the crisis
a couple of days later the United States
carried out what the five NATO generals
now call an act of war against North
Korea they closed down North Korean
financial operations which happened to
be in a small bank in Macau was probably
a trial run for what they're now doing
against Iran to see how it work well you
know that's a very serious attack on a
country to isolate it from the
international financial system the
waxworks no imports and so on and so
forth and it was almost certainly done
in order to undercut the negotiations
that had just been reached and in fact
Macaria reacted as you'd expect carried
out a nuclear test you know went on to
develop missiles and so on and that's
been the history all the way back yeah
North Korea meant the worst government
in the world but they've been following
a pretty pragmatic course on this when
the US gets more aggressive they get
more aggressive when the US gets more
conciliatory they get more conciliatory
and it's been running steadily all the
way through so that's the other part of
the story and there's another part of
the story that's even more significant I
don't know if North Korea has been
providing anything to Syria or not but
there would have been an easy way to
stop this a very easy way in 1993 North
Korea and Israel were on the verge of an
agreement by which Israel would
recognize North Korea and North Korea
would terminate all weapons related
activities in the Middle East now that
would be very important for Israel
security but the Clinton administration
said and no it wouldn't let them do it
and when the Godfather speaks you gotta
listen so
that agreement was never reached and if
that agreement had been reached we would
not be having any discussion about
whether North Korea is doing anything in
Syria or not well that part of the story
is knocked out now it's not that it's
secret you know if you do some research
you read the arms control literature and
so on yeah you can find it actually I've
written about it too and have others but
it's certainly not the headline where it
ought to be it's not something that
people know another small point was made
by a and record is none this one
bleeding Middle East security
specialists in the United States who
suggested that maybe this whole flap is
just a warning to Iran saying you know
we got our eyes on you and if you do
anything or even if you don't do
anything we'll pretend that you did and
you're in trouble you know so yes
there's a lot to the story but exactly
what's going on we don't know and
probably won't know until the classified
documents come out someday if they ever
do hi I think you're I've read your
books and I think you're excellent my
question is most people I mean we can
sit here and have a discussion on the
problems that we've had in the past in
Panama or Guatemala and Cuba and we can
also talk about how you know how we
supported the Shah and we basically
affected the Iranian Revolution but the
fact is that most people in America
don't even know that at one point we
supporting Saddam Hussein so knowing
this fact how can we help educate the
rest of the American public on all these
issues when it seems that you know the
media won't do it and it's all of this
information that you say is easy to find
is maybe not so easy for the average
person so yeah see I first of all let's
what you write about supporting Saddam
Hussein but very few people know the
extent of the support in 1980s Saddam
Hussein was hangry
a couple of months ago a year ago
whatever it was and if you look he was
hanged for crimes that he committed in
1982 he was alleged to have ordered the
killing of 150 or so people which by his
standards was like you know toothpick on
a mountain but that's what he was judged
for but it was kind of interesting to
see the commentary on it as something
else happened in nineteen eighty-two in
1982 the Reagan administration removed
Iraq from the list of states supporting
terror which is a name for the list of
states we want to go after nine to a
sporting terror so they removed it from
the list in order that the US could
start providing aid and support through
their friend Saddam Hussein Donald
Rumsfeld went shortly afterwards to you
know sign the friendly agreement and
through the 1980s the US was one of a
number of states who supported gave
support to Saddam Hussein a lot of was
agricultural sport which he desperately
needed and it was a big boon to us
agribusiness but also weapon support you
no means to develop weapons of mass
destruction and so on this went on right
through Saddam Hussein's worst
atrocities you know the Halabja
massacres is a unfall massacres you know
everything a use of chemical weapons
well we threw nada there was some
protest Congress protested now and then
but Reagan vetoed any effort to do
anything about it George Bush number one
came along he was particular at my earth
saddam in 1989 at the very time of the
invasion of panama just as the invasion
of panama was going on Bush over road
the Treasury Department and authorized
new aide to his friend Saddam Hussein
the press cooperated by not reporting it
in also in 1989 Bush invited Iraqi
nuclear engineers to the United States
to get advanced training and weapons
production nuclear weapons production
okay that's also 1989 early nineteen
ninety
Bush sent a high-level senatorial
delegation to Iraq led by bob dole
republican senate majority leader who
was then presidential candidate a couple
years later and the goal the purpose of
the delegation was to send George Bush's
good wishes to his friend Saddam to
ensure him that he could disregard the
kind of protests he hears now and then
from the American press we have this
free press thing here and we can't shut
all these guys up and told him that he
would they would take off from The Voice
of America anybody who was criticizing
him I was generally kind of love session
that was april nineteen ninety okay a
couple of months later Saddam Hussein
disobeyed orders or maybe misunderstood
orders just possible and invaded Kuwait
okay shifted instantly from favored
friend and ally to reincarnation of
hitler you know you don't disobey orders
you know like i said any mafia don
understands that's what and incidentally
shortly after that washington returned
to support the first of them hussein
after the war was a murderous
destructive war way beyond anything that
was needed to get some out of quake but
right after the war by march 1991 the US
had total control military control of
the region control of the air everything
and there was a large shiite uprising in
the south which probably would have
overthrown to them but the US authorized
saddam to crush it they authorized him
to use aircraft military helicopters and
so on to crush the uprising killing
probably tens of thousands of Shiites in
the south general was this name schwartz
cop who was a general said later that he
was fooled by saddam he didn't realize
that when he authorized saddam to use
military aircraft he'd actually use him
so kind of you know we were tricked but
it was explained pretty open but frankly
by the new york times the chief
diplomatic correspondent thomas friedman
a chief diplomatic cars
means State Department spokesperson in
New York Times just relays State
Department propaganda he said he wrote a
clear column he said the he said the
best of all possible worlds he supported
the decision to allow them to crush the
uprising I said the best of all worlds
for the United States would be an
iron-fisted military went the ruling
Iraq just the way Saddam did but with a
different name because he's now kind of
embarrassment and so we have to settle
for second best you know Saddam himself
the Middle East correspondent for the
New York Times who's still there still
there top Middle East correspondent Alan
Cowell he said well you know it's kind
of unpleasant watching all these people
get massacred he said but there's a
consensus among the United States and
its allies namely Britain and Saudi
Arabia that the best hope for stability
in Iraq is Saddam Hussein not the people
who are trying to overthrow him okay so
therefore we have to let Saddam crush
the uprising that might have overthrown
in the stability is a technical term it
means following us orders okay so that's
stability and Saddam's more hopeful for
stability than Iraqis in fact what it
have said is you know the worst possible
outcome is that Iraqis might rule Iraq
we're not going to allow that
independent nationalism is not to be
accepted that's why moved out all solder
is a renegade and so on and in fact
through the 90s it's the same story if
you look at the main effect of the
sanctions clinton sanctions they were
murders and destructive but they
strengthen saddam hussein they
undermined opposition to him they
compelled the population to rely on him
for survival which is probably the
reason he wasn't overthrown know
otherwise he probably would have had the
same fate as Ceausescu and so heart
though butdo and a whole bunch of
gangsters not very different from him
who the us-supported until the end but
in fact that's exactly what was said by
dennis Halladay and Huntsman spawning
the two directors of the oil-for-food
programme was I said no more about Iraq
than certainly any Western
so maybe so you know it's a but it's
crucial that Iraqis not rule Iraq so yes
there was support now how do we get any
of this stuff to the American people
well you know how do you get anything
else to the population with a you who
quoted Margaret meet at the beginning
you know that's the way to do it
everything happens exactly the way you
said exactly you know I'm taking it the
civil rights movement the women's
movement the anti-vietnam war movement
pick anything you like you know the
environmental movement starts with small
groups people doing things and gradually
it grows finally it gets to the point
where as in the case of the anti-vietnam
war movement where the government was
afraid to send troops because they need
him for civil disorder control all that
happened within about two years you know
yeah and it just changed the world I
mean a striking example is the women's
movement it's not that I'm there were
feminists before but until the 1960s
there was nothing much was happening and
within a couple of years it changed the
country in the world dramatically it's
probably the major impact of the 60s on
the world and it happened just by
consciousness-raising groups bigger
groups and activism where it was
necessary and so on civil rights
movement a couple of black kids at at a
lunch counter and freedom fries bus
riders started writing and you know
pretty soon you had a huge mass movement
which didn't solve the problems
obviously vasavada made it a lot better
earlier you mentioned latin america and
the u.s. preference for police days and
i think we see those police states
crumbling preference for what I didn't
state blue state in Latin America and
those states are crumbling most recently
there was the election in Paraguay and
while we never heard anything about the
generations of rulers in Paraguay this
would this weekend there was a
significant election you know who's
playing pariah and Ecuador who is saying
that US military bases have no place in
Ecuador Venezuela a revolution with
resources a rich revolution on ever
Morales in Bolivia right now as you know
is being threatened and that there is a
worldwide appeal to to seize the
hostilities anyway my question is how do
you see Latin America moving forward on
its leftist path or just on its own path
and defying the US this is one of the
most important things happening in the
world I think it's not Latin America
unfortunately at South America Central
America was so devastated by Reaganite
terror it may never recover so they're
not part of this much I mean a little
but not much but South America is
undergoing a really dramatic change and
it's the first time since the Spanish
invasions that the countries of South
America are beginning to face two
fundamental problems which have turned
them into like a horror story some of
the worst poverty and misery in the
world in in a region with enormous
resources and a lot of potential you
know it's not like it's not like you
know it's not a desert somewhere the two
problems are both problems of sort of
disintegration one of them internal to
each society and other among all the
societies each Latin Latin American
societies typically have been run by a
very small wealthy
very wealthy largely white elite race
class correlations preclose with a mass
of suffering and misery that's been an
internal problem so if you compare it
with East Asia's striking I mean Latin
America's many advantages over East Asia
should be way ahead and development but
in Latin America capital is exported by
the tiny rich elite the imports are
luxury goods so they can live it up
their second homes are in the Riviera or
someplace like that the children go to
school overseas there was nothing to do
with their own population no
responsibility to pay taxes nothing the
disintegration among the countries is
that they are all separated from one
another like this very little
interaction among them during the
colonial period and even the period of
independence you can see that in the
transportation systems and almost
everything well those things are
changing strikingly I think the most
dramatic cases Bolivia which is really
impressive what happened and you're
right it's under a lot of threat now the
white elite that's always run the place
is infuriated that they had a democratic
election for the first time and the US
is just as infuriated democratic
elections are a real danger but they had
a remarkable democratic election in
which the large majority of the
population mostly indigenous entered the
political arena elected someone from
their own ranks on crucial issues you
know not did you make them say some
phrase that you should have said but on
real issues control of resources issues
of cultural rights of justice and so on
and they want and if they were not just
pushing a button on Election Day these
were continuing struggles control over
water all sorts of things sometimes very
bitter struggles and i had developed
mass popular organizations and they had
a democratic election of a kind that is
unimaginable in the united states
in the West all together and yes now
there's a serious effort to return it
this is strong secessionist movement we
don't have documents but I'm sure it's
backed by the United States to try to
support the rich mostly white minority
to pull out and that happens to be where
most of the natural resources are and
the majority's once all the country
together and you know carry forward the
significant changes that are taking
place and there's also and that's
happening in the other countries to that
you mentioned including Brazil the most
important and there's a lot of
integration going on in fact the whole
region almost the entire region is sort
of moving to the left you know well the
US had means of protection stopping this
to means violence and economic
strangulation and both means have been
severely weakened a Korea throwing out
the Monta airbase is a symbol of the
weakening of the weapon of violence
traditionally the US when anything like
this happened the u.s. just carried out
a military coup or you know instigated a
military coup installed a bunch of
gangsters and that was the end of it
it's but they can't do that now the last
time the US tried a military coup was in
Venezuela in 2002 where they did manage
to the us-backed military coup did
manage to overthrow the government but
it was overturned within a couple of
days and it was huge protest all over
Latin America and the US had to back off
and have been able to do it since the
economic strangulation is also weakened
the economic strangulation in recent
years has been the instrument of it has
been the IMF International Monetary Fund
which is basically a branch of the US
Treasury so the idea is you know get the
country's deeply indebted to give
impossible debts that they can ever pay
the debts are not from the population
there from the elite population didn't
borrow the money and didn't gain
anything from it but the international
rules are they're the ones who have to
pay it okay well that's being overcome
contrary after countries as the
argentine president put it
ridding ourselves of the IMF
restructuring the debts repaying the
debt sergeant Tina did it with the help
of Venezuela Brazil did in its own way
and the IMF is actually in trouble it's
not getting a funding by debt repayment
SSO the and in general the method of
economic strangulation is declining
partly because of the integration the
countries are working together the
standard US line now press scholarship
and so on is that the there are two
kinds they have to admit that Latin
America is moving left but there's a
good left and a bad left the good left
is Lula and Brazil the bad left is of
course java's and morales and maybe
Korea but in order to maintain that
party line you have to be quick on your
feet for example you have to overlook
the fact that one of the strongest
supporters of Chavez is Lula that
doesn't fit the party line so it doesn't
get recorded after Lula and Brazil after
he was his second nature was reelected
his first act practically was to fly to
Caracas to support Chavez in his
electoral campaign and to dedicate a
joint Venezuelan Brazilian project
there's no more projects development
shortly after that there was a very
important meeting of Latin American
presidents in Cochabamba and Bolivia
very important place that's where the
Bolivian Revolution took off that's
where peasants began protesting the
World Bank us programs to privatize
water which means waters atacan you know
people can't drink can't pay the costs
so they threw out they succeeded
throwing out the bechtel corporation and
blocking the effort wasn't easy a lot of
people got killed that's cochabamba it's
real symbol so that's where the Latin
American presidents met it was december
two thousand six and they made
interesting plans joint plans for an
european union type the integration and
actually taking steps towards it and the
US is just done that much that you can
do about it
you know it's lost its main weapons not
the other plenty of internal problems to
overcome so it's not going to be an easy
path but this is the first time they're
being seriously faced and on the band
with the participation of substantial
mast popular movements that's the basis
for democracy it's one of the reasons
why we don't have a functioning
democracy we don't have mass popular
movements so therefore popular opinion
we mostly disregard it as it is but
they're overcoming then it's a real
model to look for the u.s. is by no
means giving up you may have read in the
paper a couple of days ago that a
training of military officers is being
shifted from the State Department to the
Pentagon that's been going on for some
time now in fact that they finally
reported it that's quite significant
training within the State Department is
at least theoretically under
congressional supervision meaning that
there are human rights conditionalities
and so on once it moves into the
Pentagon it's just a black hole and do
anything they want nobody ever looks
training and torture or whatever you do
it's a weak control but it's something a
further more training of Latin American
officers is shot way up the u.s. is
trying very hard to recreate a Latin
American officer corps that will be able
to follow its orders I think it's now
higher than it's ever been through the
cold warriors and the purposes are
explicit the training is designed to
combat what's called radical populism
well in the Latin American context
radical populism means human rights
activists union leaders priests
organizing peasants anybody who gets in
the way and that's the explicit goal of
the training of officers and training of
officers just doesn't mean just teaching
them it means providing them with
technology and weapons and connections
and so on so the u.s. is certainly
trying to recreate the weapon of
violence and also the economic weapons
but it's not as easy to us for one thing
there's much more protest here which is
a good thing for another things there's
the whole world has become more diverse
so the exporters in Latin America can
out there into China for markets and
China's investing there were also
south-south relations development so
Brazil South Africa and India now have
relations all of this these moves are
very positive i think and could lead to
of the basis for some kind of authentic
independence and also for overcoming the
enormous internal problems so that's a
israel very hopeful signs i think
you
