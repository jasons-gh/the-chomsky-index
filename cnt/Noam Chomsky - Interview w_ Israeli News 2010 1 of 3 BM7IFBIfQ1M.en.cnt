mr. gnome come ski thank you for taking
the time to meet with us very pleased to
be with we had to come all the way to
Amman Jordan to talk to you you get a
free trip yeah well I was thinking that
you should send the flowers to the Board
of Control official who said that you
can go into the territories actually
perge taught us and the thanks since it
publicized the talk which otherwise no
one would have ever heard of
I mean I've talked it because it before
and nobody ever knew we were meeting you
after the talk the conference talked the
video talk that you gave tubers aid was
there anything in that talk that might
have talked about you it was mostly but
it was about the United States it was US
foreign relations so of course the
Middle East came up and I talked about
Israel Palestine what I mean it doesn't
compare the talks that I've given in
Israel you know the Ministry of Interior
apologized and claimed that it was a
simple misunderstanding
that's certainly false it was perfectly
well understood the of the border
official was in constant contact with
the ministry and he was he played a role
he was simply referring questions and
comments from the ministry and I
understood everything and there were
reasons were very clear and explicit why
what do you think the reasons were for
them they're the ones that kept coming
back from the ministry that he kept
asking over and over one was well he did
mention well they they don't like you
you know they don't like your views the
government so I said yes it's try to
find one government in the world it does
like my views has it happened to you in
any other country in the world well this
one case of a country which wouldn't
allow me in that was Czechoslovakia
under the Russians in 1968 it's hard to
think of the case and outside of
totalitarian states where someone has
been refused entry because they've been
invited to give a talk at a particular
University so I guess you're gonna use
this I can hear your no lectures from
now in them US campuses that could
haven't intended to say anything about
it if I'm asked told and why didn't you
try to come in after the after the
ministry college eyes well I just a long
time I have a short trip several
countries to visit I'll go on to the
next country so you were here in Jordan
there is eight you were plan to go
tubers eight and tomorrow you're leaving
for Beirut and there's simply another
time to and is it intentional the fact
that you haven't been to Israel in what
1213 years is it no more intentional
than the fact that I haven't been to
Brazil for the same number of years or
Argentina or
that I've never been to countries that I
constantly invited to I'm going to have
a very intense series of requests for
visit second favor force justice just a
matter of a timetable mainly the matter
of the timetable in what's high on the
agenda so by the way we could have
conducted this interview in Hebrew right
you speak fluent Hebrew I'm rusty if it
was 50 years ago
yes your father was a Hebrew professor
yeah and I lived in Israel for a while
and my Hebrew was I was obviously an
American accent but was flowing I can
still read perfectly well but I wouldn't
trust myself to speak I have to think
too hard to get the words out but you
know I think it emphasizes the
complexity of the issue because on the
one hand you've I mean you speak Hebrew
and you come from a Jewish family and
you talked about anti-semitism when when
you were young and you you lived on a
kibbutz and you actually considered
staying and living in Israel and on the
other side you were the most outspoken
critic of Israel and I mean you
undermine Israel's existence it's
grateful if I don't regard myself as a
critic of Israel I regard myself as a
supporter of Israel the people who are
harming Israel in my opinion and so I've
said many times are those who claim to
be supporting it they are driving
helping drive Israel towards a moral
degeneration and possible ultimate
destruction I think support for Israel
should
support for policies which are to its
benefit you talk about the fact that you
don't support the right of Israel to
exist as a Jewish state I don't report
and should we support the right Israeli
public saw you should go and shake hands
with Hezbollah Sleater and that's for a
lot just a couple of days before he
started the bombing Israel a couple of
days before and furthermore they saw
pictures of me meeting nasrallah but
they didn't see pictures of me meeting
his main animate with whom I spent much
more time well a gym blood what's
happening is that when I went to Lebanon
as in any other country I tried to find
out as much as I can about the country
if I have a little time so I met with
the head of Hezbollah it's a major
political force and Lebanon in fact in
the last elections the coalition that
it's also this this leader who's calling
the demolition of Israel and actually
what Hezbollah's position has been is
that any position that the Palestinians
accept they'll accept he doesn't think
is really okay I mean he has so many
missiles which are aiming Israel and now
he's aiming to bomb Tel Aviv but you
know even there I'm sorry
he has missiles but they're used for
deterrence now let's go back a step you
said I'm going for the destruction of
Israel or some words like know that you
yeah I don't think it should exist as a
Jewish state yeah I don't think the
United States should exist as a
Christian State I don't think that
Pakistan should exist as an Islamic
state but there's a big difference
because the United States and Pakistan
there is no nation in the world calling
for their destruction and having a
nuclear weapon like Iran for example
like a brand does not have nuclear
weapons it's not calling for the
destruction he's calling for there's
many John is very specific in saying
that these are quotations that are
appearing Israeli press I heard him say
that him in his voice that would hear
what he said is I don't approve that he
said in the he was quoting Khomeini
during a period when Israel was very
close to here and I didn't mind home a
nice saying it he said in the end of
time
Israel will disappear words like that no
he was very specific in and but look the
Israel is in a position of security well
beyond that of many other states which
do not and if insofar as do they call
themselves not states of their citizens
but states of a particular category of
citizens object to it in principle so
what should I understand from your words
but are you telling Israelis go back to
Europe live as a minority here in Israel
take a chance through history sit on the
beach exactly we understand from here
what exactly their action tomorrow
exactly what I write a thousand times
though I was opposed to the existence of
a Jewish state and that was part of the
Zionist movement remember as a as a
Zionist youth leader yes I was opposed
to the the forming a Jewish state once
it was formed 1948
my position has consistently been that
Israel should have all the rights of
every state in the international system
no more and no less
now Israel demands more and I don't
