when you read anything including you
know what I write specifically you got
to remember that everybody's got an axe
to grind you know and history isn't
physics I mean in physics the world
pretty much controls what you do and
makes you honest you can't lie in
physics you'll be cooked very quickly
but history isn't like that and the
reason is that you know the intellectual
structure of the field is not such that
you got the real constraints of the
outside world so you pick and choose you
know you pick and choose from a massive
stuff and you pick what you think is
important and there's a lot of
subjective judgment and there's a lot of
ideology and that should be understood
what that means is that anything that
you read I try to be as apprentice that
can be about where I stand there's also
something called objectivity which is a
poll fraud and what that means is
accepting the ideology of the
established system that's called
objectivity but you should recognize
where somebody's coming from and what
they think is important and what their
values are and what they're looking for
and so on and so forth and then you
gotta compensate for it
and there you just have to rely on your
own intelligence and understanding
there's no answer and that's no matter
what you read that having been said
there are two points that already made
one point is that the mainstream
indoctrination system happens to contain
a lot of information it does for two
reasons for one thing because there are
people who have to know the facts like
business business has to know the facts
they got a lot at stake and so when you
read The Wall Street Journal News News
reports not the commentary when you read
the news reports they're probably pretty
accurate and the same is often true in
the New York Times news reports now
you've got to know how to read them you
know so you have to read defense of
South Vietnam as a pact against you know
and things like that
but once you understand how to read them
you know then you can get a lot of
information out of them and of course
you got to read carefully like you have
to compare it today's lies against
for example you read government denials
when you read government denials you're
often learning what in fact happened
quite typically they will not refer to
an event but they'll refer to the
government denial of it and then you
check back so there's all sorts of
techniques for for you know penetrating
the major media on top of that they're
also of course better off if you read
widely so if you have if you can say
read you know for example the Manchester
Guardian even the weekly edition you
will learn things about say Central
America they won't read in the American
press it's like the British press it's
not was written in such a wonderful
country it's just that they don't happen
to be the guys who were committing the
crimes in Central America so therefore
they can write about them more openly
and if you read journals like say the
nation especially people like Alex
Coburn you'll learn an awful lot that'll
never be the American understand either
one
like for example terror in El Salvador
has been described men in these times
and in the Guardian but not in the
mainstream press that's always been true
at the time the Tonkin Gulf incident for
instance when the hope which was a real
turning point in the war total fraud
government claims that American ships
had been attacked and that was the start
of a big attack in Vietnam the press the
mainstream press brought bought at a
hundred percent but the Guardian didn't
and told the truth in fact and that
turned out to be the truth I mean the
American New York of course you always
have you know you always read those
things with skepticism like anything but
nevertheless there are times when
network or things that the mainstream
press won't report or they'll understand
things that the mainstream press won't
understand but ultimately I don't think
there's any substitute for
just diligence and intelligence and
skepticism a lot of skepticism now let's
see that's one of the ways in which
people are kept ignorant you can have
all the information there but only a
very small number of people are in a
position to put forth the effort try to
figure out what's going on you have to
be very privileged you know quite
privileged before you can even do this
you have to have resources you have to
have training you know you have to have
time you have all sorts of things that
most people don't have in order to even
to be able to figure out what's going on
that's one reason why the country is
sort of safe and having a lot of
information available only very few
people are going to be able to get at it
and you know that's why you need
organization I mean if you can group
together in organizations you can do
what individuals can't do that's crucial
that's one reason why the United States
has always attempted to block things
like political parties or meaningful
organizations in which people can
participate because that's the way in
which isolated individuals can overcome
the lack of resources the only way
