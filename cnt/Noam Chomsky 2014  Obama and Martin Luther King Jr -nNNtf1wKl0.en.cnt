in 2008 before the primaries I wrote
about Obama
nothing much was known about him he had
no record but I just took a look at his
record and his presentations of himself
on his own website and it was obvious
that this person has no principles
there's nothing but rhetoric you know I
mean for example you take a look on his
website 2008 before the primaries so for
example take a look at his when he was a
senator he had almost no record but he
did do a few things and he was very
proud of them and one of the things he
emphasized on his website was that in
the year 2006
when Israel invaded Lebanon for the
fifth time practically destroyed half of
it
Obama sponsored a resolution in the
Senate and in demanding that the US
government permit Israel to continue the
attack until it achieves its objectives
and to punish anyone Hezbollah Syria
Iran which tries to impede Israel in its
destruction of Lebanon destroying half
that so than half the country again as
they've done repeatedly killing and
killed over a thousand people that was
these achievement that he was most proud
of in the Senate and it goes on like
that the rest of it was empty rhetoric
hope change I'm a nice guy you know so
on and so forth to try to find something
else there was no reason to be
disillusioned because there was no
reason for the illusions in the first
place and when you look you can see
and it's true but it's true that people
are kind of always waiting for a savior
and no Savior is going to come that's
not how things work it's you know you
can if people can create the conditions
under which some decent person may
become a spokesperson but they don't
come from above and organize the
movements it takes a Martin Luther King
a very significant person respect him a
lot he would have been the first to tell
you that he did not create the civil
rights movement civil rights movement
was created by young black activists in
the south who sat in at lunch counters
rode freedom buses got beaten tortured
killed tried to register people form the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee finally drew in supporters
from the north you know finally had a
big mass movement and Martin Luther King
was an effective spokesperson for it and
he deserves plenty of credit for that
I don't criticize it but that's how
leaders come and interesting it's
interesting to notice what happened with
Martin Luther King there's now a
national holiday in the United States
Martin Luther King Day and every year
there's a lot of rhetoric and what a
wonderful person and so on take a look
at it almost invariably the rhetoric
stops with Martin Luther King's I have a
dream speech in Washington okay which
did lead to significant civil rights
legislation because of the mass movement
he didn't stop there he went on to
confront class issues he went on to the
north in fact when he was assassinated
he was supporting a public workers
strike sanitation workers strike in
Memphis Tennessee and he was on his way
to form
to lead a march on Washington again to
form a poor people's movement not a
black movement of poor people's movement
to strike it class issues he was
assassinated the March took place anyway
led by his widow they did set up a tent
city in Washington resurrection city and
Congress is the most liberal Congress in
American history they let it stay there
briefly then they sent in the police in
the middle of the night he smashed it up
and drove everybody out of town that
part of Martin Luther King's history is
gone it's ok for the point of view of
the northern liberal it's fine to attack
racist sheriffs in Alabama but don't
look at what we're doing that's not
allowed and there was not enough popular
support for his later efforts to succeed
that's the fault of people like us who
didn't do the things we should have done
it's not going to get a leader will save
you unless you do the work then you can
get spokespersons
