playing what ecole devil's advocate
berkland hustle hood in the 1950s that
the fate of the world depends on I quote
the decisions of coach F Mao and dance
dance was secretary of state of the
United States under Eisenhower at that
time Russell added they do not read our
books and would find them very silly if
they did things have changed since then
but the power is still concentrated in
the hands of a relatively few people at
the head of the IMF the World Bank the
Pentagon the World Trade Organization
etc what they've continued ting people
like you of us can make in case you
replied that the general public has an
influence on leaders the same question
arises do they read our books well the
Russell quote that makes sense it's a
good answer - it's a good response to a
slogan that's familiar among activists
it's actually a slogan used by some my
close friends and the activist movement
particularly the Quaker activists very
good very courageous people constantly
engaged not only in protest but in
resistance civil disobedience and their
slogan is that you have to speak truth
to power and Russell's response I think
is an apt response to the idea that you
should speak truth to power
there's no point speaking truth to
Stalin Khrushchev in his day
Mao and Dulles they don't want to hear
it or they know it but I think we
shouldn't accept the slogan in the first
place for many reasons for one thing
Russell's reasons for it for another
thing that's not our audience as you
don't rent it out it's people who can
create conditions under which the
leadership is compelled to make
decisions
actually we've seen that and what's
being called the Arab Spring even the
dictators have to respond to organized
public opinion and it's plainly much
more true in more free societies and
it's not just a matter of influencing
leaders but also throwing them out
replacing them in fact the libera
eliminating leadership altogether so
power is the wrong audience the audience
is people who can influence power or a
certain power also the idea of speaking
truth to them
that doesn't seem to me a to capture the
right concept for one thing who are we
to speak truth do we have some special
insight into the truth I mean we do our
best other people do their best so you
should be speaking your what you best
your best presenting your best
understanding of complex affairs of the
world and human life and you shouldn't
be speaking to them ideally what you
should be doing is what a good teacher
should be doing speaking with them
interacting with them learning from them
is constantly the case in serious
dialogue so the right idea should be
speaking with people who are in a are
part of the general public and concerned
and committed to improving changing
maybe overthrowing structures of power
and dominance and learning with them
encouraging them to using what resources
you have most of us are we're privileged
so we have access to resources to
training and so on and that can
contribute to popular movements it
always does but also learning from them
John asked do they need our books well
that's up to them actually I think they
probably do at least
and it has an effect and there's an
interacting effect it changes the kind
of things that one writes and speaks so
I think though I kind of agree with the
criticism I think it's not directed to
the to the true issues at hand
