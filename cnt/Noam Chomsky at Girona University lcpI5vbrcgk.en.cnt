[Applause]
your can you hear me yeah okay there's a
general thesis about contemporary
history that is widely and proudly
proclaimed in the rich industrial
societies of the West it is that the
that history is converging towards an
ideal of liberal democracy and
FreeMarkets
which are the ultimate realization of
human freedom and another part of the
thesis is that we have just emerged from
a cosmic struggle in which the ideals of
liberal democracy and classical markets
have been vindicated the reality is
somewhat different in the rich Western
societies at least there's one can make
a strong argument that democracy and the
free markets are probably declining as
power becomes more and more concentrated
in the hands of privileged elites who
have always throughout history regarding
freedom and democracy as a threat a
danger that must be avoided and have
regarded markets as a device to control
and subdue others while requiring that
state power can be used to maintain
their own wealth and privilege and I
think the West is moving more and more
in that direction as for the Cold War it
was real enough but I think it should be
understood and rather different terms
what I'd like to do is say a few words
about these topics
well first democracy we have to decide
what we mean by the word like most of
the terms of political discourse
democracy has two meanings one is its
actual meaning and one is the opposite
the opposite is the one that's used for
the purposes of ideological control
in the ordinary meaning or ordinary
persons meaning democracy a system is
democratic to the extent that it
provides opportunities for the general
public to play a meaningful role in the
management of public affairs in the
sense of democracy that's used for
doctrinal management in contrast a
society is democratic to the extent that
the business classes rule without any
interference from the Troublesome rabble
I'm going to assume that we mean the
first by democracy and it's in that
sense that it is regarded but as a
threat by elite and has always been and
that it is in fact in my opinion
declining we can trace this problem back
to the first modern democratic
revolutions which took place in England
in the mid 17th century as the usually
suppressed and subdued Ravel began to
organize began to publish pamphlets
began to appeal to other poor people to
take their lives into their hands
those who described themselves as the
men of best quality were appalled by
this outrage and insisted eloquently
that the rabble must be subdued they
must be obedient they must respect their
masters and there was even a reason
behind it all kind of a logic behind it
a logic which persists up till today the
logic is that the mass of the population
are stupid and ignorant they are what
was called in those days beasts in the
shape of men to allow them any power or
any influence would lead directly to
disaster and that's not entirely false
to allow the population any influence
would lead to disaster for those who
concentrate power and privilege now
that's the real truth that lies
behind the the doctrinal fantasies
well these ideas were quite work
prevailed were prevalent among the
intellectual classes in England they
continued right to the founding of the
United States the first modern democracy
one may say the founding fathers held
that as they put it those who own the
country ought to govern and the country
should be managed by those who were
described as men of virtue good
old-fashioned Roman Republicans
aristocrats who could be counted on to
manage the society properly in the
interests of those who own it and
therefore have the right to government
in the early stages that meant
aristocrats and landowners and so on
later it came to mean the corporate
elite in the industrial society that
emerged in the next century that concept
we there's much time to run through it
but it comes right up to the present
basically unchallenged so in the present
it gets a little bit more sophisticated
and so on but it's basically the same
idea in the 20th century the the noted
the one of the leading American
intellectuals walter Lippmann who is the
leading figure in American journalism
the most respected commentator on public
affairs and a major political
commentator in his own right he among
other things wrote essays that were
called progressive essays and democratic
theory in the 1920s and he explained
lucidly the form that a democracy should
take in a modern industrial society in a
man in a modern democracy he said there
are two classes of citizens there are
what he called the responsible men those
are the men of virtue of the founding
fathers or the men of best quality of
the 17th century there are the
responsible men who are a very small
group and of course anyone
since these ideas is always part of that
group by definition so there's the
responsible men who have the duty of
managing and controlling the society and
then there's the general public whom he
described in his words as a bewildered
herd and the responsible men have to
protect themselves from the trampling
and the rage of the bewildered herd
that's a problem these two classes of
citizens have two different functions he
said in a democracy the responsible men
of course have the function of running
the since it's a democracy and not a
totalitarian state the bewildered herd
also have a function their function is
to be spectators not participants in
action but they're given a certain role
periodically they are allowed to lend
their weight to one or another member of
the responsible class that's what's
called an election after that they're
supposed to go home and be quiet now
this doctrine was extended by academic
leading academic political scientists
and many others and the general idea was
as one of the leading American political
scientists Harold Lasswell put it one of
the founders of modern political science
that we should not succumb to democratic
dogmatism about men being the best
judges of their own interests they are
not we are the best judges of their
interests if we allow them any
opportunity to influence affairs it'll
just be a catastrophe he also noticed
something which in fact you can trace
back centuries that as a society becomes
more free typically through popular
struggle which expands the range of
freedom it becomes harder to control the
Raval by force and therefore it is
necessary to rely more and more on
propaganda in a very free country like
the United States it is necessary to
rely extensively on property
and that idea had already been learned
by the highly class conscious business
classes decades earlier come back to
that in a moment
moving up towards the present in the
1960s the rabble all over the Western
world became you got out of control
began to enter into the political arena
all sorts of groups that are normally
passive and apathetic and obedient and
serve the masters began to raise their
voices to organize to put forth demands
in the political arena and to act to
implement them that called forth an
extremely interesting study study done
by the trilateral commission which was
put together in 1973 by David
Rockefeller it was a trilateral
commission because it was recognizing
the new political economic reality of
the world namely that there are three
major power centers the us hegemony had
dissolved a certain extent by that point
so the trilateral commission is a
represents a leak groups intellectuals
corporate leaders others from the three
major centers Europe the United States
and Japan I should mention that they
represent the liberal side the soft
humanitarian liberal side of the elites
this is the group for example out of
which Jimmy Carter and his
administration came that's the
complexion reacting to the uprising of
the rabble in the 1960s they called a
meeting and published a book called the
crisis of democracy and in the book the
representatives of Japan the United
States and Europe described the crisis
this fact that normally marginalized
people use women minorities all sorts of
others are becoming are trying to assert
their rights in Oregon
nice to obtain them they described this
and that's the crisis of democracy now
the naive might believe that that's
democracy but that's only if they're
using the term democracy in its actual
meaning if we use the term in its
ideologically correct meaning it's a
threat to democracy because it's a
threat to unquestioned business rule and
it was recognized by the Commission as a
threat a threat that had to be overcome
the crisis of democracy had to be
overcome they urged various methods to
impose as they put it more moderation in
democracy meaning these groups that were
attempting to put forth their interests
in the public arena should return to
their traditional passivity and
obedience because that would enable
democracy to survive which again is
correct and they're in the elite sense
of democracy
well that carries us pretty much up to
the present and we could carry it up to
the present day this is a major current
probably the dominant current in
intellectual thought with regard to
democracy and I should say that all
through I've been sampling from the
liberal extreme people like Lippmann and
Lasswell and trilateral commission all
the way back now there is indeed a
spectrum of opinion on this on the one
hand you have a libertarian parent that
can be traced back say to John Locke and
that would in fact include those who I
had just described their position was
that the rabble should be permitted to
know what is happening in the government
they should be permitted to have
information about public affairs but
they must be spectators they must not
participate in fact in the case of John
Locke in college one reads his
libertarian philosophical essays but if
you want to understand his actual
thought you have to remember that apart
from on the side writing philosophy he
also had a job his job was as a colonial
civil servant and in that capacity
he wrote he devised the constitution's
for several of the colonies and
especially the Carolinas and he imposed
in those constitutions his beliefs as to
what role the rabble should play in a
democracy being a libertarian he held
that they were allowed to know what's
going on but they're not allowed to talk
about it it was a crime to discuss
public affairs certainly not to do
anything about it well that's the
libertarians comes pretty much up to the
present there's also a more
authoritarian side also it goes way back
without tracing it back in history in
the modern period contemporary period a
good example of the more authoritarian
side of the spectrum is the group that
are called by a remarkable Orwellian
inversion of language are called
conservatives today any genuine
conservative would turn over his grave
to hear the term used for people like
those around Ronald Reagan radical
status who believed in a very powerful
state that intrudes massively into
economic affairs and public affairs
throws its weight around violently all
over the world and is carefully
protected from any interference by the
rabble so that this is the authoritarian
extreme the Reagan administration in
keeping with its commitments it's deeply
anti-democratic commitments created the
largest illegal of course government
propaganda agency in American history
there have been others but this was new
in scale its mean its main purpose was
as they put it to try to demonize the
Sandinistas to build up public support
for the US war against Nicaragua which
was lagging and other similar things
when the operation was exposed as it
finally was and of course declared
illegal the one of the high officials of
the Reagan administration told the press
that the kinds of operations that were
being carried
out are those that one carries out in
enemy territory which is quite exact the
general population is enemy territory
and since unfortunately you can't
control them by violence
we need propaganda agencies the
Reaganites also as you know broke new
records in clandestine activities
clandestine secret terrorist activities
the US has always been involved in
international terrorism massively but
they broke some new records they were
carrying out very complex clandestine
operations there are other states that
are terrorists but they're usually small
players so Libya say may hire some
terrorists to do some job for them but
the United States is a big country when
the United States gets into terrorism it
doesn't hire particular assassins it
hires terrorist States so for example it
hires Belgium to provide arms it hires
Saudi Arabia to fund it it hires Israel
to organize the and trained the killers
and so on that brings in Taiwan to
trained assassins and in fact an
enormous network of terrorist States was
established something quite new and
scale although not all that different
and specific character and all of this
was kept secret it was crucial that it
be kept secret and it's important to
bear in mind that point which is perhaps
obvious that a government engages in
clandestine activities only if it's
afraid of its own population clandestine
activities are not secret from anyone
else they're certainly not secret from
the victims they're not secret from the
array of terrorist states that are
participating in fact they're not even
secret from the media it's just that
they're at a low enough level so that
the media and the intellectuals can
pretend that they don't see it and
what's called exposure of these
clandestine activities is when it breaks
through to a level where you can no
longer pretend that you don't know what
you always knew that and then
you go through a certain routine to sort
of cleanse yourself confession am I
supposed well the the Reagan and the
fact that the Reagan administration
broke new records in clandestine terror
is another measure of its fear of enemy
territory the population at home and
their commitment to ensure that the
state to which they're deeply committed
be insulated not only from any influence
by the rabble but even from awareness by
the rabble say they don't accept the
position of say lock that the public are
allowed to know what's happening the
Reagan administration although there are
various procedures that every government
uses to release secret documents from
some suitably distant past which enables
the population to know what was
happening to them you know fifty years
ago or something like that
that's called Democratic freedom on
States very on this the United States is
one of the more open in fact it's
usually about a thirty or thirty-five
year period and there's a fair amount of
documentation released the Reagan
administration tried to stop that they
imposed very harsh conditions on release
of documents from thirty or forty years
ago on the principle that the population
of enemy territory has no right to know
what the state was up to forty years ago
or 30 years ago certainly not today
in fact these constraints were so heavy
that the entire historical section of
the State Department resigned and public
protests these are very conservative
people I should say the State Department
historians but they were appalled at the
level of censorship that was being
imposed they simply couldn't do their
professional job and there were many
other such examples well that makes
sense and in my opinion we are in fact
moving towards the authoritarian end of
this rather narrow spectrum there's an
international variant of this I've been
talking about domestic society the
international variant well I was
presented rather lucidly by Winston
Churchill in
1945 when plans were being made to run
the world this is about running
countries we're not talking about
running the world and he explained that
the government of the world must be
entrusted to the satisfied nations to
rich men dwelling in peace in their
habitations their rather ample
habitations they might say our power
placed us above the rest he said
therefore we rule they serve that's the
basis of what's called world order one
of the euphemisms for this is the
north-south confrontation goes right
back to the beginning of the Colombian
era before at home the same thing the
rich men rule others obey now you take
these two principles and put them
together and you have a logical
consequence namely the rich man of the
world rule the world the service areas
so-called south obey and most of the
population at home obey that's world
order on both an international and
domestic scale as perceived by those
officially committed to democracy now
there are differences in the means for
imposing order as last well and others
have noticed in military states and
totalitarian states you don't really
have to worry much about the rabble they
get out of line you send them down to
the torture chamber and you know central
Madrid or whatever it was in so for
example in El Salvador if you if you
union organizers or troublesome priests
or peasant peasant activists or getting
out of line you just send the death
squads they kill them off takes care of
that in the United States or any of them
were free societies where people have
over centuries won a certain amount of
protection from state violence it's
harder to do this it's much harder to do
it and therefore you have to turn the
more subtle means exactly as was pointed
out by the theorists of this process
long ago the primary means that's used
is thought control
obvious if you can't control people by
force you have to control their opinions
draw what they think that was recognized
as I mentioned by the US corporate a
lead back in the early part of the
century there are a number of respects
in which the United States an unusual
country in the world one of them is that
it has a highly class conscious business
class they're all vulgar Marxists
incidentally if you read the business
literature it reads like little malice
texts accept all the vows values are
reversed of course so early in the
century it was recognized by the
corporate elite that the rising
political power of the masses opposed
the threat of the greatest threat to
corporate power and therefore was
necessary to do something about it can't
kill them I've lost that capacity so
therefore it was necessary as they put
it to control the public mind which is
the greatest threat to the corporations
and a huge industry was formed called
the public relations industry which is
dedicated to controlling the public mind
later on Europe and Japan more backward
societies picked it up and now have
similar things pioneered in the United
States the public relations industry
spends huge sums of money nobody knows
because remember the corporate world is
secret but few congressional attempts to
investigate some years ago came up with
figures on the order of a million
dollars a year which is probably much
higher today this was in this 1970s to
control the public mind it's a lot of
money a lot of effort it ranges over a
whole wide spectrum of available means
of communication and indoctrination in
the modern period one of the major ones
is television which presents a picture
of life as it should be lived from the
point of view of the rulers each
individual should be a happy consumer
consuming as much as possible no nobody
works nobody has a job nobody
has a struggle on the job you have some
personal problems maybe but they get
overcome by the end of the program and
of course it's all interspersed with
lots and lots of advertisements which
try to convince you especially try to
convince young people that they better
spend every cent they have on buying
$200 sneakers and whatever the next
thing is because that's the way life is
supposed to be lived this incidentally
has quite an impact on the poor black
ghettos where kids are watching this
stuff and haven't got a cent but they
see their favorite basketball player
appearing in all of this fancy gear and
they want to be like him so they have to
get it and there's only one way to get
it which is part of the reason for the
certainly and as an impact it's hard to
measure on the ghetto criminality on the
drug trade and so on well that's one
aspect another aspect of the thought
system of thought control is simply
diversion get the rabble out of our hair
just get them to pay attention to
something else not Public Affairs which
are none of their business so get them
to watch sports or you know sex or
violence or something anything but
something that might that they might
that might help them to take part in
managing their lives because that's not
allowed in a democracy the there's also
straight indoctrination you know
presenting a picture of the world that
suits the ideology that's usually beamed
at the educated classes they're the ones
who have to make decisions which may
influence something they're the managers
corporate managers you know cultural
managers political managers and so on
they have a certain range of in which
they can move so they better they really
better believe the right things and
hence the major careful propaganda and a
sort of a narrow sense is directed at
the educated classes and it's rather
striking to see the effects there's
quite significant differences of opinion
and knowledge between the rabble who
just figured things out by their own
instinct because they're being diverted
and the educated classes who are being
subjected to extensive indoctrination
and of course have an internal reason to
believe it they have to fulfill their
function just to give you one case
there's lots more just before I left the
United States a an academic study was
published of opinion right before the
presidential election to see you know
what people believed about it what
people believed about the positions the
candidates and so on not surprisingly
very few people knew the positions on
the candidates when asked although 86%
knew the name of George Bush's dog less
than 30% knew where the candidates stood
on public issues the propaganda was kind
of getting through in some sense so you
know they gave the kinds of answers
which reflected the propaganda messages
so for example when asked the the
biggest item in the federal budget by
far is military spending the next way
down below that is anything that could
loosely be called welfare at the very
bottom undetectable you know you can't
find out what the microscope is
so-called foreign aid it's really a kind
of export promotion but the public
inverts those figures most of the people
most of the people when given those
three choices thought that foreign aid
was the biggest item in the federal
budget because we're giving away
everything all those third-world
malcontents the next biggest item they
thought was welfare you know purchasing
Cadillacs for welfare mothers and that
sort of thing and quite lowdown came
military spending there were a lot of
other results like that but one
interesting result was late decent
people who did the study correlated the
responses with level of education and it
turned out the higher the level of
education the greater the ignorance
about the facts that's not particularly
surprising in fact it's kind of
reasonable and there's a lot of similar
results in other studies because the
rabble are just being ignored and their
own experiences tell them what the world
is really like whereas the educated I
have to train to become a czars so they
are indoctrinated and therefore quite
commonly have false pictures of the
world thanks to the effects of the
educational system and the journals and
so on and so forth the instruments of
ideological management well that's one
mechanism of control controlling the
public mind what you might call
propaganda a second method of control is
simply to isolate people keep them alone
make sure that there are no
organizations in which they can come
together if people are alone if poor
people powerless people are fighting
concentrated power alone they're
helpless you can't know what you think
you know you can't have ideas you can't
interchange them you can't have plans
can't do anything about it so it's very
important to break down organizations
and isolate people
there's an old called the United States
Wobblies the anarchist labor movement
back in the 1920s an old wobbly
organizer
one of his favorite slogans was I
thought wouldn't get run around giving
talks and singing songs and so on
he said the press has told us how good
the times are we have no opportunity to
consult their neighbors to see if the
press speaks the truth
that's the crucial point if people can
consult their neighbors they get to be
dangerous as long as the press is
telling them one at a time what the
story is things are pretty safe and the
the masters understand that as well as
anyone else
television has had a substantial effect
on this television Zini inherently an
isolating device
unless you're going to a bar to watch a
boxing match or something you sit alone
in front of the television set and your
neighbor sits alone in front of his or
her television set and in fact in a
country like the United States where
there's you know have television sets in
every room every member of the family
sits alone in front of the television
set and that way people are really
isolated the chance that they'll consult
their neighbors is very low there have
also been huge efforts including
enormous corporate propaganda campaigns
to break unions that the the corporate
world was terrified in 1935 when labor
labor won its first legislative victory
ever namely it gained the right to
organize actually US labor has been as a
very violent history of repression and
American workers didn't get the minimal
right to organize until 50 or 60 years
after it was common in Europe even the
right-wing European press like the
London Times was constantly appalled at
the treatment of workers in the United
States but in 1935 in the course of the
being popular struggles and uprising
then they did gain the right to organize
that's the first and last victory for
labor in the legislative system the
business community organized that once
again warned about you know the rising
political power of the masses to do
something about this and launched huge
new campaigns they realized it was too
late
to do to rely on the traditional method
of strike breaking just state violence
which is the traditional method they had
to have more sophisticated means what
were called scientific methods of strike
breaking involving largely attempts to
organize opinion in the communities
against the strikers the typical picture
was and communities were as day aged
with this material the picture was all
of us are good Americans living in
harmony you know working together for
the common good
the honest labor you know
simple housewife the executive and the
corporate suite
you know toiling for the benefit of the
people and then there are these
disruptive elements from aliens of some
kind who are trying to destroy our
harmony and this was done with great
energy and sophistication the Axworthy
efforts were kind of put on hold during
the Second World War there were some
other things to do
but it picked up right away afterwards
and without going through the details
the right to organize has been lost
labour won the eight-hour day finally in
1935 its lost it completely
if people are lucky enough to have a job
they're forced to work a lot of overtime
the the the right or the the ultimate
weapon of strikebreaking namely bringing
in scabs and you know replacement
workers non-union replacement workers
the corporations were afraid to do that
for years they're doing it now it was
done to break a big Union this year and
being strike by the United Auto Workers
and most corporations now say they'll do
the same thing that's of great success
in destroying democracy well that's
another technique and of course this
means try to break down all popular
organizations as well notice that if
this succeeds if you succeed in
isolating people sufficiently it really
doesn't matter what they think that is
each person can privately have his or
her own or her own thoughts in their own
living room and it has no effect on
anything and that does yield very
striking results so for example
throughout the rig Reagan years which
were regarded as a triumphant period for
no right-wing conservatism what in fact
was happening was that public opinion
was rigged steadily moving towards more
social democratic New Deal style
positions well though nobody was
advocating in fact everybody was on the
other side so each person was doing it
alone
things have now reached the point where
in the latest the United States is very
heavily polled because the public
relations industry which has to control
the public mind wants to know what's
happening in the public mind so this
huge efforts to figure out what's in
people's minds and they're interesting
to study the most recent one of the most
recent ones found that 83% of the
population regard the economic system as
inherently unfair can't be remedy has to
be overthrown about seventy one one of
the big issues arising in the United
States now is health care which is you
know not available to most
many people and how a sight for those
who can get it and cost about seventy
percent of the population are in favor
of what's called a canadian-style health
care system more or less the kind of
health health care system that exists in
every industrial country except the
United States and South Africa I think
now they've never heard this advocated
you know when there's any reference to
it it's called a soviet-style system of
repression or something like that
and in fact it's not an option I mean it
doesn't come up in the political
campaign and it can't happen because the
health system has to be designed so that
it benefits private insurance
corporations so it's not an option but
that's what 70% of the people think
anyway well as long and we could go on
and on it's just take a last example
there was a recent poll in which the
popularity of living ex-presidents was
determined who was the most popular
living ex-president well by far the most
popular was Jimmy Carter
second was Gerald Ford and the only
reason he was second is nobody knows who
he is the president for a couple of
months and nobody remembers him so he
must have been pretty good and down at
the bottom way down the bottom where
Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon among
working people Reagan was the most
unpopular among all public figures who
they gave in the poll
now remember this is you've been hearing
years about the great popularity of the
Great Communicator and this and that all
total fraud you know but as long as the
general population is isolated it really
doesn't matter nobody knows that anyone
else has the same opinions they have and
if they even if they did they couldn't
do anything about it
now that's the beauty of isolation
another technique which is actually just
being sort of pioneered now and extends
to Europe as well as do all of these
things incidentally Europe kind of lags
a generation behind usually in these
respects the
so you probably get a picture of the
future by looking at what's happening to
the United States
another method of marginalizing the
public and making sure that they estate
spectators not participants is to take
decision-making out of the public domain
entirely then there's no to keep any
problems well that's done very widely so
for example take say corporations or
banks those are totalitarian structures
pure totalitarian structures what goes
on internal to them is never anybody's
business
I remember once at a conference I
happened to run in Switzerland I
happened to run into on that same panel
I was on a diplomatic historian from
Switzerland we got friendly and talked
for a while and he told me the worst job
in the world is to be a diplomatic
historian in Switzerland the reason is
that diplomatic historians there what
they do is look at government documents
you know of course from the distant past
and they try to figure out what happened
in the past on the basis of documents
but in Switzerland he said they've
they've dropped the pretense that
there's a government in between the
corporations and the banks and policy
it's all done by the governments and the
bank by the corporations and the banks
directly and they don't leave a record
because nobody finds out what they're
thinking about and the government's just
kind of like a low-level administrating
device well that's kind of like a step
forward but within the corporations and
this becomes hugely significant in an
era of globalization of capital huge
transnational corporations and banks
internal to them everything is totally
secret and completely
totalitarian and decision-making
structure workers come from the top they
flow down nobody even in principle has
the possibility of influencing anything
you have a choice of renting yourself to
them or starving in the streets so
that's a choice but that's about it
a second type of and that's always been
true of course but it's very much
expanding and skins in scale in the
modern period in fact just to give you a
measure of how much it's expanding in
scale international trade what's called
international trade probably close to
half of it or you know somewhere between
a third and a half of it is probably
intra firm transfers just movement of
goods inside a particular firm in the
United States about where this good
statistics about ten years ago
40% of what's called international trade
was just internal to a particular firm
that means centrally managed trade
centrally managed trade absolutely
insulated from any market pressures and
of course you know unknown to anyone
just as the decisions are a second
development that's happening now is the
rise of a kind of de-facto world
government which is reflecting the
globalization of the economy it's been a
big escalation in the last 20 years in
the flow of CAP the free flow of capital
tons of unregulated capital in the world
people can invest very quickly and very
easily elsewhere one effect is the
deindustrialization of the industrial
societies it's an obvious effect because
capital is going to move to higher
oppression low wage areas if it can move
freely since that's profitable and in
fact with this increase in transnational
corporation and super national banks and
investment firms with huge amounts of
capital to throw around
they have naturally they are naturally
creating a world government to reflect
that structure typically governments
reflect prevailing domestic economic
power now it's on a world scale so it's
a world of government and it includes
its own institutions like the GATT or
the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank the meetings of the seven
rich executives in the seven richest
industrial countries g7 in fact it's
described in the international financial
press as
the new Imperial age with a de facto
world government controlling everything
well of course one of the in the
European community the term Democratic
deficit is sometimes used to reflect the
fact that decisions are being raised to
a level where they're out of the
influence of any parliamentary bodies
whatever to whatever extent
parliamentary bodies reflect public
opinion they can no longer do it if the
decisions are at the level of the IMF
and the GATT negotiations that's called
the Democratic deficit and the idea is
to try to maximize the deficit you know
make it as big as possible notice that
that gives you a new form of control of
the public decisions are being made at a
level where they cannot influence them
through any form of representative
institution and in fact where they don't
even know about them you know who knows
what's going on inside the IMF or you
know in the GATT negotiations people may
think they know but they really don't if
you look closely what's going on is
something quite different and decisions
made at that level have an overwhelming
influence on every aspect of life on
investment trade environment everything
you can think of and it's out of the
control of governments of populations in
the United States a similar thing is
happening right now with the north
american free trade agreement which is
an executive agreement that the public
doesn't even know of that actually is
being kept secret and congress has
abdicated any responsibility some of
this sail through labor screaming about
it but nobody pays any attention to them
in fact any more than you pay attention
to the third world so it'll be rammed
through it'll obviously be a bonanza we
even without knowing what's in it and
you can't really know it's plain that
it'll be great bonanza for investors
they'll make a lot of money out of both
the US investors and their Mexican
counterparts it will probably be a
disaster for the working class both in
the United States and Mexico and it may
very well severely degrade environmental
restrictions
pesticide control and so on in other
words it'll have the intended purpose of
lowering the level of life for everybody
but the very rich to the lowest possible
level and marginalizing the public well
these are tendencies that are quite
quite obvious and will continue that's
democracy with regard to liberal
capitalism is getting late so I won't
spend a lot of time on it but the fact
is that all the talk about liberal
capitalism and markets is just dreamy
fantasies if you look back at economic
history there's some very clear lessons
every successful developing country
without exception from England up to
South Korea has gotten that way by
violating these principles radically
violating and it's not even questionable
every country that's followed these
principles is a complete disaster in
fact the only place where they're
followed is the third world in fact
they're designed for the third world to
make it easier rob people if a country
follows these free-market principles it
will be robbed blind which is exactly
why every developed society starting
with England has destroyed its
competitors by force like as England
destroyed in the Indian textile
manufacturer was out was now producing
it has set up high protectionist walls
has relied on import substitution and so
on and so forth and so it goes up to the
present the United States is a perfect
example the United us industrialization
started with it with textiles like
everybody and the only reason you could
have textiles in New England in the
1830s let's say is because British
manufacturers were kept out they would
have undercut it some estimates are that
about 50% of American manufacturing
would have been destroyed right away if
they let the protectionist walls down
same was true of the steel industry
coming up to the present the same is
true of the computer industry the
computer industries called
a private enterprise but that's a total
fraud the computer industry is largely
funded by the public that's part of the
main purpose of the Pentagon the whole
Pentagon system
is to chat channel public subsidies to
high technology industry and everyone in
the industry knows perfectly well that
without that subsidy they'd be nowhere
that's one of the reasons they're so
upset now because of the loss of the
traditional pretext for organizing a
public subsidy to advance sectors of
Industry just the other day there was a
big article in The Wall Street Journal
about how the American computer chip
industry has sort of come back into
international competition thanks to the
fact that the government set up a
government corporate Corporation which
subsidized them and so on and to my
knowledge they know except there are no
exceptions to this and everyone very
well understands it the idea that
capitalism might be a viable system
disappeared about 60 years ago and now
it exists only in the ideological system
or in the stuff that's produced for
third world people who you want to rob
and destroy so much for in fact as
international trade becomes more and
more controlled by huge corporations as
the share and international trade by
centrally managed corporations increases
obviously markets decline I mean even if
the you know that the classical economic
theory holds that there's a free market
see and then there are little tiny
islands in it which are called
businesses firms I mean everybody always
understood that a firm is centrally
managed there's no free trade inside of
a business oh by now the islands are the
size of the sea and the sea was never a
free trade see anyway of the 24 most
industrial countries 20 are more
protectionist now than they were thirty
years ago that's one of the main reasons
why the gap between the third world and
the first world is increasing the other
major reason is the third world has been
subjected to what's called IMF
fundamentalism neoliberal economic
policies which is of course destroyed
them you have more protectionism among
the rich more free-market liberalism
among the poor
and predictably you get a growing gap
and now the as Eastern Europe returns to
its classical third world role it's
happening to them as well well let me
finally make a remark about about the
Cold War role of Eastern Europe and all
of this it's important but I think it's
misconceived in in my opinion the Cold
War was essentially a phase in the
north-south conflict and let me briefly
explain why I think that's the way to
understand it the north what's called
the north-south conflict it's a
euphemism for Europe's conquest of the
world sets up rich powerful industrial
societies which robbed everybody else
and then the third world which is a
service area provides resources raw
materials cheap labor markets investment
opportunities in the current period
opportunities for exploit export of
pollution all kind of services like that
no there's a there's a constant threat
to this system it's if if you look at
the internal u.s. planning documents
it's identified very clearly the
greatest threat to the US was the global
enforcer in the post Second World War
period so the document the planners took
a global view and they said the greatest
threat to US interests is radical and
nationalist regimes in the third world
which will be subject to pressures from
the masses of the population for
improved living standards and
diversification of production for
domestic needs in other words any form
of government in the third world which
is responsive to its own public is a
threat to our interests because of
course that means they're not responsive
to the higher value our interests and
this is explained as in the business
press in ordinary vulgar Marxist terms
namely we have to maintain healthy
investment climate with with adequate
repatriation for investors and that's
all going to be threatened if
governments start responding to
pressures from their own populations or
begin to produce for domestic needs and
so on so that's the big threat and has
to be killed of course can't permit that
threat to exist the threat becomes
amplified if a country moves on an
independent course and actually shows
some signs of success then it becomes
what's called a rotten apple that might
spoil the barrel or a virus that might
infect others
so en de Chile for example was described
as a virus that might infect others all
the way to Italy not not that anybody
expects Kissinger who said there's not
that he expected you know I end these
hordes to descend upon Rome obviously I
don't think it was that stupid though
I'm not sure the truth but he did they
did expect that it would send the wrong
message to Italian voters namely that
social democratic reforms could be
instituted through parliamentary means
and that's a virus that might infect
others
Nicaragua who is a virus Vietnam was a
virus and you know they ought to be
destroyed
when you have a virus things get serious
you got to destroy it and you've got to
inoculate everybody around it so
typically when there's a virus you get a
destruction of the threat an imposition
of terror states in the environment
that's been a characteristic pattern the
neo-nazi National Security states in
Latin America that spread from the
Kennedy administration on were an effort
to respond to the Cuban virus you had to
inoculate the region same was true in
Southeast Asia this is a very standard
pattern well that's tickle and that's
basically the logic of the Cold War
there's a lot more to it well if you
take the cold be cold that of the
north-south conflict sorry let's take
the cold war now and it's important to
bear in mind that Eastern Europe is the
earliest third world actually even
before the Columbian era Eastern Europe
was beginning to under develop and
become a service area for the slowly
developing West those relations
intensified actually the split was right
down the center of Germany not
very distant from where east and west
germany divided today to the east it was
becoming underdeveloped impoverished
serfdom was increasing and so on to the
west it was developing the interactions
both reflected that and accelerated it
in the standard pattern and by and this
continued it intensified right into the
20th century with your eastern most and
son you know not every place like not
the western part of Czechoslovakia but
most of Eastern Europe became an
impoverished colony of the West in the
classic sense okay in 1917 an ultra
nationalist threat developed a big piece
of the third world pulled itself out now
this isn't Grenada or Nicaragua
this is a sixth of the world pulling
itself out of its service role that is
really intolerable and in fact there was
an immediate invasion and the invasion
was taken very seriously one of the
facts that's constantly suppressed in
British scholarship which has been known
for at least ten years from declassified
documents is that the British military
successes on the northern front were
largely due to the use of poison gas now
poison gas in those days was like
nuclear weapons today but and it was the
intervention was taken extremely
seriously didn't quite work although it
didn't carry out a lot of destruction
and so on in later period this
independent piece of the third world was
not only separated from the service role
but was becoming a virus there was great
fear that elsewhere in the third world
people would want to follow that model
especially during the Great Depression
when the Western countries were serious
problems and that Russian economic
development at least was continuing this
goes right into the post-war period in
fact they were afraid that the virus
might even spread to the west part of
the reason for the Western initiatives
to partition Germany from 1945 on
whereas the British
an office put it to block ideological
infiltration from the east which amounts
to aggression political victories by the
wrong people are commonly described as
aggression but they were afraid that the
influences from the east might lead to a
unified labor movement and you know
interfere with the project of restoring
Europe to traditional conservative rule
that was going on at the time and this
goes on for years it's kind of hard to
remember now but Soviet success was
considered a great threat because it was
a virus others thought why not us you
might think it's an intense that led to
the second stage of the Cold War from
1945 on at that point the virus was not
only infecting others but had even
become a major military force which had
a deterrent effect on the West made it
harder to intervene elsewhere so it was
you know that's something that no
third-world country can do and of course
by then it had expanded to Eastern
Europe which is a traditional source of
resources and raw materials for Western
Europe that meant cut off of the flow of
food supplies and other raw materials
that Europe was used to exploiting well
it's worth it's important to stress that
Stalin's crimes were of absolutely no
concern to anybody if you read the
planning record don't even talk about
them Harry Truman and of course the
crimes were awesome and scale Truman
President Truman said that he liked
Stalin you know he thought he was honest
and very clever it would be a
catastrophe if he died but there was a
condition the condition was we have to
he said we can make it deal with him but
on one condition that we get our way 85
percent of the time in that case we can
make a deal otherwise No Deal well they
couldn't get their way 85 percent of the
time on goes the Cold War
I'll go through the details the Soviet
Union though always far behind the West
in both economic and military power its
power peaked or
1960 by the mid-1960s internal
indicators were declining things like
health standard indicators of what's
happening in a society were beginning to
decline by the 1970s military spending
leveled off by the 80s the whole thing
imploded collapsed though they had
carried the societies the tyranny was
brutal tyranny and it had carried the
society through the early stages of
industrialization couldn't go on to the
modern period it's called a disaster but
that but that depends what you compare
it with in the West the standard is
standard procedure is to compare Eastern
and Western Europe and say Oh God look
how awful they are and how wonderful we
are we must be terrific people Eastern
and Western as an idiotic comparison
I mean Eastern and Western Europe
haven't been like for probably six
hundred years and they were falling
farther apart in the early part of the
century people in the third world who
aren't forced to be as stupid as we are
make a different comparison they compare
they make a rational comparison they
compare countries that were alike in the
early part of the century no no perfect
examples but they might say compare
Brazil and Russia or Guatemala and you
know Bulgaria or something like that if
you draw though if you look at those
comparisons you get quite a different
picture in any event by the 1980s the
system couldn't maintain itself couldn't
control the Senate fell apart and
predictably Eastern Europe finally
returns to its third-world role I'm the
logic is exactly the same was when the
Marines conquered granade it but you
know Grenada is a speck in the Caribbean
you can knock it off in a weekend Rhett
rushes you know even in in the
third-world period it was a big military
force and he takes to take 70 years but
the logic is about the same the return
of Eastern Europe to the third world
role offers new opportunities for
repressing people in the West in the
traditional fashion so one of the ways
which you if you're a executive of
General Motors one of the ways in which
you attack the US labor force the
domestic enemy is by shifting production
to high repression areas like say Mexico
or Thailand
now Eastern Europe is open General
Motors is closing 21 plants in North
America but it's opening a huge plant
700 million dollar high-tech plant in an
area of East Germany where there's over
40 percent unemployment and where I'm
now quoting the London Financial Times
the world's leading financial journal
where they won't have to be concerned
about pampered West European workers you
know who want high wages and vacations
and all this nonsense the head of
Daimler pence who made the same warning
last spring when there was a big strike
wave you said keep that stuff up and
we'll shift production elsewhere
including Russia so that offers another
means as the third world it does all
together to kind of institute a third
world structure back in the rich
domestic societies and bear in mind that
that's a corollary to the globalization
of production and the globalization of
finance if capital can flow freely
you're going to find production moving
to the most high repression low wage
areas and that means that the third
world model this kind of two-tiered
model with superfluous people in a
sector of wealthy people that will
extend to the rich societies themselves
you walk through any American city and
you can see it and it'll happen here
before too long as well
under current tendencies the there was
in in the earlier period what was called
the Ford model Henry Ford model a Henry
this was a national economy at the time
and Henry Ford understood first magnate
to understand that you had to provide
workers with at least enough of a wage
so they could purchase what you produce
otherwise no time a market well that
model is kind of decline
as the economic system becomes more
global
now you can produce for rich people
elsewhere and they can produce for rich
people in your country production will
be done in areas which are under such
high repression that you don't have to
worry about wages going up and then
there's a flow of people from the
countryside to force them down and so on
and so forth so in the most repressed
areas you get your productive labour
force at home you keep the rich
population which in a rich country like
the United States isn't going to be like
Brazil it's not gonna be say 10% like
Brazil it would be maybe 40 percent or
something and the rest of the population
just becomes superfluous they're useless
for wealth production they are less and
less needed for consumption so therefore
they're useless because these are the
only human values that exist in a state
capitalist society and then you got to
do something about them well that's you
saw the LA riot Los Angeles riots and in
right in the background of the Los
Angeles Riots is the fact that this used
to be a production area there are empty
industrial plants all around Los Angeles
these are superfluous people add to that
the racism and you get what you saw
there and it's happening all over
violence in the ghettos is extraordinary
I mean the level of murders and you know
the packs and the in the inner cities is
unbelievable
that's as people get cooped up and they
pray and pray on one another and you
keep them from getting out you know you
can't build walls like El Salvador but
there are a lot of ways of keeping
people from getting out into the richer
areas so they kill each other and they
sell drugs and so on if you can't do
anything else with them they get thrown
in jail there's been an enormous
increase in the prison population in the
United States in the last ten years as
part of the state policy of
internationalizing production of Bill of
converting returning resources even more
than before towards the super-rich
2% of the population while the rest of
the population declines natural
reflection of this so you got to have
more and more people going into prisons
and another cause for that is the
breakdown of social services so there
used to be mental institutions we could
take care of people who were couldn't
handle couldn't take care of themselves
on the streets
well they've mostly disappeared you got
to do something with the people you can
wander around on the streets so many of
them are put in prison in fact a recent
study show that about 30 percent of the
state and local prisons in the United
States have inmates who are mentally
retarded and haven't even been charged
with anything there's just nothing else
to do with them well these are ways of
you know controlling the population the
u.s. now has by far the largest highest
per capita prison population in the
world well without proceeding the
tendencies I think are pretty clear the
tendencies are towards a world
government by the rich for the rich with
national states mobilizing resources for
their own domestically based
corporations and banks and controlling
the population for the benefits of the
transnational corporations that are to
rule the world economy and in this new
Imperial age that the financial press
talks about and they are slowly
developing their own governing
institutions as a reflection of these
economic realities those tendencies are
based crucially on the destruction of
any meaningful democracy on destruction
of any possibility for the rabble to
participate or in the current period
even to know what's going on the highest
stage of destruction of democracy when
the general public can't even know what
decisions are being made because they're
totally insulated there are counter
tendencies the crisis of democracy that
so concerned a lease was very real there
has been a real cultural and moral
tremendous improvement in the cultural
and moral level in much of the
population in fact it's quite dramatic
in the last 30 years strive very
striking in the United States but I
think just about everywhere
that's a counter tendency and an
extremely important one it doesn't have
any institutional form to speak of but
it's quite brought widespread and deeply
rooted and which of these two tendencies
prevails will determine whether there
will be a world in which a decent human
being would want to live

at the moment they're not all that
interested in the oil in Siberia for one
thing there's a big oil glut there's a
big surplus of oil that's one of the
reasons they're trying to keep you rocky
oil off the market furthermore Siberian
oil is expensive it's hard to get oil
out of there you know it's a horrible
climate when the there will come a time
when they'll care about the oil
undoubtedly and you can be sure that all
the Western oil companies and the
Japanese will be in there up to the next
III don't think oil is the particular
reason gosh what are you on guys oil and
gas well you know Soviet Union was a big
gas supplier to the West actually that's
been cutting back as part of the general
collapse of the system they've stopped
being reliable suppliers to Western
Europe for one thing a lot of the gas is
getting diverted to local countries like
Ukraine and for another the whole
system's collapsing I mean the so the
Eastern Europe was kind of stable
through the 1980s in 1989 when it had
the IMF rules imposed on it it started
going into freefall
you know just collapsed that's true
throughout the region and it's typical
it's undergoing a process of sometimes
called Latin American ization and sooner
or later sure the Western powers will
try to control those resources as others
but even if the Soviet Union didn't have
a drop of oil the Western policy would
have been exactly the same I mean
Nicaragua didn't have any oil Cuba
doesn't have any oil trying to destroy
them and this is a huge area notice is
blown via bromine bond of the country
stays over like a roll call
well point number one is that we ought
to be careful with terminology there was
no gulf war a war is something where
there are two sides shooting at each
other and that didn't happen in the Gulf
in fact the US and Britain would not
have entered the Gulf conflict unless
they were pretty confident that nobody
would shoot back the reason for that is
that there's very little popular support
for intervention one aspect of the
improvement in the cultural climate is
that they know there's no support for
intervention they're very aware of that
so this was a war it was just a
slaughter
it was the Gulf of slaughter and the
question is what was the reason for the
Gulf slaughter the normal reason the US
and Britain you know these two
traditional warrior states they support
any gangster around but then how awful
they are as long as they are useful for
controlling their populations and
ensuring what's called stability meaning
profits and so on so Saddam Hussein was
one of those guys he was doing fine you
know he's keeping everything quiet he
was providing a big market for Western
industry he was offering his oil on
reasonable terms they thought he was a
fine guy they liked him it didn't matter
that he was slaughtering Kurds and
torturing dissidents but it never
matters and it didn't matter for
Trujillo didn't matter for Stalin as I
just mentioned there's a much bigger
killer than Saddam Hussein in fact the
US was kind of supporting Hitler up
until the late 30s because he was
regarded as sort of a barrier against
pressure from the labouring classes and
and the Soviet Union what they called
Bolshevism the u.s. enthusiastically
supported Mussolini from the day of the
march on Rome which was greeted with
enormous enthusiasm all through the 30s
Mussolini was that admirable Italian
gentleman as Franklin Delano Roosevelt
called him and the business
he was ecstatic about him and so on
right now they're supporting General
Suharto of Indonesia who's one of the
major killers in the world he took power
in 1965 as part of the project of
insulating Southeast Asia from the
Vietnamese virus and the first act that
he carried out was to slaughter about
700,000 people in about four months an
action which incidentally was greeted
with enormous applause and food
enthusiasm throughout the West I've just
written a study of this which I went
through the press it is unbelievable
they were just ecstatic as the corpses
mounted and that's the way it always
works but all of these gangsters have a
flaw sooner or later they stop obeying
orders now sooner or later they strike
out on their own and they commit the
crime of disobedience at that point they
become radical nationalists and they
have to be wiped out mussolini made that
mistake when he joined Hitler Hitler
made that mistake when instead of just
repressing the working classes he tried
to expand Trujillo you-know-who is
another big killer made that mistake by
the 1950s he was such a crook he started
buying up interfering with US
investments in the Dominican Republic
CIA tried to kill him
and he was shortly assassinated it just
happened with Noriega I mean no he's a
very minor thug by these standards you
know barely detectable but Noriega was
perfectly fine he was stealing elections
he was torturing dissidents you know
doing running drugs everything was just
fine until about 1986 or so and you know
he started just going off on his own you
know he's playing both sides he refused
to participate enthusiastically the war
against Nicaragua
okay had to go in fact if you look at
the crafter Noriega it was kidnapped and
brought to the United States he was put
on trial if you look at the charges
against him
they were virtually all charges from the
period when he was a US he was in the
pay of the CIA
well that's what happened we said I'm
insane he did the wrong thing got to be
destroyed but what they want and I know
there were opportunities for a
negotiated settlement to that word from
mid-august right until early January
there were offers coming from Iraq to
withdraw under various conditions by
early January there were virtually no
conditions these offers were being
released by high US officials who
regarded them described them as serious
and negotiable
of course they were never considered and
the press refused to publish them so the
only people who know about them are a
couple of fanatics who you know read
crazy journals and things but they were
real and the US had no interest in them
they didn't want a diplomatic settlement
they wanted to reassert their force the
comparative advantage of the United
States and Britain in world affairs is
primarily violence they monopolize the
resources of violence and they want you
know everybody wants the world to run in
accord with your own advantages you try
to play your strong card in a card game
well in this game the strong card for
the United States and England is violent
so they'd much prefer to see issues
settled by violence than by negotiations
been true for a long time they had to
get they had to cut back they had to
punish the disobedient dictator they
wanted to reassert their control this
region is a US region nobody's allowed
in that's been true since 1945 the
British are allowed in a little but
that's only because they're regarded as
completely servile they'll do anything
you tell them so they are allowed in but
nobody else is you know and the US and
its British client wanted to resort to
control to show the importance of course
in the world to punish the guy who made
a mistake in case anybody else gets a
funny idea and then after the war was
over it so-called war was over notice
that they immediately
to supporting Saddam Hussein right I
mean the fighting so-called I mean the
slaughter was over in early March within
about two weeks they were supporting
Saddam Hussein as he destroyed the
Shiites in the south and the Kurds in
the north the reason was that the threat
of popular democracy is far greater than
the threat of Saddam Hussein's power in
fact this was described surprisingly was
described quite accurately in the New
York Times by their chief diplomatic
correspondent that's a technical phrase
that means State Department spokesman in
The New York Times you get your leaks
from the State Department you publish
them under your own name that's called
chief diplomatic correspondent the chief
diplomatic correspondent must have
Thomas Frieden and about mid-april
published a quite a good article I mean
I hate to admit it but it was quite a
good article in which he described US
policy and he said well yes of course
you know we're our moral sensibilities
are you know appalled by Saddam
Hussein's crimes but we recognize that
he's contributing to stability and he
says the United States wants to get what
he called the best of all worlds the
best of all worlds would be an
iron-fisted ruler who would rule Iraq
with an iron fist exactly the way Saddam
Hussein did prior to his one mistake
August 2nd 1990 that would be the best
of all worlds we don't want him you know
because that's sort of embarrassing but
we want to find a duplicate who can do
exactly what he does the trouble is that
said I'm Hussein is such a efficient
killer that he's probably killed off the
possible duplicates but that's
essentially the policy and it's entirely
understandable you know in fact it's a
replica of everything that happens over
and over it's not all that different
acceptance scale from what happened in
Panama a couple months earlier thank you
see
there's everything let's blow we will
open them so Chomsky we are aiming at
the common European market which
apparently is going to be something as
what you described in the United States
are what is your idea about that project
that benefit the part of the people or
what would happen with it I don't think
that one can respond to the question of
a common market in an abstract way it's
kind of like freedom of trade I mean in
principle freedom of trade could be a
good thing it could be designed in a way
which would help people on the other
hand if it's designed by the masters
it'll hurt people and the same is true
of the common market I mean freeing up
in or at least economic interactions
among the European societies could under
certain circumstances be beneficial to
them under other circumstances it will
be a technique for centralizing power
marginalizing the population leveling
cultural differences which means driving
everybody down to the zero level
attacking environmental standards and so
on it simply depends what form it takes
but that depends again on the ongoing
struggle between people who own the
place and everybody else
no no then you see any possibility of
breaking this power of the mind by this
day yeah I think that power is very
fragile it seems to me that the
techniques for controlling people are
extremely weak for example it's been
this mostly cultural uprising since the
1960s which has greatly transformed the
Western world has been terribly
frightening to elites and they've tried
everything to try to stop it and they
have totally failed
you know they've prevented it from
taking any institutional form but they
can't do anything else you know and they
know it and that means that it ought to
be possible for people to overcome the
isolation and the propaganda and these
after all relatively weak means of
control you know television is a form of
control but it's not like living in El
Salvador where people still do succeed
in organizing and fighting even though
they're living against a level of terror
that we can't even imagine so yes it's
possible to do things but of course it
takes effort and energy and commitment
and never is easy it wasn't easy to
overcome slavery nothing's easy every
winter we
every 1,000 for social defense of the
failure of national national is
maquiladora comical interpret are low as
soon as personal eccentric to self-aware
or son less elitist can obtain enough of
Erica volatile finito
well again I don't think there's a
simple answer to that it's different in
different places nationalism is a
double-edged sword they can be extremely
destructive it can be a form of cultural
and other forms of liberation
depends what form it takes and basically
it depends under whose control it is as
always if it's under the control of
dominant elites it'll be murderers if
it's under popular control that can be
quite a positive force this was gracias

[Applause]
your can you hear me yep okay there's a
general thesis about contemporary
history that is widely and proudly
proclaimed in the rich industrial
societies of the West it is that the
that history is converging towards an
ideal of liberal democracy and
FreeMarkets
which are the ultimate realization of
human freedom and another part of the
thesis is that we have just emerged from
a cosmic struggle in which the ideals of
liberal democracy
and classical markets have been
vindicated the reality is somewhat
different in the rich Western societies
at least there's one can make a strong
argument that democracy and the free
markets are probably declining as power
becomes more and more concentrated in
the hands of privileged elites who have
always throughout history regarding
freedom and democracy as a threat a
danger that must be avoided and have
regarded markets as a device to control
and subdue others while requiring that
state power can be used to maintain
their own wealth and privilege and I
think the West is moving more and more
in that direction as for the Cold War it
was real enough but I think it should be
understood and rather different terms
what I'd like to do is say a few words
about these topics
well first democracy we have to decide
what we mean by the word like most of
the terms of political discourse
democracy has two meanings one is its
actual meaning and one is the opposite
the opposite is the one that's used for
the first purposes of ideological
control
in the ordinary meaning ordinary persons
meaning democracy a system is democratic
to the extent the the noted one of the
leading American intellectuals walter
Lippmann who is the leading figure in
American journalism the most respected
commentator on public affairs and a
major political commentator in his own
right he among other things wrote essays
that were called progressive essays and
democratic theory in the 1920s and he
explained lucidly the form that a
democracy should take in a modern
industrial society in a mount in a
modern democracy he said there are two
classes of citizens there are what he
called the responsible men those are the
men of virtue of the founding fathers or
the men of best quality of the 17th
century there are the responsible men
who are a very small group and of course
anyone who presents these ideas is
always part of that group by definition
so there's the responsible men who have
the duty of managing and controlling the
society and then there's the general
public whom he described in his words as
a bewildered heard and the responsible
men have to protect themselves from the
trampling and the rage of the wildered
herd that's a problem these two classes
of citizens have two different functions
he said in a democracy the responsible
men of course have the function of
running the census of democracy and not
a totalitarian state the bewildered herd
also have a function their function is
to be spectators not participants in
action but they're given a certain role
periodically they are allowed to lend
their weight to one or another member of
the responsible class that's what's
called an election after that they're
supposed to go home and be quiet
now this doctrine was extended by
academic leading academic political
scientists and many others and the
general idea was as one of the leading
American political scientists Harold
Lasswell put it one of the founders of
modern political science that we should
not succumb to democratic dogmatism
about men being the best judges of their
own interests they are not we are the
best judges of their interests if we
allow them any opportunity to influence
affairs it'll just be a catastrophe he
also noticed something which in fact you
can trace back centuries that as a
society becomes more free typically
through popular struggle which expands
the range of freedom it becomes harder
to control the Raval by force and
therefore it is necessary to rely more
and more on propaganda in a very free
country like the United States it is
necessary to rely extensively on
propaganda that idea had already been
learned by the highly class conscious
business classes decades earlier come
back to that in a moment

public to play a meaningful role in the
management of public affairs in the
sense of democracy that's used for
doctrinal management in contrast the
society is democratic to the extent that
the business classes rule without any
interference from the Troublesome rabble
I'm going to assume that we mean the
first by democracy and it's in that
sense that it is regarded but as a
threat by elite and has always been and
that it is in fact in my opinion
declining we can trace this problem back
to the first the modern democratic
revolutions which took place in England
in the mid 17th century as the usually
suppressed and subdued rabble
began to organize began to publish
pamphlets began to appeal to other poor
people to take their lives into their
hands
those who described themselves as the
men of best quality were appalled by
this outrage and insisted eloquently
that the rabble must be
subdued they must be obedient and they
must respect their masters and there was
even a reason behind it all kind of a
logic behind it a logic which persists
up till today the logic is that the mass
of the population are stupid and
ignorant they are what was called in
those days beasts in the shape of men to
allow them any power or any influence
would lead directly to disaster and
that's not entirely false to allow the
population any influence would lead to
disaster
for those who concentrate power and
privilege that's the real truth that
lies behind the the doctrinal fantasies
well these ideas were quite were
prevailed were prevalent among the
intellectual classes in England they
continued right to the founding of the
United States the first modern democracy
one may say the founding fathers held
that as they put it those who own the
country ought to government and the
country should be managed by those who
were described as men of virtue good
old-fashioned Roman Republicans
aristocrats who could be counted on to
manage the society properly in the
interests of those who own it and
therefore have the right to government
in the early stages that meant
aristocrats and landowners and so on
later it came to mean the corporate
elite in the industrial society that
emerged in the next century that concept
we there's much time to run through it
but it comes right up to the present
basically unchallenged so in the present
it gets a little bit more sophisticated
and so on but it's basically the same
idea in the twentieth century
