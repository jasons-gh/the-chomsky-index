most of the countries in the world have
normal bilateral relations with Cuba why
is the US virtually alone in its
hostility toward Cuba what explains US
policy let me just report again some
truisms that you would read all over the
front pages of the newspapers if they if
there was any commitment to trying to
tell important and uncontroversial
truths there's nothing i'm going to say
that's in the least controversial but
let me just run let's run through the
history because it's interesting cuba
was the first foreign policy problem for
the United States goes back to the 1820s
this is no new thing back in the 1820s
the nice guys like Thomas Jefferson and
so on who were planning to take over the
hemisphere you know I saw Cuba is the
next place to pick up okay that already
stolen Florida from its inhabitants
claiming to have taken it from the
Spanish but actually from its inhabitant
and their eyes were now kind of moving
toward the west but also on Cuba that
was the next prize well it was a little
problem the British fleet you know there
was a British deterrent just as in the
1960s there was a Soviet deterrent and
in fact the British were the hated enemy
in those days mainly because of their
power they were preventing the United
States from expanding like they
prevented the United States from
conquering Canada a couple of times
which the US has been trying to do since
1775 and may have finally achieved in
the so-called free trade agreement but
but yeah Cuba was sitting right there
you know it's valuable place he couldn't
get there because the British are in the
way john quincy adams i guess it was
suggested that we just be patient he
said it'll drop into our hands like a
ripe fruit by the laws of political
gravitation okay meaning by the time we
get stronger and the British get weaker
will things they'll shift around we'll
be able to take it over okay by the end
of the century that had happened by the
end of the century the British were sort
of being pushed out of the game the
United States was getting more powerful
and during something that is sort of
ludicrously miss titled the
spanish-american war the United States
intervened in Cuba primarily to prevent
it from liberating itself from Spain you
take a close look that's an
interpretation so you want to make sure
you know don't take my word for it but I
think if you look you'll find that what
happened is that the intervention in
Cuba was primarily an effort to make
sure that its liberation from Spain
didn't mean liberation and in fact qubu
is quickly turned into an American
plantation with all kind of restrictions
on its options and you know bought up by
American agribusiness and so on and so
forth when Cuba tried any funny ideas
about moving towards independence it was
smashed down for example Franklin
Roosevelt is famous for the good
neighbor policy we don't intervene
anymore in the affairs of our neighbors
well take a look at 1934 when Cuba made
the mistake of trying to elect a sort of
I guess moderate social democratic more
or less independent ideas as president
that's going too far okay so out the and
that's how it continues up through 1959
okay 1959 Castro comes along there was a
little bit of toying with the question
of whether we can in court maintain the
new Cuba in our system or not and this
is not a new policy issue remember it's
back the 1820s hasn't changed much
within a couple of months it was decided
that Chester's too big for his britches
there's no Russians incidentally he's
anti-communist you know how can his
jailing members of the Communist Party
there was no question of the Russians or
the communists or any of this kind of
stuff by late nineteen fifty-nine us
planes are already bombing Cuba from
Florida basis the State Department
claims they didn't know about it yeah
sure okay but I mean try try that if say
Cuban planes mom the United States you
know and say well okay the Cubans didn't
know about
okay so but it was happened by in March
1960 the Eisenhower administration made
a formal decisions now it was secret but
now it's be classified so you can find
out about it they made the formal
decision to overthrow the Cuban
government and take it over that's March
1960 remember no Cold War no Russians no
communists just independent qubit from
that point on March 1960 up until today
Cuba has been subjected to extensive
international terrorism economic
strangulation without an end and it's
not trivial stuff just to give you one
small example this one comes from an
absolutely impeccable source Raymond
guard Huff who's very conservative and
respected historian right inside the CIA
and the intelligence apparatus now
writes historical work on all the stuff
take a look at his books on reflections
on the missile crisis which is writing
sort of partially from the inside partly
from as a historian why the little item
in there somewhere we're at the peak of
the missile crisis you know before it
you know when it had sort of
theoretically been solved but it would
still was not over so like the missiles
were still there at the peak of the
missile crisis one of the operate when
the Mongoose teams these terrorists
teams that the Kennedy had sent into
Cuba to smashed the place up one of them
which was apparently acting out of
control at the time like there's no
evidence that Kennedy had ordered it to
do this but so maybe was on its own but
one of them blew up a petrochemical
plant in Cuba which according to him he
said he doesn't verify it but he says
it's alleged and he apparently takes it
seriously the 400 workers were killed
well suppose Cuba blew up a factory in
the United States and 400 people were
killed I think it might make the
newspaper in fact they probably be new
tweed newcomb you know okay but this is
us and this is incidentally one tiny
footnote to a long history of terrorism
and this was right at the peak of the
missile crisis when I suffer all I know
cube had its fingers on the missiles
I don't know that but anyway somebody
did okay now try just for those of you
who want to know about why people
believe what they do just just do a
little check and find out how much
information you can find that about this
okay I mean I've told you that I'll save
the trouble this is it I've repeated it
in probably 20 times and books that
nobody would dream of looking at it
reviewing and so on but that's one
little item and then it goes on to
poisoning crops and livestock and
shooting down fishing boats and strafing
hotels and you know blowing up airplanes
and all sorts of things meanwhile the
economic strangulation goes on okay
permanently
