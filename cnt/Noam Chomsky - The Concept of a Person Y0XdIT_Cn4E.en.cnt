now we think and we are sure that Robert
or a Turing machine that proves there
really does not understand theorems so
that will be more away well how do we
know that I mean I really but it seems
to me I agree for trivial reasons
because understanding theorems is a
property of people
so therefore yeah the Turing machine
doesn't understand programs but you know
it's true but kind of yeah for exactly
the consigns reasons and yes
understanding Chinese would do the same
in fact if somebody asked there's a
robot identify a straight line I would
say no identifying straight line some of
these people who there's a robot take a
walk
let's say I mean there are robots that
move things that look like legs and go
somewhere suppose somebody said is the
robot taking a walk it's just a stupid
question
yeah I mean taking a walk is something
that people do if you want to extend the
metaphor to robots okay
it's exactly as stupid as the question
whether airplanes really fly I mean
nobody would waste time on that no and
why should you waste time on this it's
the same kind of question if you push
the simulation to the extreme and then
so suppose you get a human and then just
a replication of that human it still
doesn't follow that you have explained
anything and it might be the case that
the way you copy to make a copy of a
human supposes that you understand it
understand how how it works what I mean
it's like you were to ask Frankenstein
how a human works I mean it's like in a
way it's like if you try to synthesize a
molecule okay you can do it
the usual way first understand the
destruction structure then solve the
practical problem but if you do it just
by chance or you don't you know how how
you get it it mean then you haven't you
haven't explained it well see I think
there's some issues that have to be
sorted out here notions like molecule
and notions like person are radically
different
now there's a whole philosophical
literature about persons that has to do
with things like duplicating them so
that this is an effort to explore our
intuitive concept of a person and our
intuitive concept of a person is
extremely weird so if you take the
science fiction type stories if a person
is you know if you look at you know some
crazy science fiction movie and you get
people teletransported right they're you
know they're dropped from the spaceship
the earth instantaneous at the speed of
light and the way it's done is you
decode the person's genetic and you know
the instructions in the cells so you've
got a coding of the person and then you
send it at the speed of light to some
other place where the person's instantly
reconstituted well question has the PERT
is it the same person okay well most
people seem to think it is that is like
when kids watch these programs they say
yeah the person got teletransported but
then of course come the further
questions the obvious ones suppose that
when you tell a transport the person you
leave the original okay you know
eliminate it you leave it which is the
person and if the two are identical is
it moral to destroy one of them and if
so which one you know well you get into
those questions now and you go on and on
and it's attack of you pursue it what
they discover is that our concept of a
person is an extremely weird concept but
that's true of our concept of everything
our concept of a chair is an extremely
weird concept if you look at it in fact
the concepts of human language are very
strange
I'll talk about this if there's time
either later today or tomorrow but the
concepts of human language are extremely
strange concept not human human thought
are extremely strange concepts and
you've got to eliminate them all if you
want to do science they're just not
appropriate for science so you don't
care any I mean now molecule there was a
stage when it was sort of like a human
concept but as science marches on it
divests molecule of all intuitive
properties so you can ask questions
about identity of molecules for example
if a quantum physicist tells you that
every two electrons anywhere in the
universe are identical ok even if one of
them's here and one of them is on Alpha
Centauri well ok that means something in
quantum physics doesn't mean anything in
English you know but you create concepts
which have their own properties and then
you can raise questions about is this
identical with that or you know and you
can raise the kind of questions that
you've described I mean have you
understood something if you show how the
object like a molecule is constructed
you can't really ask that about persons
because persons aren't really objects I
mean we were what our concept of a
person is something that has a kind of
psychic persistence to it there's no
object in the universe no physical
object in the universe could have the
property that it's over here now and at
the speed of light it's somewhere else
you know it's an insulator that's not a
property of a physical object but it is
a property of our concept of person in
fact they're even simpler things about
our concept of person that are strange
the your body undergoes a constant
change in its physical substance like
every seven years or so I guess all the
protoplasm is replaced by something else
okay
well you know if you were looking at the
physical objects would just be a
different physical object if you're
looking at it from the point of view of
the consumed and concept person it's the
same person and you look you know you
look totally different I mean you meet
somebody haven't seen for 25 years they
look
different I mean all kind of physical
changes take place is it the same object
well you know you can it and you when
you're using human concepts yes it's the
same person because the criteria for
individuating persons are the kind of
criteria that you couldn't possibly use
in a naturalistic inquiry into the world
I mean physics isn't going to or biology
is not going to want to have a concept
that has these crazy properties so
they're gonna have other concepts which
they make up to serve the purposes of
theoretical understanding human concepts
are you know a very limited utility for
theoretical understanding it'll carry a
very far because I got too many weird
properties like psychic persistence
whatever that means which we sort of
know intuitively and you can do thought
experiments which people tend to agree
although that they get to be somewhere
they lose their intuitions like the
teletransportation where you leave the
copy behind that's a point where most
people just lose their intuitions they
don't know whether it's the same person
or not so we have these very strange
concepts with other funny properties and
those are ok for us you know that's why
we get along in the world but they're no
good for science and therefore the to
try to draw analogies between
constructing a person and constructing a
molecule don't make much sense because
there's no notion of constructing a
person in the Natural Sciences since the
concept person can't exist in the
Natural Sciences has too many crazy
properties
