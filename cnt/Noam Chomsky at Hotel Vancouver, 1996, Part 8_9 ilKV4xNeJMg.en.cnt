such that the major corporations could
never do it never thought of doing it
well by the late 80s they started
thinking of doing it and the first big
manufacturing corporation big
manufacturing corporation to do it was
caterpillar that was part of a major
union-busting strategy and right at the
center of the heartland of working-class
America at the caterer llinois big
working-class town three major unions
you know biggest unions and there was a
big corporate attack on them three
transnationals two one British one
Japanese and one caterpillar a US base
and they just want to destroy the
union's very openly they used the huge
profits they used their excess capacity
overseas like caterpillar explained its
business strategy at least in the
business press they said that they're
going to force they're going to coerce
workers to capitulate because they've
used their enormous profits to build
excess capacity overseas like in Brazil
ones go on which allows them to fill
their international markets even if they
don't produce here plus permanent
replacement workers here and you know a
lot it's huge growth and temporary
workers you know you know no benefits
all that kind of stuff
well these weapon this got I mean
actually the United States was actually
censured by the International Labour
Organization which is extremely rare
honor they never tapped the wrists of
their rich funders but it got to the
point that the US was actually censured
by the ILO for using permanent
replacement workers which by up in the
caterpillar case with violates all
international labor standards and affect
us this urge to sort of accept
international labor standards which it
doesn't all right this was outright
conspiracy I mean the state federal
government simply authorized the use of
illegal methods some of them flatly
illegal methods to attack and destroy
and undermine unions well they couldn't
gotten away with that earlier
incidentally here's another case where
the left simply abandoned the terrain
to cater workers we're going around the
pic of course they weren't covered in
the press you know obviously you don't
expect the corporate media to cover this
stuff but the cater workers were really
fight they all lost and suddenly they
got smashed and they all it was a total
disaster all threes
and a big part of the reason for that
was that the Patan people who ought to
be the left just didn't give a damn like
in Boston when daily workers came to try
to organize some support we had a
meeting for them which ought to have
been this many people it's in the room
where this many people show up for
anything there were 75 people it's the
first time I've talked at it I talk a
lot at those meetings on every
imaginable topic this is the first time
in about 20 years everything the place
almost filled why well just bunch of you
know white males who cares about them
working people from Decatur Illinois who
are trying to preserve and restore and
ultimately rebuild the American labor
movement okay those are the kind of guys
are going to be out in the malicious
pretty soon or listening to Pat Buchanan
and I think we can partly blame
ourselves for that not in significantly
but the point is there were powerful
weapons and they're being used all over
the world I'm the United States and
Britain first they were used to destroy
the weaker working classes like in Latin
America Latin America you know Latin
America pre-organized
and powerful working classes but they're
much weaker societies so they were
smashed by structural adjustment and so
on they're by now really devastated
throughout the continent in the
industrial world it's a tougher nut to
crack and it started with the United
States and England the United States
anyone our worst in this respect but the
Thatcher Reagan period a big attack on
working people also on families on
children you know it's across the board
and Europe and Japan are not are still
kind of holding on kind of a sword in
between I mean somewhere between the
United States and the
the anglo-american model in the European
Japanese model but in a more integrated
global economy it's going to be awful
hard for anybody to hold out unless
there is substantial popular resistance
because most of it
I mean what's actually happening is most
of the world is being turned into a kind
of third-world you can see this is
pretty dramatic in places like the
United States and England less so and
continental Europe but unless there's
substantial resistance to this that's
pretty much what's gonna happen so
layoffs is a piece of it but it's a much
bigger hit picture and I don't think
that the kind of talk that's coming out
of Washington even relates to this issue
I mean asking corporations to be nicer
you know that's like I'm sure you know
in fact there there was background like
in the Kennedy years around that period
there was a lot of talk about how
corporations had changed I remember one
colleague of mine was in fact the head
of the Institute for Advanced Studies
and then was in the Kennedy
administration at MIT there's an
economist wrote a paper called the
soulful corporation that is the
corporations it becomes soulful you know
they used to be kind of money-grubbing
and so on but now they're it's just
ridiculous I mean if any corporation
here Milton Friedman and those guys are
absolutely right
if a corporation tried to be anything
but you know really monsters they would
it would be basically illegal they would
not be fulfilling their responsibilities
to their shareholders and furthermore
they would be eliminated they'd be cut
out of the market because somebody else
wouldn't be soulful and would be making
more money this is institutional you
know it has nothing to do with anybody
being nice these are institutional
faction as long as I mean it's like
trying to ask you know the some
totalitarian state to be more nice to
its people well you know it doesn't make
sense what you do with the totalitarian
state is eliminated but you don't ask it
to be nicer to people and these are
totalitarian systems these
that corporation is a totalitarian
system and by now they're very big ones
you know they're huge command economies
which are internally model I mean
they're just the you know they have it's
pretty much the structure with the
tellurian state they unify the judicial
legislative and executive functions and
a top unaccountable control system the
only accountability is to investors
which means other you know banks
you know big investment firms and so on
and public accountability is limited to
the regulatory system which of course
they're trying to destroy so it's
essentially a takeover of power by Big
totalitarian institutions which
incidentally their rates come their
roots are not very - about the same as
the other contemporary forms of
totalitarianism Bolshevism and theis ism
they all come out of late 19th century
you know vaguely Hegelian ideas about
organic entities having rights above
individuals and so on and so forth
there's actually pretty good scholarly
work on on this on the origin of 20th
century corporations got their current
power mostly in the early part of the
century you know they're not like sort
of graven in stone the rights of
immortal persons with things like free
speech and you know all that kind of
stuff that's early 20th century and it
was not granted by legislation either it
was done mostly by courts and lawyers
and so on and it's a form of
totalitarianism and you don't ask it to
be more soulful anymore now just on that
any more soulful it's these are
institutional structures they behave the
way they do you have to eliminate it and
so these were truisms in the
working-class movement not very long ago
by now they sound really weird but
that's the sign of the of the victory of
power
propaganda systems corporate propaganda
system is simply driven out of people's
heads what used to be everybody's
understanding in fact you go back to the
early century ago in the AFL you know
which is not particularly radical these
are the things people are talking about
the national meetings you know let's get
rid of all these things and working
people working people or to own the
mills and they and run them there they
build them they work in them they run
them that was one of the big issues in
the homestead it's better it's great
back in 1892 you know well you know if
it's been beaten out of people's heads
that's our problem we were to get it
back in people says it's not very
strange sort of natural and automatic
just like opposition in any other form
of totalitarianism and playing games
about me they should be nicer to people
that doesn't mean anything
yeah sure if you can sort of impose by
force if you can use federal say OSHA if
he can impose health and safety
standards on them fine that's better
than not having those standards but
there should be no illusions
that's like forcing its appellate Arian
state because of some countervailing
force to act nice okay maybe you can do
it but that's not the answer okay yeah I
consider myself to be a Machiavellian
excuse me your use of the word
totalitarian is a poo term and I'm not
afraid it is one of that's fine to catch
that with a descriptive term Martin
kitchen who wrote a book on fascism is
calls it a boo term who mark
