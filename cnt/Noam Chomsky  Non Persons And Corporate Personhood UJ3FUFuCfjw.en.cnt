read the Fifth Amendment for example it
says that no person shall be deprived of
rights without due process of the law
but the founding fathers didn't mean
person when they said person so it
obviously didn't include Native
Americans they do anything you like to
them that didn't include slaves didn't
include women I mean up until the mid
20th century the women were mostly
property on to the law in effect until
the 1970s women didn't even have a
guaranteed legal right to serve on
juries a woman was the property of her
father or her husband so there they
weren't persons and this goes right up
to the present so if you come up to the
present day take a look Supreme Court
rulings the concept person has been both
expanded and narrowed its been expanded
to include legal fictions corporations
