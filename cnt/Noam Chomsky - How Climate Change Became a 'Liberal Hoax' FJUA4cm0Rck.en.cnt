the Chamber of Commerce the main
business lobby the American petroleum
industry other business lobbies have
publicly proclaimed in fact with
enthusiasm that they are carrying out a
campaign to try to convince the
population that global warming is the
rule hoax and it's it's succeeded
unfortunately the latest polls I've seen
show maybe a third of the population
believes in anthropogenic global warming
the media contribute in their own way so
for example when the New York Times it
runs a front-page article on what
meteorologists think about global
warming namely they don't believe it
meteorologists are pretty faces who read
scripts telling you if it's gonna rain
tomorrow what do they have to say any
more than your barber but that's
presented as if it's a significant
contribution to the discussion the same
when they you know in fav it you know in
pursuit of the fabled objectivity
present the two sides one side is
ninety-eight percent of scientists who
know anything
the other is side is a Senator Inhofe
and a couple of stragglers and that's
the two sides and you're supposed people
are supposed to make a choice between
them they leave out a third side which
is the substantial number of climate
scientists who believe that the
consensus predictions are much too
optimistic including some of the leading
scientists right here who've recently
run what they call the most extensive
modeling ever done that concludes that
it's far worse than anticipated at their
own results are an understatement
because they don't take into account
such things as effects of methane after
permafrost disappears and so on so
that's the debate that people are
presented with and it's not surprising
that the effort to manufacture consent
to the
that doesn't mean anything is pretty
successful
what's rather interesting about this and
tells you something about the nature of
our society is that those same CEOs and
managers who are trying to convince the
public that it's a liberal hoax know
perfectly well that it's extremely
dangerous they have the same beliefs
that you and I have but so they're
they're caught in a kind of an
institutional contradiction as leaders
of major corporations they have an
institutional role that is to maximize
short-term profit and if they don't do
that they're out and someone else is in
who does do it so it's them it's
basically institutionally speaking it's
not a choice that's going to happen in
the major institutions so they may know
that they're mortgaging the future of
their grandchildren that in fact may be
everything that will be destroyed but
they're caught in a trap of
institutional structure that's what
happens in market systems financial
crisis is small example of the same
thing you may know that you're what
you're doing is carry systemic risk but
you can't calculate that into your
transactions or you're not fulfilling
your role and somebody else replaces you
in fact in the United States it's
actually a legal obligation to do that
for corporate executives so and that's a
very serious problem it means that we're
marching over the cliff and doing it for
institutional reasons that are pretty
hard to dismantle there's other factors
like the the anger and fear and
hostility in the country about
everything carries over to this so if
you look at polls
everyone hates Congress they hate the
Democrats they hate the Republicans even
more they hate big business they hate
banks and they distrust scientists so
why should we believe what these
pointy-headed elitists are telling us we
don't trust anything else we don't trust
them
all of this combines the latest election
a couple of days ago as a you could
almost interpret it as a kind of a death
knell for the species there was an
article in Bloomberg Businessweek you
know not a radical rag exactly they're
running through the new Republican
Republicans coming to Congress and they
are worried about them one of the
reasons is because there are global
warming deniers almost all that means
the powerful House committees are like
science and technology and so on are
going to in the hands of people who
think there's nothing to it or at least
claim that they think that what they
actually think is another story in fact
one of them was quoted as saying can't
be a problem because God will take care
of it now you know if this was happening
in some small country and you know maybe
I don't know what
Minako or something wouldn't matter much
but when it's happening in the richest
most powerful country in the world it's
a it's a danger to the survival of the
species nobody else is going to do very
much if the United States doesn't do a
lot not just some but take the lead so
we're essentially saying let's kiss each
other goodbye there are plenty of
examples of mutual support and
cooperation in every aspect of life in
fact one of the leading components of it
right at that time in the 30s was labor
unions
I mean labor unions are based on the
concept of solidarity we're all in it
together and it's in theory
international solidarity that's why
they're called internationals well you
know the extent to which they live up to
that aspiration you could debate but
it's not zero by any means when people
go out on strike they're suffering but
for each other and working together for
each other for the community that can
mean a lot and in fact in countries like
very much like ours where the labor
movement is strong they are not only
work for each other but for the
community so that's basically why Canada
has
a national healthcare system instead of
the one that we have which is completely
dysfunctional it's a global scandal you
know twice the per capita costs of other
industrial countries and some of the
poorest outputs outcomes why do they
have it in Canada and not here well you
look back they in both countries back in
the 50s the labor movement was actively
pressing for health care but in
different ways in Canada the labor
movement was pressing for health care
for everybody
and that was a leading edge of powerful
popular movement which finally brought
them some form of national health care a
functional form in the United States the
unions were working for decent health
care for themselves so United Auto
Workers got contracts in which they gave
away a lot but they did get pretty
decent health care in fact one of the
reason that's one of the reasons why in
our society a very business run
unusually business run society there has
been bitter hostility to labor as a we
have a brutal labor history as compared
with other comparable societies and
there's major campaigns just
overwhelmingly overwhelming campaigns
after the the rise of labor movement
again in the 30s to try to destroy it
and that's a long way
in fact you now have the some see it as
paradoxical situation that labor labor
unions have turned against Obama in the
January election in Massachusetts which
in which for Ted Kennedy's
old seat elected a Republican it was
carefully analyzed the main reason for
the victory the Republican was that
Obama's base just disappeared so voting
in the democratic areas downtown
working-class areas was quite low voting
in the affluent suburbs was quite high
they want even more not just you know
the worst inequality in American history
but we want
so they voted Republican but what was
particularly interesting was the Union
vote
not many people loaded but those who did
voted Republican they voted to shoot
themselves in the foot and that was
analyzed and the reason was anger that
obama had given away everything they
fought for he gave away a public option
you know everything just gave it away
didn't have to public was strongly in
favor of it but one thing he insisted on
taxing their health plans it's the one
thing you wouldn't give up now these
health plans which are not which they
called Cadillac health plans meeting
Chevrolet health plans they were fairly
decent but unions had fought for years
to get them and had given up a lot but
unions in other countries obtained in
order to get health care now here comes
Obama the man they worked for and he's
saying well I'm giving away everything
you want but I'm going to tax your
health plans so they were very angry
naturally and going back to the original
point yes there's plenty of basis for
solidarity but it takes organization it
takes education and it can be it had
better be achieved or we're not going to
our grandchildren won't be talking about
these things but is it possible and this
is for our conversation with Dimitri who
was talking about the Russian collapse
is it possible we'd be better off to
actually collapse and rebuild because no
yeah if the United States collapse the
world goes with it
it's just too rich and powerful and I
hate to think what the human cost of it
would be anyway so nothing affected
didn't come out of the collapse I mean
it's sort of yes the economy is growing
again there are extra millions of people
dying has happened in the 90s when the
economy did collapse but it's a it's a
unsustainable resource based economy
which is hardly a model for anyone it's
a
certainly we don't do is to turn into
that that's the worst possible thing so
what has to be done here is pretty clear
but it's going to take work you're
struggling against a highly organized
very class conscious business community
constantly fighting a bitter class war
they know what they want there's
institutional structures that are hard
to break out of even if individuals may
want to and there's a very atomized
disorganized angry frightened public
that's not a good mix I remember you
were also talking about how the
petroleum companies are looking at what
the health care industry did to sort of
sway that's what that's what they say
these same statements by say the Chamber
of Commerce and others say well look up
look how they said that they took as a
model they said they would take as a
model the effectiveness of the insurance
industry in beating back any reasonable
form of healthcare of course they had
cooperation the Democrats were giving it
away as fast as they were taking it in
fact in August 2009 even before the big
debates a business week had a an issue
where the front page was something about
insurance companies in gloating over
victory or something they already had
basically won Obama had given away first
of all national it's called here
single-payer some kind of national
health care which it was substantive
area substantial support for in fact
majority support for decades gave that
away didn't even talk about it
in fact the representatives of it
weren't allowed into the Senate
committee hearings the another highly
dysfunctional feature of the US
healthcare system is drug prices much
higher than elsewhere and one reason is
this is probably the only country in the
world where the government is not
allowed by law to negotiate drug prices
well about eighty-five percent of the
populations opposed to that Obama gave
it away without even
discussion so that was gone and the
health care reform is probably better
than the system that was there before
but it's pretty bad and it's all that's
interesting it that the the big clamor
about the budget which in deficit which
I think it's completely misplaced the
put that aside if you take it seriously
if the United States had a health care
system like other industrial countries
there would not be a deficit and pretty
soon they'd probably be a surplus but
that isn't even discussed by the deficit
Commission that Obama picked which
consists of two deficit hawks just to
make sure that it works the way the
insurance companies the financial
industry will want you know these are
pretty serious problems and without any
you know there are individuals in
Congress who are willing to stand up for
something better
but there's nothing really organized I
mean we now have a political system
where what are called the Democrats are
essentially what used to be called
moderate Republicans and the Republicans
are off the map they don't even try to
be a political party just trying to make
the country on governor will give away
as much as you can to the rich in fact
what's happening in Washington now is
surreal
I mean they're saying straight out this
country we're not gonna let this country
run unless you enrich the millionaires
and billionaires if you do that maybe
we'll let the country run if there's an
effort to give unemployment insurance to
the millions of people who are really
suffering sorry we can't do that we have
to enrich the millionaires this is
almost on the front pages and the
country is so kind of in a smooth of
such irrationality and anger that they
can get away with it is that been
manufactured that anger
the human value the well partly but it's
partly just real I mean is objective
basis for it and if respective the the
economies shan't change dramatically in
the last 35 years there's been a major
process of conscious process of
financialization of the economy and the
kind of exporting of productive industry
that's very conscious and this is not
particularly obscure why if I about that
time it was possible to make more profit
in shenanigans of money manipulation
than in doing anything productive and in
market societies and people with capital
go for what's profitable that one car
Laird that was that the political
pressure just dismantled the regulatory
apparatus with the support of economists
incidentally working with economic
theories that I mean it's astonishing
that they're not ashamed of themselves
but anyway that's what happened one
consequence of this one aspect of it is
that for roughly thirty years a little
over that for the majority of the
population wages have real wages of
pretty close to stagnated little growth
but not much that's most of the
population families get by with two
husband and wife working we have very
limited support systems as compared with
other country so that means families are
in trouble and that shows up in all kind
of ways people are you can keep your
income up by asset inflation you know
just and by debt the asset inflation of
course can't last so you have repeated
bubbles of collapsing the last one was
an eight trillion dollar housing bubble
which amazingly almost no economists
could see I mean the trendline and
housing prices is going way beyond a
hundred year record there was no reason
for it was obviously going to burst
that's ever that's the assets of most
people
they're in trouble people are in deep
trouble you know not trouble like
Central Africa but that's not the way
you evaluate your circumstances you ask
how would I what should I be able to
have in a rich country like this so
people and they also see us ostentatious
wealth it's quite striking that the for
a while after the financial collapse the
super-rich were kind of playing it cool
you know so they weren't not to try to
not be too ostentatious doesn't look
nice but now it's over the New York
Times a couple days ago had a front page
article saying describing exactly this
phenomenon you know back to great
parties at a gala events showing off how
rich rich we are another article in the
same issue said corporate profits of
broken records and banks have so much
money they know what to do with it well
you know people may not know the details
but they can see this and they can see
what's happening in their own lives in
manufacturing industry unemployment's
about at the rate of the Great
Depression and much I'm an old I'm old
enough to remember that and it was bad
but there was a kind of hopefulness I
know my relatives are mostly unemployed
workers but they were not desperate they
were poor but not desperate because it
looked like something could happen we
could do things together there's a
better future my seamstress ants who
were unemployed were in the garment
workers union and they got some benefits
from that and they also felt that also
some educational programs cultural
programs they felt that we can get out
of this working together people don't
feel that now those manufacturing jobs
are not coming back not unless we have
quite a different social order here
there's plenty of need for them in fact
what's happening in this respect is
sometimes almost surreal like for
example the government effectively owned
most of the auto industry for a while
and the policies they were pursuing was
closing down flats just like GM had been
doing
at the same moment the Obama's
Transportation Secretary was in Europe
traveling around in Spain trying to get
contracts using stimulus money for
Spanish factories to produce high-speed
transport for the United States which we
desperately need as anyone has taken a
train here knows that's these things can
be produced very well in Michigan and
Indiana may be not profitable for the
bankers but certainly good for the
workforce in the communities but that
wasn't even considered an option I mean
green technology which is supposed to be
the expanding area go to China they go
to Spain go to Germany I mean investors
in the United States last figures I saw
are investing I think about twice as
much in China as they are in the United
States and Europe combined and in
Germany Spain France there's substantial
and China presumably be the leader and
if it isn't already in wind and solar
technology that cannot be done here sure
can in fact a lot of the high technology
the innovations the ideas come from here
but they're produced there you know
China is kind of like an assembly plant
which that were you the surrounding
industrial area in the United States
assemble the products that come back
here that we buy but it could be
produced here that takes different
social policies and as long as policies
in the hands of financial institutions
and that corporate production
corporations like say General Electric
GM which are themselves financial
institutions a lot of their business you
know they make plenty of money if it's
done somewhere else
