hi I'm Laura Flanders and I'm here with
Noam Chomsky professor emeritus here at
MIT in philosophy and linguistics author
of countless books most recently well
there's a collection of columns making
the future and a new open pamphlet
called occupy no let's start with big
picture
how would you characterize this moment
historically speaking well there is a
depending on how you look at it either a
crisis or return to the norm of
stagnation there's two views of this one
view is the norma stagnation
occasionally you get out of it and the
other is the norm is growth and
occasionally you get into stagnation so
you can debate that but anyway it's a
period of pretty close to global
stagnation striking shift from
production to financialization the
United States and Europe or committing
suicide in different ways but both doing
it in Europe its austerity in the midst
of recession which is guaranteed to be a
disaster and is one there's some
resistance to that now in the United
States it's offshoring of production and
financialization and
getting rid of the superfluous
population by incarceration things like
that and there seems to be no easy way
out of this how about politically how
would you characterize where we're at
politically there's again there are
differences in in Europe there's a
dangerous growth of ultra-nationalist
xenophobic movements which is pretty
threatening especially anyone who
remembers the history of Europe and
there's an attack on the wealth on the
remnants of the welfare state in fact
it's pretty hard to interpret the
austerity in the midst of recession
policies other than as an attack on the
social contract in fact some of the
leaders come out and pretty much say it
in the United States it's first of all
the electoral system has been
totally shredded for a long time it's
been pretty much run by private
concentrated spending but now it's kind
of like over the top that the Republican
Party has for some years pretty much
abandoned any pretense of being a
traditional political party it's a kind
of lockstep obedience to very rich super
rich corporate sector they can't get
votes that way so they've had to
mobilize a different constituency which
has always been there through American
history but never rarely was mobilized
politically they they call it the
religious right but it's basically the
religious extreme religious population
United States is off the spectrum on in
religious commitment and anti
anti-abortion opposed to women's rights
so they've had to appeal to that and to
the nativist population the people who
were frightened so frightened country
and you know it's increasing now by the
recognition that the white population is
going to be a minority pretty soon so
they've taken our country from us and
this that's the Republicans there are no
more moderate Republicans there now the
centrist Democrats because the Democrats
are drifting to the right right after
them the Democrats have pretty much
given up on the white working-class they
don't even try that would require
commitment economic issues and it's not
their concern do you think comparisons
between occupy and the Arab Spring are
misplaced useful one point of similarity
is they're both responses to the toll
taken by the neoliberal programs so in
Egypt the neoliberal programs have meant
statistical growth like right before the
Arab Spring Egypt was a kind of poster
child of the World Bank and the IMF that
marvelous economic management great
reforms the only problem is that for
most of the population it was they kind
of look up below in the solar plexus the
wages going down
benefits being eliminated you know
subsidized food going and meanwhile high
concentration of wealth and a huge
amount of corruption well okay we have
an act kind of an analogue to that here
it kind of stimulated the Occupy
movement there's interaction in the
media coverage of the Occupy movement
there was a tremendous confusion between
those who talked about the need for
demands and those who talked about
anarchism and the question of
organization as if these were all kind
of contradictory that you couldn't be
both anarchistic and have organization
can you clarify some of this for us is
there a contradiction between anarchism
and organization no no you know
mannerism means all sorts of things to
different people but actually want these
media confusion I think has a basis
because there really are two different
strands in the Occupy movement and both
important but different one is sort of
policy oriented
so what policy goals do you want to
achieve you know regulate the banks get
money out of elections minimum raising
them wage over
environmental issues all Paula - whole
variety of policy issues all very
important and the Occupy movement made a
difference it shifted the not only
discourse but even to some extent action
on these issues the other part is just
creating communities that's something
extremely important in a country like
this which is very atomized have people
don't talk to each other you know you're
alone with your television set or
internet or whatever it is why is that
so important because you can't have a
functioning democracy without what
sociologists call secondary
organizations places where people can
get together or plan
talk develop ideas you know you don't do
it alone the Occupy movement did create
spontaneously communities
that taught people something you can be
in a supportive community of mutual aid
and cooperation and you can have an open
space for democratic discussion and
participation communities like that are
really important and that's I think the
maybe what's causing the media confusion
because it's both do you think that's
why the media found it so important to
the same media that disregard violence
against women and violence against
people of color all the time
found it so important to emphasize
stories of violence rape and violence
yeah that's standard I mean every
popular movement that they want to
denigrate does you pick those things
that's what they're looking for let's
try to show that it's silly and
insignificant and violent if possible to
pay attention to the actual core of the
movement that would be pretty hard dr.
king called it the Beloved Community
yeah and a community of real
participation and that always gets
smashed so takes a Martin Luther King I
mean when you listen to the speeches on
Martin Luther King Day it's all about I
have a dream and so on but he had
another dream the one that he presented
and his talk his last talk and Memphis
just before he was assassinated and
which he said something about how he's
like Moses you know you can see the
Promised Land but we're not going to get
there and the promised land was policies
and developments which would deal with
the poverty and repression and not race
but in fact he was organizing the Poor
People's Movement well right after that
right after the assassination
that wasn't March he was going to lead
it Coretta King led it and they had a
ten-city
resurrection park and the the security
forces were called in by the liberal
Congress this is the most liberal
Congress
memory they broken in the middle of the
night - smashed up a resurrection city
and drove them out of the city that's
the way you deal with popular movements
that are threatening thinking of Memphis
dr. King was there in support of
striking sanitation workers whose famous
slogan was I am a man and I'd love you
your thoughts on the future of the labor
movement private sector unionization is
down to practically 7% meanwhile the
public sector unions have sustained
themselves they've been under attack but
they've kind of sustained themselves the
last two or three years when a sharp
attack on public sector unions which
Obama has participated in in fact so
when you freeze salaries of federal
workers
that's equivalent to taxing public
service people denying the right to
collective bargaining at risk in
Wisconsin and a whole range of attacks
because that's the part of the labor
movement which was protected by the by
the legal system was kind of a residue
of the New Deal and Great Society and so
on it's a constant battle right through
American history the history of every
other country - but the United States
happens have an unusually violent labor
history I mean hundreds of workers were
getting killed here for organizing and
so on at a time when I was just unheard
of in Europe Australia today there are
so many targets to choose from and dr.
King's day or in the 30s it was the
targets were labor rights or civil
rights judiciary the courts Congress
today where's the number one target of
power in your sense is in your view is
it corporations we should be going after
is it Congress is it the Pentagon is it
the media the media are corporations
it's the concentrations of private power
which have an enormous
not total control but enormous influence
over Congress and the White House in
fact that's increasing sharply with the
sharp concentration of private power the
escalating cost of elections and so on
well for example as we're speaking there
shareholder actions happening in San
Francisco in Detroit are those good
targets they're okay but remember you
know there's no economic principle that
says that management should be
responsive to shareholders in fact you
can read and you know texts of business
economics that well you could just as
well have a system in which the
management is responsible to
stakeholders you know its stakeholders
meaning workers and community why not
why shouldn't they be responsible of
course this presupposes that there
oughta be management but that's another
question
Why should there be management why not
have the stakeholders run the industry
well this is a phenomenon that's growing
I'm following it I know that you are
Carl Paribas has written about it worker
coops appearing across Ohio Pennsylvania
right here where we are now one question
that I hear is will change come from
changing ownership even to worker
ownership if you don't change the profit
paradigm could you maintain the same
kind of exploitative profit system under
worker ownership it's a little bit like
asking whether shareholder voting is a
good idea yeah it's a step is the
Buffett Rule a good idea you know a
small step I mean worker ownership
within a state capitalist market semi
market system is better than private
ownership but it has inherent problems
I mean markets have well-known inherent
inefficiencies this is part of markets
they're very destructive I mean the
obvious one is that a in a market system
a really functioning one whoever's
making the decisions that doesn't pay
attention to we're called externalities
effects on others so say I sell you a
car
we where our eyes are open we'll make a
good deal for ourselves but we're not
asking Westmont how it's gonna affect
her and it will will be more congestion
more gas price will go up environmental
effects and so on and that multiplies
over the whole population well that's
pretty serious
that takes a financial crisis ever since
New Deal regulation was essentially
dismantled
they've been regular financial crises
and one of the fundamental reasons it's
understood is the fact that there's a
CEO of Goldman Sachs or Citigroup or
whatever does not pay attention to
what's called systemic risk so maybe you
make a risky investment transaction and
you cover your own potential losses but
you don't take into account the fact
that if it crashes it may crash the
system which is what a financial crash
is so and the much more serious case of
this is the fact is environmental
effects now there in the case of
financial institutions when they crash
you can come the taxpayer comes to the
rescue but if you destroy the
environment nobody's going to come to
the rescue
so it sounds like you'd support things
like the Cleveland model where the
ownership of the company is actually
held by a NGO representing the community
as well as workers that's a step forward
but it also has to go beyond that to
dismantle the system of production for
profit rather than production for use
and that means you know dismantling at
least large parts of market systems and
take the most advanced case Mondragon it
it's worker-owned it's it's not worker
managed actually although the management
does come from the workforce often they
exploit workers and some South America
you know they they do things that are
harmful to the societies old and so on
and have no choice I mean if you're in a
system where you must make profit in
order to survive you're compelled
ignore negative externalities effect on
others that's only one example the
market systems also have a very bad just
kind of psychological effect they drive
people to a conception of themselves and
society in which your your f your only
if after your own good you know not
others and that's extremely harmful have
you ever felt tasted had a sense of a
non-market system have you ever had a
flash of optimism oh this is how we
could live so it certainly can be done
and I the biggest I know is Mondragon
but there many in between I'm a
functioning family for example and there
are bigger groups you know cooperatives
or case in point
it's it right here in Boston there's one
of the suburb was about two years ago I
guess there was a small but profitable
enterprise doing building some kind of
high-tech equipment for airplanes or
something the multinational who owned it
didn't want to keep it on the books
just profitable the bother so they
decided to close it down the workforce
and the union's UE offered to buy it
the community was supportive it could
have worked if there had been popular
support if there had been an Occupy
movement then I think that would have
been a great thing for them to
concentrate on if it had worked you
would have had one of there are many of
them a profitable worker on maybe worker
managed enterprises there's a fair
amount of that around the country and
there are real examples I don't see why
they shouldn't survive of course they're
going to be beaten back you know the
power systems are not going to want any
more than they want popular democracy
any more than the states and the Middle
East and the West going to tolerate the
Arab Spring they're going to try to beat
it back
they tried to beat back those city and
strikes that you talked about early on
what we forget is entire communities
showed up to support those workers
getting food in there make sure they
were protected including women as I
recall big Gordon's of women protecting
them from the cops go back a century to
homestead
you know there's worker run communities
towns that send in the National Guard to
destroy them two minutes from you on the
role of racial violence and the racial
discrimination in this situation we've
been describing some people think it's
sometimes economic issues or civil
rights and race issues well you know
there clearly is a serious race problem
in the country so for example wealth in
african-american communities is almost
zero the history is striking you take a
look at the history of african-americans
in the United States there's been about
30 years of relative freedom it was a
decade after the Civil War and before
you know the north-south compact
essentially recreating the Second World
War there was a need for free labor so
there was a kind of a freeing up of the
labor force blacks benefited from it it
lasted for about 20 years the big growth
period in the 50s and the 60s very high
growth so you know black man could get a
job in an auto plant and my house and
Sam's gets to college and they've kind
of entered into the world but by the
seventies I was over basically the
workforce which is partly white but also
heavily black they became superfluous
and look at what happened weary klimt
criminalized black life incarceration
rate since about 1980s going through the
roof overwhelmingly black males and it's
essentially redoing what happened after
reconstruction and that's the history of
african-americans how can anyone say
there's no race issue I mean talk about
media for a few minutes we can often
discern the bias in the telling of an
individual story but I want you to talk
more
broadly about the way that our corporate
media portrays power democracy the role
of the individual the way the change
happens the way that Jane well they
don't want you injured have and I mean
they're right in the center of the
system of power and domination now first
of all they are corporations parts of
bigger corporations they're very closely
linked with other systems of power both
in personnel and interests and the
social background and everything else so
that naturally tend to be pretty rather
reactionary we kind of gave us a clock
if it hasn't happened in five minutes
it's not gonna happen well that's that's
a technique of indoctrination and it's
something I learned about - my own
experience and there was once an
interview with Jeff Greenfield I think
he was asked in the interview why I was
never on invited on to their program it
was one of the famous Nightline yeah and
he gave a good answer he said he said
that his main reason is I lack concision
I had never heard that word before but
you have to have concision you have to
say something brief between two
commercials I can say Iran is a terrible
state don't eat any evidence you know
Libya Qaddafi carried out terror you
know okay suppose I try to say the
United States carries out terror in fact
one of the leading terrorist states in
the world you can't say that between two
commercials people rightly want to know
what you mean I never heard that before
and then you have to explain you have to
give some background it and that's
exactly what's cut out so concision is a
technique of propaganda it ensures that
you cannot do anything except either
repeat cliches
standard doctrine or else sound like a
lunatic and what about power
the media's picture of power who has it
who doesn't have it and what's our role
in a democracy if we're not say
president or CEO
not just the media but it's pretty much
to a scholarship and the academic world
the differences are not huge the picture
is we're a you know the leading
democracy in the world the beacon of
freedom and the rights and democracy the
fact that Democratic participation is
extremely marginal doesn't editor on the
medial condemned the elections in Iran
rightly because the candidates have to
be vetted by the clerics they don't
point out that in the United States they
have to be vetted by high concentrations
of private capital you can't run an
election less you can you know collect
millions of dollars and so on this
happens to be the 50th anniversary of
the u.s. invasion of South Vietnam now
that was the worst atrocity in the
post-war period
I killed millions of people destroyed in
the four countries I'm in total our
story it was not a word it didn't happen
because we did it so it didn't happen it
takes 18 9/11 that means something in
the United States the world changed
after 9/11 well just do a slight thought
experiment I suppose that on 9/11 the
planes had bombed the White House which
maybe one of them was trying to do it
I suppose they killed the President
established a military dictatorship
quickly killed thousands of people
tortured tens of thousands and set up a
major international terror center that
was carrying out assassinations
overthrowing governments all over the
place installing other dictatorships and
so on
drove the country into one of the worst
depressions in its history I suppose
that had happened it did happen on the
first 9/11 9/11 1973 except we were
responsible for it so therefore it
didn't have it that's I am this chilling
effect in Latin America lit the first
911
well you can't imagine the media talking
about this
and you can generalize it broadly so in
some respects critique of the Metis a
little misleading because there it's not
very different from the mainstream
intellectual community the elite media
that is and they closely interact with
them that pretty much the same people
that's why I was glad to talk to you
professor Chomsky what a pleasure
yeah you've been watching Noam Chomsky
me Laura Flanders for free speech TV
