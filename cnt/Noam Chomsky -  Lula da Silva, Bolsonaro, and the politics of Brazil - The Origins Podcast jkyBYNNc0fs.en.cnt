so what's happened in Brazil Brazil
won't go through the whole history of
course but just recently in 2003 they
elected Lula da Silva the president he's
a uneducated union leader a very
remarkable person I knew him back in the
90s for him closely he's very remarkable
person very effective you don't take my
opinion the World Bank published a study
of Brazil in 2016 in a 2016 on which
they discussed what they called the
golden decade a unique period in
Brazil's history under Lula's two terms
2003 to 2011 a period in which there was
remarkable improvement poverty reduction
enormous poverty reduction a large
expansion of inclusiveness marginalized
but remember these are very unequal
countries were rich but incredibly
unequal enormous poverty tremendous
resources wasted inclusion of people
afro-brazilians almost half the
population indigenous people and women
brought into educational institutions a
sense of dignity of commitment that the
country just changed they say it's a
remarkable example of the development
rarely equal at the same time lula
became probably the most respected
statesmen in the world a very respected
statesmen as a voice for the global self
respected everywhere I remember visiting
Brazil it seemed like yeah it seemed
like the beacon you know it was an a
remarkable period
well Brazilian elites couldn't tolerate
this and not only the first lady was
very supportive of establishment
institutions they didn't but interfere
with did not well as Robbie in the
country yeah he didn't he paid off the
debts to the foreign investors he
satisfied the IMF
he's not a radical yeah I'm his beliefs
pretty straight or you just put money in
the hands of poor people that'll take
care of things
that's his radicalism but the for the
Brazilian elite who are outlandish all
the Latin American elite this is
intolerable furthermore there's an
enormous class hatred how can this
uneducated worker who doesn't even speak
proper Portuguese dare to be sitting in
the presidential palace you know we can
these people have to have humility we'll
take care of them that sort of thing
that's deeply rooted all throughout
Latin America in Brazil in particular
anyhow as soon as he after a couple of
years after he stepped down the oil
prices dropped and the commodity prices
dropped in China cutting back
development there's a lot of claims that
the improvements under his rule were
just illusory there but the World Bank
didn't agree that you look at their
analysis they say it's not true in fact
if you look more closely I've written
about this the Brazilian economists have
written about it it was the mainly the
predatory financial institutions who
prevented any sensible reaction to this
every effort that was taken it was
beaten back and it did lead to a
recession that gave the opportunity for
the soft coup that's been going on since
then the first step was to impeach his
successor Dilma Rousseff on absolutely
the riser II grounds I mean you look at
them it's not even a joke and she was
impeached by a gang of thieves the of a
sort you can't even describe that was
the first step then comes the next just
a couple months ago there was an
election coming up in October October
2018 the Lula was way ahead in the polls
I was pretty clear it's going to win the
election so what they do put him in jail
solitary confinement 25-year sentence of
basically a death sentence
prevented from reading newspapers and
journals and cursorily prevented from
making a public statement not like
murderers and death row this is right
before the election next step which is
we should look closely cuz it's a test
run for the 2020 election here a massive
campaign on the social media which are
the main source of information for most
of the population press of course mostly
right-wing but these are but the media
campaign is just unbelievable I mean the
the lies the fabrications the vitriol
you know the the Workers Party his party
is planning to turn every before the
boys into homosexuals it's gonna kill
religion they're gonna put out baby
bottles with penises as the nipples you
know on and on like this people believe
that you know they finally managed just
by these means you know shut up silence
the guy who's gonna probably gonna win
flood the so-called information system
with grotesque lies and attacks that
can't be responded to and remember we're
going to see this soon we're starting to
see it already this is testerone they
managed to get into office a guy who's
the most outrageous of the right-wing
fanatics all over the world just to
illustrate this is a guy who when he was
in the parliament when he voted for the
impeachment of Dilma Rousseff he
dedicated his vote to her torturer she
was a guerrilla tortured by the military
regime he dedicated his vote to her
torturer the general who was in charge
of the torture he supports the military
dictatorship which was vicious mmm-hmm
but with but he criticizes it too
because it didn't go far enough he said
it should it should have was too soft
the
should have killed 30,000 people like
the Argentine's did the worst of the
military dictators yes he goes back to
the 19th century it criticizes the
Brazilian cavalry because they didn't do
what the Americans did wipe out the
indigenous population if they'd done
that we wouldn't have these problems
today in fact now that he's in office
first of all he's his economics adviser
is a ultra-right Chicago boy public
Gaydos his motto is literally privatize
everything sell the country out to
mostly foreign investors kill right now
they're killing the social security
system which is not that strong but
something had and everything over to the
rich and the powerful
the newest legislation has changed the
history books so that they don't
criticize the military dictatorship they
say it was necessary to protect the
country from communism he says the whole
country has been taken over by what's
called cultural Marxism including the
right-wing press the university you've
got a block that science is finished we
don't support that chunk we don't waste
money on that kind of stuff so the
Brazilian science is pretty powerful
interesting things coming in true so I
mean this is just indescribable and it's
happening in the most powerful country
important country in Latin America one
of the most important in the world with
the strong support of the United States
very powerful in fact this media
campaign can't prove it but it has all
the fingerprints of the people who've
been running these things elsewhere
