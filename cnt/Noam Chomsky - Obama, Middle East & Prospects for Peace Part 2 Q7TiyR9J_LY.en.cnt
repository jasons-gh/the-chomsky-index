a political settlement that allows any
meaningful national self-determination
to the Palestinians and the twenty-two
percent of the terror of Palestine that
technically they're supposed to have
under international law well those are
the policies right before our eyes I
haven't talked about the the constant
regular brutality and sadism which is
serious but that's the diplomacy and
Mitchell is bound by it there's he's not
given any chance you may be perfectly
good negotiator he has no opportunity to
do anything as long as the United States
remains committed to those policies well
there are things that can be done in
fact one good suggestion was made by
Amnesty International it's now
considered in the United States and
Israel a kind of a radical left
organization but hope we don't talk
about that in the several human rights
reports about the us-israeli war in Gaza
they call it an Israeli war but that's
politeness in the have been quite a few
human rights investigations and one of
the most important of them hence the
least publicized was an Amnesty
International report which went through
the weaponry that was used in the attack
on Gaza found of course that almost all
of it comes from the United States
including white phosphorus another
high-tech weaponry and it called for an
arms embargo on both sides well can't
roll an arms embargo and con las because
no state publicly at least provides them
with arms but you can call from and of
course most overwhelmingly that means
Israel so they called for an arms
embargo on Israel for good reason
because its actions violate
international law and US shipment of
arms to Israel violates us look the US
law is quite explicit that arms cannot
be sent except for the purpose of
Defense and of course this is it
might say a word about that Israel of
course claims that all the actions I
described are in self-defense but you
know that claim is meaningless
everything that a state every state when
it uses force reflexively says it's for
self-defense like when Hitler invaded
Poland it was to defend Germany from the
wild terror of the poles and so on if
you can find an exception to that in
history it kind of be interested so to
say it's in self-defense is like saying
two plus two equals four you have to ask
is there any merit to that claim well is
there let's take the separation fence
going through the West Bank and what
does that have to do with self-defense I
mean if Israel wanted to build a war
that would keep wall that would keep it
secure it would build it on the border
it would make it impregnable you know
mile high tanks on all sides this is an
annexation wall has nothing to do with
defense take the attack on Gaza it's
uniform in the united states including
the human rights reports to say yes
Israel had the right to attack it has a
right to defend itself against Hamas
rockets there is no there is a right of
self-defense that's true everyone agrees
the state has a right of self-defense
but that's not even the issue done the
issue is which is never discussed did it
have a right of self-defense by force ok
that's different from right of
self-defense international law is quite
clear on that as is common sense you
have a right to use force him self
defense if you've exhausted peaceful
means that's a precondition well the US
and Israel not only didn't exhaust
peaceful means they refused to try them
and they refused to try them because
they knew they were going to work there
were clear peaceful means that could be
used in fact there had been a ceasefire
it was called in june two thousand eight
and israel concedes publicly that during
the ceasefire there wasn't a single
Hamas rocket so ok and Israel broke the
ceasefire in November
by sending troops into the Gaza Strip
and killing a bunch of house activists
and then rocket started in response but
then Hamas continued to offer to renew
the ceasefire and the Israeli cabinet
considered it we have the public record
and as I did not do and the US of course
never mentioned it well that alone
completely undermines any claim to the
youth to the right of force if they
fired one bullet into the Gaza it would
have been a crime that quite but the
discussion is all about disproportionate
use of force which again an evasion you
don't talk about disproportionate use of
force unless there's a right to the use
of force in the first place which there
wasn't then if you go case by case there
are no security issues of course there
are security issues but they're largely
self-generated because there are
opportunities for peaceful settlement
well the United States has been blocking
them and continues to block them and so
does Obama and that's another good case
for preventive diplomacy
as we get microphones out I'd like for
people to think about questions they
have for professor Chomsky again
focusing on the Middle East focusing on
the first term of Barack Obama focusing
on George Mitchell's role there also
focusing on the role of Hillary Rodham
Clinton who's playing an interesting
role in this will quote unquote peace
effort do we have microphones one right
there we have a second right there
please raise your hand if you'd like to
ask a question and please make certain
that once you get the microphone you
speak right into it so we can hear your
question please raise your hand first
let's start right down here start
terrific speech um it seemed after nine
eleven that Bush's policy with Israel
largely fell under the war on terror and
there's a lot of support it kind of fell
into the axis of evil scheme and all
that how would you relate that to the
rationale of the Obama administration in
terms of how they relate to Palestinian
self-determination Israel's response to
terror why not about the same it's hard
the war on terror is kind of an
interesting concept what we are supposed
to think is that George Bush declared a
war on terror in after September 11th
that's not quite accurate here ii
declared a war on terror the war on
terror was declared by ronald reagan in
nineteen eighty one as he came into
office he announced and his
administration announced that
international state-directed
international terrorism is the plague of
the modern age returned the barbarism in
our time it's going to be the core of
our policy and then they proceeded to
deal with it by carrying out massive
terrorist Wars which practically
destroyed central america
it killed over a million people in
southern Africa and supported the
invasion of Lebanon just a massive
terrorist war so that's kind of a dove
history because we're not supposed to
talk about our terrorism so therefore
that terror that war on terror is kind
of submerged what about bush's war on
terror about the same it has almost
nothing to do with reducing terrors real
you know 911 happened that's bad it was
a real crime actually if you try going
to Latin America you may find that
people call it the second 911 the reason
is there was another 911 September 11th
1973 in Chile which by any objective
standard was much worse I can go through
the details if you like and we know who
was responsible for that people like
Henry Kissinger and others so yes there
was massive terror 911 our 911 was
another one and if you wanted if when
there is a case of terror a major crime
there are ways to react to reduce the
terror and they were understood so in
the case of what we call 911 second one
if you wanted to reduce if your goal was
to reduce terror which it would have
done is use the options that were
available so for example the jihadi
movement which is a broad movement was
highly critical of Obama Osama bin Laden
and 911 there were fat was coming from
them you know the radical clerics and
al-azhar university kind of you know the
main Islamic Center condemning bin Laden
and al-qaeda for this and if you wanted
to reduce the threat of terror what
would have been done is to exploit the
opportunity to break up the jodi
movement you know to separate this
violent militant element from its space
of support okay that's the natural way
to reduce the threat of terror that's in
fact what Mitchell succeeded in doing in
northern
instead the u.s. decided to escalate the
threat of terror by welding the jihadi
movement back together first by
attacking Afghanistan then by attacking
Iraq and it's exactly what happened so
for example of Asian of Iraq it was
predicted but so every intelligence
agency that it would increase the threat
of terror for a very simple reason Tara
doesn't come out of nowhere you know
it's not because people decide I want to
blow myself up there's there's a
background for it and the background our
grievances and sometimes the grievances
are legitimate as in northern island so
if one of the leading and by terror and
Iraq I'll come back to this intelligence
agents predicted it would the invasion
would increase the threat of terror as
indeed it did far beyond what was
anticipated so using quasi-governmental
statistics terror increased by a factor
of 72 big jump the year after the
invasion of Iraq of Iraq as anticipated
but more and we can go through other
cases a protection of a population from
terror or other violence is usually a
low priority of states not a high
priority and that's true of the United
States as well so sort of down there
somewhere but not a major prayer a
priority that's easy to show furthermore
what do you do about 911 itself what was
criminal act when there's a criminal act
the first thing you do is try to figure
out who perpetrated it that wasn't so
simple in this case about eight months
later the head of the FBI after the most
intensive international investigation in
history said that the the FBI was still
unable to really pinpoint the blame they
said we believe the word that was used
that the plot may have been hatched in
Afghanistan what was probably
implemented in the United Arab Emirates
and in Germany okay so that's what they
believed eight months afterwards
well okay if you're trying to carry fine
perpetrators of a criminal act you go
beyond your beliefs until you're pretty
confident who carried it out and then
you work to apprehend them if it's an
international case you get international
support which been very easy in this
case and then bring them to a fair trial
that doesn't mean Guantanamo or Bagram
well that's the way to deal with
criminal acts assuming you want to
reduce terror okay if reducing terror is
not your concern or very low concern
then you do the kinds of things that
we're done now use force and violence to
achieve your other objectives that's I
could go on with many other examples so
as you may know there was a 911
commission that was formed over the
objections of the Bush administration
but was formed to high-level Commission
to recommend means to reduce the threat
of terror and if you look over there
recommend that they reconstituted
themselves later because they were quite
angry that none of the recommendations
work we can't being carried out and if
you look yes they weren't being carried
out so for example one of the
recommendations was to fortify the
border the Canadian border that's the
porous border for the United States I
mean you and I could cross the Canadian
border with a suitcase with a small
nuclear weapon in it and you just go
through the forest you know it's a
basically unguarded border so one
recommendation was okay reinforce the
border well the Bush administration
responded by reinforcing the border
namely the Mexican border which was not
considered a threat because the threat
that the people who are fleeing from the
effects of NAFTA and the u.s. terror and
Central America the the need to keep
them out as far higher than the need to
protect the people in New York
nuclear explosion and it goes that way
step by step I mean governments are not
the benevolent agencies their power
systems they carry out policies in the
interest of those who dominate and
control them and protecting populations
is a low priority Israel's case in point
could have security but prefers
expansion thank you another question yes
sir right here do we have a microphone
right down here place right up there
what worries me is what's going to
happen in this country Obama raised such
exaggerated expectations such great
hopes in people precisely because he
wasn't unknown I recall reading that
approving peasant was asked why he voted
for a particular candidate for
presidency he said because I know
nothing about him and I'm afraid that's
what happened in this country people
voted for Obama because they knew
nothing about what he was going to carry
out and it's a very dangerous situation
when you raise exaggerated high hopes
and they did dash them down you know
what happened in France after 9268 the
goal came back to power with a vengeance
the Labour Party disappointed people in
in the 60s and the fetcher regime came
in heart of disappointed people this
country we got Reagan what's going to
happen it seems to be starting right now
when this exaggerated hopes are dashed
down who we have real dangers here and
how can we fight that yeah I you're
quite right and in fact his Obama and
his campaign managers made sure you
would know nothing about him or very
little about him and if you look back at
the campaign the slogans were hope and
change what hope for what you know what
change well at that point it kind of
evaporates why hope and change well you
know campaign managers are intelligent
enough to read polls and they knew that
eighty percent of the population thought
the country's going in the wrong
direction
okay hope and change in fact those were
McCain's slogans to accept you didn't do
it as well Obama made it primarily
because the financial institutions who
are of enormous power in the country
mainly thanks to Reagan and Clinton the
they preferred him to McCain so they
poured money into the Obama campaign way
beyond McCain and that's the core of the
funding and yes he managed to make it
you know over to win the election and it
shouldn't come to a special surprise to
anyone who knows anything about American
political history that they're being
paid off just take a look at the front
pages every day I mean the big problem
for the big banks know is that the
prophets and the bonuses are so high
that they're getting a bad press notice
they have to figure out some way to
conceal it by its they taking them in
stocks instead of money so you're kind
of borrowing money from the public
instead of stealing it no so sure
they're getting paid off for having put
obama in office but the other programs
or well you know what's happening to
them it's probably a nice man i don't
know but there shouldn't it's just as
you said there should be no surprise
they were very careful to keep it quiet
and that's characteristic of us
elections the US elections are a facade
they are run by the public relations
industry who market candidates the same
way they market toothpaste and lifestyle
drugs i mean when you see an ad on
television you know you're not supposed
to believe it you know it's not an
attempt to inform you the way it would
be in a market system it's a way to
create uninformed consumers will make
irrational choices exactly the opposite
of what you're taught in an economics
class about markets but business spends
huge amounts of money to undermine
market
by constructing uninformed consumers who
are supposed to make irrational choices
and the same institutions for your
institutions run the campaigns and they
market candidates the same way they want
an uninformed electorate that'll make
irrational choices and in fact as maybe
you know Obama won an award from the
advertising industry for the best
marketing campaign of 2008 they beat out
Apple Computer and if you read the
business press executives were euphoric
they said yes best we've done since we
since Reagan when we sort of were able
to market him now we haven't even better
achievement it's going to change the
atmosphere in corporate boardrooms in
new ways of behaving and portraying
ourselves and so on yeah that's the case
and what one technique is if you really
want to create an uninformed electorate
you have to keep issues off the agenda
and there's a second reason for that on
issues both of the political parties are
commonly well to the right of the
population so it's important to keep
issues off the table make sure people
don't know what they are so yeah you're
quite right and what will the result
likely be and Mike my suspicion is an
erosion of the base for the Obama
campaign because people will be
disillusioned they shouldn't be but they
will be and it's understandable and a
very significant backlash there's a
major group of huge group of people in
the country who feel they have serious
grievances the grievances come back go
back to the 1970s the shift of the
economy from production to finance which
a huge shift that took place primarily
under Reagan and then Clinton and of
course Bush even work stream and that's
left a lot of people out in the cold
majority of the population have seen
their wages and incomes
for 30 years their benefits decline you
know services decline infrastructure
collapse and so on and they're not happy
about it and they want to know why is
this happening to me if you listen to
talk radio you get a good sense of it I
mean which I do I might drive I listen
the standard person is saying something
like you know I'm I've done everything
right I'm a hard-working decent white
Christian and everything right why is
this happening to me well who's going to
give him an answer they're not going to
get an answer from the Republican Party
saying yeah that's the policies we
designed to shaft you and enrich couple
of rich people and they're not going to
get an answer from the Democratic Party
saying well that's pretty much our
policy to accept maybe not as extreme so
they get an answer from rush limbaugh
and Glenn Beck who tell them well why I
got an answer it's the rich liberals who
own the banks and run the government and
own the media and don't care about you
people to fly over people they only care
about the rich folk and the on the two
coasts they want to give everything away
to illegal immigrants and you know the
unworthy poor and so on so yeah that's
your problem well you know if that's the
only answer you're going to get people
are likely to believe it and we've seen
we had experiences like this it's
unfortunately reminiscent of late by mar
germany where there were also are people
with grievances and they were getting an
answer crazy answered horrible answer
but happen to take over with
consequences we know about i'm not
saying that's going to happen here but
the similarities are not insignificant
wait a question in the back yeah as it
becomes more apparent that our
leadership is complicit with israel and
its occupation by sending three billion
dollars a year in military aid and as
the demographic in east jerusalem is
changing more rapidly with housing
evictions and shake Tehran still on
another neighborhood
and like the Israeli left is shrinking
and shrinking and getting gradually
smaller do you find hope in the boycott
divestment and sanctions movement that's
been growing in the world or do you feel
that that there's other ways of
assisting and ending the occupation and
other problems in the region well I
think the development of the sanctions
movement reflects an understandable and
you know in many ways appropriate
reaction to what's going on but it has
some problems that we ought to think
through the sanctions movement is
directed against Israel okay that
absolves the United States but the
United States is the prime actor in this
Israel can go just as far as the US
permits it to and as far as the US
provides the essential support so
tactics are supposed to be educational
and this one is Miss educational it's
direct it's in fact a gift to the United
States saying it's those terrible guys
over there now a sanctions program can
be effective and sensible but it has to
be formulated properly BDS is called
boycott divestment sanctions that's a
pretty blunt instrument you can use it
effectively you can use it badly to be
used effectively first of all that ought
to be directed against the right target
and it ought to be done in a way which
the population which come which is
defensible which the wood should take
the high moral ground not be
indefensible for example it shouldn't be
obviously hypocritical for example if
you boycott say an israeli dance group
may make israelis feel bad but it's
totally hypocritical why not work out a
u.s. dance group say well US has a far
worse record of violence and aggression
you're boycotting an israeli dance group
because you get away with it there that
we can't do it against the united states
too strong and tough but anybody can see
that that's just totally bonkers
on the other hand something like say the
Amnesty International proposal that
makes a lot of sense calling for the
u.s. to follow its own laws you know and
stop sending arms to Israel first of all
it's directing it against the right
target namely us and we should always be
primarily concerned with ourselves and
that happens to be the appropriate
target anyway and it's completely
defensible the US auto they look to its
laws and that opens the door to an
educational program and make it clear
that the US is violating its own laws
international law by sending arms to a
country that's engaged in direct
aggression not using it for defensive
purposes this is the first time a human
there have been cases in the past where
human rights groups like Human Rights
Watch have suggested that the u.s. live
up to its own laws by not sending arms
to Israel because there are laws that
bar sending arms to laws that engage in
systematic torture as Israel does but
this is much more extensive this is
calling for an overall arms embargo and
it's coming from an impeccable source on
this day international and they have a
very good reason and a defensible reason
and one that can be you know can be
justified and can be used to as a wedge
to get people understand the situation
so that's a sensible BDS program others
are too so for example a boycott of say
arms manufacturers or caterpillar which
is just create destroying the occupied
territories yeah that makes a lot of
sense but you just have to craft these
things so that they're sensible it can
be done actually in case of South Africa
is a very interesting one that's usually
suggested as a model but you should
really pay some attention to it I'm the
BDS program against South Africa it
really took off by around nineteen
eighty that was at a point where nobody
was defending apart
Congress was passing legislation against
supporting a mayor's we're getting
arrested the press was against it and so
on and it was after decades of
educational programs that got people to
oppose apartheid okay at that point a
BDS program made a lot of sense and it
was effective the Reagan administration
which was a criminal administration
beyond the norm had to evade
congressional legislation in order to
continue to support its South African
allies and I was no small business as I
mentioned it led to the killing of
probably over a million people in the
neighboring countries well that was
important and in fact to finish up on
South Africa a lot of the lot of
analogies are made between Israel and
South Africa I don't think many of them
hold up very well one reason they don't
hold up is that South Africa needed its
black population its African population
badly they were its workforce Israel
doesn't want the Palestinians would be
happy if they would disappear that's one
crucial difference and it's a difference
in the policies that are followed but
there is something to be learned from
the history in South Africa by the early
1960s South Africa was beginning to
become a pariah state and there wasn't a
boycott campaign but there's a lot of
condemnation of apart height and there
were votes in the United Nations you
know overwhelmingly against apartheid
and so on as that was the South African
nationalist reacted pretty much the same
way Israel's reacting we're right the
world is wrong they don't understand us
what we need is an information campaign
to explain to the world that everything
we do is wonderful and perfect and
that's pretty much what's happening now
and it went on for a long time but a
South African the South African Foreign
Minister made a very interesting comment
as to comment to the American ambassador
this is must be close to 50 years ago he
told the American ambassador yes the UN
is vote
against us but it really doesn't matter
because you and I know there's only one
vote the United Nations yours okay and
as long as you're backing us it doesn't
matter what the rest of the world is
saying and he was right and the history
showed it as long as the united states
continued the back of them they could
get away with whatever they wanted then
matter if the whole world objected
didn't matter of congress passed
legislation against them as late as 1988
the reagan administration condemn the
African National Congress Mandela as one
of the more notorious terrorist groups
in the world that's 1988 actually as you
may know Mandela was just removed from
the terrorist list a couple of months
ago that's 1988 within about two years
the United States changed its position
for reasons we could debate but anyway
it did change its position Mandela was
allowed out of the prison at robins
Island there were moves towards
overcoming apartheid with a couple of
years the system was gone all it takes
is that one vote which happens to be the
only vote there is in the United Nations
that's what it means to have
overwhelming power and that's a hopeful
sign it's not the only case there are
other cases like that too and it means
we can really do something if we want to
but we're going to have to focus tactics
on what the United States does not what
somebody else does another question yes
right here
hi um I have a sort of two part question
the first is with the increasing
fear-mongering towards the Iranian
regime it seems like an Israeli air
strike it could be quite possible and if
that happens I think the United States
stands to lose more just because we have
our troops in both Afghanistan and Iraq
if that happens or if is really the
first but you repeat the first prisoner
stand it it seems as though there's an
increasing chance of an Israeli air
strike on iran increasing oh and the
threat of an air strike on iran right
yeah um and if that happens I think the
USA can lose more than Israel would just
because our troops are far closer how do
we stop an Israeli air strike when they
claim that they're fearing for their
existence and my second question is our
negotiations with Iran have consisted so
far of us demanding that they stop how
can we expect this to be a negotiation
if we're not willing to budge on Irish
on any issue if we're not willing to
budge on any of the issues if we haven't
offered or we haven't asked them what
they want in return and all we're doing
is demanding that they stop well as far
as stopping an Israeli air strike is
concerned that's fairly straightforward
the US just asked tell them you're not
going to do it okay then there won't be
an israeli air story and put teeth into
that statement which of course the u.s.
can do us is providing the armaments
providing the has to allow for transit
you know in fact it's happened like last
summer for example summer 2008 so you're
half go right in the midst of the
presidential campaign you know the most
sensitive moment a pack these main
Israeli Lobby was trying to get Congress
to pass a resolution calling for a
blockade on Iran well that's an act of
war that could have led to a war and
they had gotten a lot of support a lot
of
Congress people were lined up and
signing all of a sudden the campaign
ended there was no indication of why but
it must have been that they just got a
message from the White House saying we
don't want to warn now so call off your
boys and the campaign ended right in the
middle of a campaign very sensitive and
that's happened over and over I'm in
Israel and its lobbies here know that
they can go only so far they can go as
far as the u.s. lets them if they tried
to do something that the u.s. really
opposed they'd be in serious trouble and
they understand that they're not
suicidal either so yeah we can stop it
by putting it into our support for it
there are on threats for that matter and
you can it's not a hundred percent
guarantee but pretty pretty safe
prospect as for the negotiations it's
not very clear what they're about
actually we're going to try to prevent
your Iran from exercising the rights of
a signer of the non-proliferation treaty
as we're insisting well we can insist on
that but we certainly can't expect the
world to go along with us except for
Europe which young fellows obsequious
leave behind but outside Europe the
world doesn't accept that that's why you
have the kind of statement i quoted from
President Lula brazil and the
non-aligned countries which continue to
support that right if we want to
negotiate with Iran got to offer them
something and what we should offer them
is first of all that they should have
their rights but also that the will put
an end to the effort to exclude them
from the world which is serious it's
quite serious like we now have laws in
the United States which bar
international banks from dealing with
Iran well you can't legally do that but
again when the Godfather says it
happened
so the banks don't want to lose under
the Patriot Act for example if a bank is
violating the US sanctions it can be
barred from action within the United
States that's pretty serious risk for
some international banks so sure they
follow well okay we could offer
opportunities for Iran to enter into the
world system which i think would also be
a help to the iranian reformers it's
just it the harsher we are and our
treatment of iran the easier it is for
the ruling clerics to get the population
to huddle under the umbrella of power
for you know for defense and we know
that perfectly well you know after nine
eleven okay everybody was willing to
accept the harsh restrictions you know
support the government and so on yeah
other others react that way too so I
think there are steps that can be made
they're not guaranteed to succeed but we
should at least begin by putting an end
to the hypocrisy you cannot praise
President Mubarak of Egypt as a force
for stability and good and then in the
next sentence condemn the Iranians for a
harsh treatment of protesters and expect
people not to crack up and laughter
outside the highly disciplined West
which of course you know does what it's
told so there's their steps that could
be made if there were serious diplomatic
interests we have time for just one more
question from this side yes hi my
question is early in your talk you
talked about the threat of Iran being
exaggerated how it's not as big of a
threat as the world and the Middle East
is making it seem to be and then later
you talked about how no one is emitting
to supplying arms to terrorists in Gaza
and Lebanon but you also implied that
somebody Iran is doing so so and they
have admitted it so how is that not a
threat to the middle east and to the
world
not a threat if Iran violates say
International Agency resolutions and so
on ossa probably terrorist organization
well that's an interesting notion to
according to the united states and its
obedient allies the united states on is
supporting terrorist organizations okay
well ask yourself is that true I mean
which of the terrorist organizations I
mean they're presumably they're
providing arms to Hezbollah and to Hamas
are they terrorists organizations well I
mean Hezbollah is called a terrorist
organization because it drove Israel out
of southern Lebanon okay maybe it
carried out other terrorist acts maybe
not but the main charge against
Hezbollah is it drove our ally out of an
illegal military occupation of southern
Lebanon where our ally was there in
violation of security council
resolutions went back 22 years you know
they did drive him out they also
defended Lebanon when Israel invaded
it's six that's fifth invasion in 2006
okay terrorism from one point of view
not from others we can't expect the
world to accept our condemnation of that
as terrorism what about Hamas yeah I
must say the Hamas Rockets are criminal
acts no doubt but we're not going to
can't expect rational people to accept
the charge that charge if they know as
we prevent ourselves from knowing that
there's a very simple way to stop those
acts namely accept the ceasefire in fact
there's a more general way was pointed
out by near Rosen was one of the best
reporters of in the region very fine
reporter he was asked he was on Amy
Goodman show democracy now a couple of
weeks ago and she asked you know what
can we do to stop much
from killing us as well stop killing
them okay stop killing them maybe
they'll stop killing us not a bad answer
so sure the Iran is undoubtedly
supporting Hamas and Hezbollah but you
know as compared with what we do it's
like a toothpick on a mountain I mean
whatever you think about from us that
carry out nothing like the violent
murderous acts of Israel and Egypt which
we strongly support and the same with
Hezbollah they've defended Lebanon and
you may like them or hate them that's
really irrelevant but you know maybe
they've involved in something like for
example they're one of the charges
against Hezbollah is that they carried
out a suicide bombing in 1983 at which
again stay US Marine base in Lebanon
well actually probably wasn't Hezbollah
which you look at experts on the topic
they point out as well I barely existed
then it's probably somebody else but
whoever it was was it a terrorist act
I'm in the US military base in Lebanon
was being used to bomb an attack Lebanon
that was the time when the US Navy right
offshore was bombarding the hills over
in Lebanon in support of our our allies
in a civil war response to that action
is hardly a terrorist act so you really
have to ask yourself who are the
terrorists they're not nice people and I
wouldn't admit I don't but in fact they
happened to be pretty popular in Lebanon
it here organism you have to be very
careful not to believe what you read in
the American press crucially like right
right after there was an election in
Lebanon a couple of a couple of months
ago and if you read people like say
Thomas Friedman or everyone else they
were just over joy
Friedman was the most extreme as usual
he said you know tears come to my eyes
when I hear about free elections and on
and on he said the Lebanese people had a
free choice and they voted for Obama and
against tough mudder nejad because the
us-backed coalition won the majority of
votes in the parliament what he didn't
tell you and what the American press
didn't report is that the majority vote
went to the Hezbollah back to coalition
they got fifty four percent of the vote
of the roughly half of the population of
voted and because of the sectarian
system and Lebanon which is a residue of
French colonialism the Shiite population
is very much underrepresented
underrepresented so you believe in free
elections the festival I back coalition
won in fact one pretty handily but if
you really hate free elections which is
standard here then they didn't because
the way of manipulating the vote put
them in the minority of the legislature
so that you know you can't really say
that they're an unpopular group in
Lebanon in fact the legislature just
recently authorized their retaining arms
well make some sense i mean if Lebanon
has a right of self Davina has no right
of self-defense yeah then of course they
shouldn't have arms but if Lebanon does
have a right of self-defense then who
else is going to defend it against the
next Israeli invasion I mean not the
Lebanese army they can't do it if it's
about like now I can do it but did do it
so okay nothing to do with whether you
like him or hate him but you should be a
little cautious about using the notion
terrorist organization particularly when
we happen to be in the state which is
guilty of far more terrorism than
anybody else you can think of
practically
before we go I'd like to offer a couple
of get to professor Chomsky the first
gift is a beautiful bookmark thanks to
our wonderful dean of the school of
education was sitting in the back garden
Coleman a true visionary a true what I
call entrepreneur bu was lucky to get
from the University of Wisconsin this is
from Dean hard and Coleman and the
school of education thanks very much
second you already have a few for your
grandchildren but one more this is from
axis of hope on the back you'll see that
it says teaching youth for peace
beginning today that's for you also
