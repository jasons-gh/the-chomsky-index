ladies and gentlemen it is my great
pleasure to introduce professor Noam
Chomsky
I was asked to dude can you hear me no
how's that better okay I was asked to
talk about what drives us foreign policy
sorry Oh how's that better okay and what
drives us foreign policy and what we can
do to change it a good way to start an
inquiry into what drives foreign policy
is to start with what doesn't drive it
and that's pretty easy to determine
there's a simple method just took a take
a look at the conventional theses as to
the roots of foreign policy and ignore
them because they you can quickly see
that they don't work so the major thesis
constantly is that foreign policy is
driven by noble intent so humanitarian
intervention and bringing democracy and
so on that claim as far as I know is
close to universal almost every foreign
policy initiative by any state expresses
noble intent and it's very familiar in
our own history back to the very
beginning so you might say that u.s.
foreign policy begins when the pilgrims
arrived in Massachusetts and they came
with the most noble of objectives you
can see them on
the Internet if you look up the Great
Seal of the bay colony of Massachusetts
380 years ago it depicts an Indian with
his Spears pointed down sign of peace
and a scroll coming out of his mouth
saying come over and help us
so the pilgrims who were coming were
noble humanitarians who were responding
to the plea of the poor pagans to come
and Christianize them and help them and
incidentally exterminate them but that's
one of those things
collateral damage that's gold these days
and as I say that is universal so if you
read say Hitler's speeches when he was
taking over Czechoslovakia or invading
Poland full of the most humane uplifting
rhetoric or Japanese fascists when they
were around Beijing in China and in the
hope with the intention of creating a
earthly paradise for the people they
were massacring and protect them from
the Chinese bandits were who were
inflicting damage on them and that you
might search and see if you can find an
exception to that it's pretty rare so
what it means is that the claim of noble
intent simply carries no information
literally it's completely predictable so
therefore it carries no information even
in the technical sense of the word so
you can disregard a second thesis is
that foreign policy is driven by what's
called the national interest what's the
national interest so for example is the
say take the CEO of General Electric
and the janitor who cleans the floor of
his office do they have the same
interests well not exactly
there's some respects in which there are
some shared interests for example the
interest in security and it's very
commonly argued that security search for
security is with drives policy that's
pretty easily testable so take for
example of the invasion of Iraq that was
undertaken with the expectation that it
would increase the threat of terror in
fact it did by about a factor of seven
the first year is that undertaken to
preserve security and hardly it was
recently an inquiry in Britain Chilcott
inquiry looking into the roots of the
war the planning for the war and the
head of their mi5 is essentially the FBI
testified that both British intelligence
and the US intelligence a knew quite
well that there was no threat from Iraq
but that invading it would create a
threat which indeed it did others
reacted pretty much the same way now
there's one exception to this foreign
policy and domestic policy are driven by
a search for security in a very special
sense a security for those groups in the
society that Adam Smith called the
Masters of mankind
those who basically own the society and
as he described are the principal
architects of policy and design it so
that their own interests will be well
served no matter how Grievous the impact
on the domestic population that's a
thesis that holds up pretty well
has modern more sophisticated versions
but it's it's simple and essentially
true so take for example the 2008
election Obama won the election because
he was able to outspend McCain his rival
and the main reason he was able to do it
was because there was a flow of funding
from the financial institutions like for
the economy these days and they
preferred him to McCain so they poured
money into his campaign and he was able
to swing the election well they expect
to be paid off
you don't give money for nothing if
you're among the masters of mankind and
they were the country was in a deep
recession when Obama came in the first
task was to create a commission to
Economic Commission to try to find the
way out of the recession if you take a
look at who was on it he was very
careful to exclude all critics of the
policies that led to the recession
including Nobel laureates and picked the
people who designed the policies that
created the recession almost without
exception and there was a result redo
the version of the result that was just
produced by the special inspector for
government special inspector for the
bailout program Neil Barofsky he points
out that there was a legislative act
that authorized the bailout and it was a
bargain the bargain was that the
financial institutions that created the
crisis that would be saved by the
taxpayer and the victims of their
misdeeds would be somewhat compensated
by measures to protect home values and
preserve home ownership and the core of
the recession was an eight trillion
dollar housing bubble that collapsed
leaving people with no home
said no kappa well he goes on to say
that only the first part of the bargain
was kept the fascial of institutions
were rewarded lavishly for causing the
crisis and forgiven for outright crimes
but as he puts it the rest of the
program flounder that foreclosures
continue to mount with 8 million to 13
million filings forecast over the
program's lifetime while the biggest
banks are 20% larger than they were
before the crisis and controlled a
larger part of the our economy than ever
they reasonably assumed that the
government meaning the taxpayer will
rescue them again if necessary
indeed credit rating rating agencies
incorporate future government bailouts
into their assessments of the largest
bank banks exaggerating market
distortions that provide them with an
unfair advantage over smaller
institutions which continue to struggle
and of course encouraging them to
undertake risky transactions with a big
profit because when it collapses as it
will the taxpayer will come and bail em
out
so in short parofsky concludes Obama's
programs were a giveaway to Wall Street
executives and a blow in the solar
plexus to their defenseless victims that
all in accord with adam smith's maxim
from the 1770s 70's and it's pretty much
the same on foreign policy so take a few
just let's pick a few critical moments
for formation of foreign policy the
global system changed radically during
World War two the United States emerged
from the Second World War as
overwhelmingly the most powerful state
in the world
richest most powerful and it expected to
make use of that power to organize the
world in the interests of the domestic
masters of mankind during the Second
World War President Roosevelt's planners
State Department planners experts in
foreign policy from outside had regular
meetings in which they planned for the
post-war world they knew that Britain
the United States was going to replace
Britain Britain as the global dominant
power and they wanted to lay out plans
to what the world would look like well
there's a leading British diplomatic
historians Jeffrey Warner recently
pointed out after a study of this that
from the documentary record it's
perfectly clear that President Roosevelt
was aiming at United States hegemony in
the post-war world and not surprising
given us power and they had specific
plans they plan to construct what they
called a grand area which would be under
US control that would include the entire
Western Hemisphere
the Far East and the former British
Empire including crucially the Middle
East energy reserves that's the minimum
the maximum would be as much as possible
certainly the core of Eurasia the
economic industrial core of Eurasia
Western Europe well that was the grand
area and in the grand area I'm quoting
the United States will main on maintain
unquestioned power with military and
economic supremacy while ensuring the
limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by states that might
interfere with its global designs and
more significant the wartime plans were
soon implemented now this ought to be
sort of the first week of a freshman
course in college on post-war foreign
policy
it's very significant and that's
remained that stays the policy and it's
often stated pretty forthrightly
so it takes a Bill Clinton sort of
nonetheless aggressive side his doctrine
presented to Congress was that the
United States has the right to use
military force unilaterally to ensure
inhibited access to key markets energy
supplies and strategic resources and the
US must maintain military forces a
forward deployed in Europe and Asia in
order to shape people's opinions about
us not by persuasion and to shape events
that will affect our livelihood and our
security in that special sense of
security
well that doctrine Lices licenses
military intervention at will and it
actually goes well beyond the much
reviled george w bush doctrine which at
least required pretext for intervention
for clinton you need a pretext just
controlling the grand area but the
clinton's doctrine was presented
politely and so it received no censure
unlike the brazen and arrogant
pronouncements of his successor it's
style that matters not the content the
content remains pretty much the same
well take the invasion of Iraq which is
quite interesting if you look at it
closely throughout the course of the
invasion it became clearer that the US
was gonna fail who was not gonna achieve
its objectives and as the Fed or the
actual goals of the invasion could no
longer be concealed with usual pretty
rhetoric and they were expressed not
reported but expressed by the government
so in November 2007 the Bush
administration produced a Declaration of
Principles
here's the way it's gotta work the
United States forces must remain
indefinitely in Iraq and Iraq must
privilege American investors the two
months later in January 2008 Bush
informed Congress that he would reject
any legislation that might limit the
permanent stationing of US Armed Forces
in Iraq or US control of the oil
resources of Iraq pretty straight
standard grand area doctrine
these are incidentally demands that the
United States had to abandon as shortly
after in the face of Iraqi resistance it
was another step in a major defeat well
it's the the same world war two
principles hold for what's now
considered to be the greatest danger to
world order and in fact is considered
the leading foreign policy issue for the
United States
that's the Iranian threat last year was
the year of Iran because of this
terrible Iranian threat well what
exactly is the Iranian threat it's
something rarely discussed but there
actually is an authoritative answer it
was given by the Pentagon and US
intelligence in their annual report to
Congress on the global security
situation highest possible source they
point out that the Iranian threat which
they take to be very severe is not a
military threat in fact Iranian military
spending is low even by the standards of
the region and minuscule fraction of us
pendant furthermore Iran they say has
limited capacity to deployed forces
abroad and then they look into its
strategic doctrine its military doctrine
and they say the military doctrine is
defensive it's designed to deter an
invasion long enough so the
diplomacy can set in while they of
course discuss the nuclear threat and
they say that if Iran is trying to
develop a nuclear capability that would
be part of their deterrence strategy
okay that's the military side of the
threat however it's a very severe threat
one because deterrence violates grand
area principles remember the basic
principle is that no interference with
US actions is to be tolerated and if a
country can deter an invasion or can
deter aggressive aggressive action
that's an interference with our right to
dominate the world so that's a threat
and there's another threat which they
point out that's what they call Iran's
efforts to destabilize the region how is
your end
destabilizing the region well by trying
to develop to extend its influence into
neighboring countries by Iraq and
Afghanistan by commercial extending
commercial relations cultural relations
and so on and that's destabilizes the
country in contrast when we invade those
countries and half destroy them that
stabilizes the region and this is normal
practice this is the normal usage of the
term stability it's used that way all
the time sometimes so extreme it's hard
to believe so for example when the u.s.
overthrew the parliamentary government
in Chile and installed a vicious
dictatorship this action was criticized
by an elite leading foreign policy
analyst James Chase for one but he said
nevertheless it was necessary to
destabilize Chile in order to impose
stability and that's not a contradiction
if you understand the technical meaning
of the words stability means we run it
we own the world anything that
interferes is destabilizing
that's unchallenged at home of course
but not in the rest of the world and
that's significant because over the
years the u.s. capacity to implement
grand area strategy has declined the
strategy is the same rhetorics about the
same but the capacity to implement it
has design has declined and for good
reasons the peak of us power in the
world was right after World War two
now the United States literally had half
the world's wealth that's unheard of a
position of overwhelming military power
it's industrial competitors were either
destroyed or severely weakened and at
that point the ability to implement
policy was simply overwhelming well that
changed through decolonization
reconstruction of the industrial
societies u.s. share of global power
declined remained enormous but it
declined by say 1970 it was maybe twenty
five percent of the world's wealth still
colossal but not half by that time the
world was becoming what was called
tri-polar three major industrial centres
one was North America based in the
United States
another Europe now recovered primarily
based in Germany and the third was East
Asia at that point Japan based and now
it's the world's most dynamic industrial
region that China is the core of it in a
certain sense but it's worth to remember
that China is an assembly plant the more
advanced technology
fancy software and parts and components
they mostly come from the industrial
societies on the periphery of China
Taiwan South Korea and Japan and also
from the United States in there sent to
China to assemble if you take a look at
say the trade a lot of talk about the
trade deficit with China however if you
calculate that trade deficit correctly
in terms of what's called the
value-added in China to the to what you
purchase say if you purchase an iPod how
much of the value is actually added in
China turns out that the trade deficit
with China is overestimated by about 25
percent and it's underestimated with
Japan and South Korea and Taiwan by
roughly the same so yes it's a growing
important country but it's really the
industrial region that's growing well
the let's take a look at Latin America
in grand area strategy it was just taken
for granted that we control that in
America period it's our backyard Henry
Stimson Secretary of War under Roosevelt
described it as our little region over
here which has never bothered anybody
that's as he was working to ensure that
other regional alliances all over the
world would be dismantled and while Iran
would be strengthened go on to say the
early seventies Richard Nixon at the
time when the next administration was
planning the destabilization of Chile in
order to impose stability at that time
the National Security Council the
highest planning body pointed out that
if we don't control Latin America we how
are we going to control the rest of the
world that's the easy one so we better
make sure we control Latin America
well that's changed in the last ten
years the South America for the first
time in
half a millennium since the European
explorers came South America has begun
to move towards independence towards
integration countries integrating with
one another prerequisite for
independence and also towards addressing
some of their horrendous internal
problems by now the United States has
been kicked out of every military base
in Latin America and South America
that's quite a
the Bush and Obama administrations had
hoped to maintain a couple of bases in
Colombia the one country that's more or
less under control but the Colombian
Constitutional Court has so far blocked
it actually the one major the one
remaining a major military base in the
continent is outside of North America is
in Honduras and very likely that's large
part of the reason why the unit what
Obama broke with Latin America and in
fact with most of the world by
supporting the military coup in Honduras
leaving a highly repressive and brutal
regime but with the military base intact
well last February February a year ago a
new organization was formed the
community of Latin American and
Caribbean states select it included all
states of the hemisphere apart from the
US and Canada anything like that was
just unthinkable in earlier years now
they're gonna have their first meeting
in July and it'll be worth keeping an
eye on it if that functions that's a
harsh blow to u.s. domination of its
traditional backyard well control of
America a lot of Latin America was
regarded from the very beginning as
central to grand area doctrine and in
fact us way beyond back to the Monroe
Doctrine but it was nowhere near as
crucial as control of the vast energy
resources of the Middle East what
President Eisenhower called the most
strategically important area of the
world the State Department described it
as the stupendous source of strategic
power probably the richest economic
prize in the world in the field of
foreign investment and that was a
of course the u.s. intended to keep for
itself and its allies in the unfolding
new world order after the Second World
War
well despite changes and there have been
plenty planners still adhere to the
doctrine that was expressed shortly
after the war by one of Roosevelt's
leading advisors a burly who said
pointed out that if we can control
Middle East energy resources that we
will have substantial control of the
world
it's not a small issue and it follows
that loss of that control would threaten
the proper whole project of global
dominance that was clearly articulated
during World War two and has been
implemented and sustained to the extent
possible since that day despite major
changes in world order well right now
that's threatened that's the
significance of what was happening it's
been happening for the last couple of
months in the Arab world spectacular a
display of courage dedication commitment
by popular forces outcomes uncertain but
a lot has been achieved and it's this is
extremely threatening to the United
States because it's threatening to bring
democracy and democracy if it means
anything it means that the will of the
population has some effect on policy not
just the masters and that's really a
threat domestically too and we know what
the will of the population we know a lot
about what the will of the population is
now it's not reported and it's known but
not reported but it's obviously known to
planners there are studies carried out
by the major US polling agencies they're
released by prestigious institutions
like the workings in student Washington
and they're very very striking so take a
gypped the most important country
in Egypt 90% of the population regard
the United States as the major threat to
their interests in fact they're so
critical of US policy that about 80
percent think the region would be more
secure if Iran had nuclear weapons to
counter us Israeli domination and the
figures are very small percentage maybe
10% in the region think of Iran as a
threat well the figures vary from
country to country but roughly like that
well as I say it's not recorded there's
not a single report in the United States
in the mainstream you can find it look
at the edges but obviously planners know
all about it well there's there's a
principle behind it the principle was
expressed quite accurately by the head
of the Carnegie Endowment the Middle
East research program the former high
Jordanian official that Marwin washa
that what he pointed out is that as long
as the populations are under control and
they are passive and apathetic then the
powerful can do what we like what they
like so therefore it's fine to disregard
public opinion until they get out of
control which is what's happening now
now that's an old principle and again if
the media and schools the universities
were doing their job everyone would know
what I'm gonna say because it's quite
old and important so go back to say 1958
President Eisenhower the President
Eisenhower was concerned about public
opinion in the Arab world he was
concerned about what he called a
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and not by the governments
which are more or less under control but
by the people and in that same year the
National Security Council produced
memorandums long Declassified which gave
the reasons it said there's a perception
in the Arab world that the United States
supports harsh and brutal dictatorships
and that we oppose democracy and
development now we do it because we want
to gain can make it maintain control
over their energy resources and went on
to say that this perception is more or
less accurate and furthermore that's
what we ought to be doing the operative
principles of foreign policy and world
order so as long as the mawashi air
doctrine holds populations are
controlled we don't care if there's a
campaign of hatred will go on and
control their resources and support
democracies and dictatorships and block
democracy and development well let's
move on to George Bush number two after
9/11 as you'll recall he gave a kind of
a plaintive speech in which he asked you
know why do they hate us and he
concluded that they hate our freedom
right after that the Pentagon initiated
a research study and science board which
concluded and responded to him he said
no they don't hate our freedom they hate
our policies another and it was
essentially a repetition of what the
National Security Council had said in
1958 they didn't add what we should
conclude it's not that they hate our
freedom it's that we hate their freedom
and there's a good reason because if
they are free they're gonna follow the
policies the will of the population and
that means the US are just going to be
driven out of the region that's obvious
from the campaign of hatred and
fifty-eight and everything since and the
contemporary polls we saw a pretty
dramatic demonstration of how educated
elite opinion interprets that right now
kind of striking that there wasn't any
commentary on it you've all followed
WikiLeaks I'm sure the most of the
WikiLeaks exposures the one that
received most attention
in the headlines you know with
enthusiastic commentary and so on was
that the Arabs support us policy on Iran
Iran being the main threat to the world
well that's a true of the Arab dictators
which is all they cared about but it's
dramatically false for the population
the population on the contrary strongly
opposes US policy and even calls for
Iran to have nuclear weapons however as
long as the Mosher doctrine holds you
know keeps the population or control who
cares
all educated opinion cares about is the
dictators and as long as they are
supporting us we don't care about the
population is very clearly Illustrated
but it is a problem and you can see it
right in front of your eyes day after
day Egypt is still under military rule
hasn't been a real large-scale social
and political change but there have been
changes and the new Egyptian government
is more responsive to the popular will
and things are happening that are
considered extremely threatening in the
United States there's good reasons why
we oppose democracy so for example a
couple of weeks ago the Egyptians
permitted Iranian ships to go through
the Suez Canal for the first time in 30
years breaking the u.s. policy of
isolation just a couple of weeks ago a
couple of days ago in fact Egypt
organized a unification agreement
between the two major Palestinian
factions Hamas and Gaza and rest
now that again is a very day Israel
reacted very harshly a us did too and
for good reasons for about twenty years
a major u.s. Israeli policy has been to
separate Gaza from the West Bank it's in
violation of the Oslo agreements 1993
which describe him as a territorial
unity but you know that was the policy
and it's been pretty successful but the
unification agreement if it holds might
overcome that furthermore unification
might make it easier might ease the way
towards diplomatic negotiations for a
political settlement of the
israel-palestine conflict that's been
one one of the ways of holding that off
has been to claim that the Palestinians
are to partner for peace well if you
look at the record again this doesn't
get reported but it's easy to discover
for 35 years the United States has
unilaterally been blocking a political
settlement it's alone in the world on
this along with this room
you can see it in Security Council votes
vetoes General Assembly resolutions
public statements and so on and in fact
if the unification agreement facilitates
the path towards negotiations US and
Israeli isolation is going to become so
dramatic that it's going to be hard even
for the press not to report it well
that's and certainly most of the rest of
the world understands so that's
dangerous the New York Times warned
about something else which they are
concerned about very much namely the
1979 peace treaty between Israel and
Egypt The Times reported the concerns in
Washington that
that treaty might be threatened it's
very unpopular among Egyptians and the
treaty they said is a cornerstone of the
region's stability well there's that
nice word stability again actually the
peace treaty is actually a cornerstone
of the region's instability very
dramatically when the peace treaty was
signed in 1979 and there's an
interesting history which we won't go
into but when it was signed Israel
responded rationally they concluded that
Egypt which is the main deterrent to his
Israeli actions only major military
force in the Arab world
so with Egypt neutralized Israel could
move ahead much more freely towards
integrating the occupied territories to
the extent taking them over to the
extent that it wanted it all illegal of
course and also by attacking its
northern neighbor Lebanon which they
proceeded to do right away major attack
killing tens of thousands of people well
that's instability in the in normal
meaning of the world word but it's
stability in the technical meaning push
it accords with us plans so that's why
the treaty is called a cornerstone of
the region stability kind of like it ran
well the u.s. reaction to the democracy
uprising and you can see all this
playing out very straightforwardly major
principle is democracies a real threat
so we've got to do something to deter it
well there are several categories of
states the most important are the
oil-rich states where the dictators are
reliable and obedient like say Saudi
Arabia
well there they're given free reign to
crush the demonstrations because we want
to keep things the way they are Saudi
Arabia for example there was a it was an
effort to have to join the democracy
uprisings but security presence was so
overwhelming that people were afraid
even to go out in the streets okay
no calm
about that the same thing happened in
queit also a reliable dictator the most
interesting cases Bahrain navaja Raymond
isn't all that important in itself
except that it hosts the u.s. 5th fleet
which is the major military force in the
region but crucially Bahrain is just a
couple miles from Saudi Arabia off the
coast it has a majority Shiite
population Eastern Saudi Arabia right
next door is also a majority Shiite and
both have Sunni dictatorships and is and
happens to be where most of Saudi oil is
says their deep concern that the major
oil resources in the region Eastern
Saudi Arabia and southern Iraq
southwestern Iran well mostly she I
might fall under Shiite control which
might move towards independence so
therefore any democracy movement in
Bahrain has to be crushed and it has
been crushed and violently Sudi that was
City led military invasion gave the
Bahraini security forces the capacity to
you know destroy the tent cities it
destroyed tougher that their version of
Tahrir Square Pearl Square to break into
the hospitals empty the hospitals
throughout the doctors and the patients
capture didn't torture
human rights activists it's a real
horror story going on right now the
destroying Shiite mosques all kinds of
atrocities virtually no comment that's
necessary to keep thee for the stability
of the reliable obedient oil-rich
dictators well take the countries that
don't have that had dictators but not a
lot of oil so for example Egypt and
Tunisia well in those cases the u.s.
followed a very standard game plan I'm
you have to be kind of blind not to see
it over and over again
through the years some favor
dictator gets into trouble and the
procedure is always the same say no
Somoza and Nicaragua Marcos and the
Philippines China and South Korea Bhutto
in the Congo the Suharto in Indonesia is
case after case what you do is support
them as long as possible
and if it becomes impossible to support
him like for example if the army turns
against him then show them send them
away somewhere and try to restore the
old regime as much as possible maybe
with new names it's exactly what's going
on in Egypt and in Tunisia not a right
in front of our eyes
a very familiar pattern some has it
works sometimes it doesn't that that's
the policy well that leaves one other
category an oil-rich dict dictator who
isn't reliable and there is such a case
that's Libya and here's what the US has
done is very and Britain and work
together is very striking
they've strongly supported Qaddafi I
don't have time to go into the details
if you like but up until the present
they've been very strongly supporting
him but now there's a chance to get rid
of him
and so that's what they're trying to do
you know just done before I came over
here I was listening watching BBC on
television now they're perfectly frank
about it the reporting says yeah we
support the rebels that's what we're
doing and the head of NATO was
interviewed and he said well you know
it's justified because the regional
powers asked us to the Arab League was
kind of a half-truth at least but the
Arab League did call for a no-fly zone
but it immediately retracted as soon as
it saw that the US Britain and France
were going way beyond the resolution to
protect civilians and we're just
remaining in the
rebellion was another small point at the
same time that the arab league called
for a no-fly zone over Libya it also
called for a no-fly zone over Gaza to
prevent further US Israeli attacks on
Gaza which is devastated the place that
literally didn't get reported in the
United States except way out at the
margins you can read about it in the
International Business press well that
we don't have to adhere to that call
because it doesn't accord with their our
goals
well the in Libya this the actual
intervention I mean you can say it's
right you can say it's wrong but at
least we're going to be honest about
what it is it's direct intervention on
the side of the rebels as not protecting
civilians just make try to see if our
side can win it's the it's kept the
intervention is carried out by France
Britain in the United States note that
those are the three traditional imperial
powers they're doing it in virtual
isolation
there's token participation by NATO very
little of in the Arab world where this
huge military forces in Egypt Saudi
Arabia nothing they don't want to be
involved a couple of reconnaissance
planes from Qatar Africa it's an African
country the African Union's calling for
diplomacy they don't want to be involved
they don't want the intervention of the
major regional power turkey also a huge
military force and NATO that they're not
trying to impose any no-fly zone didn't
want anything to do with it the
so-called BRICS countries Brazil Russia
India China South Africa the main
emerging countries since most of the
world they just completed a conference
in China and they came out with a
declaration opposing any military force
in Libya and calling for negotiations
and diplomacy
well again you can
whatever opinion you like but the
confront of the facts are quite clear
the imperial triumph or it is isolated
they are acting alone
it's another sign of the decline and the
capacity to rule the world just getting
more free and open and the same is true
in the case of Iran the United States is
extremely isolated on that the
non-aligned countries that's most of the
world they have been supporting the
Iran's right to enrich uranium
vigorously from the beginning well we
don't care about them the region I've
already mentioned in the region public
opinion
overwhelmingly supports not only Iran's
right to develop nuclear energy but even
to have nuclear weapons
well the mawashi doctrine tells us we
can ignore the regional population the
same is true of Turkey major power which
is nothing to do with the isolation in
fact they're increasing commercial
relations with Iran same is true of
Raziel the most respected country in the
south well the United States can
tolerate a Turkish and Brazilian
disobedience though with some dismay but
there's another country that's harder to
ignore that's China the Press warns that
China's investors and traders are now
filling a vacuum in Iran as businesses
from other countries mainly Europe pull
out in response to US demands and in
particular China is expanding its
dominant role in Iran's inner energy
industries and Washington nany doesn't
like it but it's reacting with a touch
of real desperation so the State
Department recently warned China
that if it wants to be accepted in the
international community meaning by the
US then it must I'm quoting skirt and
Eve it must not skirt and evade
international responsibilities which are
clear and what are the international
responsibilities well to follow us
orders China does observe UN sanctions
because they're mostly toothless and
they're criticized but it here for that
but they're not following unilateral US
sanctions and therefore they're not
meeting their international
responsibilities this just elicits
laughter in the Chinese Foreign Office
that the real threat of China is they
just can't be intimidated I mean their
picture is look we've been around for
3,000 years
the major civilization in the world we
have been fending off the barbarians we
don't care about them now and that's
that's frightening
I mean if
I mean if you're the Mafia Don and
people stop following orders you're in
serious trouble so that's the main
threat of China now there's also talk
about a military threat and in fact the
Pentagon just released a study of it
they say that China's military budget is
approaching 1/5 of what the Pentagon
spent to operate and carry out the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan a small fraction
of US military spending which is roughly
the same as the world combined
the New York Times reported that China's
expansion of military forces might deny
the ability of American warships to
operate in international waters off
China's coast what about international
waters off the u.s. Coast like say in
the Caribbean Sea the Chinese Navy
deploying there just imagine what would
happen if they did the strategic
analysis literature is quite interesting
the technical literature it speaks of a
classic security to not dilemma in the
us-china confrontation each side the
regards its primary interests at stake
so China's interests are the territorial
of the waters riddled near its border
and our interest is the borders right
near China's border that's a classic
security dilemma that's hard to deal
with and of course make sense if the
u.s. controls most of the world now you
look at the intellectual journals like
the New Republic recently expressed its
concern about the fact that China sent
ten warships through international
waters that just off the Japanese island
of Okinawa which indeed is a provocation
that unlike the fact which they don't
mention that Washington long ago
converted the island into a major
military base in defiance of the
protests of the people of Okinawa that's
not a provocation on the standard
principle that we own the world well
actually there is good reason for
China's neighbors to be concerned about
its growing military and commercial
clout and in the Middle East although
our public opinion supports an Iranian
nuclear weapons program I don't we
certainly shouldn't do so we should try
to do something to reduce or eliminate
that the nuclear weapons program not on
Iran but everywhere of the foreign
policy
well how can we do it foreign policy
literature is full of suggestions but
there's one that's missing the one that
can work namely moved to establish a
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle
East
that's here's another case where the
u.s. is almost totally isolated there
are regular review sessions of the
non-proliferation for the
non-proliferation treaty the latest was
about a year ago international support
for a nuclear weapons free zone was so
overwhelming that Obama had to formally
agree however he insisted that there be
a qualification namely Israel has to be
exempted and of course the u.s. is self
exempted from all international
obligations important fact not discuss
so what he said is it's a fine idea
but this isn't the time and furthermore
the u.s. insisted no proposal can call
for Israel's nuclear program to be
placed under the auspices of the
International Atomic Energy Agency or
can call for release of information
about Israeli nuclear facilities and
activities including information
pertaining to previous nuclear transfers
to Israel end of nuclear weapons free
zone
well these policies can persist as long
as we obey here the Mirage or doctrine
as long as we don't do anything about it
yeah and we can face the possibility of
the Iranian nuclear threat and a very
volatile region all that there is a
solution actually it's rarely noted in
fact almost never that the US and
Britain have a special responsibility to
move to a nuclear weapons free zone in
the Middle East it's a very good reason
for that
when the US and Britain invaded Iraq
they tried to construct a legal cover
Reeth in legal covers fell apart pretty
soon they cover was that Iran you'll
recall I'm sure erect that was
developing weapons of mass destruction
and it was there for violating a
Security Council resolution of 1991
which called on them to eliminate their
WMD programs well we know the fate of
that but putting that aside to go back
and look at that Security Council
resolution it committed the signers to
work to establish a nuclear weapons free
zone in the Middle East so the US and
Britain above all other countries have a
special responsibility for this and us
isolation in blocking it is a serious
threat to the world and shouldn't be
tolerated but that's up to us nobody
else can do anything
well the I mentioned that the doctrines
the hegemonic doctrines that were
formulated during World War two they've
they're still prevailing at least in
rhetoric but the power to implement them
is notably declining some of the major
reasons are actually domestic the
American Society now for last 30 years
is being quite consciously undermined by
the masters of mankind at home since the
1970s there's been a very sharp change
in the economy has moved from production
to financialization the back at that
time financial institutions were a small
fraction of the economy and they're
doing what they're supposed to do in a
state capitalist economy they were
taking unused resources like somebody's
bank account and transferring them to
productive use that's what they're for
that's gone since the 1970s that's
almost totally gone by now
they're not a few percentage of the
economy neither by 2007 right before the
crash they created now they had 40% of
corporate profits and their activities
have maybe no social utility maybe
harmful effects they don't contribute to
the health of society their ways of
making tons of money by a financial
manipulation of trickery well there's no
time to go into the details but if you
look into it there have been a variety
of factors since the 1970s that have
interacted if connection the urge to
create a vicious cycle of radical
concentration of wealth which is mostly
in the top fraction of 1% of the
population that means CEOs hedge fund
management hedge van hedge fund managers
and so on such a small percentage of the
population it's not even captured by the
census figures if the careful analysis
to find it that's the main source of the
extreme inequality well then we go to
Adam Smith's Maxim the concentration of
economic power leads to concentration of
political power which in turn leads to
state policies government policies that
increase this concentration that fiscal
policies like taxation you might say
when John Boehner says everything's on
the table except raising taxes for the
rich seems like there's plenty more like
it
rules of corporate governance
deregulation which is great for the
financial institutions leads to repeated
crashes and a lot more so you've have
this vicious cycle at the same time part
of it is that the costs of electric
electoral campaigns are skyrocketing
which drives the political parties
deeper into the pockets of concentration
of capital increasingly financial
capital for the Republicans just
reflexive for the Democrats who is oh
they are now what used to be called
moderate Republicans for them they're
not far behind
well while all this is going on and
income and wealth and power becoming
extremely narrowly concentrated for most
people for the last 30 years real
incomes have pretty much stagnated the
people have been getting by with
increased work hours way beyond Europe
no the debt and asset inflation like the
housing bubble which is regularly
destroyed by the financial crisis crises
that began as soon as the regulatory
apparatus began to be dismantled under
Reagan now none of this makes any
difference it's fine for the very
wealthy especially for the financial
institutions which are at the heart of
it do they benefit from the government
insurance policy that Neil Barofsky
mentioned what's called too big to fail
so what that means is the banks and the
investment firms to make risky
transactions they get rich rewards that
happens with the risky transaction and
you can ignore what the economists call
an externality something that doesn't
figure in market transactions in this
case it's a systemic risk the risk that
the whole system will collapse if
something goes wrong with your
transaction but you that's a footnote
forget about it
well inevitably the system crashes and
then what they can do is run to the
nanny state that they nurture and ask
for a taxpayer bailout clutching their
copies of Hayek and Milton Friedman and
and and so on now that's been a that's
been a regular process since the Reagan
years each crisis is more extreme than
the last for the public that is real
unemployment in the countries at the
level of the Great Depression for much
of the population the Goldman Sachs
meanwhile the main architects of the
current crisis they're richer than ever
bigger than ever and they've just
quietly announced seventeen and a half
billion dollars in compensation for last
year with CEO Lloyd Blankfein they're
receiving a twelve and a half million
dollar bonus and his base salary more
than triple but we have to make sure
that he doesn't get taxed because that
would harm jobs you know I won't talk
about elections they're just by now a
charade run by the PR industry
well if barely skimmed the surface of
these critical issues but I don't want
to end without mentioning one more
externality that is dismissed in market
systems now that is the fate of the
species if you're the CEO of a
corporation or an investment bank that's
something you don't take into account in
market transactions it's an institute
it's a fact about market systems
well systemic risk in the financial
system that can be remedied by the
taxpayer but nobody's going to come to
the rescue if the environments destroyed
and that we should recognize as close to
an institutional imperative as things
now stand business leaders
business leaders are quite openly
declaring that they're conducting
massive propaganda campaigns to convince
the population that anthropogenic global
warming human contribution to global
warming is just some kind of liberal
hoax now the people who are carrying out
these campaigns they understand
perfectly well that the threat is very
grave but they have a institutional role
they have to maximize short-term profit
and if they don't somebody they'll be
kicked out and somebody else will come
in who will do it
that's institutional fact it's not an
individual one which makes the problem
much more severe now this particular
vicious cycle could well be lethal and
to just get a sense of how they how
serious the threat is it's really enough
to have a look at the new Congress that
came in propelled into power by business
funding and propaganda almost all our
climate deniers that they've already
been cutting measures that might
mitigate the environmental catastrophe
kind of a one indication of how far the
country has shifted to the far right is
that they're basically trying to right
now one of the things they're trying to
destroy is the Environmental Protection
Agency that was instituted under Richard
Nixon who was in fact the last liberal
president literally ever since then it's
and worse still a number of them are
really true believers like the head of
one of the the newly elected Republican
congressman is the head of one of the
subcommittee's on the environment as you
may have read he explained that the
global warming can't be a problem
because God promised Noah that there
wouldn't be another flood well you know
if that was happening in some tiny
country somewhere we could laugh but not
when it's happening in the richest and
most powerful country in the world and
before we laugh we might also bear in
mind that the current economic crisis is
traceable in substantial measure to a
fanatic faith in dogmas such dogmas as
the efficient market hypothesis and in
general to what Nobel laureate Joseph
Stiglitz fifteen years ago called the
religion that markets know best that
made it unnecessary the religious faith
made it unnecessary to notice an eight
trillion dollar housing bubble that had
no basis whatsoever in economic
fundamentals and devastated the economy
when it inevitably burst
well it's useful to contemplate what's
being done in the richest and most
powerful country in human history errors
and in the poorest country of South
America so in the US that Congress is
taking the lead in undermining any hope
for preventing catastrophe and that
again is driven by deeply rooted
institutional factors bad people first
country in South America is Bolivia
that's taken the lead internationally in
efforts to protect the environment
it's
this most recent effort just a couple of
weeks ago was to pass legislation
granting rights to the natural world
now sophisticated Westerners and
ridicule such knifed a but unless we can
gain some of the sensibility of the
indigenous majority and Bolivia the last
laugh may be on us well all of this sent
a lot more can proceed as long as the
moocher doctrine prevails as long as the
population is passive apathetic angry
diverges the consumerism hatred of the
vulnerable and so on as long as that
remains true then the powerful can do as
they like and those who survive can
contemplate the ruins but we all know
that we don't have to obey the masher
doctrine that's what we're here for now
we're here right now to celebrate 75
years of courageous refusal to do it
with many noteworthy successes and that
leave they leave a legacy the legacy
that we can carry forward often been
done in the past it's being done right
now in Tahrir Square many other places
under conditions far harsher than those
that we face so fortunately the future
is very much in our own hands
