one of them was we heard today about
wool then just sit down negotiate maybe
they get someone
my view is there's there's nobody
Palestinian
oh she ate without preconditions but the
facts are very clearly exactly the
opposite
Israel imposes commercial preconditions
one precondition is that central Israel
United States they impose the condition
that the negotiations have to be under
the US aegis that's already
for the last 35 years the United States
has unilaterally
International various investments the
first it came to the United Nations
Security Council 1976 and brought by the
Arab states us Pete came again 19
because it doesn't
General Assembly constant but support so
for the u.s. to if the were legitimate
additions so they would be organized by
some respected neutral party and on one
side us
the world that negotiations that's the
first precondition guarantee sure that
second precondition is that the
settlement expansion must continue
justice security council repeatedly
so the second
but in this framework that meanwhile
Israel with us
work can systematically take over the
parts of the West Bank once
the picture this there's no problem
yeah
another the United States and just
dedicated
the us-israel been systematically trying
to separate and the reason it means that
if any
ever set up some West Bank will be
imprisoned because the only access to do
the first carefully monitor the US
do that our concept of democracy as you
do obesity around so they put it along
the way
in the first free elections in the US
it was immediately standard procedure
so these immediately
to try to overthrow the collection I
must
military coup what we want that's
incorrect
so that
that's the first
we've got our
you think they said nobody gave me a
dirty look do you think things could
have been different
in the early 70s after the occupation my
babies treated that they don't get
recorded to the press but they're there
so in 1971 President
and so the only reference that
Palestinians with
so a full-piece driving out thousands of
farmers
destroying town
was initiating plans too
city city
was beginning these programs and the
editors
should they security
should they accept security in truth is
this non-expansion was a choice security
risk management
well it was an internal debate in the US
government the Secretary of State
William Rogers was in favor
so he was in favor of the Henry
Kissinger
this
we should have known associations
that is directly
big business kissing you're realized at
that point that you can't just
in which the u.s. is now part of the
u.s. Israel essentially except
though from their way too much so a 99
right us trying
vast amount of suffering distraction
finally they more or less accept that he
was
but try to find that
yes please I don't mean to stay on the
same topic I'm sorry I want me to stay
on the same topic I'm sure there's other
questions and you asked but oh yeah when
you were talking about how our form of
democracy is kind of like do what we say
or else and I know you're here to speak
to the larger question of the United
States and the United Nations you still
can't hear me I'm sorry I know you're
here to speak the larger question of the
United States and the United Nations
would you feel that this whole situation
that you're on running here with the
Israelis and the Palestinians
effectively here tarnishes or minimizes
the United Nations in terms of the fact
that the settlements are direct
violation of international law their
occupation of the Golan Heights and the
shovel arms is it illegal
about it the United Nations
the world
question
when the United States
the record is very clear but a us
the way that's presented here the United
Nations
Trotsky is separated to to see you in
person I see your appearances with any
good democracy now my question he with
regard to you book published in 2006 the
famous States ever since the publication
of is who developments pretty much
reaffirm your views that failed state
United States the pain stick into into
dimension two aspects our rather of
rather pretty much and you were failing
state one with regard to the decision
last year citizens united Supreme Court
versus the Federal Election Commission
one to United States we active policy
ports you have Springs like Egypt's
revolution in Tunisia so with that I
would like to see you be use whether
that's today the Saints in the
publication of
complexity of facing US diplomats with
regard to what's happening in Egypt
because between the us very easily take
a look at whole of their careful
regular careful studies they're not
reporting the press
opinion
opposition policy is so strong that
about 80% of
but given the enormous threat posed by
the
that's one just the United States
so there's no that's fabrication you
have to say that happy believe
these are the things that work
and the introductions preemption what
the introduction says
it was free and he says
unpopular ideas can be suppressed
without
as part of its because the press is
owned by a wealthy man
you think unless you have that and still
interview
and that's why you can get
Supreme Court ruling in January 2010
details but in effect
that's been working for many years on
what he calls the investment theory of
politics
the basic penis that elections are
vacations and which groups of investors
coalesce and invest to control the state
Obama's main funding support paying for
the financial institution that is
policies ever since
that citizens united
so sure this
I mean there's a lot of light
but even in the election the brave one
about two-thirds of people voted for
you don't expect anybody doesn't expect
these are effective they make different
promises to different audiences very
carefully organized but the PR agencies
to run their campaigns
and then there were dishes
problems lack of jobs so there ought to
be a joblessness
but the banks
they care about the dentist because
they're afraid in the future
inflation
inflation is good for borrowers
right alright suppose you look at the
deficit pushing the size of pension
plans are there ways of dealing
first of all get the rich to pay taxes
preserve
whatever's gonna command this is exact
and in fact there's one
which would eliminate the deficit
immediately effectiveness of circles the
world
well the United States simply had the
healthcare system of other industrial
countries
all right when we have
you can't touch that insurance companies
in the bank
maybe they would assume a fraternity
with the thesis you know that even being
there species are born with this
linguistic acquisition device
now this is a kind of you know this
thesis but my dear might say that it is
it is an underdetermined thesis like the
behavior istic in depression of language
what will be your response from that
heaviness
that's something that you compare to the
ISM do you think Jim
respect
the neighbours position must be a
skinner radical behave what skinner had
students and the students believe there
were
but probably something to her a name for
you things like
Skinner students training
and it looked like he seemed to have the
answer
in discovery they discovered that when
they were tracking an animal they could
get everything to work
work up to a certain point at a certain
point it started to regress so for
example they were training the train
service animals they're trying to be
the more you ran the reinforcement
schedule was fine better and better
and the layin
later
the skitter was training pigeons
it was just animals
congratulations
a couple of mice
it's gonna on the other hand
with that current situation in the
Middle East specifically Indonesian so
with the dilution started in January the
military chose to be neutral and States
to the people but they were wrong by
past week and Friday is to open fire
against evil and use that here yes
against uprising and in my opinion I
think that people have a long experience
to run the state but at the same time
the new people you know didn't have much
a specific date for the pre-election the
military no for the resident for the
British edition they don't have they
never mentioned that
and you all say you know we want to stay
in power for the same time remotely I
don't know I do think they are very
serious about it I don't think we want
to stay in power
but what they are most serious about the
election and just you know giving a
country
as long as they can and they know that
the West
understand they regarded the military
and sooner or later
and there are other parents military
would like to run an election in which
the only participant
the United States we're supporting them
was considered by the United States and
Britain
one of the more notorious terrorist
but around 1990 the US Britain decided
to
Western corporations also wanted South
African white business community what
they wanted to do
and that's pretty much what the older
team is in place for the majority of
as better worth
but there's
yes please what are some of your
suggestions
so do you have any suggestions
the United Nations in response to crisis
would be for the United States stop the
story is the United States stop
undermining it every time it gets
nevertheless the windows
you
the United States international crisis
and the u.s. followed the blue lagoon
dirt majority
yes who is an expert we sought capital
punishment in 34 states in the u.s. we
spell capital punishment in 34 states in
the US how do you feel about the death
penalty
especially after
my very idea that is impressive
I mean the state should not
that's just the beginning it's not just
the death penalty the incarceration
and it's a recently the 1970s the United
States was pretty much like
incarceration a little bit beginning
around 1980 incarceration was started in
Greece
and if you look at what's driving it
it's mostly
furthermore it's it's extremely racist
and then it is where appended
three-strikes-you're-out stay doesn't
mean our serration system
is not it doesn't try to rehabilitate it
just creates
and
get rid of the superfluous population
three close race class correlation in
the United States
starting Saturday change
financialization
for production work meaning less less
need for working-class people and of
course the first to get
but is technique for getting rid of
in jail
the air is getting jet
gentrify the areas in New York City
that's pretty dated some striking
occasions yes
it's pretty sad
so how do you convince the the
government United States government to
IVA is all the choices right we
understand that we have there are many
problems right the government is of
stock of us is of stock this government
is obstructed to many like what we doing
gross injustice to its own people but
how do you convince that the government
of the coalition corporations right is
Elias to change the course of action to
change
but again in Egypt right yeah
the mass population post Hosni Mubarak
and then again it's like midday you know
back power to give up but again it came
back right how do you use please see in
any near future that means you know like
Martin a large mass marginalized right
mass population nor Kelly at Marseilles
unit area right writing out and the
changing the structure not only in one
geographic area
and we saw how this college is like go
to say my university nineteen fifty
years ago when I go
which
wait males
we walk down the halls today half women
that 1/3 minorities in formal dress
relations
slavery
yes if you were President Obama how do
you try to run the Congress what do you
think about them and what they are doing
about you know trying to solve this
crisis and also what you sing about a
Occupy Wall Street
it's not as far as
a large majority population
quite a large majority thinks this jobs
problem
so the president could say okay we're
going to mobilize new population to
force through the things corporations
the same is for one safe healthcare
pretty large majorities I did a favor of
national military when it even when it
came down to the public option about the
pharmaceutical corporation us having
laws
Oh
there
is a pretty free country
you are free free
I thought rolling around in my head for
most of this semester it kind of goes to
what we were talking about just before
about health care and about a couple of
things I'm taking a class right now
there seems to be this underlying tone
right now in a lot of the Republican
debates and things like that that if
people are willing to subjugate
themselves to the Wills of the market
that will all end up better again I
think economic theory is pretty
classically shown that that's just not
the case you can comment maybe on why
this theory has kind of come around that
subjugated people's markets and civil
markets people
kind of a semi
that stuff stays safe it's in the States
animated research
so for example everybody now workers did
the skill of making work that had been
done creative work
and turning it into a show anymore
there's one part of the is it does run
pretty much market 91c good deal
regulation then it became pretty much
the first
and if we're paying attention we work
out that deal so that works out okay for
us but there's something we don't
externalities but the effect on others
so if I buy a car enough favorite place
I don't
this congestion price of gas per each
individual may be small
and you don't know in the case of
financial institutions the thing that is
not paid attention to what's called
systemic risk
so if Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs makes a risky investment
meaning they had a lot of profit from
them if they're paying attention
themselves but they don't insure the
system against collapsing so the risks
the collapses are going to build in the
resistant however they don't follow this
concluded they believed in markets both
in statics to be Morgan Chase Citigroup
Bank America the only bankers because
when they crash capitalist system
that's not what happened they call on
the nanny state
we'll say Tea Party I do ask them what
they think about particular issues that
they're mostly Social Democratic so they
think there should be more spending on
until more on education that more on
assistance to but not welfare you can't
have money from welfare because Reagan
demonizing
and it's the same issue with the
antigens so there's slogans which you're
supposed to believe don't believe any
situation
