it was very striking change of opinion
after the 1967 war before the war
Zionism wasn't much of an issue even the
Holocaust wasn't the new york times our
example was pretty much a non Zionist
newspaper a commentary magazine which is
now extreme supporter of Israel that was
non-zionist in fact so a neutral on
Israel that design established a
competing journal to to try to mobilize
the Jewish community and Norman
Podhoretz
who's now the editor of commentary was
the editor of commentary and very
passionately pro-israel you read his
writings up to the 67 war and barely
barely mentioned it wasn't a concern or
an interest and as an engine of the the
whole the Holocaust museums holocaust
courses Studies programs almost entirely
of post 1967 for issue it's not because
the Holocaust became more important
after 1967 I mean anything it was more
important in the late 1940s when you
could actually do something to save the
survivors and all of this was clearly
time to justify the occupation and it
also was related to a shift in US
government policy before 1967 Israel was
kind of an ally but not a particularly
important one after 1967 the current a
unique relationship between Israel in
the United States was established and
educated opinion tends on almost every
issue to conform pretty well to
government policy
the press wasn't a scholarship academics
public intellectuals and so on not just
on this issue so as Israel became
leading a strategic asset as it was
called what the Nixon administration
called a cop on the beat to protect the
energy systems that the u.s. relies on
opinion changed radically in fact
there's another aspect to the sort of
official narrative if you like and that
is that the United States is an honest
broker trying to mediate between two
difficult partners so look at the
coverage of this vertical the piece
current piece the current peace process
the u.s. the picture is the US is in the
middle trying very hard to conciliate
the two opposing partners who were being
very difficult than dragging their feet
and we offer them inducements and so on
I said total myth if there was a if
there were real negotiations on one side
there would be some neutral moderator
and I don't know who maybe from Finland
or someplace and on one side would be
the United States and Israel on the
other side would be the world literally
I mean for decades there has been an
overwhelming international consensus on
a political settlement of the conflict
namely a settlement on the
internationally recognized border with
perhaps a minor and mutual modification
some kind of trade off that's official
u.s. wording from the time when the US
was still part of the world back in the
late 60s since
since then the US have just been
blocking it that began in January 1976
when the US for the first time he to the
Security Council resolution calling for
a two-state settlement and I won't run
through the history but it comes right
up to the present by now the
international consensus is literally
overwhelming includes the non-aligned
countries Europe includes the Arab
states the Arab League includes the
Organization of Islamic states which
includes a grand in fact includes every
relevant partner except the US and
Israel
