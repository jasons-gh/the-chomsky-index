Locke Hume the English clayton s others
that they understood that the concept of
you like if of an object is not
individuated by identifiable physical
properties so you read lock on person
for example this is persons they even
put in these terms but what he if you
look at the kind of thought experiments
Locke carried out with from what if you
have two minds and same body that kind
of thing what he's actually saying is
that our concept of person is based on
some notion like psychic continuity ok
psychic continuity is not a physical
property it's not something a physicist
can discover it's something that we're
imposing on the world it's like the
rigidity principle effect for Locke
he says person is what he calls a
forensic concept it carries with it
notions like responsibilities and rights
well you know physicists can't look at
an object so pious responsibilities and
rights activism this is known in the
history of philosophy there's a recent
book on it by Galen Strawson who brings
up these things he unfortunately doesn't
refer to the history about them because
nobody knows it but the but that's
correct and and that's just true of
everything including Cal's so you can
quickly make a simple thought
experiments that show that notions like
Cal are also based on psychic continuity
among other properties in fact there's
some a part of this is very familiar to
everyone fairy tales
infants have no problem understanding
fairytales that's easy you know but just
think of the standard fairytale you know
the Wicked Witch cast a spell on the
handsome prince and terms that turns him
into a frog let's say for the rest of
the story the prince has all the
physical properties of a frog all of
them then the beautiful princes kill
kisses the frog becomes the handsome
prince again that means it always was
the prince didn't matter what its
physical characteristics were because
it's because what makes it a person is
this strange property of psychic
continuity that runs through the whole
thing always and you can do the same
there's similar stories with animals you
know turned into something and then turn
back into themselves and I children have
no problems with that
that's perfectly straightforward because
their concepts are simply not based on
physical properties of course in part
they are like you don't distinguish you
know say a cow
house or something but it's only a small
part of it
most of our concepts even if the
simplest notions are pretty much like
the rigidity principle you see them a
certain way because of the way you
interpret the world and you can't get
that by association and causality so I
think Jerry's approach is and every it's
not just him everyone's is hopeless from
the start in fact I think if you look
closely you I think you find that in a
human language there really is no
reference no notion of reference or
denotation there's ways of interpreting
the world based on our internal
conceptual systems but they do not set
up a relationship between an internal
symbol like a word and some mind
independent entity which was what
reference your denotation would have to
be and in fact feel it is your
philosophy and some of the famous
conundrums have to do with this so it
takes a the ship of thesis you know the
dark story the story is that a thesis on
a ship in the ocean and the variants of
any one of the boards rods throws the
board over word over board replaces it
by a different board this keeps going
until finally every board has been
replaced and it's still the ship of
theseus although all the physical
properties have changed well that the
conundrum
when you add say that there's somebody
on the shore who's picking up the old
boards and putting it back together and
rebuilds the original ship that which
one is the ship of theses nobody has an
answer
and the reason is our cognitive systems
are not designed so they can deal with a
question like that actually I tried this
out with my ridiculously small sample of
my grandchildren once they made me watch
some space program
you know Star Trek or something where
they have this device on the spaceship
in which a person can go into it and be
transported somehow reconstructed on
another planet okay so nobody has any
problem with that but then I asked them
what would happen if the person who was
reconstructed on the other planet was
still in the box that he went into which
one would be the person that's the ship
of theseus they were stuck with that
they had different answers but basically
had no answer and I think if you look at
pricklies puzzle it's pretty much the
same the puzzle dissolves if you don't
assume that there is an entity a mind
independent entity that worked like
Londoner had a recipe and so on are
referring to but if there is no such
relation in language then the puzzle
can't be formulated and of course
they're going to be questions you can't
answer like which is that you know which
is the ship or who's the bird which is
the person in the box but there's no
reason we should be able to answer them
of why should our cognitive systems be
developed so that any question you come
up with we haven't
answer - they're not those are the
traditional puzzles and to find out why
they're unanswerable we have to look
into the nature of our conceptual
systems and I think it's here that ideas
like say Jerry's that just found her
right at the beginning because there are
no there is no way of all they try any
that any word you can think of no matter
how simple you'll find that it it's the
concept is individuated by non physical
properties actually this was noticed by
Aristotle Aristotle talks about it he
talks about it in metaphysical terms so
he asks what's a house you know what's
the definition of house he's not doesn't
say the definition of the word house the
definition of the thing this is in the
metaphysics and he says the definition
of house is a combination of matter and
form the face of the matter is on board
and bricks and stuff like that and the
form is what it's used for what the
design is things like that which are you
know this is all later reconstructed in
the 17th century and mr. melodical terms
these is the cognitive structures
without hairstyles metaphysics any more
matter and form but the basic idea is
right that what constitutes a concept
for us is some combination of things we
perceive and constructions that we
impose on it by their complicated
cognitive systems for which things like
a second continuity and design and use
and so on are critical now if there's
something that looks like a house say
but it's used just to store books it's a
library it's not a house and this holds
of every term you can think of River
tree almost everything maybe everything
everything has been looked at
