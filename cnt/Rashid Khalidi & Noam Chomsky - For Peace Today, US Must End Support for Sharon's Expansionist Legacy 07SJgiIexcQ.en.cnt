the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
the former israeli prime minister ariel
sharon has died he died on Saturday
after eight years in a coma he was 85
years old our guests are professor Abby
Schleim at Oxford University where he is
a professor emeritus there of
international relations Noam Chomsky the
world renowned linguist political
dissident author and Rashid holiday Arab
mare Arab studies professor at Columbia
University the Edwards Saeed professor
of Arab studies you were just talking
about the New York Times and how they
covered what happened at Sabra and
Shatila and the direct responsibility
that RL sharone linking to documents of
sure owns responsibility and us
responsibility elaborate further on that
and then how it's his life is being
described today in the same pages I
described it as the apotheosis of Ariel
Sharon he's being turned from a war
criminal and a mass murderer which he
was into a God in the American much of
the American media the New York Times
has played an enormous role in this
instead of for example running their own
op-ed which was published a little over
a year ago which lays out in damning
detail from documents in the Israel
State Archives Israeli and American
responsibility notably Sharon's
responsibility for this massacre they
republished on their own in their online
edition yesterday an op ed sheeran in
which he justifies the war it has been a
degrading spectacle to watch the
american and the israeli media turn this
man into as he said a man of peace
something that he could never possibly
have been described as why does
Professor avi Schleim why does ariel
sharon hold the special place he does
and the annals of Israeli history nam
trong ski reminded us that one shouldn't
speak ill of the recently dead so i
would like to say something positive
about ariel sharon
which explains both his popularity with
one segment of the Israeli population
and the revealing of Sharon by another
segment of the Israeli population and
the point is that towards the end of his
active life shall run finally understood
the limits of military power he had
always been a proponent of Greater
Israel but he understood that the facts
of democracy worked against Israel so he
didn't he did not jettison the dream of
Greater Israel but it scaled it down to
what he thought was realistic for Israel
to maintain in the long run so he had a
strategy of redrawing the borders of
Greater Israel unilaterally stage one
was building the wall on the West Bank
and stage two was the unilateral
withdrawal from gaza in august 2005 and
now the withdrawal from gaza was not
part of any negotiations of overall
peace deal with the Palestinian
Authority it was a unilateral move
undertaken in Israel's interest so sure
on we drew from Gaza but he wanted to
consolidate Israel's presence on the
West Bank and this got him into trouble
with the right wing of the his own party
the Likud Party and with the settler
community so he quit early could and he
set up a new center party Kadima but
Kadima did not survive Sharon's
political demise today Kadima has two
seats in the hundred and twenty member
knesset so Sharon's last mini effort to
realign Israeli politics ended in total
failure he's enduring legacy in Israel's
history is that he empowered and
emboldened some of the most xenophobic
aggressive racist expansionist and
intransigent elements in Israel's
dysfunctional political system which
professor holiday another thing that
might be mentioned about Gaza is that
there's a there's a huge debate in
Israel about whether the withdrawal was
a good thing or a bad thing the
withdrawal did not change the situation
of Gaza as being completely under
Israeli control which it is to this day
so is israel withdrew its settlers and
withdrew its troops from within the gaza
strip but it completely controls the
strip from without it is the largest
open-air prison in the world Sharon also
had a notorious period as commander of
the Southern Command in which he
participated in the savage repression of
resistance inside Gaza killing thousands
of hundreds of them well many hundreds
of Palestinian militants destroying
thousands of homes as part of a huge
repression of the resistance Noam
Chomsky dev Weiss glass top aide to
Ariel Sharon described withdrawal from
gaza by saying quote the significance of
our disengagement plan is the freezing
of the peace process that supplies the
formaldehyde necessary so there is no
political process with Palestinians
explain what he meant and how that
translates today to the so-called peace
process that's going on motive nice
class understood the situation very well
the Oslo Accords in 1993 determined that
the Gaza Strip in the West Bank are a
single territorial entity which cannot
be divided immediately of the United
States and Israel
I said about separating the two and
making sure that they would not be
united and this is extremely significant
and not only for the people of Gaza but
for the prospects of any viable
Palestinian entity the west bank is
essentially in prison it's a one access
to the outside world would be through
gadget access through the sea through
the air there was an airport and so on
by breaking Gaza from separating guys
are from the West Bank that undercuts
whatever limited possibility there might
be for a meaningful Palestinian
self-determination device boss pointed
out that what he meant is in fact as he
said the Israel will keep the people in
Gaza on a diet we won't let them starve
to death that won't look good in the
international world we'll just give them
just enough to stay barely alive in this
open-air prison as Russia totally did
correctly described it and they'll be
separated from the West Bank meanwhile
both the wall the separation wall
actually an annexation wall that fair
uninitiated and other development and
settlement projects including in the
Jordan Valley will effectively Canton
eyes whatever is left of two Palestinian
administration and surrounded so that it
has so that it is another kind of prison
surrounded completely by Israel and it
says Jordanian Ally actually a professor
slams it's only very important in his
life his first comment at the very end
all of this can happen because of what
he called Israel ironically Israel's
little friend because the United States
authorizes it supports it provides the
requisite
a diplomatic economic military support
and also ideological support namely by
assault by the process of reshaping and
falsifying what is underway this is
quite reminiscent this is not novel
unfortunately if you look at the history
of South Africa was pretty similar by
1960 the South Africans knew that they
were becoming a pariah state South
African foreign minister called in the
American ambassador I told him look we
know everyone's gonna vote against us in
the United Nations kind of all kinds of
problems but as long as you support us
it doesn't make any difference and
that's the principle that they adhered
to right to the end of the Reagan years
1988 us along with Britain was still
vetoing and blocking resolutions which
would call for any kind of sanctions and
supporting South African atrocities and
crimes this is a kind of a replay of it
as long as the United States the most
powerful state in the world continues to
play it's crucially supportive role
unfortunately these developments will
continue and this is a crime
significance for other people like us
for American citizens to our
responsibility Chevron may have had
indirect as a cotton Commission and it's
whitewash claimed in direct
responsibility for sovereignty of
actually direct responsibility and we
have direct responsibility for the fact
that our own government is virtually
facilitating all of this what could
carry do right now what should we do and
what should what do you feel John Kerry
should do what John Kerry should do is
insist on implementing a
very broad international consensus a
virtually Universal call inquiry to
state settlement on the internationally
recognized border which is as I said
before the 1949 ceasefire line possibly
with minor and mutual adjustments which
was a u.s. point five seconds yeah and
this is supported by the entire world
it's been blocked by the United States
for 35 years which is just that policy
join the world and the carry out
measures which might conceivably bring a
semi-decent peace we have to leave it
