so
professor chomsky i understand there's a
there's a rumor circulating in ireland
uh that you may be joining the gaelic
athletic association
is there any marriage in that claim i'm
sure i'm going to be one of the
major players in the next championship
is this an aspiration that you've always
held maybe maybe you could give me a
little bit of information about how your
relationship to the gaelic football
gaelic athletic association come about
through the palestine work
i mean i've i've met people associated
with it
through common interest in palestine
and that's about the limits of my
association
okay some very wonderful people in fact
like john hurston
just got back from the free gaza
experience quite a story to tell
and in fact started a gaelic
association club in gaza
i mean the fact that there is a
connection of that of that nature
is a way of
building up consciousness and awareness
of the situation there and what we can
do about it actually i was
i was in ireland a couple of months ago
and was
strict to see a substantial popular
sympathy for
the suffering and
horrible oppression of gaza and
especially in
i noticed it specifically in belfast you
know
and that was impressed by it
do you think our there's a consciousness
in ireland for international struggles
that
maybe is different than elsewhere there
has been some times
so for example during the 1980s
when the us was essentially at war with
central america
that carrying out there was the reagan
administration was carrying out
and supporting a horrendous terrorist
war in central america
and a good deal of the information about
it
good deal of information about it did
come
from through ireland ireland had special
connections the war was to a substantial
extent of war against the church
and there were irish tradition of irish
priests in
central america who and through that
connection
information was coming back where i
could read things in the irish press
that
i didn't confined here
and there seemed to be a support for it
a
popular concern over the atrocities
going on there
and uh
i mean ireland itself has had uh
800 years of oppression which i
i suppose it creates some sensitivity to
what it means for others
ireland is going like much of the world
is going through some dramatic changes
at the moment
particularly in terms of the role of
state the role of the banks
the role of the church and your own
experiences of coming and going from
ireland
and how do you see the country evolving
and
how do you see the future for ireland in
the case of belfast
i i hadn't been there for 15 years the
last time i was there was
1993. at that time it was a real war
zone as was the whole
environment south armor and so on
today it's at least on the surface at
peace
there are tensions and there doesn't
take long to
notice their manifestations but
it's more or less peaceful the
major conflicts have
been substantially resolved and there's
a lesson there
as long as the british responded to
ira terror by just more violence
it was it simply stimulated the cycle of
violence
uh violence and retaliation
as soon as they began with some
useful u.s intervention
george mitchell bill clinton they began
to pay some attention to the
legitimate grievances that lay behind
the violence then it became possible to
deal with
and when there were some moves made to
deal with those and they were legit and
the violence subsided and finally as
it declined almost not to nothing but
certainly nothing like what it was a few
years ago
and that's a general that's true
generally
where there is terrorist violence it
comes from
something and quite often it's
it has its roots and legitimate
grievances
which should be attended to quite apart
from the violence
but when they are addressed seriously
that offers a constructive way to
undercut
and maybe eliminate the violence and the
confrontations
the republic is a different story
it went through a period of
a living in a
fairy tale euphoria there was a moment
when ireland was able to capitalize on
the fact that
uh it had a
an educated skilled population
thanks to substantial estate investment
and had an entry into the european
market
so it was a perfect place for american
firms to invest
and that led to a false prosperity
the numbers were real like ireland
looked like one of the richest
places in the world but it was all built
on sand
the economy was not developing
internally
it was
it was mostly
like ireland became one of the main
exporters of pharmaceuticals for example
but not because ireland had developed a
pharmaceutical industry or a software
industry or so on but
it was a convenient place for
mostly american firms to invest
and enter into the
european market that was clearly
a temporary phenomenon the
the opportunity was wasted through
a lot a lot of plain robbery
if you look at what happened uh
fake wealth
housing boom which was based on nothing
and yes it collapsed and now ireland is
in
serious uh financial straights
it's necessary to live in the real world
not in a world of
illusions and ideology there's some very
good
careful analyses of these fentanyl tool
as a recent
ship of fools which goes through it in
detail
you could see it coming before in fact
he
himself had written about it before as
that others warning about it
warnings were not attended to and now
there's going to be a severe cost to pay
in terms of moving on from
the difficulties that ireland faces what
do you see
as potential solutions for ireland
well you know i'm reluctant to talk
about what
should be done in ireland because i
don't have a sufficiently intimate
knowledge of the
problems of the country that has to be
done by people who do
but plainly ireland is going to have to
create a self-sustaining
economy one that cannot just be a
launching pad
for others while ireland
tries to live off the you know the booty
that
comes along with it on the side i think
those days are probably over
and ireland has
opportunities it has human
resources it has
a rich culture and tradition it's a
part of europe it has benefited
enormously from the
largesse of the european community and
again
it cannot can go on forever being a
kind of a borrower state depending on
the
kindness of strangers so it'll have to
build an internally self-sustaining
economy
which is productive and
makes use of the capacities that ireland
indeed does have
