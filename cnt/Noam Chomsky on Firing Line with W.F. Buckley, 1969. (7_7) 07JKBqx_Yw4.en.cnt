miss Hoffman I would like to ask mr.
Buckley what he thinks the motives of
the people who are in favor of the war
in Vietnam are putting it very simply
how can we possibly hope to help
universal misery when we are so
miserable here well I think we're less
miserable yeah I mean III I'm you may
not be a happy young lady but I'm sure
you're not as miserable as you would be
if for instance you didn't have a free
press if you weren't able to write such
poetry as you want to write you couldn't
join a labor union if you couldn't
express yourself as you liked if you're
the mayor of your town might be
disemboweled tomorrow I think that there
are there are observable differences I
should say between the nature between
what freedom you have here or I'll put
this one between your misery in theirs
if you wouldn't have saturation bombing
there I want to disagree with you for
the moment because I I think that there
is a certain condition a human condition
the condition of guilt which mr. Chomsky
speaks about which for me is the most
interesting point of his argument the
guilt that we feel here which in the way
may keep people from writing poetry or
from writing anything that they think
because they're absolutely stifled
that's right get on the best out of this
they managed to write their dreams but I
know we're not we're not writing now
because of the war in Vietnam we're not
functioning because of their guilt well
it's not it's not it's not an aspect of
my responsibility foreign policy to
encourage you to externalize your
complaint but if you want to there there
are any number of book publishers
magazine publishers and radio stations
other stations who are glad to hear them
out which i think is qualitatively
different from what exists for instance
in north vietnam or sell well or Greece
not quite similar Brazil a little bit of
country a little bit less so sure lesson
I think it's true what's true is that a
nation at war does not have the same lot
of liberties
nation at peace Abraham Lincoln
suspended the right to habeas corpus and
the oldest Parliament in history of the
world didn't have an election for eleven
years during you know if you compare the
state of freedom in North and South
Vietnam prior to the war as some people
done like Joseph buttons here I'm afraid
it doesn't come out the way you like
well I think it does come out not by the
evidence that's been as refugees who or
number the refugees will of North
Vietnam compare them with those of us I
hope that's that's a very different
issue what I said if you what I was
talking about is the right of free
expression in North and South Vietnam I
mean take a look for example with but
ensures analysis you know where he runs
through cases quite apart from that
let's take a look at for example again
you know pick your authority I mean let
it be Bernhard for let it be almost
anyone you like see there's a great
amount of village democracy which was
instituted in North Vietnam and in fact
has also been instituted in the a life
dominated areas of South Vietnam which
is nothing qualitatively different than
anything that has existed in Asian
societies before and this exists
simultaneously with let me be quite
clear this exists simultaneously with a
good deal of repression and certainly
both civil liberties of the sort that we
are used toski that Mosley
one of the most libertarian
constitutions in the Institute of the
world was written by the Soviet Union
petitions are my my part is what kind of
freedom is experienced by somebody in
North Vietnam the answer is that the
feed was perpetually insecure oh well
you know for reasons you think what you
ho chi minh himself is wept over the
occasional just tested to kill forty
fifty thousand in his own not the
necessity the occasional fact but just
just just what I was talkin yeah I had a
very non sarcastic but also wrong and
you say it's very important to recognize
if you want to understand what communism
means in Southeast Asia to realize that
along with many authoritarian and
repressive practices which I certainly
don't condone there is on the side a
great deal of democratization there's
been a liberation of energies and
involvement nonsense about this I don't
think you ought the great the great the
great paradigm of Red China in which the
eighth of l-cio itself concedes to to
something in the neighborhood of twenty
million victims on that particular I'm
talking them didn't ask you where that
was the aircar CIA did have its mission
has claimed the million people killed
through through Chinese communist
purchase absolutely no one well no one
serious at least quietly it was
published in the new leader five leaders
of course the new leader might I mean
the CIA plant well I said no one serious
has take a look at tiny journey like
they look at China plankton see I think
you're missing the point really and I
think it's an important point see I
think in looking at China one has to
recognize a great deal of repressive
practice a great deal of
authoritarianism and one also has to
recognize a great deal of the of
spontaneous democratic structure of a
sort which never existed in Asia before
and to another truth to some extent
doesn't even exist in our society now
these things exist side by she needed a
visitor than the denisovitch you find
out that there's an extraordinary
democratic structures even inside
concentration camps but they make this
observation I think it's profane to make
that analogy because I'm talking about
true democracy in which it so I'd look
in which people in which the the people
who the peasants who live in a village
control the institutions of their lives
they control them or you want to get out
you bump into the Berlin Wall on either
side of yeah there's no Berlin Wall in
China there's no this is the sea and
there's starvation there comes no
there's no that's just the point you see
starvation has been very largely
overcome and China yeah because it
because that something like ninety four
percent of people working on every voter
but I think mister doc say has a
question it
they also have enough to bumper crops in
the last week professor Chomsky when you
say as you said about thirty minutes ago
that there was a relativity of truth
between nations would you class
relativity of truth relativity of truth
you said in the international scene I
don't understand the calm and if I said
I don't know what it means well would
you call yourself a political would you
call yourself a political relevant
relevant relativism
I don't understand the concept well put
it this way do you believe in the
natural law and transcendental truth
let's say fixing social Union I think
that there's some there's something
doctrine of natural law but I think that
that's much more abstract than anything
we've been discussing here well but
wouldn't that then justify the use of
terror and let's say stopping a tenant
of the natural law from being broken or
stopping what say the ends from let's
bring it down to earth I see I'm
of course opposed to terror any rational
person is but I think that if we're
serious about the question of terror I'm
serious about the question of violence
we have to recognize that that it is a
tactical and hence moral matter
incidentally tactical issues are
basically moral issues they have to do
with human consequences and if we're
interested in let's say diminishing the
amount of violence in the world it's at
least arguable and perhaps even
sometimes true that a terroristic act
does diminish the amount of violence in
the world hence a person who's opposed
to violence will not be opposed to that
terroristic Act that's right yeah and he
happens to be wrong in the case in which
he applies it you see these principles
tell you very little about real cases
that's what's that's I must say that's
the one thing that bothers me more about
what you've been saying in the way you
write that that that kind of language
that it is the notion of a terroristic
act which restricts consequent violence
is precisely what Rostov says and the
view from the 7th floor when after this
whole analysis about a moral world he
says there's not a single place where we
don't have major military - I think that
the the real point here is that when you
try to formulate general principles that
will apply to arbitrary political
affairs you find very little you can
only make very vacuous an empty
statements see if one wants to talk in
perfect abstraction from any real
situation about the justification for
violence and terror then you come up
with platitudes and empty remarks and so
on the point is that you know there are
no very general principles that apply to
such certain answers at birth there are
no one has enunciated and formulated
them so what one really has to do is
look at the concrete historical
situation now where I would disagree
won't rust though and I would agree at
this level of abstraction on on the use
of violence to prevent less vile of more
greater violence where we would disagree
is in our evaluation of what is
happening in this concrete historical
situation so therefore that's order
one's attention or - so therefore you
have no philosophical objection to the
way in which mr. Rostov states this case
merely - it's applicable at the existing
circum I'm I tonight I don't know what
he said he wouldn't other things but in
other things I very great difference for
example Walt Rostow says that we should
try to strength that the great threat of
China to us is that it will succeed and
provide a model to other countries and
we have to make sure that that doesn't
happen
wave estimate of MIT I assure you that I
had nothing to do with keeping him out
of MIT I'd be delighted to have him back
it's a great help to us when he's around
thank you very much to Chomsky thank you
