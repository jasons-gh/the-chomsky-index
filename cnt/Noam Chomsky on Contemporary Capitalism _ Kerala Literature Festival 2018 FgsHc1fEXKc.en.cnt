I welcome all of you to this interview
with Noam Chomsky for presentation at
the Kerala Literature Festival 2018 in
curry code later this week professor
Chomsky is the laureate professor is a
laureate professor in the Department of
linguistics in the college of
behavioural sciences at the University
of Arizona Arizona in Tucson where his
tasks I understand
include teaching undergraduate classes
after a gap of 40 years he also has a
chair in the University of Arizona's
program in environmental and social
justice Noam Chomsky was of course for
more than half a century a professor at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology he is the founder of the
modern science of linguistics a person a
great person of the left a social and
political activist commentator and
theorist he was described once and I
know you're going to react to this he
was described once in the New York New
York Times as arguably the most
important intellectual alive and on
another occasion in the same paper as
perhaps the clearest voice of dissent in
American history I have had the great
privilege over the years of meeting
interviewing spending time with
listening to Professor Chomsky and so
may I add that in addition to all of
those he's a wonderful person Thank You
norm for agreeing to this interview
although I shall move on to other things
soon I really must ask how do you
evaluate the first year of Trump
what does year one portend for the
coming three years what's happening is
proceeding basically at two levels
whether by design or by simple instinct
it's hard to say at one level
the president the person sitting in the
White House is making sure that the that
attention media and other popular
attention is totally focused on him so
one crazy act after another he produces
some outlandish statement or action and
the media spend a couple of days
decoding it and proving that it's all
nonsense and wrong but by that time he's
on to something else
meanwhile while attention is completely
focused on him right behind him the real
actors the congressional leaders of
those who are writing his legislature
his executive statements are very
carefully and systematically dismantling
every element of the government that
works for the benefit of the general
population or in the case of climate
future generations and devoting
themselves to what is in fact their real
constituency extreme wealth and
corporate power who are getting gained
after gain in every everything from
undermining workers rights to
eliminating environmental constraints on
profit making to dismantling the limited
regulatory apparatus in the financial
system very systematic very careful
heading for undoubtedly catastrophe but
the atmosphere is a play model a deluge
you know we'll get what we can and
somebody else will pick up the pieces
which will be very serious the most
serious of all the problems and the one
that the media are simply avoiding and
discussion is almost totally avoiding
the most serious policies are those that
are
not only refusing to participate in the
global effort inadequate but at least
something the global efforts to deal
with the existential crisis of climate
change but in fact moving to exacerbate
the threat and the danger so if you if
you listen to the State of the Union
message only a few phrases about climate
that one of them was praise of our
beautiful clean coal which as he said we
have a enough for a thousand years of
use of course that destroys the
possibility for organized human life but
that's someone else's problem the new
budget that was just released not
actually picked up by the draft was
circulated in the media calls for a very
sharp reduction in the Energy Department
which deals with renewable energy and so
on sharp reduction and all of their
efforts to work on renewable energy and
a sharp increase in efforts to use the
most destructive fossil fuels new
regions are being opened up to
exploration of the Atlantic coast of the
Arctic regions and the idea is to drive
as quickly as possible towards an
environmental catastrophe because you
can make some short-term profits and in
fact both President Trump and Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson former CEO exact
executive of Exxon Mobil and others in
the administration understand this
perfectly well Trump himself while
claiming that global warming is a hoax
is making sure to build a high wall to
protect one of his golf courses from
rising sea levels Rex Tillerson at Exxon
Mobil for several decades was since the
1970s has been given
portes by their own scientists warning
of the extreme threat of global warming
on the huge contribution of fossil fuels
to exacerbate it to increasing the
threat while at the same time they were
denying it and supporting groups that
shed doubt on the science and so on so
they both know it and are denying it
which is kind of if you think of the
consequences for the world say for South
Asia which are devastating it's hard to
even the word evil doesn't begin to
capture what's happening and this is
only one I mean while the you know the
the significant but less devastating
level of the modalities of formal
government are being cheapened
vulgarized dismantled leading to
administrative chaos in many respects
the this the threat of nuclear war is
sharply increasing the new nuclear
strategy program which was just
announced last week calls for increasing
development of a range of nuclear
weapons all of which increased the
likelihood of battlefield use low-level
use which can immediately escalate and
will escalate almost certainly to major
nuclear war the the policy of permits
first strike with nuclear weapons in the
case of what they call cyber attack and
you can easily imagine scenarios the
United States is quite openly publicly
and with much self-praise carrying out a
severe cyber attacks against other
countries Iran for example where they're
quite proud of having
the successes of the cyber war which is
war of course suppose that Iran or
somebody else decided to respond by some
kind of cyber war that would be the
occasion for a full-scale nuclear
first-strike nuclear attack according to
the current program and all the way
through this is happening meanwhile
tensions are increasing on the Russian
border which are extremely dangerous of
course in Northeast Asia the world is
becoming a much more dangerous place and
it's not just my judgment as you
probably saw the famous Doomsday Clock
of The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
which was set in 1947 at 7 minutes to
midnight midnight meaning terminal
disaster
it's oscillated in the years since just
a couple of weeks ago it was advanced to
2 minutes to midnight that's the closest
it's been since 1953 when the United
States and later the Soviet Union
exploded the thermonuclear weapon
hydrogen bombs which indicated the
capacity to quickly destroy everything
on earth that's where we are now with
nuclear war with climate change where
the US is alone in the world leading the
way to disaster at home workers rights
regulations and so on are being
dismantled everything is being organized
in order to increase short-term profit
for the super-rich at a level of
inequality which is almost without
historical parallel and much of the
country is just collapsing that's the
first year in addition new conflicts and
differences and disputes seem to even
have emerged with what we thought were
traditional instead
[Music]
the conflict on that new conflicts in
and differences seem to be merged
well the world is pretty much appalled
by what Trump's actions almost I mean
take this morning yesterday a couple of
days ago Trump made one of his wild
statements about Britain how the British
are protesting the National Health
Service and it's collapsing because it
doesn't work and the British are
demonstrating at opposition to it Teresa
may the Prime Minister was well fact the
demonstration was in favor of the NHS
and calling from opposing the Tory
efforts to cut back on it and it's in
fact despite Tory policies of
undermining and it's still the best
health service in the world and they
know it very well they privatized us
health service that Trump is advocating
is an absolute international scandal
it's about twice the cost per capita
cost of comparable countries and as some
of the worst outcomes immense
bureaucracy administrative waste huge
profits for insurance companies drugs
are twice the cost of anywhere else and
it's basically a disaster for the
population but that's what he's
advocating because it's good for private
enterprise and condemning the British is
just another one of the many steps he's
taken to
innate clip this in this case the
closest ally practically all others
about the only ally actually client that
he's where he's been a very effusive and
his support is Israel to the detriment
of the possibility of any form of
meaningful peaceful arrangements in the
region yes that's a continuation tell
you a little bit I'm going to the world
and the late capitalism I've been
reading some of your views on the
subject in artificial intelligence and
robotics for the future work for the
future and for the future that's quite
an interesting issue there is of course
an increase in robot ization automation
and there's lots of discussion about the
potential impact on the destruction of
the elimination of a meaningful
employment for a huge masses of people
and the social and other consequences
that will follow there's much discussion
but interestingly there's no evidence
that it's happening
if robotization was being having a being
pushed forward developed at a level
different from anything you know there's
that's going on in the past this
constant a long history of more
automation if it was happening you would
see it right away in productivity
figures the more you have automation the
more productivity goes up the
productivity is a measure of the amount
of output per labor in
so if human labor input was declining
relative to automated production you'd
see a rise in productivity
that's elementary but you don't the
productivity is very low it's much lower
than it was in the productivity gains
are much lower than they were in the 50s
and the 60s during the great growth
period so there's been a slowdown in
productivity which means that the
automation and robotics taking place is
not having a notable impact on the labor
market furthermore the idea that there's
no work to be done human work to be done
it's just outlandish just walk around
any city in the United States the
infrastructure is collapsing
transportation doesn't work the roads
are collapsing the hospitals are
understaffed they need the schools our
student teacher student ratios declining
because there aren't enough teachers to
go into the classrooms at every level of
the society from construction work to
education to health to research and
development to high technology there's a
massive need for human labor all through
the economy and there plenty of
resources for it and there are plenty of
people who want to work but the system
is so dysfunctional that it is unable to
put together eager hands a work that has
to be done and ample resources and
instead we hear complaints about
warnings about the potential threat that
the need for labor will be disappearing
theoretically Ulta and a longer term
that should be happening and if it does
it's a very good thing in a decent
society I think the United States is a
highly overworked Society
people work many more days a year than
they do in comparable countries over a
month or six weeks a year or more not
for anything better in the level of
income the country is overworked it
needs more leisure sensible and leisure
can be used for creative and
constructive work for education for
doing things that people want for just
enjoying themselves every reason for
hoping that the boring dangerous work
will be taken over by automated systems
freeing people for more creative
inventive self fulfilling work and
better lives in a decent society of
course the way things are organized if
say the coal mining is automated people
are out of work
they shouldn't be they should be turning
to more less dangerous more constructive
more creative activities and indeed the
mining shouldn't even take place in the
first place but there these so there is
a potential that our potential
consequences of big data you know
artificial intelligence robot ization
they they can be organized so that there
been a very beneficial meanwhile there
are masses of unfilled needs that
require human participation and labor
which are not being fulfilled and the
measure of robotization happens to be
namely productivity growth happens to be
very low that's the reality the
situation of present-day capitalism that
issues it effect on the late capitalism
there is a new wave of obscurantism and
any science going on
what is new well actually it's a little
different than different parts of the
world so again in the United States a
large part of the population for a long
time has been in the grip of anti
scientism I mean there aren't very many
countries I can't think of another one
in which almost half the population
thinks that the world was created a few
thousand years ago and you know then
that the second coming Jesus second
coming is imminent and that goes way
back in the United States to the
founding the what's happening is that
the undercurrent in a large part of the
population of skepticism and denial of
science is now coming to the fore that's
becoming a significant force in the
public arena but that's because of
changes in the way politics are working
i suspect it's pretty similar elsewhere
what's happening is that the impact of
the neoliberal programs of the past
generation is hitting large parts of the
population again just take the United
States as an example though it I'll say
some comments beyond in the United
States during the 50s and the 60s there
was steady economic growth at the
highest level in the history of the
country and it was essentially
egalitarian the lowest quintile grew as
fast as the highest quintile that
changed in the 1970s late 70s when the
impact of the the new current neoliberal
programs were instituted and by what
happened is for the majority of the
population that was
stagnation or even decline well for a
small sector there was an enormous
concentration of wealth
well concentration of wealth translates
at once into control over political
decisions so political decisions were
made under the impact of lobbying and
campaign funding which accelerate the
process and you get a cycle which
continues just to illustrate what it was
like in the year 2007 that was that if
you recall at the peak of euphoria among
elites and among economists about the
marvelous economy and the Great
Moderation
how wonderful it was doing at that point
real wages for American workers were
lower than they had been in 1979 when
the neoliberal experiment began that was
the peak of euphoria then came the huge
crash mostly hit the poor in the
working-class the gained sense of
overwhelmingly gone into the pockets of
the very rich and of course under Trump
it's accelerating further
well the unsimilar things are happening
elsewhere in Europe of the austerity
programs mostly pushed by a northern and
mostly German banks that were extremely
harmful to much of the population
especially in the southern countries but
in fact almost everywhere good for
profit but rotten for the population and
it's these and there are similar things
that have happened there other countries
this has led to anger fear discontent
rejection of centrist institutions you
can see it in the elections for example
the last election in France the major
centrist parties that had governed the
country on for decades simply collapsed
the
the victor was from from outside the
political system there was strong
support for the neo-fascist group and so
on as same as happening in Germany FD
the neo-fascist group is gaining support
from even the unionized working class a
reflection of part it's the fear and
hatred of immigrants but exaggerated
fear but that itself is a reflection of
the belief that the recognition that
their lives their opportunities and so
on are declining and they have to blame
it on then you start scapegoating and
you pick out immigrants but this is
happening all over the world it's
misleadingly called populist it's very
unlike genuine populism it's more like
the background to what led to fascism in
the 1930s unfortunately and that's kind
of scary and one of the aspects of this
is the attack on anything that's coming
from perceived a leads which includes
science now it's it's actually more
evident in elite circles that are among
the population so take the most
significant case of it denial of global
warming you take a look at the polls in
the United States most of the population
believes that it's happening that humans
are responsible and it's dangerous a
little bit lower than other countries
but still a considerable majority now
take a look at elites now take a look at
the party that's governing the country
the Republican Party it's not just Trump
it take a look at the 2016 elections
every single Republican candidate
without exception either denied that
global warming is taking place or said
maybe it is but we shouldn't do anything
about it that's a hundred percent denial
among the elites that are running the
country
that's really striking much more so than
the fact that among large parts of the
population their skepticism about
science this is the top most powerful
elites in the world who are denying
flatly denying the most important for
human beings the most important
scientific conclusions of the present
period that's pretty dramatic religious
obscurantism and religion itself being
used as a political mobilization
strategy that's happening in many places
again take the United States which I
keep talking about for one thing because
by far the most powerful country in the
world in fact in history so what happens
in the United States of overwhelming
importance secondly because I happen to
be here my country I'm concerned with it
thirdly because we know a great deal
about it so it's what happens very
important and what you're describing is
happening here overwhelmingly as I
mentioned the United States has been has
had a very high level of religious
fundamentalism since its origins but it
was usually pretty much in the
background now it's come forward forward
as a major factor in the political and
social and economic system and the
reason has a lot to do with the drift
from the sort of mildly social
democratic welfare state capitalism of
the 50s and the 60s to the extreme right
wing the neoliberal policies of the 80s
and since one fact of this is that both
political parties have shifted well to
the right so the Clinton night knew
Democrats as they call themselves are
basically
pretty much what moderate Republicans
used to be I mean well the Republican
Party has just drifted off the spectrum
their heart they've conservative
political analysts from the American
Enterprise Institute conservative
think-tank describe today's Republican
Party as a radical insurgency that has
abandoned parliamentary politics and
what that means is that the policies
have become so dedicated to the concerns
and interests of the extreme extreme
wealth and corporate power that they
simply cannot possibly get votes on
their actual policies
so they've naturally turned to the
alternative trying to organize and
mobilize sectors of the population that
have always been there
in fact substantially but had never been
really organized as a major political
force
so evangelical Christians who are maybe
25 or 30% of the population
ultra-nationalists the white
supremacists groups like that are being
molded together into a popular base for
the Republican Party and out of that
come similar things are happening in
other countries so I mentioned
AFD in Germany for example or the Penn
and the National Front and France that
and I think that route met rather
similar develop it differs from place to
place but something rather similar as
can be found that's a factor that's
common to all of this and I think it
does trace back to the significant shift
in global economic policies from the
relatively progressive mildly
progressive policies of the 50s and 60s
to the extremely reactionary policies of
the
90s and cents which have had an effect
on the population on the on the growth
and one aspect of it is what you
mentioned the use the exploitation of
religious fundamentalism for political
ends it's you know there are many
analogues in history the way say the
Nazis exploited anti-semitism as a means
of mobilizing the population with
horrendous results as we know so it's
nothing particularly new using
exploiting of racial ethnic religious
other antagonisms a fear of immigrants
and so on to somehow control the mass of
the population and divert them away from
the real sources of their problems to
something else
that's happening in years ago well let
me return again to the
Doomsday Clock which doesn't measure
everything but measures matters of
extreme significance for a human a
decent human survival
the Doomsday Clock is said every year by
a distinguished group of physicists
political analysts who analyzed the
world situation and try to determine
what the threats are to really to human
existence and as I said it's now 2
minutes to midnight it hasn't been like
that since 1953 two years ago it was
moved to three minutes to mid forward to
three minutes to midnight which is
higher than it had been for decades and
that's continuing when Trump was elected
right afterwards it was moved to another
half minute now it's been moved even
closer that's a partial answer to your
question at some levels attacked at the
level of major concern for organized
human survival the world's a much more
dangerous place now the there was but
going back 17 years that was it was
hoped that that would be the end of
major military confrontation the Soviet
Union had collapsed there were
possibilities of creating a peaceful
much more peaceful world that would be
able to dedicate its resources to
dealing with serious human needs the
going back right after the fall of the
Berlin Wall there were regular meetings
between me garbage off the Russian late
Soviet that time Soviet Union Leader and
George Bush the first and his Secretary
of State James Baker about trying to set
up a kind of a general scheme for the
post-war world and there were
conflicting visions
a Gorbachev was calling for what he
called a common European home from the
Atlantic to the Pacific from Brussels to
Vladivostok with no military alliances
centers of power and Brussels of Moscow
Istanbul other parts of the region which
would work together for a common
peaceful goal that was Gorbachev Asian
Bush and Baker had a different vision
they wanted to expand u.s. power and to
ensure that the former Soviet Union
would decline and collapse the immediate
issue was over Germany naturally Germany
alone had practically destroyed Russia
twice in the preceding century serious
security issue for Russia the question
was what would happen to Germany which
at that point was split Gorbachev agreed
to allow Germany to be unified and even
to join NATO a hostile military alliance
but on a condition there was a quid pro
quo the condition was that NATO not move
to East Berlin to East Germany nothing
further was discussed just not as far as
East Germany and the bush Baker position
was a commitment to Gorbachev of verbal
commitment that NATO would not move one
inch to the east meaning to East Germany
it was never put in writing
NATO immediately moved to East Germany
Gorbachev protested naturally and he was
instructed that there was no written
agreement the implication was if you're
naive enough to accept the gentleman's
agreement with us it's your problem that
was Bush right afterwards Clinton came
in immediately expanded
NATO well to the east right up to the
Russian border 2008 under the bush -
that was a proposal even to admit
Ukraine into NATO Ukraine is the Russian
geostrategic heartland quite apart from
long historic and cultural connections
that only very recently in 1994 even
granted any kind of independent autonomy
a huge Russian population this would
practically mean war and that's so and
meanwhile the harsh shock was called
shock therapy market reforms were
Institute instituted in the former
Soviet Union now in Russia under much US
pressure and of course with the
agreement of the what became the Russian
oligarchs mainly many of them former
communist party functionaries who agreed
that these reforms which had the
predictable effect they devastated the
Russian economy which declined by about
50 percent they led to millions of
deaths estimated sometimes it's up to 10
million several million at least and of
course they created a class of ultra
rich ultra corrupt oligarchs that's the
policy that developed in Europe it
didn't have to happen
meanwhile if we go back 17 years recall
that Bush number one we're talking about
the statesman lady 37 years 27 years
sorry 27 rhythm takes off 1990 1991 with
the collapse of the Soviet Union Bush
the Bush administration of course
instituted a new national security
strategy and the military budget and so
on those are extremely interesting
I don't recall whether we talked about
them at the time but they're extremely
interesting and it's also extremely
interesting that they're almost never
just
they are an indication of the plans for
the future
so they're of extreme importance and
what they say is very much worth looking
at they say that and now we're in a new
era the major Wow earth the major
military threat is gone but the our
military position isn't going to change
we have to maintain a very powerful
military we're going to be facing what
they called much the phrase was we're
going to be facing much weaker enemies
but we have to still maintain an
enormous military we have to maintain
what they call the defense industrial
base anyone who knows anything about the
US economy knows that that means
high-tech economy it's under a military
cover most of the high-tech economy is
developed within the state system
computers internet satellites micro
electronics all across the board so we
have to maintain the basically
industrial policy which supports
advanced industry through the militants
through under the cover of the military
the military budget has two main to be
maintained then goes through various
regions a particular interest is in the
Middle East says we have to maintain
intervention forces aimed at the Middle
East which is of course where the Iraq
war was going to take place shortly
after and then there's an interesting
phrase that's added we have to maintain
intervention forces aimed at the Middle
East where the threat to our interests
could not have been laid at the
Kremlin's door it's a very interesting
phrase what it means is we've been lying
to you for 40 years 50 years claiming
that it was the Russian threat that made
us intervene in the Middle East but we
can't appeal to the Russians
threat anymore so now we say quietly
that the threat of our interests could
not have been laid at the Kremlin's door
in fact it's independent nationalism
what they call radical nationalism which
is nice it lifted the clouds that was
true all along now it said openly the
only problem is it was conceived it was
concealed not by the government was
public information just concealed by the
media and the intellectual classes that
one almost never reads it I mean I've
written about a couple of others but
nothing else so that's the new world
they were contemplating major military
force major buildup of high-tech
industry with state support through the
Pentagon under the cover of the Pentagon
aiming at much weaker enemies and the
Middle East in particular maintaining
the need for direct intervention against
independent nationalism and that's
pretty much what we've seen since that's
the way the world has developed and
there was an alternative the Gorbachev
vision of a common European home
including all of Eurasia and similar
developments in the peripheral parts of
the world that was a possibility it was
rejected and we can spell out what's
happened since the dangers so the last
27 years for the war is it a better
place for working people say to the
gentleman because seven years what does
it meant to the general population well
it has been 20 well let's take real
wages of working people it's a good
measure of what's happened to the
population real wages for American
workers are lower
literally lower than they were in the
1970s for male workers
spec to the sixties American families
are putting in many more hours of work
just to maintain a viable standard of
living comparable things have happened
in Europe other parts of the world there
are various differences so East Asia has
continued its economic rise and
development but since the crash in the
late 90s which was largely caused by the
expansion of financialization since that
crash east eight North East Asian growth
has in fact slowed considerably if it
can if East Asian growth had continued
at the level up to the crash it would be
much higher than it is now I think and
of course you know things in a way
things constantly improve there's always
changes some of which are for the are
beneficial that always happens but it's
nothing like what it should have been or
what it had been previously there is a
real break essentially in the mid to
late 70s between the expansive growth
period that preceded with varying
degrees of Social Welfare nothing like
what it should have been but at least
something a shift from that to a general
stagnation and decline for much of the
population with extremely high
concentration of wealth and more
striking in the United States than most
places but very visible everywhere India
included for example China the prospect
of things getting bitter are things what
are the things getting bicha what was it
do lots of things lots of things you
know there are lots of things that are
very promising extremely promising so
again take the United States go back to
the 2016 election the fact that the
election was won by a billionaire with
huge amounts of campaigns on spending
almost a billion dollars for the
campaign enormous media support
is not very surprising it's a little out
of the ordinary because he was not the
selection of the establishment but
fundamentally it's not a big change in
American policy what was a dramatic
change and a very promising one was the
Bernie Sanders campaign he broke with
over century of American political
history American elections are pretty
much bought you can predict very well
the outcome of an election just from
looking at campaign spending literally
there's a lot of very good academic
political science work on this Sanders
had no funding no corporate funding no
funding from private wealth ignored or
condemned by the media unknown when he
when he entered even used the word
socialist which is kind of scare word in
the United States he would have won the
Democratic nomination if it hadn't been
for the Massa nations of party managers
probably would have won the election
that's a startling development now after
the election he's by far the most
popular political figure in the country
and the groups that have developed in
the aftermath of the election under what
he calls our revolution are doing very
interesting things quite interestingly
there's almost no media commentary on
this that you would think maybe that in
a formally democratic country is the
most popular political figure who came
very close to winning the election would
be heard you'd hear his voice you'd hear
what he's doing what he says take a look
at the media almost nothing but it's
there and it means and it's incidentally
most prominent among younger people
which is an indication of what could
happen in the future similar things are
happening elsewhere the Jeremy Corbyn
takeover of the Labour Party in England
over the strong opposition of the Labour
Party elite the parliamentary later part
of you
that's very striking and important and I
think we see similar things elsewhere
Yanis varoufakis is the m25 organization
in Europe is pushing and organising
extra very promising constructive
policies for reconstructing Europe
salvaging what's valuable in the
European Union overcoming its serious
negative aspects those are very
important development and we find them
in many ways Latin America for years had
been in the forefront of very
significant changes there's been a
regression but it's not over I think
it'll come back
these are promising prospects for the
future well that's a pretty depressing
scene actually the the Arab world did
have the so-called Arab Spring which was
quite promising and many important
developments in Egypt elsewhere they've
been mostly crushed by force and
violence in Egypt a military
dictatorship was instituted which has
brought about one of the worst periods
in modern Egyptian history Saudi Arabia
you know very significant because of its
enormous oil resources and in Saudi
Arabia the Arab Spring never even began
repression was so severe that the
mildest efforts to protest were
instantly crushed and nothing happened
same in the Emirates and the
oil-producing States Syria there was a
protest a significant protest of
demonstrandum o Craddock secular
elements that was crushed by extreme
violence in Syria's been a torn apart
and torn to shreds the Iraq was
totally wrecked by the US sanctions
which were virtually genocidal then the
invasion destroyed what was left of the
country turned it into instigated
sectarian and ethnic conflict Tarun
ethnic conflict hadn't existed before
toward the country apart
and finally led to the growth of Isis
spread over the region Libya in Libya
turns out we now know from released
archival materials that there have been
long term plans with the British in the
lead but the United States and France
not far behind somehow to find a way to
overthrow Qaddafi now they used the
opportunity of the uprising to carry out
a major attack which murdered Qaddafi
destroyed much of the country killed at
least 10,000 people maybe more left the
country in the hands of warring militias
and opened a flood of weapons and
jihadis to the West Asia of the Levant
but also mainly to Africa the western
Africa which has now become the major
center of global terrorism worse than
any other place as an immediate
consequence of the destructive bombing
of Libya so the whole Iran is undergoing
potentially positive developments there
are reformist elements in Iran which
might succeed but there is the severe
threat of conflict with the United
States the Obama administration did
reach an agreement on Iran over nuclear
weapons but the Trump administrator of
himself has already moved significantly
to try to undermine it in the Republican
Party leadership it wants to get rid of
it which could lead to a major conflict
and in
in the region in fact of extremely
dangerous consequences and there are
very simple ways to deal with this I
mean the so-called Iranian threats is
primarily a threat of deterrence and the
wait as US intelligence concedes the way
a simple way to deal with it would
simply be to establish a nuclear
weapons-free zone in the region almost
everyone's in favor of that Iran is
strongly in favor of it there have in
fact been leading the demand under as
under the as leaders of the non-aligned
movement
the Arab states have been in favor of it
since our last conversation and the 90s
in fact Egypt has initiated the rest of
the worlds in favor of it the reason it
doesn't that would eliminate any
potential Iranian threat for those who
believe there is such a threat it would
eliminate it why doesn't that happen
u.s. won't allow it
every five-year nuclear review session
the issue comes up the u.s. blocks it
Obama was the latest in 2015 and
everyone knows the reasons other reasons
are simply to protect Israel's nuclear
weapons system from inspection that
won't allow it
so you can't so that method for solving
that problem is off the table but
policies can change they're not graven
in stone going back to your earlier
comment there are prospects for changing
the policies but they have to be known
understood the public has to be aware
organized and active that takes work and
effort even the first step hasn't been
made like these what I just mentioned
about the nuclear weapons free zone
almost nobody knows about that it's
basically concealed its public it's not
classified it's all public knowledge but
it doesn't reach the public
there there's a huge gap and it can be
filled but it takes work and effort of
the bleakest
it's one of the most dangerous areas of
course the US invasion of us british
invasion of iraq and 2003 is the worst
crime of this century and had extremely
harmful effects not only on Iraq but on
the whole region just the instigation of
a sectarian conflict I spread through
the region and tearing it apart
and posing extreme dangers with the
Saudi emirate effort to counter the
spread of Iranian influence that's quite
dangerous with the US and Britain in
fact right behind the Saudi attack on
Yemen with US weapons and US and British
support is causing one of the greatest
humanitarian disasters currently in the
world of the blockade alone Saudis
blockade is causing large-scale
starvation cholera other diseases
everywhere the Palestinian problem is a
cancer that is getting that's growing
getting worse Gaza may literally be
unlivable literally within a few years
because of the savage Israeli policies
and only the regular brutal attacks but
the blockade the cutting off of aid that
refuses to allow construction and so on
there are serious problems and a threat
a threat to the world which is enormous
they can all blow up very quickly I have
to time thank you
to a close I hope we'll be able to
accept the invitation we look forward to
seeing you for a batch of
you
