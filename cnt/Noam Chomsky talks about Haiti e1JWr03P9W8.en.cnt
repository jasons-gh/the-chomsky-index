then once again thanks for coming I just
want to say that we depend on dr. Tomsky
or professor Chomsky to give us a story
behind this story and here as you know
we'll often contradict what we see in
the media thank God for that
and as he informed us we can inform our
community so nothing more Denise if he
says by me please give a hand to
Professor Johnson
yes please in the QA bring up anything I
mean I asked to talk about Haiti so I'll
talk about that but lots of other things
if any of you've ever flown into Haiti
you've been greeted by a rather
depressing sight half of the island is
green and the other half is brown the
Haiti side is brown that's partially
just ecology the Dominican Republic side
happens to be just the way the rains go
and where the mountains are and so on it
happens to be more fertile but most of
it is man-made
like most catastrophes and that carries
right up to the present the hideous
catastrophe of the earthquake which is
one of the worst the modern period
hundreds of thousands of people killed
no massive destruction I'm sure you know
all about it
it's for a substantial extent a man-made
catastrophe there are two countries that
are primarily responsible France and the
United States I happen to have come back
from a couple days in Paris a few days
ago and I did try repeatedly to raise
the issue in France but it's very hard
to find anybody who wants to hear about
it and I hope it's a little better in
the United States but the US and Haiti
and France owe a tremendous debt to
Haiti and by rights should be paying
massive reparations at this point not
giving aid probably too much to ask for
but it's a goal we ought to have in mind
and the nature of the man-made
catastrophe tells us a lot about what
can be and ought to be done to try to
resurrect some kind of a decent life
well run through the history briefly I'm
sure most of you know it pretty well
if Haiti was france's richest colony in
fact probably the richest colony in the
world in 1789 it produced 75 percent of
the world's sugar
it was the leading producer of cotton
cotton was of course the fuel of the
Industrial Revolution it was the leading
producer of the tobacco and a range of
other other commodity valuable
commodities it's the source of probably
around 20% of Frances wealth something
roughly like that the in at the time of
the revolution of course took place then
it turns out there was no discussion of
the right the liberation of Haiti with
all the grand rhetoric about revolution
and equality and democracy freedom and
so on nevertheless for Haiti did
undertake there was a slave revolt it
was the French turned into a slave
Society of plantation society that
devastated the fragile ecology France
also started the process which is now
reached horrible level of cutting down
the trees because they wanted to ship
him out back to France to build elegant
houses and so on that denuded the the
hills leads to erosion
more devastation by the time the French
were driven out in 1804 there had
already been very serious damage the war
itself the war of liberation was a
brutal war the France was assisted by
massive help from England the main
imperial power by the United States by
others I mean the idea that black people
could gain freedom was really
frightening to the west and but he
nevertheless won its freedom in 1804 it
was actually the first free country of
free men in the in hemisphere
stress men because women had no very few
rights here or anywhere else the I was
it was terrifying particularly to the
slave state near by the United States
the idea that you could have a free
black slave a former slave country was
obviously frightening Haiti was forced
to - it was punished series of the early
for the crime of liberating itself and
becoming the first free country France
imposed a huge indemnity which Haiti had
to pay there was another way they could
enter the they would be allowed to enter
the international system in fact they
didn't even pay it off until after the
Second World War
and it was a yoke around their neck all
through that period the harshest
punishment was not surprisingly from the
United States the u.s. refused to
recognize Haiti other imperial powers
did so but not the US the u.s. did
finally recognize it in 1862 same yeren
recognize liberia and for the same
reason that was the year of the
Emancipation Proclamation and there was
a problem about what to do with his free
black people we don't want him here as a
terribly racist country and unbelievably
so everyone and they had shipped
somewhere so the thought was well maybe
we ship them off to Liberia and Haiti
actually that plan was dropped about ten
years later those of you who know
African American history will remember
that in the entire history of African
Americans in the United States has been
barely a few decades of a little bit of
freedom one of them was from the set
Civil War up till 1877 the the
reconstruction period after that there
was a compact between the north and the
south which ended that closes the door
on that period of freedom the South was
essential
given authority to reinstitute slavery
an effect something much worse than
slavery they introduced the was done was
to criminalize black life we look at the
wrong way or somebody claimed he looked
the wrong way at a white woman charged
with attempted rape and so on I pretty
soon you had massive for a huge prison
population mostly black males and they
were put right back into the to the
cotton fields now and chain gangs
they're put into the mines
you know the mills US Steel had its
mills there and so on in fact that's a
large part of the American industrial
revolution based on black slave labor
after the Civil War well that went to
the Second World War Second World War
there was a need for free labor for the
military industries huge growth of
industry during the Second World War and
after that there was a growth period in
the United States for about 20 years and
there were opportunities for the what
amounted to a new immigrant population
the black population there were
opportunities and again job in the auto
plant a pretty decent salary by home and
so on and so forth all of that pretty
much crashed in the 1970s when the
economic policies were instituted across
the country in fact for us a large part
of the world what's called neoliberalism
the economy was financialized industry
was increasingly without production
abroad and so on and that those job
opportunities disappeared you had this
bloc's perfect list population on your
hands again I saw the same solution was
picked that was picked after the second
world war
criminalisation so right from this
period around 1980 the prison population
in the United States starts escalating
1980 was roughly the same as you're now
maybe five to ten times as high and
mostly black males
Leon fraudulent drug charges the drug
war was begun at that point as an
instrument for recrimination now we're
kind of back to and they're used for
prison prison labor making license
plates so on
it's a kind of a repetition of the post
slavery period well relate going back to
Haiti the plan to shift the population
out to Haiti and Liberia was sort of
shelved once they became useful as a
criminalized slave population here and
at that point the United States pretty
much took over from France in torturing
Haiti there were dozens of military
interventions in the late 19th century
and into the 20th century the worst of
them was under Woodrow Wilson Wilson in
1915 invaded countries of Hispaniola
Haiti the Dominican Republic both
invasions were pretty brutal worse in
Haiti the reason was racism again in the
Dominican Republic the people were spics
they had a mixture of white blood so
couldn't be treated too badly but in a
Haiti they were what were called
inferior people pure niggers so you do
anything to them and bad as it was in
Dominican Republic it was much worse in
Haiti in Haiti
Wilson essentially reinstated virtual
slavery killed about maybe 15 thousand
people the marine Marines went wild all
kind of tortured terror you know war
crimes came out of it were crimes trials
came out of it the most significant part
was from the point of view of the future
of Haiti it was to kick out the
Parliament the Parliament was driven out
at gunpoint by the Marines and the
reason was they refused to accept what
was called here progressive legislation
new constitution written in the United
States
when Dylan or Roosevelt actually took
credit for writing it with her truly or
not the new constitution included
provisions for American corporations to
buy outpatient land and I was regarded
as very progressive on good solid
economic theory Haiti obviously needed
American investment and you couldn't
expect American investors to put their
my in Haiti and as they owned it so the
only way to develop ad was to allow
American corporations to buy it up and
since the Haitians you know niggers
talking French as William Jennings Bryan
ridiculed them since they didn't
understand complicated ideas like this
you had to disband the Parliament at
gunpoint and then the Marines did run a
referendum 5% of the population
participated and the US Constitution 1
99.9 percent of the vote so it was all
democratic recall Wilson's the great
exponent of democracy and freedom the 5%
who voted are the wealthy elite
there is a mulatto white a lead which is
devastated Haiti it's a kind of a it's
all over Latin America you have the same
plague rich societies lots of resources
a terrible misery mass misery but a
small sector of concentrated wealth and
power which tends to be white or mulatto
mixed mixed white sometimes pure white
that's all over the hemisphere hey it
was maybe worse than anywhere so they
voted in the Constitution they made out
fine as they usually do
this allowed the opportunity for US
corporations to essentially restore
something like a plantation society
the effects whereas before to drive lots
of the population off the land the u.s.
left both countries Haiti the Dominican
Republic in hands of brutal vicious
National Guard's trained by the Marines
the benefactor of the country in
Dominican Republic was Trujillo great
friend of Franklin Delano Roosevelt
among others a murderous killer but
Haiti was much worse it goes on to the
davidic tater ships finally we get to
the 1980s meanwhile the same policies
are being continued in 1980s it got much
worse again more progressive economic
theory was introduced the World Bank and
the US aid devised a program to turn a
Haiti into what they called the Taiwan
of the Caribbean a flourishing developed
society and the way they were going to
do it was by following policies which
happened to be the exact opposite of
what Taiwan did Taiwan became Taiwan
because they disregarded the advice from
the World Bank and the Western
economists and so on just as every
developed society has done without
exception including the United States so
they disregarded it Taiwan developed a
distributed light industry throughout
the country which led to centers of
economic development which then grew and
finally developed into a very advanced
industrial society in fact a lot most of
the high technology in China comes from
Taiwan and also Japan and South Korea
but primarily Taiwan meanwhile Haiti
stayed Haiti because they followed the
advice they had - it was a gunpoint so
they followed the World Bank US Treasury
a US aid advice which was to drive the
population from the countryside even
more
before into the cities where they could
pursue their comparative advantage which
was producing working in assembly plants
u.s. owned assembly plants stitching
baseballs making textiles horrifying
conditions mostly women the the
countryside's again largely emptied the
provisions required that haiti
cut back its expenditures for education
and for social services and for public
infrastructure because economic theory
explains that that's a waste you have to
devote resources to export oriented
production they can't produce their own
rice because the u.s. subsidized rice is
much better
they were Haiti with the Haitian rural
economy is largely based on pigs but USA
decided that their pigs were no good
they had to kill off all the pigs
hundred percent of them that's a
substantial basis for the peasant
society even and culturally there were a
means of exchange and so on and they
introduced Iowa pigs sophisticated pigs
to take care of an Iowa P requires more
money than a Haitian peasant can make in
ten years
so the Iowa pigs died off and the
Haitian figs were gone and other
progressive measures like that were
undertaken in fact imposed at from the
point there were also political
developments in 1986 I guess it was
there was actually an election and baby
doc the second of the days
won the election with ninety nine point
ninety eight percent of the vote
it was almost as good as Wilson's
election not quite they Wilson had 99.9%
the Reagan administration was very
enthusiastic it spoke of Democratic
developments in Haiti so therefore we
have to give the military front though
more military aid and so on well this
went on right through the 80s again
driving people off the land into the
cities laying the basis for the
catastrophes that we see this had been
going on since the French in 1990
Haitians committed a major crime which
required serious punishment there was a
free election and they voted the wrong
way and you don't do that
if you want to know what happens when
you do that ask the people in Gaza
voting the wrong way in a free election
is a major crime and there's a solution
for it you have to punish the population
in Haiti the nobody expected nobody was
paying any attention in Haiti to what
was happening in the hills and in these
slums but in fact there was a lot of
grassroots organizing going on and -
everybody's amazement they actually won
the election with two-thirds of the vote
voting in a populous priest in overdraw
did the Americans had a candidate
Marquez on a World Bank official he got
14 percent of the vote the u.s.
immediately turned to shifting its aid
to Haiti to the opposition to the
business-led opposition the white
mulatto business led opposition to try
to lay the basis for overthrowing the
government what made the crime even
worse was that our state's policies were
successful in fact recognized as
successful by the IMF and the India our
American Development Bank and others who
praised his steps towards reducing the
stifling bureaucracy towards putting the
country social spending which was
required and so on and it really looked
for a little while as if Haiti might
only might not only become free and
democratic which is bad enough but it
might fall out of US hands which is even
worse
well the expected military coup took
place seven months after our state's
election the Organization of American
States imposed an embargo the u.s.
technically joined the embargo but
within about a few weeks George Bush
number one he was president then he
modified the terms of the embargo he
carried out something that the New York
Times praised as fine-tuning the embargo
for the benefit of the Haitian people
the fine-tuning was to allow US
corporations to violate the embargo
great for the Haitian people but it's a
usual kind of progressive action that's
taken praised so the embargo was
undermine right away the trade with
Haiti increased in fact the the members
of the elite who were another rich elite
who were closely involved with the
military hunt though they were freely
shopping and Miami you know enjoying
themselves making a lot of money the
technically the Bush and then later
Clinton issued a directive presidential
directive blocking oil shipments to the
military hunter I happened to be there
at the time in 1993 there was a horrible
terror hideous terror you know thousands
of people killed murders I was there
right in the middle of it and he could
see that oil farms being built for the
prints but the CIA was reporting to
Congress that all oil shipments had been
stopped thanks to the presidential
directive it was later learned
that Bush and particularly Clinton
secretly permitted Texaco oil company to
send oil in violation of the
presidential directive this discovery
was so prominent that you couldn't miss
it it was the lead story on AP the day
before the marine invasion when everyone
had their eyes glued the AP and the
press managed to suppress it it was
reported in The Wall Street Journal a
couple of industry journals a couple of
minor papers here and there but almost
nobody knows about it
that's Clinton actually under Clinton a
trade with Haiti increased even beyond
Bush the terror increased by finally in
1994 Clinton apparently decided that the
patient's had been tortured enough he
allowed send in the Marines mainly to
protect the hunt and the wealthy and
allowed the President to return the
elected President to return but on very
harsh conditions the conditions for our
steeds return were that he except the
electoral program of the defeated
candidate in the 1990 election very
harsh neoliberal program so for example
no import restrictions and no subsidies
to for development and so on
well the consequences that are pretty
obvious and they were understood
immediately so US aid came out right
away with a report saying that the
effect of this will be to destroy what's
left of Haitian agriculture for good
reasons a hate Asian rice farmers are
quite efficient but they can't possibly
compete with us agribusiness which is
getting maybe 40 percent of its income
from
u.s. subsidies government subsidies of
course it'll wipe it out and that's
considered a good thing because remember
their comparative advantage is not
producing rice it's better for economic
reasons for them to import highly
subsidized the u.s. rice they're
supposed to go back to assembly plants
so that was very progressive and it did
destroy Haitian rice farming staple
staple of the food economy so the
country had been self-sufficient now
imports almost everything there were
small businesses a few small businesses
that somehow managed to survive but they
couldn't survive these policies either
so for example one small business that
was working in Haiti was producing
chicken parts how they do raise chickens
and factor who's making chicken parts
well turns out Americans don't like dark
meat so there's an excess of dark meat
in the corporations like Tyson and the
other big ones they don't would do with
it so they tried to dump it well they
tried to dump it in Mexico and Canada
but they have functioning governments so
they could use anti-dumping laws and
prevent it but Haiti
thanks to Clinton is not permitted to
block meat that's dumped from Tyson and
others so that poured in and that wiped
out this little industry and that's the
picture across the board I mean to
Clinton's credit a couple of weeks ago
he did make an apology sort of he said
he didn't understand that when he
imposed these conditions that it would
he said the conditions he imposed were
very good for Arkin Arkansas rice
producers didn't mention the chicken
industries they were there are good for
Arkansas rice producers but they didn't
wipe out Haitian rice production he
couldn't figure that out at the time
couldn't read
reporter so on and so forth but he did
apologize which is very rare I mean I
have to say that's almost unique case in
history try to find something like it
but that it was clear that that was
going to happen it did happen that this
helped destroy what was left of the
country in 2000 RSD there wasn't
election our state was elected again
handily he the US at that point this is
now Bush - blocked any any aid to Haiti
on spurious grounds they also blocked
international aid so it entered aid from
the International interamerican
Development Bank in songs all blocked
Haiti had to continue paying interest on
the aid that it wasn't receiving it was
not allowed to get the aid so of course
that's another horrible blow to the
country I mean while there one or
another disasters taking place I mean a
tropical storm goes through the region
it'll kill thousands of people in Haiti
maybe two people in Cuba same storm but
different societies any mild a minor
event in Haiti is not being magnified
because of the destruction that's been
imposed on the population there were in
2008 there were food prices rose very
sharply over the world and there were
food riots all over the place the first
ones were in Haiti because their food
supply has been destroyed you know
people are starving well in 2004 the
traditional tortures of Haiti France and
the United States helped by Canada swept
in kidnapped the president sent him off
to Central Africa the United standard
military regime led to another wave of
Terror the US has been trying to keep
our state out of the
one or two countries haven't agreed but
certainly not gonna let him back into
Haiti and come that were up to today
when the earthquake came along a couple
of months ago in January it was it was a
serious earthquake but that for example
there was a much more serious earthquake
in Chile a couple of weeks later and
that one killed a couple hundred people
this one killed maybe 250,000 people and
devastated the society and it's a
man-made catastrophe to a large extent
Hey our state did politely approach
France a couple of years ago and request
that maybe it's time to eat give them a
little help to overcome the effect of
this horrifying indemnity that they
imposed the France did establish a
committee a government committee led by
resist abrade or leftist they determined
that there was no merit in the request
so that was dismissed the we're now up
to now I mean there is a fair amount of
quite a lot of money coming in the
question is what should be done with it
my opinion is it shouldn't be called aid
it should be a fraction of the
reparations that are required edit by
any honest standards and it should go I
think to the popular organizations
despite all of the hideous destruction
that's taken place in Haiti over many
years it still retains a lively
functioning civil society the ones who
swept our state into office in 1990 in
unbelievable poverty unless you've been
there you just can't fathom it I've been
in a lot of awful places but nothing
like that but still it goes on their
functioning their lively they have ideas
and they're the ones who ought to be
taking responsibility for and giving an
opportunity to try to rebuild something
from this wreckage of
centuries of imperial destruction but
whether that happens or not or how it
happens is basically up to people like
you so I'll stop there
dr. Chomsky will take your questions I
also want to mention that we have his
latest book hopes and prospects for sale
down in our visitors center I would like
to ask you if you could comment a bit on
the role of the United Nations in Haiti
if you will it has been something that's
been in line with the World Bank and the
IMF approach or has been separate and if
you could talk about the UN's role in
the world per se as an institution is it
doing more damage or do you make a
difference between UN agencies like
UNICEF in all versus like broadly the UN
agencies in Haiti in Haiti if you could
comment on that and also on the world i
i worked briefly with the UN I'm trying
to figure out how to get out of it and
trying to you you were involved with you
an agency yeah and I just like to get my
moral compass right with you I mean you
know if you've worked with the UN you
know what it's like it's a very
cumbersome bureaucracy with a lot of
corruption and it's pretty awful but by
and large they do about as well as they
can under those conditions the
constraints on the UN are the great
powers mainly the u.s. of course the
most important power in the case of
Haiti the UN did complain publicly that
as did other aid agencies that they
weren't able to introduce aid because
when the US when Obama said in you know
the immediate reaction of the United
States was descendent a huge military
contingent which took over the airport
and the aid agencies including the UN
claimed that aid shipments were blocked
while soldiers were being shipped in and
so on but as far as I know they you know
they've done a fairly decent job I mean
the question is where the aid is going
to and what form it will take will it
take a form that allows the people of
Haiti to the popular organist sectors of
Haitian society
to work out ways to try to reconstruct
their own country there are a lot of
things that have to be done I mean not
just economic development also a
cultural change so for example everyone
in Haiti speaks Creole a small sector
mostly wealthy speak French the official
language is French the language of
schools is French
if you speak Creole like you're 95% of
the population you barely know French
you're kind of a second-class citizen
there's no reason for the actus to stay
I'm the educational program ought to be
revamped so that they can use their own
language and it should become you know
the language of the society not French
is a residue from the days of French
imperialism and it's the language of the
rich of course and but that's secondary
to the problems of economic development
which are really extraordinary I mean
for one thing the countryside has to be
revealed
you can't the society can't survive with
huge mass of people crammed into slums
and port-au-prince so that means a lot
of it means the kind of development that
actually did take place in Taiwan you
know distributing development to
different parts of the country with a
state organized subsidies industrial
policy designed to carry out balance
sustainable development that can succeed
as it did in Taiwan for example chair
our own countries an example itself
under the youth when the United States
won its freedom in 1786 there was advice
from the leading economists of the day
Adam Smith in particular advised the
United States on what it should do to
grow and develop and his advice was
pretty much what economists give the
so-called developing world today the
United States he said should concentrate
on its comparative to that
they use the term then but that's what
was the things we're good at we should
be producing and exporting fish and fur
and primary agricultural products and we
should be importing industrial goods
from England which where they were much
more advanced and instead of trying to
produce in just develop an industrial
society here that would violate all the
laws of economics and would be much
better much better for if the United
States followed those policies and
pretty much the same advice that the
Treasury Department the World Bank the
economics profession and so on gives to
the third world today Smith also urged
that the United States not try to
institute a monopoly over the primary
products that it produces because you
can prove an economic theory and so on
that that's you know bad for the world
economy well the US was a sovereign
country and it could therefore follow
its own policies so it rejected all of
those policies 100% Alexander Hamilton
has sort of created the US economy
immediately imposed very high import
duties to block superior British
textiles and other manufacturers and
that enabled the United States to
develop though at first the textile
industry he goes on later steel industry
actually the US had the highest
protection in the world and also the
highest growth rate and the correlation
is not accidental
as far as monopolies are concerned the
u.s. tried very hard to gain a monopoly
of cotton cotton was a very it's like
oil today you know it was the fuel with
the Industrial Revolution and the US was
producing a lot of it but not all the
u.s. conquered Texas and half of Mexico
a
you know a prime goal was to try to gain
a monopoly of cotton production and US
presidents like Tyler argued that if we
can control if we can monopolize if we
can control cotton production we can
bring England to its feet England was
the great anime then remember that was
the powerful military force and they
were a deterrent the u.s. couldn't
conquer Canada it couldn't conquer Cuba
because the British military force but
if we could monopolize cotton we could
bring England to its feet and then we
could you know expand and so on so the
u.s. tried very hard to monopolize
cotton and succeeded pretty well
actually Adam Smith's prediction which
to repeat is it pretty much the same as
the instructions given to the third
world today we're based on solid
economic theory and it's probably the
most spectacularly refuted prediction in
history but that's the way countries
grow on development if you can find an
exception
we'll try I mean it's not you know it's
it's pretty striking that the one
country of the South you know the non
you know outside of Europe in the United
States the one country that developed
Japan is the one country that wasn't
colonized and it also could therefore
violate the the injunctions of the
leaders of economic thought none of the
wealthy powers
well Haiti didn't have that hasn't had
that look but unless it has the capacity
to get truly gained sovereignty and have
the capacity to run its own to carry
carry out a form of development that's
appropriate for the society the way
Taiwan did in South Korea and others
then it's not going to have much of
future it will be a colonial dependency
as it has been but that's really you
know they can't do it on their own
that's something we have to do so it's
in Haiti about a month ago and
it's not going to the people it's not
getting to where it is supposed to go
with all of the NGOs that are in Haiti
more so than any other country or the
International Red Cross 33 nation states
in the lack of luxury that they enjoy
even going to an Italian restaurant and
that's just juxtaposed to the way the
Haitians are living in these cities and
neighborhoods the the differences more
than striking however my question is
about popular resistance that we begin
to see that have emerged on the streets
it really started at the University
leading University professor was
murdered and so something has been
growing on the streets for a long time
so I wonder if you could give us your
sense of what's happening with this
popular resistance it seems to be very
definitely tied into a very structural
organized way with the leadership in the
in the tent city neighborhoods that are
very structured and very impressive with
the people whom I spoke to and what are
your thoughts about that and where might
this lead to in terms of challenge and
this structural adjustment and
developing program clearly of Canada the
US and France that has nothing to do
with the needs of the Haitian people
yeah what you described is unfortunately
pretty common when the NGOs the NGO a
lot of the NGOs are quite good you know
some of them do really good work but
there's a kind of an NGO culture that
which is really like vultures I mean
they wait til a catastrophe comes
somewhere and they flood in and pick up
the money that's being poured in from
you know the wealthy countries and and
they live just like you described I mean
they go to the fancy restaurants you
know they live at a sour they live at a
level wave yet above
population which causes all sorts of
problems and it that works aid away from
where it oughta go into the hands of the
Western run NGOs and I'm surprised to
hear that something like that's
happening in Haiti
there are constructive things that could
be done the main one is what you say
there has been for a long time it's kind
of amazing but there have been a very
lively active engaged public local
organizations activist organizations of
the most striking case of it was just
our steeds election and then repeated
election everything I've done is an
election the same thing happens and
they're there and we have to figure out
ways to get the aid into their hands for
them to run there may be joint projects
in which they take over actually the
most effective NGO and Haiti that I know
of and it really has been good works
just like that that's poor farmers
partners and health programs they set up
respect in the mid-eighties a clinic and
the one of the poorest areas of rural
Haiti and Paul and others who work there
made sure that Haitians took it over so
it's now pretty much run by Haitian
paramedics Haitian doctors and others
they if they need some kind of
sophisticated surgery then doctor will
fly down there's anything but it's
pretty much run by by Haitians and very
effective when it right through the
earthquake it was there were people
pouring in from all over way beyond the
anything they could handle and that's
the way to do it you know to develop
institutions that are taken over by the
local population and run by them in
their own way and they can do things
that the outsiders can't do so if you
want to say have you know maternal aid
for
in a rural village or for the hill
somewhere
I mean Haitian paramedic can do it but
the Westerner doctors can't and it's
pretty much the same in every area
actually there are other things that
could be done on a national level so one
proposal which came from the center for
economic and policy research very good
economic research institute is that the
United States should buy up the entire
Haitian rice crop at a decent price
beyond above the market price well that
would be a tremendous subsidy to patient
rice farmers it would enable them to it
would also mean of course it means buy
it up and give it to the Asian people it
would be a have a major effect on the
serious malnutrition it would give a
shot in the arm to domestic production
and of course the other thing that ought
to be done not just for Haiti but for
the whole world is for the Western
countries the United States and Europe
to put an end to the agricultural
subsidies which are destroying
agriculture all over the world you know
poor countries can't compete with highly
subsidized Western agribusiness Europe
is even worse than the United States in
this respect and that ought to be
totally gone now Haiti's debt ought to
be completely eliminated it's totally
what's called odious debt as doesn't has
no legitimacy and there are other steps
that can be taken at a general
policymaking level but the main one is
the one you talk about aid should go to
the local functioning organizations
whether it's educational assistance
technical projects agricultural
development Community Development
whatever it may be
and that's going to take a lot of
pressure from the population here and it
should happen in France as far as I know
not
is going on in France for the truth the
characterization of Arras seed
requesting help from France I think one
of the major reasons why there was this
vindictive element was because he was
quite strident
although eloquent in that he was not
requesting aid he was actually
discussing how they would not reach a
level of basic moral development without
accepting the fact that their wealth was
based upon their poverty and that they
should provide to Haiti what is
rightfully Haiti's something that was a
one-element well I mean I I read the
same things you did and it could be
looked at that way but I regarded that
as polite but I guess the emphasis on
reparations for historical injustice
versus Aid is something that that plays
a factor in that it's true but he should
I mean I didn't I thought it should even
been stronger but I felt was a fair
statement he should I'm in France
destroyed the country France enriched
itself by destroying the country they
imposed a burden on the country that
prevented it from developing for ever
since its liberation for the crime of
liberation under those conditions it
seems to me pretty fair to ask for
reparations I wanted to ask you because
of the work that you've done on
intellectual culture and the media and
and that realm of policy what is it that
allows people like Clinton to go in
front of the congressional committee and
and say things like you know I'm going
to have to live with this regret for the
rest of my life every day and also
another example is Jeffrey Sachs who
you've condemned in the harshest words
for his work in Bolivia
and in the Eastern Bloc who became a
quite vigorous and a pretty fair
advocate for Haiti during the time where
the rest of the intellectual culture was
demonizing it so I want to ask you what
about those particular aspects how does
that relate to this doctrinal system
that you discuss fact that occasionally
somebody does decent thing doesn't tell
you the doctrinal system isn't there
I mean Clinton's statement was good and
I'm glad he made it as I think I
mentioned it's practically unique and
imperial history try to find something
like it it was nowhere near what he
should have said I mean it was just like
a fraction of what he should have said
but it's good that he said it there was
a little commentary about it if you do a
media search you won't find much and I
didn't see any commentary explaining
what it meant and what the background
was in the case of Jeff Sachs he's you
know he continues he certainly has
shifted his position varies
substantially from the time that he was
going for shock therapy for in Russia
which led to utter catastrophe frankly
destroyed the economy harsh neoliberal
programs in Bolivia which had a horrible
effect and yeah he's revised his
positions and is doing good things
praise him for it what lessons do you
see fund-me love less and that decade
two decades rather of popular
participation what are the lessons that
we can apply from that to the United
States what are the different scenarios
and impediments that the United States
has that perhaps are unique that prevent
us from creating a popular based
movement like finally level us thank you
that's an important question I mean it's
quite striking that we and other Western
countries can't reach can't even
approach can't even dream about the
level of democ
see that they hadn't Katie I mean that's
pretty shocking now here's one of
poorest countries in the world that were
told the population that did organize to
win that election are among the most
repressed and impoverished in the world
and they managed to organize - enough to
enter the electoral arena without any
resources and to elect their own
candidate I mean is it believable that
we can't do the same it's it's not the
only case I mean the same thing happened
in Bolivia a couple of years ago I mean
the indigenous population which is you
know the most repressed in the continent
over a couple over some years
this is overcoming the effects of the
policies that Jeff Sachs had helped
impose they began to take their fate
into their own hands it began well
before the election they into the
elections in 2005 but in 2000 there was
there were what were called the water
wars in Bolivia the World Bank and huge
international corporations Bechtel here
or one from France we're trying to
privatize water and again in an economic
seminar you can prove a theorem that
says it's more efficient to privatize
water footnote and most people can't
afford it so they don't drink but you
know can't have everything perfect so
they tried to privatize water the mostly
Indian population rejected it they
demonstrated they protested it became
pretty violent a lot of them were killed
by security forces but they finally
succeeded in tossing out the
international corporations in the World
Bank that was done with international
solidarity that's also important they
carried the main
that they were carrying out in
Cochabamba happen to be at the same time
that there were protests here at the
World Bank and in Washington and they
were coordinated so thanks to the
internet they could be coordinated
there were also protests around the
world at the home offices of the main
corporations and that combination of
international solidarity and purposed on
the ground won a big victory and then
they went on from there though they were
on to other issues and finally they
reached the point where they could enter
the electoral arena that the majority of
the population and they won an election
in 2005 they elected someone from their
own ranks poor peasant the issues were
very real everybody knew what they were
control over resources problems of
justice
multiple it's a very multi-ethnic
societies of complex questions of
cultural rights and the election was
they were well organized for the
election wanted elected during another
person someone from their own ranks in
fact but that was just a moment in
ongoing struggles then they go back and
continue the other struggles well you
know that's functioning democracy it's
beyond anything we can conceive of here
it's and that's a that's a problem about
the United States and Europe you know
and the other in wealthy industrial
countries as a concept of democracy has
just been so impoverished that it's we
have to go to the poorest countries in
the world to see what democracy means
and yeah we can take lessons from that
lessons that we should apply I mean
anything they've done we can do a
thousand times more easily so fine let's
do it to do it you have to first know
about it and draw the lessons are your
response to the situation in Gaza now
and the similarity between the suffering
of the Palestinian people and the
Haitian
well when both of them victims of racism
there are there are similarities I
mentioned one the Haitians and the
Palestinians were both punished severely
for the crime of voting the wrong way I
mean the harsh punishment of Gaza has
been miserably treated for a long time
but it really escalated in January 2006
and the reason was very straight forward
you'd read it on the front page of the
New York Times in fact you could read
adjacent columns on the front page of
the New York Times the one of which
praised the United States for its
dedication to democracy and all
wonderful things and the one right next
to it by Steven angle Berg said that the
it was the day after the a couple days
after the election that the US and
Israel are going to impose harsh
sanctions on Palestinians for voting the
wrong way and the only free elections
only taking place in the Arab world and
as far as I can see that didn't elicit a
whisper of protest even comment yeah
sure okay we people vote the wrong way I
got a punishment in Gaza the punishment
was severe this siege was imposed it
went to the extent that Israel even
blocked water from the arid Garet Gaza
Strip in the months that followed the
violence increased you know in fact by
by June Israel had fired 7700 rockets
into the strip and there was incursions
and killings and so on without going
through the whole history it the
punishment picked up much more harshly a
year later in June 2007 what happened
then is that the US and Israel and the
Palestinian Authority tried to carry out
a military coup
Gazza to overthrow the elected
government and to institute the rule of
Fatah strongman I'm a flan
well the crew the COO was beaten back
and if I mice took over and that's when
the punishment really became savage and
this incident is described here as proof
of you know from us terrorism how could
they dare not accept a us run military
coup that was designed to overthrow the
elected government and it just goes on
from there I'm by now it's you know it's
not the worst crime in the world but
it's surely one of the most savage I
mean Israel's keeping the population as
kind of caged animals they don't they're
not letting them all die because that
would cause too much of an international
uproar but they're barely permitting
them to survive I mean unless they take
a look at the restrictions on goods that
can go in and it's shocking yeah
pencils medicines almost anything you
can think of anything beyond their
survival is blocked Egypt cooperates
over the last couple of days it's backed
off the United States of course
cooperates the Israel is also regularly
attacking Gaza one thing it just goes in
and kills people if it feels like but
it's also trying to drive people away
from the borders it's fertile land so
driving away from the borders with the
constant attacks gunfire and so on it's
also been driving them away from the
with from their territorial waters so
Israeli gunships over the past ten years
have been driving fishermen closer and
closer to the shore by now they can't go
out more than a few miles from the shore
which kills the fishing industry and for
one reason because the sewage and power
plants have been destroyed so
Israeli attack so everything the near
the shore so totally polluted can fish
maybe it's coincidence maybe it isn't
but these attacks on Gaza fishermen
which all of this is of course criminal
I mean that point even it happens to be
in violation of Security Council
resolution 1860 which called for an end
of the siege but you know the idea of
talking about law when you bring up
something that the United States and
Israel are doing is like a bad joke
so yes it's illegal known to be illegal
but in fact that Security Council
resolution passed 14 to 0 with one
abstention you can guess who the
abstention was that means it's
inapplicable but so of course it's
criminal the to get back to the sea in
the year in 1999 the British s major
British gas company discovered
apparently substantial reserves of
natural gas off the coast of Gaza in
fact all along the eastern Mediterranean
but particularly in the territorial
waters of Gaza
well Israel of course wants the gas and
right at that point they started driving
fishing boats out of their own
territorial waters towards land and in
fact Israel has been negotiating with
the British Gas to to contracting to get
the oil that's extracted from Gaza and
territorial waters well there was a
little and I and a couple of other
people tried to initiate some
