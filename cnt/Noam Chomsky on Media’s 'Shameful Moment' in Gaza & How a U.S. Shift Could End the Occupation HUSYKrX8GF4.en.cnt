the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
as a new 72-hour truce in Gaza appears
to be holding we turn now to part two of
our interview with Noam Chomsky the
world renowned political dissident
linguist and Institute professor
emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology where he's taught for more
than 50 years he's authored over a
hundred books including most recently
Gaza in crisis reflections on Israel's
war against the Palestinians which he
wrote with Professor Ilan pappe I spoke
to namche young Chomsky on Thursday in
the middle of the initial 72-hour
ceasefire I started by asking him about
US media coverage of the conflict by
playing him a clip from a recent CBS
Face the Nation show with host Bob
Schieffer in the Middle East the
Palestinian people find themselves in
the grip of a terrorist group that is
embarked on a strategy to get its own
children killed in order to build
sympathy for its cause a strategy that
might actually be working at least in
some quarters last week I found a quote
of many years ago by Golda Meir one of
Israel's early leaders which might have
been said yesterday we can forgive the
Arabs for killing our children she said
but we can never forgive them for
forcing us to kill their children
that was CBS journalist Bob Schieffer
Noam Chomsky can you respond well we
don't really have to listen to CBS
because we can listen directly to the
Israeli propaganda agencies which he's
quoting says it's a shameful moment for
US media when it insists on being
subservient to the grotesque propaganda
agencies of a violent aggressive State
as for the comment itself the Israeli
comment which equaled the propaganda
comment which he quoted I guess maybe
the best comment about that was
made by the great Israeli journalist
Amira Haas who just described it as
sadism masked as compassion it's about
the right characterization I wanted to
also ask you about the UN's role and the
US visa vie as well the United States
this is the UN High Commissioner for
Human Rights Navi Pillay criticizing the
u.s. for its role in the Israeli assault
on Gaza they have not only provided the
heavy weaponry which is now being used
by Israel in Gaza but they've also
provided almost 1 billion dollars in
providing the iron dome's to protect
Israelis from the rocket attacks but no
such protection has been provided to
garson's against the shelling so I am
reminding the United States that it's a
party to the international human rights
aryan law and human rights law that was
Navi Pillay the UN High Commissioner for
Human Rights know on Friday this was the
point where the death toll for
Palestinians had exceeded Operation Cast
Lead it had passed 1,400 President Obama
was in the White House and he held a
news conference he didn't raise the
issue of Gaza in the news conference but
he was immediately asked about Gaza and
he talked about he reaffirmed the US
support for israel said that the
resupply of ammunition was happening
that the 220 million dollars would be
going for an expanded Iron Dome Israel
has a right to defend itself from rocket
attacks that terrorize the Israeli
people there's no country on earth that
can be expected to live under a daily
barrage of rockets there's no country on
earth that can be expected to live under
a daily
barrage of rockets and I'm proud that
the iron dorm system that Americans
helped Israel develop and fund has saved
many Israeli lives but then the weekend
took place yet another attack on a UN
shelter on one of the schools were
thousands of refuse to nians had taken
refuge and a number of them were killed
including children and even the US then
joined with the UN in criticizing in
criticizing what Israel was doing can
you talk about what the US has done and
if you really do see a shift right now
well let's start with what the US has
done and continue with the comments of
the with the UN Human Rights Commission
right at that time to time the quote you
gave over the radio that you gave before
there was a decision debate in the Human
Rights Commission about whether to have
an investigation no action just an
investigation of what had happened in
Gaza an investigation of possible
violations of human rights Possible's
kind of a joke
it was passed with one negative vote
guess who Obama voted against an
investigation while he was giving these
polite comments that's action the United
States continues to provide as you like
pointed out the critical the decisive
support for the atrocities when what's
called Israeli jet planes bomb
defenseless targets and Gaza that's us
jet planes with Israeli pilots and the
same with the high-tech munition and so
on and so forth so this is again
sadism ask with compassion those are the
actions
what about opinion in the United States
can you talk about the role that it
plays we saw some certainly remarkable
changes MSNBC had the reporter in
unmolding who had been at Al Jazeera
very respected he had been together with
Shireen Tadros in 2008 the only Western
reporters in Gaza covering Operation
Cast Lead tremendous experience in the
area and he was pulled out by MSNBC but
because there was a tremendous response
against this with I think what was
trending was let a man report he was
then brought back in so there was a
feeling that people wanted to get a
sense of what was happening on the
ground there seemed to be some kind of
opening do you sense a difference in the
American population how would the
attitude toward what's happening in
Israel and the occupied territories very
definitely it's been happening over some
years and it's it there was a kind of a
point of inflection it increased after
cast led which horrified many people and
it's happening again now you can see it
everywhere take say the New York Times
The New York Times devoted a good part
of their op-ed page to a Gaza diary a
couple of days ago which was
heart-rending and eloquent they've had
strong feds
condemning extremist Israeli policies
that's that's new and it reflects
something that's happening in the
country you can see the polls especially
among young people among if you look at
the polling results of the population
below 30 roughly by now has shifted
substantially that you can see it on
college campuses you know I see it
personally I've been getting talks on
these things for almost 50 years
I used to have police protection
literally even at my own University the
meetings were broken up violently you
know enormous protests within the past
roughly a decade that's changed
substantially by now that the
Palestinian solidarity may be the
biggest issue on campus huge audiences
Kent there's an evening hardly get a
hostel question that's a tremendous
change
that's strikingly among younger people
but they become old however there's
something we have to remember about the
United States it's not a democracy
it's a plutocracy now there's study
after study that comes out in mainstream
academic political science which shows
what we all know or ought to know that
the decision political decisions are
made by a very small sector of extreme
privilege and wealth concentrated
capital for most of the population their
opinions simply don't matter in the
political system now they're essentially
disenfranchised
get the details if you like but that's
basically the story now public opinion
can make a difference even in
dictatorships the public can't be
ignored
and in a partially democratic society
like this even less so so I will make a
difference
and how long alta mately is well that's
up to us we've sent it before
that takes a the east teamwork case
which I mentioned for 25 years the
United States strongly supported the
issues is Indonesian invasion and
Massacre virtual genocide it was
happening right through 1999 as the
Indonesian atrocities increased and
escalated after dearly the capital city
was practically evacuated by after
Indonesian attacks the US was still
supporting it finally in mid-september
1999 under considerable international
and also domestic pressure Clinton
quietly told the Indonesian generals
finished and they they had said they'd
never leave they said this is our
territory they pulled out within days
and allow the UN peacekeeping force to
enter without without Indonesian
military resistance well you know that's
a dramatic indication of what can be
done South Africa is a more complex case
but has similarities and there are
others sooner or later it's possible and
that's really up to us that domestic
pressure will compel the US government
to join the world on this issue and that
will be a decisive change MIT professor
Noam Chomsky after break we'll talk
about BDS the boycott divestment and
sanctions movement
