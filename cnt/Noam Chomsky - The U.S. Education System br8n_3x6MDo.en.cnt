the comics but um indicates isn't doing
like what we're seeing budget cut people
know you let her go without thank God
well that's a really important issue the
the public education system was one of
the real major achievements of this
country was the first country to have a
really broad mass education system that
contributed enormously not only to the
cultural health of the country but to
its economic growth that after the
Second World War there was a major
period of economic growth in US history
was the several decades after the Second
World War a substantial reason for that
was a GI Bill which allowed a huge
number of people not enough
unfortunately but a huge number of
people to go to college who would never
been able to do it and those days
college was cheap public education was
free I mean I went to college 1945 and I
happen to go to the logo I went to the
local school you know never
but the local school happened to be the
University of Pennsylvania which which
is private but it was a hundred dollars
you know and that you can get it and you
can easily hit a scholarship so
education was basically free and for the
GI Bill of the huge number of people and
that had an enormous impact so all
that's being reversed if there's an
attack on public education which is with
any precedent because all the way from
kindergarten up to the universities so
it takes a the university's budget a
personal experience a couple of months
ago I travel around a lot giving talks I
happen to give a talk at in Mexico City
at the National University and put an
impressive university couple hundred
thousand students very high level very
engaged in fact salaries are
ridiculously low by our standards but
they work facilities are pretty good
it's free
that's a poorer country you know but
public education is free furthermore in
Mexico City itself there's a city run
college which is not only free but had
open admissions so anybody can go and if
they need help to get in to get remedial
training I was there too pretty
impressive also high standards well
that's a poor country I happen to go
from there to the Bay Area in California
it's maybe the richest place in the
world outside of the Gulf Emory they the
public education system is being
systematically destroyed tuition is so
high in the major universities that it's
just for the rich it's a fact it's at
the level of Ivy League colleges work
for this year for the first time more
funding for the public institutions is
coming from tuition than from the state
in a rich state not Mexico
and this is happening all over the
country I mean a majority of estates by
now the tuition in the public
universities is higher than funding now
it's not because of the lack of wealth
and it's not because of the deficit
which is complete Forrester's is easily
the show it's because of the decision to
destroy public education the in
California for example the great
universities which are being will be
proud almost certainly be privatized
they're almost private now you know very
high tuitions that big endowment and so
on and that means the rest of this is
the system it gets kind of lowered to
low level technical training well you
know for the economy of forget the human
cost for the economy of California
that's very serious California became
rich in large measure because of the
high level education system well the
people who are running the program that
top one-tenth of one percent of the
population they don't care I mean their
kids will be fine you know they don't
use the public education system that's
privatized they can pay for it a
phenomenal wealth and there's a change
and this is generalizes over the country
we have to recognize a significant
change in the nature of contemporary
state capitalism from the 70s you go
back to the 1950s the CEO of the firm's
a General Motors had to care about the
future of the firm that had had brand
loyalty you know the firm had to persist
and so on so they tried to build it so
it would persist that's not true anymore
the CEO of a General Electric which is
mostly a financial institution old after
it was make money in the short term I
mean and
of course they get bailed out by the
taxpayer if it goes wrong but if the
company itself declines it doesn't
matter they walk away with their golden
parachute that's the new system and it's
for the country they don't really care
about it along with the financialization
of the economy came offshoring of
production so if you can make more
profit by using a super cheap exploited
labor in China let's say without
environmental constraints and so on fine
having to harm this country severely but
that's not their concern so we're
getting into a situation where the
future of the country just doesn't
matter for the people for the
decision-maker and it's going all the
way down to elementary school I want to
tell you there's a huge attack on
teachers I'm in an effort to try to
shift the blame for for for the
financial crisis and a general economic
crisis away from you know goldman sachs
to the public school teachers and the
firefighters
so ludicrous you can hardly believe that
it getting away with it and there is a
backlash like in Wisconsin significant
backlash but it's certainly going on and
it is absorb so you're right there's a
major effort to destroy the public
school system now I think the
fundamental reasons behind that it's not
just that the rich don't care I think
the same thing lies behind the attack on
Social Security Social Security is a
phenomenally successful program has
almost no administrative costs I mean
far less than privatized insurance and
so on
very cheap works very well keeps a lot
of people alive it doesn't mean much to
people in higher income levels you know
they get a small amount they forget it
but for a lot of the population that's
what keeps them surviving particularly
after the huge economic collapse and
collapse of the real estate bubble so
it's a white attack social security well
partly it's of no benefit to the rich
but there's a deeper reason I think that
it's the same reason as the public
education system I can't prove it but
this is what it looks like coming the
public education system and Social
Security are based on a certain
principle namely the principle that we
care about other people
social security means you care that a
disabled Widow across town than a food B
or let's say I don't have kids in school
but you know I'm happy to pay school
taxes because I care that the kid across
the street this concept of sympathy and
social solidarity is considered
extremely dangerous there's a major
effort propaganda effort to try to drive
into people's heads they should only be
concerned for yourself now there's
nothing new about this you go back in
Americans good to learn know about
American history
you go back to say 1850 the beginnings
of the Industrial Revolution and
incidentally the period of the freest
press in the United States there are
hundreds thousands of newspapers a lot
of readership the direct participation
that are written the factory workers and
others and one of the main themes that
was angered at what was called the new
spirit of the age gaining wealth
forgetting all but self that was the new
spirit of the age in 1850 and it's been
a tremendous effort over the years to
somehow drive that into people's heads
and drive out all normal human feelings
and you know it's had some success and I
think you see it in the willingness of
parts of the population at least to try
to kill the elements of the society and
the culture that are based on care and
concern for other people and to try to
turn people into crazed the maniacs who
care about nothing but themselves well
that's all as pretty dangerous again it
was happening in some small country you
know it'd be a shame but when it's
happening in the richest most powerful
country
history it's very dangerous
