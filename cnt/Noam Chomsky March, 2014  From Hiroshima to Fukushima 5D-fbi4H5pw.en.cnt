the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
we end our Fukushima anniversary special
with the words of the rural world
renowned political dissident linguist
offer MIT professor Noam Chomsky who
also travelled to Tokyo last week Noam
Chomsky is now 85 years old he met with
survivors from Fukushima including
families who evacuated the area their
meeting was filmed by the independent
online media channel our planet TV this
is professor Chomsky speaking in Japan
particularly horrifying that this is
happening in Japan which with its unique
horrendous experiences with the effect
of nuclear explosions we have to discuss
and of course it's particularly
horrifying when it's happening to
children who were defenseless innocent
but unfortunately this is what happens
all the time I mean I had two daughters
about they were about the age of your
daughter they would come home from
school telling us how in school they
were taught to hide under desks in case
there was a nuclear war this was right
after the Cuban Missile Crisis when the
world came very close to the clear war
and children were very upset I mean I
knew children who were friends of
families that were sure they were never
going to survive because the world is
going to be destroyed by a nuclear war
but the official line was don't worry
everything's under control the same was
true again my daughters when they were
about her age we stopped feeding the
milk because the scientists who were
concerned recognized that there was a
very high level
of strontium 90 in the milk that was
coming from atomic explosions the US was
carrying out many open-air explosions
and the government assured everyone that
there's no problem but we just a lot of
people like us just stop feeding the
children gave them only a powdered milk
which came from before the explosions
it's it happens all the time so right
now for example in Iraq there's a city
Fallujah which was attacked by US forces
using weapons but no one understands but
they leave a high level of radiation and
there's studies by Iraqi and American
doctors showing a very high level of
cancer among children far higher than
before in the whole neighborhood of
Fallujah but the government denies it
the US government denies it the Iraqi
government is doesn't function the
international organizations refuse to
look so it's all being carried out by
independent organizations and citizens
groups and this is simply everywhere I
mean in 1961 the United States began the
chemical warfare in Vietnam South
Vietnam chemical warfare to destroy
crops and livestock that went on for
seven years of the level of poison it
they used the most extreme carcinogen
known dioxin
and that's went on for years there's
enormous effects in South Vietnam their
children today being born in Saigon
hospitals that deformed children and
horrible deformations government refuses
to investigate they've investigated
effects on American soldiers but not on
the South Vietnamese and there's almost
no study of it except for independent
citizens groups it's can add case after
case but it's a horrifying story and
particularly horrifying for you because
you're suffering from it but that's the
way governments operate they protect
themselves from their own citizens
governments regard their own citizens as
their main enemy and they have to be
protect themselves that's why you have
state secret laws citizens are not
supposed to know what their government
is doing to them just to give one final
example when Edward Snowden's
revelations appeared the head of US
intelligence james clapper testified
before congress that no telephone
communications of americans are being
monitored without landish lie lying to
congress is a felony go to jail for
years not a word governments are
supposed to lie to their citizens author
