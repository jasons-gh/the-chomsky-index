hey and welcome to beer Christianity my
name is John T and I will be your host
for this episode episode one of beer
Christianity will that need some
explanation but before that I need to
have a sip of this which is Tusker
Kenya's finest lager possibly my
favorite beer in the world this is not
one of those be a podcast that gets
super nerdy about beer because I don't
know enough and you know generally
speaking doesn't all be it tastes the
same yeah yeah I know that's not true
just a little joke it's not whiskey but
if you do want to complain or send any
kind of feedback emails the email to
send it to is because we're gonna kick
it old-school with this podcast the
email to sender two is beer Christianity
at Yahoo dot code on UK that's right you
can write to us there and when I say us
I mean there's gonna be a bunch of
people doing this it won't just be me
this episode is episode 1 but we
technically did do an episode literally
nine years ago in 2011
maybe that's eight years ago anyway me
and a couple of friends we got together
in a pub slash a bar in the Rhydding
International Solidarity Center we got a
few hundred lessons on that we played a
lot of copyrighted music and you know
just got nervous slash old slash busy
and didn't finish it up so this is a
kind of reboot of that podcast its main
purpose was to kind of find a use of
some of the interviews that I was doing
with various Christian musicians and
also to introduce people to Christian
alternative music that I liked because
it doesn't tend to get that much of an
airing and that's a shame I think I like
me some worship music but I don't love
all of that I'm more of a kind of goth
industrial kind of boy at heart and I do
love me some grunge and I do love me
some Punk and ska and all sorts of
interesting synthy stuff and EBM and
yeah industrial and all that so that's
what that was about it's not so much
going to be about this
we can find bands who are willing to let
us use their music on our show and kind
of introduce them and I have one lined
up for a future interview and a future
episode of this already so I'm going to
be doing that but generally speaking
this podcast is going to be all about
having a few drinks and talking about
stuff that relates to fame some of
that's gonna feel really obvious it's
gonna feel like episode 2 which is our a
real episode 1 and I have to warn you in
advance the production values or ropey
but the banths is is strong with us it's
a friend of mine Laura and myself
sitting in a pub in Didcot which is the
most average town in Britain so you've
got to kind of go with that and feel
like that's gotta mean something talking
about Greenbelt festival which is a
Christian festival but it's kind of like
this is kind of that kind of podcast
really it's a Christian festival but it
doesn't just you know focus on Christian
stuff it's not just worship and its
really concerned with issues of justice
issues of politics issues of where the
church and the people of God should be
and taking it away from that kind of
negative space that perhaps a lot of
people have been experiencing the church
in I'm not talking about going full
identity politics I think that identity
politics has a lot to teach us and I
think that it will make mistakes like
any other movement but I think the
problem with the world currently is not
too much identity politics I think the
problem with the world currently is that
it's slipping into fascism and the
church seems either not to care or to be
so caught up in kind of the capitalist
mindset that we don't really pay that
much attention it's not gonna be hating
on the church either because I love the
church I also love tradition I also love
evangelical Protestantism I think
there's a lot to offer for it I myself
am a recovering fundamentalist and I
hold some of that stuff still dear not
the reaction to a society that is
changing that makes us into weird
terrified people who try to draw hard
lines but I understand the first half of
life
I think it's important so we will not be
throwing the baby out with the bathwater
we will also not be enforcing hard
doctrinal lines here I'm gonna disagree
with some of my guests I'm gonna
disagree with some of my co-presenters I
imagine I don't want to push some kind
of single dogma what I want to push is a
version of Christianity that is no it's
not even a version of Christianity I
want to push some Christians and I push
anything man why do you have to push
everything all the time I don't to push
anything what I want to do is to make
use of some of the interviews that I'm
doing with people generally speaking for
my day job and just as a hangover from
when I used to do op-ed and review
writing for the Baptist times and for
Christianity magazine and for Christian
today and a bunch of other Christian
media in the UK and I got to interview a
bunch of cool musicians if we can find
some of those interviews I'll play those
again and also interesting thinkers you
know politicians philosophers
theologians church men and women people
from the fringes of it from you know
kind of liberal reformers through to the
LGBT kind of campaigning community so
yeah we'll be doing a bunch of those
kind of interviews hopefully having
chats not as I'm currently sitting in a
study in my house drinking beer I should
open another one as well I'll be honest
I recorded then opening the Tusker
before I started because I felt like I
had to get lick it up before I did that
so now I'm opening hey let's not get
nerdy about the beer but that's also say
I'm opening in a freak ale works phantom
Pale Ale which is one of those ones that
you compare LD is that is that offensive
to beer people
I don't really know do you know Aldi the
supermarket is kind of like a budget
supermarket in the UK anyway they always
have you know interesting American craft
beers and Pale Ales and all that guy so
it's probably all made in Croydon but it
is terribly nice and often very
interesting and they have really pretty
cans with which is not a phrase you can
usually say on a Christian podcast so
I'm going to test this it's fruity it
tastes you know red that's a it tastes
like it tastes like it's got that kind
of like Ruby glow you know I've no idea
if it does cause it's kind of dark in
here and but yeah that's a very nice
beer and I like it very much and that's
the point is I think my attitude to beer
is what my attitude to faith has become
which is I really like beer I'm not
gonna get all hardcore with people if
they don't drink the right beer I'm not
sure that I know enough about it to
really enforce that I do know that some
beer is probably a lot nicer than other
beer and um I also think there are you
know ways to drink it and excesses that
we can go to I'd like us to be a little
bit more chilled out at the bar beer I'd
like us to be a little bit more open and
welcoming to people who are new to it or
people who are different tastes from our
own I would like us to to ultimately
allow more people to get an accurate
picture of what beer is so that it can
find its way into their hearts and they
can accept it as their personal Lord no
wait a minute I think I've taken the
metaphor too far anyway the point is
there will be cool stuff in this podcast
there's going to be generally speaking I
think the format we're going to take is
we're going to be going into a pub with
myself and a few of my friends you will
hear ordinary pub noises or bar noises
or wherever people drink you know we may
drink by the river you know we may drink
in a car park you know these are
traditional places to drink and we are
going to be discussing things of faith
things that should be concerning to
people of faith so in Episode two for
instance which were titling Genesis
because I'm drinking beer and my friend
Laura is drinking gin we talk about
extinction rebellion we talk about
Greenbelt festival which is a
progressive Christian festival which you
know sometimes there it hurts me but
most of the time is genuinely gorgeous
and beautiful and exactly what these
events should be like and is I think a
beautiful I don't know a reflection of
what the church can be and should be in
the world and you know it has I don't
know man it has a it has a centre heaven
about it and I mean don't get me wrong I
I'm not a hippie I
I am an aggressive individual who you
know goes to Hillsong I'm one of those
guys but you know I do really love that
festival so we're gonna be talking a bit
about that because Laura had never been
before and she got to hear people like
Nadia Bulls Webber
that was really very cool she got to
hang out with extinction rebellion and
we talked a little bit about what the
purpose is of an organization like
Atwater so like to go to one of their
meetings and also just why Christians
should actually give a rat's ass about
the environment and about activist
organizations like that so you got a 42
year old that's and you got a 24 year
old that we'll be talking about in
episode 2 which is really our first kind
of proper episode and there's also an
interview with Harry and Chris if you
don't know them you should do some pre
listening so that then you can be super
excited about hearing them peppered
through the I think it's about an hour
and five minutes long so long I know but
if you've got a commute that's kind of
cool right or if you want to have a long
bath or if you don't listen to it all
and yeah it's kind of three sections in
there and it will be me talking again
all of the audio stuff on this I
recorded just to take notes so future
episodes we'll have better audio but
yeah talking to them about their recent
foray into America and trying to break
America what that was like and what it's
like to be Christian comics Christian
comics singers and artists and advice
for aspiring artists of all kinds as
well so they're very cool guys they're
very funny and it's a fun interview as
is the conversation with Laura so if you
want to hear two people getting I'm
gonna say hammered I'm just gonna say
progress of you more tipsy because I
believe that's a Christian way of
experiencing I'm not drunk I'm Ella I'm
so mellow I can I can see my words
um I'm not that mellow at all but I'm
gonna have another sympathies mmm these
guys that's very good freak ill works
from Aldi for the discerning beer
drinker this picture in genuine beer
people coming to this podcast and going
like why is he doing this because it's
quite nice but do feel free to email
beer Christianity at Yahoo Co at UK if
you have
you know music that you'd like us to
play or to consider playing all people
who you think I should interview or
beers that you think I should drink
places that you think I should drink I
think that'll be pretty cool other
interviews that we've got in the can I'm
trying to get permission to use an
interview I did with the Archbishop of
Canterbury because that is bents
it is the archbishop of been to breed
not my joke but I do like it
who was such a nice guy and so smart and
so very reasonable I was talking to
mostly about the World Church it's an
interview I'm doing for and magazine I
edit and for the Baptist Times online
and so it'll be going into those places
anyway but if you wanted to hear the
interview in its full glory as well as
one other one that I did at
whatchamacallit
at Greenbelt festival then you can catch
episode I don't know what episodes it's
gonna be on to be honest and but yeah
it'll be there basically I just want to
share some of the cool stuff that um
I've done in terms of well that's answer
guys I just want you to know how cool I
am um I want to share some of the cool
people who I've interacted with and the
cool ideas that have influenced me so if
I can find the old interviews that I did
with Richard Rohr if you're a fan of
Richard Rohr I've got some great
interviews of him I've got an interview
with Noam Chomsky that was very cool and
I spoke to him a little of our faith
I've even got old Callie Larson who I
mentioned in a particularly named Rafi
and pretentious section of episode 2
I've got yeah I don't know in fact if
I'm honest I would love to play
something now because you've gone to all
the trouble of listening to this thing
and it's you know several minutes long
and it just seems right that you know I
give you something worth listening to so
I had a search for Richard Ross is the
magic of really Oh slash podcasting I
have I've dug out he a power cable for
an old laptop so that I could fire it up
so that I could find some of my old
stuff I tell you this mainly because it
was
because I forgot to feed my wife because
I had cooked something and just kind of
left in the oven and I got totally
distracted so that is cool
but also not as cool as interviewing
noam chomsky when you have just been in
a hot tub that you earned for about two
years one of those inflatable ones not a
cool one and drinking beer so this is
perfect and talking to him about just a
whole bunch of stuff yeah for a magazine
that I was editing at the time for
Baptist Christians in the UK and he was
very cool as you can imagine noam
chomsky if you haven't read him or
listen to his talks you really need to
get into him the is he the most
influential and one of the most
influential intellectuals of the 20th
century and I'm terrified about what's
gonna happen when he dies cuz he's so
smart and so right about so many things
so ya Chomsky a sweetheart
I found an interview with him and I'll
play a bit of it now just so it feels
like there's you know something
worthwhile in this okay I get the full
bit of Christianity experience because
you're not gonna have a bunch of people
kind of just shooting the breeze but you
can get some of it in the form of this
interview also it turns out that
Christian nationalism has not gone away
in the time since I interviewed him
several years ago which is deeply deeply
depressing receive the rise of Donald
Trump we see the rise of the mega hat
being worn by the Christian which I mean
I know that theologian I'm not gonna say
it's the abomination that causes
desolation because I think it's a big
statement but I would say it is an
abomination and I don't get it so yeah
weird anyway here's Noam Chomsky who is
not as far as I know a Christian but is
a very very smart man hello hi professor
Chomsky yes speaking thank you so much
for taking the time to speak to me I
really appreciate it
just to give you a little bit of context
the topic is generally on borders and
nationhood in the context of immigration
the deceived you EU migration crisis and
yeah that sort of thing absolutely
I'm running for a Christian audience
here from your knowledge of Christianity
does it seem like Christianity should be
a religion that promotes
internationalism considering that it has
this idea of being a universal religion
and and if so what do you make of that
kind of Christian nationalism well
there's no kind of nationalism that I'm
particularly sympathetic to although as
I say I think people have both the right
I have a right to maintain their own
cultures and national identities without
conflict and without violence without
infringing on others Christianity can
the Christianity can be many different
things and in its 2,000 year history in
fact it has been many very different
things
even in recent years Christianity has
taken many different forms so for
example when under vatican ii of the
catholic church turned basically
returned to the lessons of the gospels
which kind of radical pacifist and had a
in my view extremely beneficial the
impact on large parts of latin america
that frightened the power in fact the
united states officially takes credit
for having helped destroy Liberation
Theology officially Cindy give you the
details if you like but it was a very
positive force now being revived to a
certain extent by Pope Francis on the
other hand George Bush and Tony Blair
appealed to Christian values when they
carried out the worst crime of the
century invading Iraq fact George Bush
declared that he was doing it at the
come
and of his Lord will that's another form
of Christianity hmm absolutely a final
question
the rise of certain worrying trends of
right-wing nationalism in Europe and in
North America a lot of Western
democracies seem to think that they're
immune to a kind of ultra-nationalist
nightmare like we saw in the mid 20th
century would you say they're right in
being dismissive of that danger no I
don't think I
I was certainly with not in fact it's
not just right now about 15 years ago I
in a book I happen to quote an article
by a leading historian of modern Germany
Fritz turn who's a refugee from Germany
fled in the 1930s to the United States
became a very prominent historian of
Germany he wrote an article in the
leading establishment journal foreign
affairs called in which it was about
Germany's descent into barbarism the
transition of Germany from the peak of
Western civilization in the 1920s to
perhaps the depths of human history in
the 1930s but it's an article that's
worth reading because as he made it very
explicit he said in fact said I now fear
for the country that gave me refuge from
Nazi Germany and in fact right through
the article it's every reference is a is
a reference often not so oblique to
developments taking place in the United
States he's not saying that the United
States is Highmark Germany but he's
saying there are things we ought to be
wary about and in Europe even more so
very much more so than the rise of the
ultra nationalist parties throughout
Europe this is very frightening
phenomena this is not ancient
okay I'm old enough to remember it
personally that is Noam Chomsky talking
to me in 2016 it is now 2019 it is what
September October around there and yeah
it's got much worse in the states I
think I think we can all agree I think
it's got much worse a lot of places
you've got the Amazon burning because of
a far-right politician basically
allowing it and encouraging it and
stoking it in order to make way for
developments in terms of farming and in
terms of infrastructure coming in and
getting indigenous people off their
lands and getting rainforests clear so
we can you know make some money off of
that earth yeah and you've always got
President Trump doing his thing with his
guys beating up people and yeah it's all
just a little bit horrifying and yeah
Chomsky talking about it then obviously
and I just I find it troubling and I
think it's something we need to pray for
I think I keep on hearing this Boris
Johnson just you know got into power in
the UK and I hear a lot of Christians
going well you know instead of
complaining about it maybe you should be
a good Christian and you should pray for
him and I think that's cool I think if
you are gonna be doing the same kind of
rhetoric if Jeremy Corbyn gets in and if
you did the same kind of rhetoric about
Obama or freaking Clinton even and these
are hardly left-wing people if you can
find it in your heart for them then I
guess yeah I take you seriously if
however you only think we need to just
accept it that God puts his leaders into
place when it's the leaders you like
your opinion is well it's it's hard to
respect let's put it that way when it's
when it's that kind of relative myself I
think yeah we probably need to pray for
them all the time I think most of them
are probably not awful awful people but
but there are some who are and I think
we also need to remember that we as
Christians have a responsibility to get
involved in society we do not get to be
a political
we not get to pretend that we're above
all of that if we care about our fellow
human beings if we care about the
stewardship God has placed in our hands
of humans and of our planet then we have
to get involved and I think personally
the Christian distinctive is to stand
against hatred and against power not
maybe not all power we'll address that
in another podcast anyway that got super
heavy point is Chomsky on beer
Christianity would ya
also this freak else will works is going
down just a treat mmm and make me feel
very kind of enthusiastic about the
future so that's nice basically the
future of this podcast because I think
it could be quite cool so if there's
anything that you would like to hear
please email via Christianity at yahoo
co dot uk' and if you have any thoughts
on it you know if they're not too brutal
then do share them there's lots of cool
stuff and also just some very cool music
and theatre and movies and whatever
we're gonna be doing a little bit of
review we're gonna be doing a little bit
of politics sort of bit of theology or I
think elegy sounds really overblown I'm
not a theologian I studied philosophy I
didn't finish my Master's I am NOT a
particularly educated person but I got
passion but by god I have some opinions
and so we'll kind of be looking into
those those are some very funny friends
who will be significantly more
entertaining than I am on this very
quiet podcast I have to say episode two
guys the the the music in the background
is often quite loud and you know I want
to apologize in advance but it's a
super-fun podcast and the super-fun
podcast super fun episode super fun
episode and the interview with Harry and
Chris is just delightful because of them
not me though Chris does at one point
wash one of my feet which is a delight
yeah I think that's mostly what you need
to know if you subscribe to this I
looked at some advice kind of videos and
stuff like that on doing a podcast
to do this or redo this and the the
advice was don't ask people to listen to
your podcast or tell their friends that
means nothing you need to get them to
subscribe so hey would you subscribe to
this podcast please
that would be grant and do email and
tell me what you thought and give me
some suggestions that would be rad
Sookie and I will see you at episode 2
so only remains for me to say that
tuscan lanka does not sponsor the show
but gosh it would be lovely affected and
i want it to be a little bit nerdy about
beer and so i checked out their
wikipedia page and they say that it's
owned by East African Breweries which is
an imprint of Diageo which is
unfortunate it was set up in 1922 I just
know it as that beer that you drink when
you're in Kenya and it's just super
great a little bit sweet and really
lovely the woody call that stuff the
slogan on the back of the t-shirt Ione
of tusky because I liked it that much
was bada yeah cause II which means for
after work which i think is a very
responsible attitude to beer if if not
super fun because hey you know it's
always 10 a.m. somewhere but there's
also they have a new one now which I
can't pronounce because I'm gonna say
cuz I've had a few beers and also
because I don't want to be accused of
either culture and sensitivity or
cultural appropriation but it means my
beer my country which you know could be
taken kind of mega I know that anyway so
that's the end of episode 1 just to tell
you basically what this podcasts gonna
be about love it if you could spread the
word love it if you could subscribe but
really you haven't heard what it's
mostly about until you listen to episode
2 which is quite a commitment I
understand or you can just get through
them because who knows when you're
getting to this it's the Internet's
forever
I hope you have a delightful day /
evening / can be better if you're
listening to this and thank you so much
for listening
