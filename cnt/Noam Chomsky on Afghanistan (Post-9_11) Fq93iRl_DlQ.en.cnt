mentioned this silent genocide that you
blame America for or will blame America
in the coming weeks I know that you
don't believe that America put these
Afghan people on the brink of starvation
in the first place you may ascribe that
to the world economy there are many
reasons why these people were on the
brink of starvation in the first place
so certainly you don't blame America for
putting them in the position
second of all I thought it was
conspicuously absent from your
discussion any mention of blaming the
Taliban which could end this genocide
that you mentioned by simply turning
over a sama bin Laden to an
international court they could end it
immediately and that was conspicuously
absent from your discussion also you
mentioned you also mentioned by analogy
you said that if there were a madman who
were down the street it would be wrong
for us to turn an assault rifles on our
neighbors and to shoot everyone without
knowing where he is I suggest that your
analogy is perhaps flawed and I'd like
to pose another one if you'd humor me
instead of a madman a killer being down
the street who knows where we know
exactly where he is let's say he's taken
over a large mansion we don't know which
room he's in but the family that lives
there has said that they will take up
arms and oppose law enforcement from
entering the home to obtain this known
criminal now how would the government
react to a home in this situation they
might cut the power they might cut the
gas they would probably cut the water
perhaps they would threaten that if
these persons were to aid and abet the
criminals and prevent law enforcement
from entering the home to take them into
incarceration perhaps in fact violent
means would be threatened against these
people how do you respond to this
hypothetical and also my own
hypothetical it's dealing with a house
it's in other country it's not a
sovereign nation all hypotheticals and
analogies are odd in this way and so
we're dealing here with a serious
problem 6,000 people are dead if we turn
to economic retaliation if we turn to
economic sanctions certainly the poor
Afghan people will be
first and foremost by economic sanctions
so I know you're opposed to that you're
obviously opposed to military sanctions
so having real doubt economic and
military sanctions
I don't suppose spitballs would be in
order well I already gave you the answer
why I think you do but let's go through
your questions first of all you said I
believe America and that is secondly
when you say that the United States had
nothing but it's the world economy that
had to do with Afghanistan it's just not
true
well the Afghanistan has always been a
very good place and there are many
reasons for its current straits but two
primary ones are called Russia in the
United States the United States Russia
in the United States and the 1980s
practically destroyed the place not to
help the Afghans as soon as the place
was destroyed they pulled out and the
sources that the United States organized
to harass the Russians Human Rights
Watch cause the worst period in Afghan
history as these various sources that
the u.s. a target on us with its allies
just tore the place of perfect probably
killed 50,000 people I mean they would
carry on mass rapes and slaughters and
destroy cuddle in fact they were so
horrendous that when the Taliban came in
in the 1994-1995 they were actually
welcome because at least there wasn't an
order to the place and writing I think
mad madmen who had been left behind from
the US war meanwhile yours didn't do
anything for them
so when you say
let's not ruin America it's being people
like you and me you can do something
about it there's no abstract into the
America that acts and when we had a lot
to do with this quite a lot to do with
it there plenty of other forces to you
say the Taliban could solve the problem
by just handing him over to equipment
business out the Taliban could solve a
lot of problems by disappearing I'm been
strongly in favor of that for a long
time however I have no way of making
them disappear
so like it's suppose we were in Russia
in the 1980s know somebody could have
some and some dissident was criticizing
the Russian invasion well a commissar
could have stood up and said look what
do you buy a curse on the Russian
invasion
why aren't you criticizing what the
Afghans are doing to each other yeah
that's the standard connoisseur align we
know what to think about it you and I
are responsible for what you and I can
do we have no moral responsibility for
what other people do and we can't affect
we may hate it we can't do anything
about it like we could have a debate the
discussion right now about the crimes of
Genghis Khan and we might be correct
about it it would have no moral value
whatsoever might have some historical
value same with the you know can't think
of it do about them
fine then have an academic seminar but
don't think it hasn't any moral value
when you tell me what the Taliban can do
it's exactly the same the moral value of
that is yeah they could do a lot of
things for example one thing they could
do is what you said turn over to a third
party
well the problem of that is the US has
refused to allow it now are they serious
in that offer that's been going on for a
couple of weeks well we don't know
because every time the offer is made
George Bush stands up and says where I'm
gonna talk to you we're not gonna
negotiate with you we don't want to
turned over
let's has nothing to do with how rotten
the Taliban are yeah
they're rotten water rotten things in
the world we should be if we're serious
we should be concerned with what we do
and what we tend to do if there's an
elementary moral truism that's so let's
say there's a killer in a house and I'm
suddenly we don't nobody knows where he
is firstly they don't even know that
he's the person notice they don't have
any evidence against him I mean there
was evidence that his networks are in
the background yeah that's um almost
certainly true although no evidence is
presented like I said it's kind of facie
plausible but they don't know that it's
him he may be telling the truth when he
says he wasn't involved and there's some
reason to believe it in fact a good deal
of the foreign press some commentators
believe it because it just doesn't seem
credible that he could have carried it
out or initiated it so they don't know
that he's the perpetrator and they don't
know where it is they haven't a clue
where he is
so what the writer so let's pick your
house analogy you feel like you say that
there are people there were going to
defend him
are those the seven to eight million
Afghan so when they're trying to starve
to death are they defending him victims
defending him the people who are killing
our innocent Afghans not people were
defending Osama bin Laden they're the
victims of the Taliban they're the ones
we're attacking is that your the analogy
you made as an interesting case and you
could talk about it in some seminars but
nothing to do with this what's going on
here when the New York Times tells us
that food shipments have been cut back
to the point where the number of people
now at risk of starvation since
September 11th has increased by 50% so
to seven point five million that's
another two-and-a-half main people at
risk of starvation since September 11th
as a result as they point out correctly
of the threat of us bombing and the
terror it's caused and so on and the
withdrawal of aid and of international
workers well those people are not
defending men Laden those are perfectly
innocent
civilians who have nothing to do with it
except that they're victims of the
Taliban you and I not some abstract
entity are consciously acting to murder
okay if we can't face that we have no
right talking about this problem
