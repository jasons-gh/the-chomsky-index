this
okay Audio is cameras rolling and
whenever you are ready ready no one just
like came from Azerbaijan and about the
research on the Shiite Muslim and
Christian relationship and I was very
surprised to see over there there are
mosques people Sunni and Shiite they are
praying together which we see they were
in peace for centuries ready and but
praying together
in fact there are some faces there they
have if you look at this picture they
have basically altars three authors in
the same mosque and churches there's a
kind of tolerance cultural tolerance the
question would be what two issues one is
the Sunni Shiite conflict in the past it
was very bloody but for centuries in
many countries they have been in peace
living together and also the United
States interests in the area of want
stability but it seems that there is
more right now it seems to me that
there's provocation trying to kind of
live off of this conflict to maybe I
don't know for so
but whether there is a contradiction
between the policies strategy in the
Middle East and would you say the US
seek stability you have to understand
the technical meaning of the word
stability stability stability means
following us orders so and so for
example just to take an illustration one
leading far affairs specialist advantage
a smaller editor the journal Foreign
Affairs of liberal analyst that once
wrote
regretfully that it was necessary to
destabilize Chile by overthrowing the
parliamentary regime in the spoiling of
this dictatorship in order to bring
about stability so we got to stabilize
the country in the aim of stability it's
not a contradiction if you understand
the technical meaning in order to ensure
that the society follows us workers who
was necessary to overthrow the
government and elected governments well
dictatorship when the u.s. invades Iraq
the goal is to establish stability by
destroying the society and in fact
inflaming the Shiite Sunni constantly
which was not there before it was very
much like what you described later
I think so now it's a bitter rural
conflict that just this morning
depressing else another 50 people killed
yesterday and it spread throughout the
region inflamed by the invasion but
that's nice that's bringing about
stability an effort to bring about
obedience with the United States that
when Iran in contrast isn't accused of
destabilizing its neighbors arrived in
Afghanistan how by trying to extend its
cultural and commercial influence that's
destabilizing because it draws them out
in the u.s. so there's no contradiction
when you understand the religion the
state religion governs the way these
things are discussed and what the
conflict in Syria and became begun as a
an effort to have spent extend what was
happening in the Arab Spring efforts by
democratic performers to gain some is a
pretty harsh brutal dictators and
getting some limited democratic and
human rights the Assad regime reacted
with extreme violence and brutality the
dynamics finally led to an armed
conflict which has been moving towards a
shia-sunni conflict it's part of what
the US the fires that the us live in
Iraq are now burning throughout the
region in the background is a conflict
between Iran and the oil dictatorships
of the Gulf region
extreme Islamic fundamentalists the
Saudi Arabians of the Gulf states are in
the dictators are in conflict with the
Iranian regime for influence and that's
turned into a kind of a Sunni Shia
conflict as well none of these as you
mentioned these things go back centuries
there's always something similar and if
you take a complex social situation and
you hit it with a sledgehammer a lot of
all things can happen and in fact that's
what the invasion of Iraq did the series
case a point it's become this Onishi
open market also courage so a serious in
the process of moving that's moving
toward some kind of suicide the part is
it will probably be partition it's a
trap part to partition with the Kurdish
air is drifting towards the Iraqi
Kurdistan may be assimilating to them
the rest is divided between a dog run
by the way Cindy she region and the
Sunni regions dictatorship and do you
see any kind of a future or what kind of
any prognosis
we've got indeed issue Iran has been
serious heading toward suicide that
conflict is indeed spreading over the
region a very dangerous it's kind of
interesting to see the way of American
commentators discuss it David Brooks
intellectual commentator they had a
column recently in which you pointed out
accurately that you know we're all
concerned about the alleged massacres in
Syria but we should understand that in
the background is a raging and growing
see us-led throughout the region and
then he added something he said this is
the result of this is an indication of
the failure of the US policy of
withdrawing from the region and removing
our moderating influence well that he's
reflecting the state religion the state
religion is that what we do is benign so
if we destroy another country
that's helpful our moderating influences
would set off the conflict the factors
that that was what stimulated the
partners that are nominee but you can't
see that if you're a dedicated believer
in the state religion which is a kind of
fanaticism there's a fanatic belief in
the purity of American Motors that's
what's called American exceptionalism we
have to believe in that no matter what
the facts are and it's not unique to the
United States was also true if their
Chairman 8000 - a day was the sense that
we're so magnificent doesn't is not
affected by date by fact it really is a
fundamentalist religion or
fundamentalist religion thank you very
much
