I took a look at the Sanders campaign I
mean it really hasn't been discussed
discussed as much as it should be but it
was a pretty astonishing achievement I
mean for well over a century American
elections have been pretty much bought I
mean the evidence is just overwhelming
the person who's done most of the work
on this is Tom Ferguson political
scientist at UMass Boston used to be at
MIT he's got a book called golden rule
which studies the role just simply of
campaign funding on outcome of elections
and policies going way back into the
19th century right through the New Deal
and so on and it's startling results he
has a recent paper that came out a
couple months ago was looking at
congressional elections from about 1980
up till the present and just comparing
campaign funding with electability and
it's kinda like a straight line you
don't get results like that in the
social sciences well and it's nothing
new I mean back in 1895 there was a
great campaign manager then named Mark
Hanna and he was asked once what's
necessary to run a successful political
campaign and he said well you need two
things the first one is money and I've
forgotten what the second one is
that's it that was 1895 it's gotten way
more extreme since and by now it's out
of sight
okay after over a century of this
somebody comes along who nobody ever
heard of that he uses a scare word
socialist you know he has no funding
nothing from the corporate sector and
nothing from wealthy people immediate
totally against him almost either
ridiculing and we're dismissing him but
easily have won the Democratic Party
nomination if it hadn't been for the
party shenanigans to keep him out it's a
pretty amazing development and what it
shows is that the institutions are they
look powerful but they collapse as soon
as the population becomes engaged
they're basically very weak actually
that's an insight that goes back
hundreds of years one of the first
modern works on politics is by David
Hume one great philosopher founder
classical liberalism he has a study
called I think Prince of first
principles of government and he opens it
by saying that there's a strange paradox
in governments he says in every
government whether you know military run
more or less popular like England at the
time this is the strange thing people
obey their rulers and why do they
because power is in the hands of the
government and if they want they can
take it and he says by what miracle is
this achieved this is only by control of
opinion if you can make people feel that
they're powerless don't hope and
everything's futile and they can't do
anything okay then they'll obey if not
they don't have to obey and that's much
more true in pretty free countries like
ours than say a military dictatorship
but it's but the paradox is real and
it's in people's hands too
overcoming and the Sanders campaign is
one dramatic illustration of that
