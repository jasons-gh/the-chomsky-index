suppose you're living under a
dictatorship and the dictators carry out
some horrendous act so you're living in
Stalinist Russia let's see and Stalin
carries out horrible crimes are the
people of Russia responsible for those
crimes well to only a very limited
extent because living under brutal harsh
terrorist regime there isn't very much I
can do about it I think there's
something they could do and to the
extent that you can do something you're
responsible for what happens suppose
you're living in a free democratic
society with lots of privilege enormous
incomparable freedoms and the government
carries out the violent brutal acts are
you responsible for it yeah a lot more
more responsible because there's a lot
you can do about it and therefore the
the cost of if you're responsible if you
share responsibility in criminal acts
you are liable for the consequences
