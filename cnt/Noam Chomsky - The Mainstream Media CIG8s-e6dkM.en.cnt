mainstream media gives essentially the
same message because why well we have to
look what the message is first of all
the message is one of remarkable sub
subordination to power now power in the
United States doesn't happen to be in
state it's not the it's not a
centralized military bureaucratic state
like in the Soviet Union right power in
the United States primarily lies in
corporations in the corporate world the
there's very narrow concentration of
control over resources over investment
decisions and so on and so forth and
that affects everything
can't help affecting everything it
affects the government because this
means that there's a very close link
between governmental power and corporate
power furthermore just the ability to
make investment decisions and financial
decisions places bounds on what any
government could do yes
furthermore it now let's go to the major
media for what are the major media well
they're huge corporations okay the New
York Times Washington Post NBC they
first of all are large corporations so
they're quite profitable ones in fact
secondly there are parts of even bigger
conglomerates like you know Westinghouse
and GE and so on now like any
corporation they sell a product on a
market this is a market roughly a mark
that kind of a state guided market
society what's the product and what's
the market well the markets advertisers
that is other businesses so they're
selling a product to other businesses
corporations are selling a product other
businesses what's the product well the
product is audiences now for the major
media the ones that kind of set the
agenda they're selling a lead audiences
privileged audiences New York Times say
is targeting privileged elite sectors of
the population that's their audience and
they're trying to sell that audience to
other businesses not so we have to begin
with just on you know the most
elementary grounds we have it we look at
a system suppose we're Martians you know
we're looking at this system we say okay
here are huge corporations selling
privileged audiences to other businesses
well what picture of the world do you
expect to come out of
then we begin that other factors if
you're let's say you're the chief
diplomatic correspondent of the New York
Times or you know fund it on the op-ed
page and you want to really have
important you know insights into the
government well we all know how that's
done you have lunch with the Secretary
of State he tells you the lies that he
wants to appear tomorrow you write them
and you say a high source in Washington
my intrepid reporting has discovered
that a high source in Washington said so
and so in fact if you compare the
internal declassified record you know if
say people like Dean Acheson decisions
and you look at say James Reston's
columns they're pretty close and the
same will be true about James Baker and
Thomas Friedman furthermore this is an
open secret we know that this is the way
it's it's not a big secret and the
journalists position that this is now in
order to maintain those contacts you
better present the world a certain way
or those contacts are going to be cut
off you'll you'll lose your opportunity
to have to appear to have special
insight to have leaks you know to be
able to come across with a story you
know couple hours before the next person
and so on plus you'll now in order
there's a there's an interplay here
which requires power in order to
maintain your own power that's another
factor over and above the just
structural and institutional
