I mean in fact the the Bush
administration you have to give them
credit has shown a certain genius in
isolating the United States they have
even succeeded in alienating Canada and
that takes real talent you know the and
that's another major oil energy provider
the US just refused to accept NAFTA
rulings against the United States in
favor of Canada well you know here who
cares you know kick them in the face
kick the UN in the face it's our job but
the Canadians were not too enthusiastic
about it and the Canadian government I
don't think they're going to implement
it but they did state minister of
resources and others that if the u.s. is
not going to follow the rules they will
simply start shift there some of their
oil exports from the United States to
China which will be perfectly happy to
move in well you know as I say that
takes a certain genius you gotta admire
Venezuela is diversifying its economy
its exports China is very happy to move
in and invest and it's again the other
resource exporters in South America
primarily brazil and chile are
increasing exports to china same
incidentally is happening in the Middle
East as you may have noticed remember
when president who visited Washington a
couple of weeks ago the United stood
aside adult him by not granting him a a
state dinner well he returned the insult
very cordially by leaving from the
United States and flying to Saudi Arabia
real slap in the face to Washington and
a serious one much more serious than a
state dinner where he firmed up
relations which are already pretty
strong between China and Saudi Arabia
which is China is now getting a lot of
its oil from there it's investing there
it's even giving a military aid this is
part of the deterioration of
Washington's control over the major
energy resort of energy and other
resource rich areas Latin America is a
part of it you got to look at it in the
context of what's happening in the
Middle East it's not unrelated to the
threats to invade Iran in fact if you
look at the take a look closely at the
attention given to the Iranian nuclear
threat I mean it picks up roughly in
round august 2003 that's when you start
getting a lot of rhetoric about it and
then it continues to increase from then
well what was happening then take a look
what was happening then was that the
u.s. invaded Iraq the reason was as bush
and Blair and Powell repeatedly
announced what they called a single
question will Saddam Hussein give up his
programs of weapons of mass destruction
by the summer of two thousand three the
question was answered the wrong way so
you had have something new and a new
pretext came along that's when the
president announced his messianic
mission to bring democracy to the world
and so on that was the real reason you
know weapons of mass destruction wien
care about its their messianic mission
to bring democracy and everybody got on
that bandwagon but you also had to have
some if it turned out that Iraq is not
going to be a stable dependent client
state you know kind of an El Salvador
which of course is what they're hoping
for and by then it was pretty clear
that's not going to happen you're going
to have to have some other pretexts to
keep military bases there to build the
palace which is the hugest embassy in
the world and so on and the other you
know the other indications of a
permanent military presence to control
it well you know one good pretext is you
got to protect the world against Iran
and in fact as Bush's popularity
rankings decline rhetoric about the
Iranian threat increases was actually
pointed out recently and quite a good
article and a lock rom the Gyptian
journal but if you look I think that's
pretty accurate the nuclear the concern
over the nuclear threats becomes visible
at about the same time that the
democracy promotion rhetoric begins both
of them responses to the fact that the
pre
text for invasion had collapsed and that
it was becoming very difficult to
control the country and impose a client
regime as it been intended and it
increases from there I think all of
these things are related and what's
happening in Latin America is part of
this picture sir
