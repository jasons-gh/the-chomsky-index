this the topic which I was going to talk
about is pretty broad it's about
democracy and markets and the way the
world order is evolving there is a kind
of a standard version on this which I
won't waste much time on you've heard of
them seeing it often the standard
version is that there's a sharp break
taking place in the nature of world
order there's a new era opening which is
an era of great promise for the growth
of markets and growth of democracy the
United States has won a major victory
the Cold War 1989 definitive in
symbolizes the break and the new opening
the there are other processes the
process of globalization has changed the
nature of the world radically and
there's a minimization of the state and
the increase in market relations and so
on that's the general picture it's even
a even formalized as the Clinton
doctrine the National Security Adviser a
couple years ago Anthony Lake who's sort
of the intellectual of the
administration presented the Clinton
doctrine as expressing these views his
basic thesis was that until at the end
of the Cold War the United States has
been engaged in containing the threat to
market democracy but now that threat is
suppressed and we can now go on to
enlarge the reach of market democracy as
as we'd been intending to do all along
and are now free to do I think there's a
good deal of reason for skepticism about
the every aspect of this picture every
aspect some of the aspects of the
picture are just flat wrong by
everyone's agreement
at least debatable so it takes a
minimization of the state one of the
main features of contemporary doctrine
is that the day of the large active
state is over and that we have to
minimize the state and move to more
market principles you can get an
estimate as the accuracy of that in the
latest annual volume of the World Bank
development report they every year come
out with their flagship publication a
lot of fanfare and so on supposed to
represent mainstream economic thinking
kind of interesting because it rapidly
oscillates from one year to the next
which may tell you something this year
is about the state and markets and they
just they give some data on the ratio of
state expenditures to GNP worldwide and
it shows what people should have known
it's differentiated there are some areas
of the world where in fact the state is
being minimized that is reducing
relative to GNP namely those areas that
have been under the influence and
control of the international financial
institutions in the United States
it's a sub-saharan Africa and Latin
America in those areas in fact state
expenditures relative to GNP are low and
declining and there are also all
economic disasters in the rich countries
oacd countries that's the place where
the ratio of state expenditures GNP is
the highest and it's been going up went
up quite sharply in the 1980s it's still
going up though less sharply in the
Asian growth area which has been
essentially out of World Bank u.s.
domination
state expenditures relative to GNP have
been going up they're not as high as the
rich countries but going up so what you
do have there is a picture namely the
place where the international
institutions the World Bank the IMF
US government in the areas where they
can pretty much control policy the state
is indeed declining it was always lower
it's getting still lower and in fact
there's a poverty's increasing in
absolute terms as well as relative terms
in general there's an economic disaster
except for a small sector of the
population in the rich country is
exactly the opposite is happening one
might want to draw some conclusions from
that the World Bank doesn't but anyway
those are the data about minimization of
the state what about markets is this a
period of growth of markets well no and
in fact it's known not to be so if you
look at the technical literature by
international economists and so on they
point out quote one of the major
scholarly studies of this by economist
of the GATT Secretariat that the last 25
years have been a period of sustained
assault on free markets led by the rich
countries the OECD countries with the
United States for 'only Reaganite anti
market measures he estimates at about
three times the level of those of other
OECD countries and they're very severe
this incidentally is quite well known
read and say the Foreign Affairs a
review of every year they have a review
and the review of the decade in 1990
reviewed the last decade by their editor
you know this is the major establishment
Journal pointed out that the Reaganites
quote him that the Reaganites had led
the greatest swing toward protectionism
since the 1930s they had shifted the
United States from being a supporter of
multilateral free trade to being its
leading Challenger and the facts
bear that out the Reagan administration
in fact that essentially doubled
protection for US markets by one or
another device they were more
protectionist than all post-war
administrations combined and in fact
they boasted about this to the business
community they didn't keep it secret and
that's the only one part of their
radical market interference they also
poured state subsidies into high
technology industry under the usual
military cover and in many other ways
made sure that that at least wealthy
sectors in the United States weren't
gonna have to face market discipline and
that was part of a sustained assault
against markets all over from the rich
countries all over the world on the
other hand it is differentiated the
poorer countries particularly those that
were under the influence and domination
of the international financial
institutions and the United States the
one subject to what's called the
Washington Consensus which tells you
where it's coming from they they did
indeed open themselves up to markets
with consequences that you can observe
Mexico was the most recent example case
after case is a disaster for most of the
population but it's true that markets
have been increasing there there is also
further differentiation the last 25
years have been a period of restrictive
measures on trade but great
liberalisation of finance that's a
radical change that really is a change
and a significant change in world order
but it didn't do with the Cold War took
place starting 60s but radically in the
early 1970s and that led to huge changes
so for the first time in modern history
financial flows have first of all been
astronomical and very rapid and also
essentially uncorrelated to the real
economy so
before this period say 1970 about 90
percent of the capital interactions and
foreign exchange were related to trade
an investment that is the real economy
about 10% were speculative by now it's
about 5% related to the real economy and
about 95% speculative the speculative
flows are extremely rapid about 80% of
them have a turnaround time of a week
and most of that is a day some of it is
even minutes and it's astronomical
it's just shot out of sight by now it's
over a trillion dollars a day
totally you know how weighing the
resources of even rich countries even
the European Union and so on so that's a
big change but and that liberalisation
of capital has increased but restriction
on trade has increased along with it
that correlation is well known it's not
a perfect correlation but it's a
relationship in fact the whole post-war
economic system was built on that
relationship when the United States and
Britain designed the post-war economic
system back 1945 what's called the
Bretton Woods system it was designed to
liberalize trade and restrict finance
so the the system that was designed by
Harry Dexter white and John Maynard
Keynes and the rest of them was designed
specifically to try to increase trade
they thought that'd be a good thing and
in order to do that to restrict capital
so their countries had capital controls
in fact the OECD countries the rich ones
maintained capital controls into the
1980s the there are countries that
didn't like Latin America they have
their very free and an open to
international capital and sub-saharan
Africa so they have plenty of capital
they don't have capital controls and you
can see it
the famous debt crisis hit Latin America
and did not hit East Asia primarily for
that reason it's kept the capital flowed
out of Latin America to New York banks
and the London and so on the rich people
sent their money elsewhere in other
words instead of investing it
domestically and the Latin American debt
is not very different from capital
flight in other words they kept their
money inside the famous that wouldn't
have would barely be there and that
indeed is what happened in East Asia
which did have capital controls it's all
it was understood by Keynes white and
other designers of the world order from
1945 that these two things were
generally an inverse relationship as you
liberalized capital you tended to
restrict trade and conversely and that
remains true generally speaking it's
been true the last 25 years very radical
liberalisation of financial capital and
the period of restrictive nosov trade
even the so-called trade agreements are
in fact not free trade agreements they
have
very severe protectionist elements I'll
come back to that if there's time anyhow
first picture about minimization of the
state is true in a very differentiated
fashion it's not true for the rich
countries not true for East Asia in fact
the opposite is true but it is true for
the poorer countries and increasing for
the poorer countries and that in fact is
part of the Washington Consensus that's
part of what's imposed on them now
actually it's a little more nuanced than
that because another recent change is
that internal to the rich countries
especially the United States and England
there is there's an analogue to that so
the state has not declined relative to
GNP in England in the United States and
the Thatcher and Reagan Reagan but it's
shifted it's shifted to more and more
service to the wealthy and less and less
service to the rest of the population
which is the domestic analog to the
international system so yes there is
liberalisation for the poor like you
know seven-year-old children have to
learn responsibility and you know get
out of that cycle at the pendency and
face market discipline and so on but not
rich people they have to be protected
from market discipline they have to be
protected by socialization of risk and
socialization of cost along with of
course privatization of profit and
management but they don't want to face
they have to stay on the cycle of
dependency and that's become very
striking in the Reagan and Thatcher
years the so after 17 years of Thatcher
state expenditures relative to GNP were
exactly what they were when she came in
but the change shift in the way the
state was functioning was quite
substantial so there's a very sharp
increase in poverty and increase in
millions of children and poverty hunger
that hadn't been seen for 50 60 years
childhood diseases that had been over
declining and essentially overcome are
now back and it's a kind of a distinct
to Ken
in picture at the same time state
expenditures are being used to in fact
illegally they keep having scandals too
you know
subsidized aerospace exports and so on
and so forth that's a same here
I mean we're all familiar with it I
don't have to talk about it but there's
been a very sharp shift internally in
the United States in fact you see it
quite strikingly by looking at everyone
knows that should know at least that the
United States says by far the highest
level of inequality of any industrial
society and in fact it's mean after
having declined from about 1945 till
around 1970 it's been increasing and
it's now back to what it was around the
1920s and still going up but that
picture is not it's true but it's again
good to disaggregate it break it up into
its components the participation in the
economy what's called the market economy
but that's misleading but what's
participation in the economy leads to a
certain distribution of income okay so
you know you have a job and spend money
and so on that leads to a certain
distribution of income then comes a
second factor a social policy which is
taxes and transfers okay so it's called
government action but in fact it's
social policy and the more democratic
the society the more people participate
so when if you look at if you compare
the United States with other industrial
societies in market outcomes
what's the inequality there well it's
about the same as other societies so
we're United States ranks along with the
other industrial societies in terms of
distribution of income from market
outcomes if you add the effect of social
policy the United States diverges
radically that's where the divergence
comes in so you take into account taxes
and transfers you find the inequality
growing very sharply because that's the
nature of social policy
in the United States increasingly in
England and that's the big
reagan-thatcher revolution Kerry that
they're not it's not totally there but
they sort of symbolize it well okay
those are decisions you know they're not
laws of nature as you can see from the
fact they don't happen in other similar
societies but this is real and it's in
fact a domestic variant of the
international picture that I just
briefly sketched there couldn't be a
better symbol of this than Newt Gingrich
who's the leading you know no one is
more passionate about the need to break
the you know cycle of dependency and
learn responsibility and all this sort
of thing but not the people in the
district that he represents Cook County
Georgia a very rich suburb of Atlanta he
manages to maintain the record for
bringing federal subsidies to his
district I've maintained it for some
years because they're the rich folk in
Cook County they have to be saved from
market discipline they have to maintain
the cycle of dependency just the last
just as the last budget went through he
managed to sneak in another half billion
dollars for his favorite local charity
Lockheed Martin and which has corporate
headquarters down there and on that
standard I mean this is like you know
sort of symbolizes it but the pilot that
the picture is quite general and it's a
picture you see all around you you walk
a couple of bucks towards Roxbury you'll
see it welcome couple of blocks towards
financial centers you'll see the other
side of it and and that's happening on a
global scale as well so again in Latin
America there has been an which has been
subjected to the Washington Consensus
and it's quite open to international
capital flows and so on there's an
absolute increase in poverty with only
two exceptions Colombia and Chile
Colombia it's largely because of the the
drug based economy is a considerable
part of that and also because it
maintains capital controls in Chile it's
because contrary to what you read they
have not accepted the Washington
Consensus so it's not a free-market
society they for example do impose
controls on short-term speculative
capital flows and in fact their major
export copper most of it comes from a
nationalized company you know which is
quite efficient and so on so they've
managed some sort of nuanced form of
development whatever you want to call it
and though they're not Tigers in the
Asian sense they're not disasters and
the Mexican sense
well that picture seems fairly general
and it's enough to make one think at
least about the sort of mantra you know
that we're entering into a new period of
markets and minimization of State and so
on and so forth I think if you look
closely it's not that what about
democracy is it a new era of democracy
the result of the victory of the United
States and the Cold War well you can
look at that - for one thing notice that
to the extent that there is an extension
of market principles there's a decline
in democracy those two things go hand in
hand when you minimize the state you
don't eliminate decision making you just
transfer it so it's not being made in
the state system it's being made
somewhere else and where it's been the
you know the story is this is a transfer
of power to the people but that's not
even a joke so we don't do waste any
time on that it's a transfer of power to
to the private sector undoubtedly but
that's not the people that's the highly
concentrated power system within the
private sector so in fact it's a
transfer of power from the state system
where there's whatever degree of
participation there may be you know a
lot in some countries less in other
countries but some degree of
participation and in principle a lot of
participation in fact full participation
in principle there's a transfer from
that system to a system of unaccountable
private power where in principle there
is no participation so you and I in
principle have nothing to say about the
decisions of General Electric and
Microsoft you know that's a matter of
law and principle and unless you have
their own some stock then you have as
much say as the stock you own which
means if you're in the top few
percentage of the population you own
most of the stock and you have most of
the say but there isn't even in
Princeton and these are unaccountable
also you also can't find out what
they're doing like you can't find you
can't read the fun to out the books of
General Electric that's a secret so
these are unaccountable private power
internally they're essentially
totalitarian if you take a look at the
structure of a corporation it's about as
close to the totalitarian model as
anything human beings have devised you
know with power vested at the top orders
going down
stage by stage if you're a middle level
managers say take your Raiders from
above and you hand them down below Eve
as in totalitarian systems see Stalinist
Russia there's some interaction you know
like nothing's totally rigid and all
other influences but it's a as I say
about as close to the
Aryan ideal as humans have constructed
and unaccountable and that's where
powers that's where decisions are
transferred so to the extent that these
processes are taking place yeah it's a
it's an attack on democracy virtually by
definition and the efforts to move
things in that direction or an attempt
to increase that but even beyond that
let's just take a look at democracy
within the state sector so a formal
democracy like voting rights and that
kind of thing here there's it's a mixed
story so take take the regions where the
US has been influential that's primarily
the Western Hemisphere that's the place
to look to check the theory that there's
been a victory for democracy we've been
trying to contain threats to it now we
enlarge its scope so we can look at the
Western Hemisphere well that's been
studied studied rather well there's good
scholarship on it the best scholarly
work on the topic is most extensive is
and it's good as by Thomas Carruthers is
a Latin American specialist who has the
advantage of also writing from an
insider's perspective because he was in
the Reagan administration in the State
Department
working on democracy enhancement
programs that was the period of the
great victory of democracy in Latin
America he was working on it in the
middle and he's now writing about it as
a scholar and his review I think is
basically accurate he points out that
there indeed was an increase in
democracy formal democracy and what in
Latin America and it was an inverse
correlation to US influence that is the
greater the US influence the less the
increase in democracy so there was an
increase in democracy in the Southern
Cone you know South America like
Argentina
Brazil Chile the Reagan administration
opposed it but once it proved
irresistible they sort of went along
with it and in fact even took credit for
it so in the regions of the least
influence there was an extension of
democracy in the regions of the most
influence which is nearby you know a
traditional area of US domination in the
Caribbean Central America that's where
there was least increase in democracy
there were formal democracies but as
Carruthers puts it o quote him
the United States would only tolerate
top-down forms of democracy of
democratic change that maintained the
traditional structures of power with
which the United States has long been
allied and maintained the basic order of
basic fundamentally of quite an
undemocratic societies yeah that's
correct if you look closely at the
region you'll find out that that's what
happened so yes there was a kind of a
victory of democracy and which was
substantial in the regions of less US
influence was less in the regions of
more US influence and in fact maintained
the structures of the undemocratic
societies in the same power systems
crucially that was a crucial part of the
move toward democracy I think you find
again an internal analog to that come
back to it at this time
the the the model that was given when
Anthony Lake announced the Reagan the
Clinton dr. you know the great new
doctrine he gave an example a prize
example to illustrate how it's going to
work the new victories of markets and
democracies the example he gave was
Haiti and it's a good example because
the recent developments there are post
Cold War so one can't give any arguments
about this was a reflection of the Cold
War or whatever actually I don't think
those arguments work very well for
earlier periods either but here the
question is moved
because the events in question are after
the end of the Cold War and Haiti was
offered as the example of the our
achievements and the promise of bringing
democracy and markets to ABBA knighted
world so that's a good one to look at
and then when you look at it you find it
illustrates all the phenomena I've just
been describing quite accurately I think
when in there was a democratic election
first democratic election in Haiti in
1990 the United States did not oppose it
the United States had its own candidate
mark bazaine a world bank official and
it took for granted everyone took for
granted he was gonna win he had all the
resources he had all the rich people
working for him and so on so if everyone
figured he'd be a shoo-in
so that looked like an OK election
maintained the top-down structure of
power well to everyone's surprise he
didn't win if I got smashed he got 14%
of the vote and 2/3 of the vote went to
a candidate nobody thought about namely
jean-bertrand Aristide who was supported
by a something that no one had noticed
namely a huge popular grassroots
movement in the poor in the peasant
society in the urban slums nobody pays
any attention to those people but they
had been developing lively organizations
and grassroots movements and so on and a
very light vibrant civil society a
sufficient so they even swept their own
president into office with two-thirds of
the vote and no resources that's pretty
remarkable in fact that is probably the
most dramatic victory of democracy and
the Western Hemisphere and quite a long
time in fact maybe ever you could argue
but or not just the Western Hemisphere
it was pretty dramatic event rarely
takes place and that was an election
real democratic election post-cold-war
the United States did react
it was extremely hostile the United
States moved at once to undermine the
democratic government cut off aid except
for opponent
so the president supported his business
elements that were trying to undermine
him the this is despite the fact that
his policies were quite successful in
fact mildly reformist policies so
successful that even the World Bank and
the IMF were impressed and forgiving
loans and so on but the United States
was dedicated in undermining it you
could see the dedication rather
strikingly by looking at refugee policy
which is quite very revealing in this
case during the period of the brutal
dictatorship that the u.s. had back
there was an enormous flow of refugees
from Haiti people were fleeing from
terror and poverty they were turned back
by force illegally this is in radical
violation of the UN declaration of human
rights but the Carter Administration and
the dictatorship made an agreement which
was then extended by Reagan to
forcefully return people fleeing from
Haiti not to grant them asylum and that
continued until the democratic election
at that point the refugee flow stopped
virtually stopped this is a trickle and
in fact it reversed because people
started going back patients started
returning in this period of hopefulness
and US refugee policy also reversed it
reversed the towards granting asylum to
refugees in fact asylum requests were
granted at 50 times the rate during the
democratic interlude as before because
now they were fleeing a democratic
government not a murderous dictatorship
so therefore they were real political
refugees a couple of months later just
to dramatize the fact a few months later
there was a military coup president
Aristide was overthrown US refugee
policy reversed now they were people
were again fleeing from brutal
it was pretty bad and there for a little
while myself but you have to be there to
know how bad it was it was awful people
were fleeing from poverty terror torture
and they were forced back the United
States imposed and again obviously
illegal blockade to force them back and
that's still going on
a couple hundred were just forced back a
few weeks ago
well that symbolizes what happened when
the military coup took place the United
States made the right noises of the Bush
administration about saying how bad this
is and we're in favor of democracy but
they move that wants to support the
military coup the Organization of
American States called an embargo
