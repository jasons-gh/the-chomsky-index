the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
we continue our conversation with the
world renowned political dissident
linguist author Noam Chomsky institute
professor emeritus at MIT his latest
book who rules the world I asked him for
his assessment of the Obama
administration it's about what I thought
before he before the 2008 primaries when
I wrote about him just based on the
information in his web page I didn't
expect anything I expected mostly
rhetoric and you know nice rhetoric but
speaker and so on but nothing much in
the way of action I don't usually agree
with sarah palin but when she was
ridiculing this what you called this
hope he changes stuff she had a point
there were a few good things you know
there was a few good things in the W
Bush administration but opportunities
that were available especially in the
first two years when he had Congress
with him just were not used and some
it's a by the standards of US
presidential politics it's kind of
nothing special either way nothing to
rave about certainly I wanted to ask you
about the passing of Michael Ratner
Michael Ratner the former head of the or
the late head of the Center for
Constitutional Rights the trailblazing
human rights attorney who died last week
at the age of 72 I had interviewed
Michael last year in washington DC at
the reopening of the cuban embassy after
it was closed for more than five decades
and I asked Michael to talk about the
significance of this historic day this
is an excerpt of what he said well I
mean let's just say
other than the birth of my children this
is perhaps one of the most exciting days
of my life I mean I've been working on
Cuba since the early 70s if not before I
worked on the vents of rainbows Brigade
I went on brigades I did construction
and to see that this can actually happen
in a country that decided early on and
unlike most countries in the world it
was going to level the playing field for
everyone no more rich no more poor
everyone the same education for everyone
schooling for everyone housing if they
could and to see the relentless United
States go against it from the Bay of
Pigs to utter subversion on and on and
to see Cuba emerge victorious and when I
say that this is not a defeated country
this is a country if you heard the
foreign minister today what he spoke of
was the history of us imperialism
against Cuba from the intervention in
the spanish-american war to the Platt
Amendment which made us a permanent part
of the Cuban government the taking of
Guantanamo the failure to recognize it
in 1959 to the cutting off of relations
in 1961 this is a major major victory
for the Cuban people and that should be
understood we are standing at a moment
that I never expected to see in our
history that was Michael Ratner it was
july twenty second it was that historic
day in washington DC when the cuban
embassy was opened after almost half a
century if you could talk both about the
significance of Michael Ratner from his
work around Guantanamo ultimately
challenging the habeas corpus rights of
Guantanamo prisoners that they should
have their day in court and winning this
case in the Supreme Court to all of his
work and also talk about Cuba noms
something that you certainly take on in
your new book who rules the world well
Michael Ratner has an absolutely
fabulous record his achievements have
been a norm
tremendous courage intelligence
dedication a lot of achievement against
huge odds the center which he largely it
was a major factor and was major actor
in has done wonderful work all over the
place Cuba and lots of other things so I
can't be excessive in my prays for what
he achieved in his life and the
inspiration that it should leave us with
with regard to Cuba US relations I think
what he just said is essentially
accurate fact it's even worse than that
we tend to forget that after the Bay of
Pigs the Kennedy administration would
was practically in a state of hysteria
and the seeking to somehow avenge
themselves against this upstart who was
carrying out what the government called
successful defiance of US policies going
back to the Monroe Doctrine how can we
tolerate that Kennedy authorized a major
terrorist war against Cuba the goal was
to bring the terrors of the earth to
Cuba that's the phrase of his associate
Arthur Schlesinger storing Arthur
Schlesinger in his biography of Robert
Kennedy Robert Kennedy was given the
responsibility to bring the terrors of
the earth to Cuba and it was it he in
fact described it as one of the prime
goals of government is to ensure that we
terrorize Cuba and I was pretty serious
thousands of people were killed after
chemical plants but other industrial
installations blown up the Russian ships
in the Havana Harbor were attacked
imagine what would happen to American
ships or tank there was it's probably
connected with poisoning of crops and
livestock can't be certain
winner that went on into the 1990s not
at that not at the extreme level of the
Kennedy years but pretty bad the late
seventies it was an upsurge blowing off
of a Cabana airliner so nice in 73
people killed the culprits are living
happily in Miami one of them died the
other we spotted a major terrorist as
cheerfully living there the taking over
of southeastern Cuba back at the time of
the Platt Amendment the US had
absolutely no claim to this territory
none whatsoever we're holding on to it
just in order it's major US military
base it was and but we're holding on to
it simply to impede the development of
Cuba major port and to have a dumping
place where we can send illegally send
Haitian refugees claiming that their
economic refugees when they're fleeing
from the terror of the Haitian Hunta
that we supported Clinton incidentally
in this case or just as a torture
chamber there's a lot of talk about
human rights violations in Cuba yeah
there are human rights violations in
Cuba by far the worst of them
overwhelmingly are in the part of Cuba
that we illegally hold you know
technically legally we took it at the
force of a gun so it's point of a gun so
it's legal I mean in comparison with
this whatever you think of Putin's
annexation of Crimea is minor in
comparison with this the all of this is
correct but we have to ask why did the
u.s. decide to normalize relations with
Cuba the way it's presented here it was
a historic act of magnanimity by the
Obama administration as he himself put
it and commentators echoed
we have tried for 50 years to bring
democracy and freedom to Cuba the
methods we use didn't work so we'll try
another method reality we tried for 50
years to bring terror violence and
destruction to Cuba not just the
terrorist war but they're crushing
embargo when the Russians disappeared
from the scene instead of you know the
pretense was well it's because of the
Russians when they disappeared from the
scene how did we react under Clinton by
making the embargo harsher Clinton
outflanked george HW bush from the right
in harsh during the electoral campaign
and harshness against cubans porcelli
New Jersey Democrat who initiated the
legislation later became worse with
helms-burton all of this has but that's
how we tried to bring democracy and
freedom to Cuba why the change because
the United States was being driven out
of the hemisphere you take a look at the
hemispheric meetings which are symbol of
it that Latin America used to be just
the backyard they do what you tell them
if they don't do it we throw them out
and put in someone else no more not in
the last 10 20 years it was hemispheric
meeting and in Cartagena Colombia i
think it was must have been 2012 when
the US was isolated US and canada were
completely isolated from the rest of the
hemisphere on two issues one was
admission of cuba into hemispheric
systems the second was the drug war
which latin america are essentially the
victims of the drug war the demand is
here the actually even the supply of
weapons say to mexico is largely here
but they're the ones who suffer from it
they want to change it they want to move
in various ways towards
decriminalization other measures us
opposed kind of opposed it was pretty
clear at that time
at the next hemispheric meeting which
was going to be in Panama if the u.s.
still maintained its position on these
two issues the the hemisphere would just
go along without the United States there
already are hemispheric institutions
like salek gonna serve for South America
which exclude the United States and it
would just move in that direction so
Obama bowed to the pressure of reality
and agreed to make to accept the demand
to the overwhelming demand to move
slowly towards normalization of
relations with Cuba not a magnanimous
gesture of courage to bring cube to
protect Cuba from its isolation to save
them from their isolation quite the
opposite to save the United States from
its isolation of course with the rest of
the world not even any question take a
look at the annual votes on the UN has
an annual votes on the US embargo and
just overwhelming I think the last one
was something like 182 to United States
and Israel it's been increasing like
that for years so that's the background
as for Michael Michael Ratner his
achievements are just really spectacular
and finally know you've just written
this book who rules the world you've
written more than 100 other books and I
mean you have been a deep profound
thinker and activist on world issues for
what I mean more than 70 years you were
writing when you were 14 years old given
your analysis of what's been happening
and I'm wondering where you think we
stand today if you agree with well with
dr. Martin Luther King that the arc of
the moral universe bends towards justice
actually was 10 years old but not
nothing to rave about
if you look over the past say they
roughly 75 years of my more or less
consciousness it's in general I think
the arc of history has been bending
towards justice there have been many
improvements some of them pretty
dramatic at women's rights for example
to an extent civil rights should be
remembered that there were literally
lynchings in the south until the early
1950s not beautiful now but that's not
happening there have been steps forward
opposition through aggression is much
higher than it was in the past there's
finally concern for environment
environmental issues which are really of
desperate necessity all of this is slow
halting significant steps bending the
orc of history in the right way there's
been regression a lot of regression and
things don't move smoothly but there
have been bad periods before we've
pulled out of them I think there are
opportunities they're not huge but
they're real to overcome the issue prot
and I stress again to overcome problems
that the human species has never faced
and it's roughly 200,000 years of
existence problems of literally survival
we've already answered these questions
for a huge number of species we've
killed them off Noam Chomsky
