hi i am john Brita's today we are
starting a new dialogue on development
the Corbett 19 crisis has disrupted life
everywhere Kerala is starting a new
platform to discuss and debate on
development let me welcome you all to
the Kerala dialogue a global
conversation Honorable the Honorable
Chief Minister of Kerala Chippenham
revision will inaugurate this series
once again I welcome you all to this
global conversation on development
humanity is in a battle with the covert
19 pandemic the pandemic and the
resultant crisis have made us all
rethink about the core aspects of our
life we now know that we have to change
for this new world our priorities are
going to change even the way we organize
our society may change some of the
common knowledge that we take for
granted might become useless
we may have to gain new knowledge to
adapt this is not something that
governments alone can do a society-wide
conversation is nursery we have to
search develop discuss and debate ideas
and models through this conversation
like many other occasions Kerala will be
a pathfinder in this quest also we are
starting a platform called Kerala
dialogue to facilitate this global
conversation scientists philosophers
policymakers economists active its
properties professionals and the general
public will be part of this conversation
in times of a crisis like Ovid 19 the
relationship between the state and the
people needs to be strong
presto earthy and organic careless
experience with this crisis has many
lessons to offer historically Herrara
kerala has had a very strong system of
decentralized governance they attempts
to build and strengthen the grassroots
level democracy in the state procedure
73rd and 74th constitutional amendments
legislative efforts in this regard
started as early as 1957 when the state
elected its first communist government
led by EMS Namboodiripad Kerala made
pioneering trials in the recent lies of
the form of governance including
implementation of the people's plan
program yes a result there is
considerable community participation in
the planning process which has enriched
through the process of decentralization
of power it is this strong system of
participating governance that has helped
kerala in the containment measures
related to the Coe with 19 pandemic a
state or a central government can give
broad directions and guidelines but
people's participation under the
leadership of empowered local
governments seems to be the most
effective strategy to contain the spread
of Ko with 19 pandemic at the same time
a strong public sector in health and
education he is necessary for this
decentralized model to work well the
kovat 19 pandemic has also made us
rethink the role of state intervention
especially in social sectors like health
the experience of the pandemic should
act yes a game changer in esses in the
role of the state public sector
intervention in social and economic
sectors cannot be treated yes n
avoidable able borrowing by this
it cannot always be a vice we now know
that economic and social inequalities
tend to make the problems of pandemic
worse the crisis has disproportionately
affected the marginalized and poor
communities we need to bring the focus
back onto the people I hope this
conversation will further advance our
understanding about the world the role
of governance and the best models for
our societies ie welcome you all to this
conversation
is it correct to talk in terms of a post
kovat 19 world does the pandemic
represent a transformative point well
what's gonna be a post pandemic world
depends on what people are doing right
now there are people the ones with the
power the ones who created the
neoliberal disaster the ones were
benefiting from Trump's malice they're
working they're working very hard
relentlessly to try to ensure that the
world that comes out from the pandemic
will be structurally much like the one
that caused it even harsher more
authoritarian more controls more
surveillance they're working on oh great
now things like I mentioned the
deregulation many other ways there are
counter forces all over the world very
significant ones if they can be brought
together and form a powerful force they
can change the way things will turn out
and there are steps in that direction
about two weeks ago the that was the
first announcement of progressive
international it's based on the Sanders
movement in the United States
Yanis varoufakis is the m25 in Europe
transnational organization in Europe
seeking to preserve what makes sense in
the European Union and overcome the
deeply flawed parts of it they're
forming a progressive international
voices from all over the world from in
the Africa global South the United
States Europe the prime minister of
Iceland as a member in the first meeting
will be in Iceland in September now
they're trying to create a different
how will this conflict emerge you could
ever predict but it's going on right now
little intensify as there are the
beginnings of decline of the pandemic
there will be recovery we should bear in
mind what we're talking about this
though the fact virtual fact we are
ultimately going to recover from the
pandemic that terrible cost we will
never recover from the melting of the
polar ice sheets and other grim
consequences of global warming which are
going to have a hideous effect on the
world South Asia will become
uninhabitable in an over several more
decades if we continue on our present
course that's just the beginning
we're not going to recover from that and
what are the governments of the world
doing let's take a look some mothers are
doing something including India not
enough but something the country that's
doing most is the most powerful country
in the world it's racing to Russia tough
towards the abyss Trump is pulling out
all the stops to try to maximize the use
of fossil fuels and to eliminate any
regulatory apparatus that might mitigate
them and for a good reason that enriches
his rich friends and increases corporate
power and if it leads to the destruction
of the organized human life that's not
an issue even smaller that takes a
trumps tearing up the agreement with
Iran why because Obama made the
agreement so he has to tear it up for
his own ego the effects are pretty
serious that's
I mean quite apart from the horrible
effects on Iran it's highly sharply
increasing the threat of major war in
the region Europe doesn't like it
are they doing anything no they don't
want you when the US imposes sanctions
the only country in the world that can
do this everyone in the world has to
obey the sanctions their third-party
sanctions so Europe doesn't want to be
thrown out of the international
financial system and it doesn't want to
anger the Mafia done in Washington so
they make timid protests and then they
observe the sanctions and go along Trump
came out with what's called the greatest
deal in history for for the Middle East
if any other country had put that out
people wouldn't if they'd even noticed
they'd be collapsing in ridicule when
the Trump comes out with it it's the law
now we ask how we can implement it does
it go too far and so on this is awesome
power no one else comes close and no one
else is going to come close all the talk
about you know China becoming in a
competing superpower I think he's built
on sand but what would you say covet 19
has taught us about inequality in the
world I think that's a very hard
question now because the pandemic in
itself doesn't come with lessons
it kills indiscriminately to read
welcome here see in the New York town
the banality visa began and again saying
hey go bid nineteen doesn't respect
jostle color that is black or white
across it doesn't and
didn't expected what makes that relevant
is how the population reacts to it what
happened if you and and this doesn't it
applies not only to condemning it
applies to any crisis the win in the
nineteen forties in 1940 the British
discovered that they didn't have as much
food per capita as we had before what
they did was to try to ensure that
through rationing and control Isis that
everyone will have that and suddenly
what was a negative situation of food
shortage turned into a positive
situation of people having most to the
entitlement for those who we're at the
bottom of the ladder and suddenly
undernourishment disappeared and that
experience is well applauded understood
and they were a great authors like Artie
Hammond liked it was who brought those
lessons to the attention of the public
to learn from it now unfortunately that
didn't happen for example take the
United State in areas like Chicago the
laxity african-americans maybe 30% of
the population but 70% of the deaths
were found the community of black on the
African invitin
chunk of it and and then as a result one
has to say that they there was no
attempt of the egalitarian reaction in
which for example the Buddha friend in
the forty the vision the trend is very
interesting because the faith fear
in which the which were suddenly being
set up better friend than ever before
with also the period in which the Bengal
famine happened in India in the widget
had no sympathy at all those who wear
noodle do and have the means of wine to
and repairing in a in large lady in some
ways the pairing began in the nineteen
forty two before the famine and then
they can bigger and bigger to the
cottage me until past October so that's
you see three different attitude of the
same leadership they leadership like
Churchill and anger and Levin and when
Reverend was dominant that's right
witness concern but Churchill was doing
it as far as India is concerned I don't
take the reviewers some people do that
me the famine is all the fault of one
question that under estimate what in
theory assume that there is only they
manifest itself in rainy phone and one
of them is a utter lack of sympathy to
other to another group of conquered
people as opposed to a dominant
metropolitan population so that happened
at that time and in some ways America
had this picture of looking with like an
imperial country the slaves have been
worked to America hundreds of years
earlier and that distinction between we
and they made it may be at long last
receiving some real resistance in in
public action connected with what's
going on in America right now and and I
see some hope in that what we do and how
we understand the problem makes a big
difference every adversity every
dialectical challenge is potentially
but it may not go that way he will
refuse to learn what seems to be after a
chose aren't reading of the situation
that you're not going to be able to
eradicate the virus you will have to
manage around it it's going to be with
us for a long time but you can do a lot
to contain it live with it perhaps the
trajectory will be from pandemic flu
epidemic to endemic would you like to
comment on that impression the first
thing I'd like to say is that we are
learning a lot about this virus and so
each week we understand more and more
and therefore are thinking about it and
also the projections that we are able to
make do change and in fact I think it's
it's one of those things where it's
science it's very common you know as we
make advances scientists to debate and
question each other and then that's how
knowledge advances but for the public I
think it's probably a new experience to
have all of this debate happening out in
the in the public domain but it's it's
very normal for science
now this virus the SARS Co v2 virus that
causes a week 19 belongs to a family of
corona viruses that we have known for a
long time and prior to this one there
are six other corona viruses that
actually infect humans bags and some
other animals actually have hundreds of
Corolla viruses that infect them that
don't do any harm and we think this also
came from the back but what we know now
about this virus is that firstly firstly
it's much more infectious than the two
other previous serious corona virus
infections we have seen the SARS in 2002
3 and then the MERS which was later
during this past decade now SARS was
completely contained and disappeared
actually because of the measures that
were taken and possibly because it was
much less infectious and transmissible
well
murrs continues to cause episodic
outbreaks
even though countries have learned how
to deal with it and keep it at a low
heaven this virus we've seen a spread
extremely quickly
it's spread around the world it's now
present in almost every country in the
world and of course it's caused major
outbreaks leading to a significant
amount of death and morbidity it appears
that this virus will stay with us
because of the of the the spread and the
transmission that has occurred over the
last few months and we're still watching
it we are watching the genetic mutations
we are watching it you see how it's
behaving and so far it's doing like any
other coronavirus it changes a little
bit like all RNA viruses too but the
good thing is it hasn't changed its
structure in those major domains at
which drugs and vaccines are going to be
targeted so I think to summer it's
likely that this virus will stay with us
for a long time it will have to be
managed in one way or another right now
we're using these public health measures
to contain in it and mitigate the damage
hopefully we will have a vaccine which
will definitely help building up
immunity and then just like humankind is
now living with many many viruses
perhaps this will become one more but a
manageable one
