[Music]
[Applause]
well good evening everybody thank you
for making us feel welcome this is a
wonderful occasion to have professor
Chomsky Noam Chomsky who of course you
all know something about a distinguished
colleague for MIT who is also a leading
scholar in linguistics and of course
probably there's no public intellectual
in the world whose has the stature of
Noam Chomsky and I feel very fortunate
to have been a student of his decades
ago he probably doesn't remember that we
used to take the tea from here to here
you and Jerry Fodor teach in the in the
60s and then I have known Bruno for much
less a period of time but a wonderful
colleague scholar diplomat science
fiction writer or science editor science
editor sort of yeah worked for many
years at osed got them interested in
neuroscience brain
study of language and culture and for
the last several years has been a
visiting teacher here both teaching
courses and also here in j-term and no
matter how late I go home at night and I
go home pretty late if I had a bet who's
gonna be sitting outside of Larson hall
chatting with students it'll be it'll be
it'll be Bruno and so it's great to have
both of them here we're trying to figure
out the origin of this evening and none
of us were successful in in doing it but
I think you all know that we're here the
catalyst for the for the evening is was
the publication I guess in Portuguese 45
years ago of a book that had a lot of
influence of pedagogy of the oppressed
by a man whose name I am not used to
pronouncing and I've taken lots of polls
and you'll hear it pronounced lots of
ways tonight but it's roughly speaking
Paulo Freire a thank you and I want to
start by asking the audience just to
describe yourselves how many people here
know the three choices will be no little
or nothing about Frary no enough so you
could write a paragraph you know the
first paragraph of Wikipedia and some of
whom how many of you are really quite
familiar with his writings with critical
theory so this is for you hey this is
not an introduction if the coming home
so how many of you know little or
nothing about him so that would be an
introduction you're the only ones I'm
not going to get called on by the way
grace
raise your hands higher though okay so
it's about 14% how many how many of you
could write a paragraph and okay so I'm
with most of you we know something but
not a lot and how many of you are really
quite familiar with his work in writings
so it's a it's a small number so I think
that's helpful for us to do so we tend
to go to around 7 and there'll be time
for questions from the audience and
we're very strict taskmaster when it
comes to questions so they can be a
little bit lot more longer than a tweet
but you might actually if you want to
ask a question you might want to write
it down because that helps you to be be
succinct we will begin by talking about
how Nome and Bruno first encountered
fairies writings whether they have some
personal contact with him
what they thought at the time how
they've seen his influence wax and wane
over the years and I will then introduce
Exhibit A which I only discovered when I
was boning up for this which is an
amazing two pages out of the very reader
about the Harvard Graduate School of
Education how many of you know that on
pages 4 and 5 of this book the ed school
gets excoriated
then we're moving to more general
discussions of educational trends about
which you know both of the both of the
people in the stage you know have
observed over the decades and where we
are at this point in educational
thinking and educational practice around
the world we may look a bit forward into
both a dystopian and a utopian way about
what might happen and these are things
of course that people who study a work
here talk and think about all the time
but we don't always have a chance to
hear from people with the concept as
that
Noam and Bruno have and we may talk a
bit about other things though we agreed
that we're not going to discuss 9/11 or
the most recent elections that's this is
for this is for this is for another day
two days is fairies day and education
and the reasons for the current trends
so are you guys okay with this okay so
no I'm you actually mentioned when you
first read the book can you talk a bit
about your first contact with furries
writings well it was actually here I
don't know whether is your is this
working
it may be sort of working but let me see
maybe if that's green okay okay but I
have to listen carefully it's just
doesn't like to be in my pocket he
actually was here at the time though I
didn't know it when the English edition
of his book came out which was 1972 I
read it I already knew about his work I
hadn't read the Portuguese edition but I
knew I was very much interested and
involved in fact in the background out
of which it grew remember the book came
the original book came out in 1968 and
rather interestingly by the time it came
out in English 72 the situation I
substantially changed over that four
year period 1968 as I'm sure you all
know was a pretty exciting year around
much of the world the United States as
well and in Latin America particularly
in Brazil even more particularly
actually Ferrari had already been exiled
from Brazil so in fact his book couldn't
appear there for years many years
dictatorship had repressed the
dictatorship incidentally was strongly
backed by the United States it was
apparently planned on the last the coup
in the last days in the Kennedy
administration took place right
afterwards that was it was a vicious
brutal dictatorship the first of a
series of kind of neo-nazi style
national security states that spread
through the hemisphere reached horrible
peak in the 1980s
massive atrocities in Central America
this was the first major one it was
called the greatest victory for freedom
in the 20th century by Lincoln Gordon
Kennedy Johnson ambassador of Brazil
they were college president and that was
typical of reaction it was very brutal
and one aspect of it was Ferraris exile
and there was more than that one of the
leading figures in both called
Liberation Theology it was progressive
part of the Catholic Church actually
it's called that but the term is kind of
strange I would have thought it should
be called the conservative part of the
Catholic Church it was dedicated to
bringing the Gospels back into
Christianity though they had been kicked
out of Christianity in the fourth
century when the Roman Empire Emperor
took over the church and made it the
religion of imperialism and oppression
first couple of centuries Catholic
Christians and Catholics in were
persecuted the cross which was the
symbol of the suffering of the poor that
was placed by the Emperor on the shield
of the Roman legions early fourth
century and stayed pretty much like that
great theologian and historian of
Christianity postpone describes the
shift in the fourth century as the shift
from the Church of the persecuted to the
Church of the persecutors and he himself
describes in his history of Christianity
Vatican 2 which took place in 1962
the background for the Ferraris work he
describes that as the moment when the
church returned from the Church of the
persecuted persecutors to the Church of
the persecutor it adopted drug his
persecuted the same word is oppressed
positively this name yeah yeah same as
oppressed it's and that's very he's
right in the middle of this and Brazil
was right in the center
the Brazilian bishops were the main
force pressuring for the radical shift
in the church that the place in 1962
under pope john xxiii and that initiated
what came to be called Liberation
Theology
which was dedicated to the Gospels
principle of preferential option for the
poor I had a lot of effects the biggest
effect effect was in 1968 when Ferrari
wrote was a bishops conference
conference of Latin American bishops
which formally adopted the fundamental
principles of liberation theology
preferential option for the poor the
leading one of the leading figures was
the Bishop of the fairies native city
Recife Dom helder Colorado Bishop of the
poor they were doing things similar to
and sometimes borrowing from the
pedagogy of the oppressed and develop
there were priests nuns lay people were
going into the villages
countryside organizing what we're called
base communities where people were
reading the Gospels not just reciting
them you know like you do one Sunday
morning without thinking about actually
reading them thinking about what they
said unless I said it's radical pacifist
and trying to establish this concept of
conscientious ization that frere
emphasizes raised consciousness
understand your own oppression recognize
that you don't have to be passive and
oppressed it's not all law of nature the
very similar things were happening here
I should say I say take the women's
movement which was just beginning to
take off at that time the one that began
exactly the same way with small
consciousness-raising groups group of
women talking to each other we're saying
refreshing domination is not a law of
nature let me ask you this is you can
say all of the above but I'm wondering
who you are in 67 68 it's the height of
the Vietnam War you also your work in
linguistics is becoming really well
known and it's the relationship to the
rest of cognitive science when you
picked up this book was it more because
of political interest more because of me
just ideas um did it have anything to do
with the fact there was education and
then if anything the fact that he
focused very much on language reading
and words and things like that do you
have a sense of what drew you to it and
what you took out of it things I've been
working on in the sixties a couple of
books came out was
17th and 18th century philosophy and a
lot of the ideas are kind of go wrong
from that I don't know if he was
conscious of it but if you take a look
at the Enlightenment conceptions of
Education there were basically two
competing conceptions they were
presented in imagery one of the images
was a thinking of education as pouring
water into a vessel that's what Ferry
calls the banking model what a lot of
you familiar with it's contemporary
schooling in the United States teaching
to test you know for water into the
vessel is every one of us knows who's
made it to college it's a very leaky
vessel
you can study for something for a test
and some of course you're not interested
in pass the test and a week later you
forgot what the course was about that's
our current educational system more and
more and has a purpose and talk about it
but and it sort of starts in the early
70s in the modern I say it's as part of
the reaction against the liberating
tendencies of of the 60s that say the
women's movement here was part of the
anti-war movement nefarious the work and
pedagogy of the oppressed met Ian
bishops conference which adopted the
preferential option for the poor all of
this is integrated and in fact even the
literacy for she was much influenced by
the highly successful literacy program
in Cuba in 1961 which had similar
conceptions
principal was the teachers that literacy
teachers should go out to teach but also
to learn that's it's very very and as
well it's flattening the that's go then
they should break down the relation of
kind of domination between teacher and
student where the teacher essentially is
pouring water into the rest so remind me
because later I want to ask both of you
why after at least three centuries
nationally internationally in at least a
century here of section are articulate
critique of this view wide remains so so
dominant but let's we're going to come
back to that later
let's ask Bruno now you you weren't
quite as much on the scene in the 60s as
some of the rest of us no tell us a bit
about you know what you what you were
doing when you were four when you first
encountered prairies work and what's
your what's your stance toward it what
did you what attracted you what did you
get out of it yeah thank you
in fact yes I was six years old when
this book was published so I could read
more interestingly enough the very first
time I heard the name of Frye rate was
after most of my education including at
university level
being a linguist and a sofa linguist
educator I had never heard his name
until I reached Mexico where I spent a
few years of my life and thoughts of
linguistics there and I had started to
develop a way of teaching which I
thought was well adapted for me and
hopefully good for the people in the
audience and one of them one of the
participants came after one class and
said you know what you've read too much
of friary and that was the very first
time in my life
I was like sorry but of course you know
I didn't want to appear as the guy who
obviously doesn't know anything about
someone who everyone is supposed to know
so I said oh no you know I haven't read
that much so I was attracted my
attention was attracted this way but I
didn't back then take the time to really
look for anything or etc I came across
friar in a second way a few years later
and exactly as gnome has said through my
interest for Liberation Theology I read
people like Leonardo buff and Gustavo
Gutierrez and of course don't let their
camera and some and I came across the
name again I thought well okay one one
of my students in Mexico told me that
I've read too much of friary and now I
find the name of this guy again in in
the books of these liberation
theologians what is that and then I read
this book for the first time so that
dude that took a while but interestingly
enough during all my years or maybe I
didn't pay attention maybe I was asleep
maybe it was not part of the test that I
had to learn Baja or whatever but I
don't remember having heard the name of
fry ring I heard probably 10 million
times the name of PHA but I never heard
the name of friary
and after a while I wondered why and I
think now I have some hypothesis on that
why is friary
not that well-known even if his work is
in in my view more relevant then than it
ever was it was of course relevant when
he wrote this at the end of the sixties
published sixty-eight but in the world
we live in today and I would say
especially in this country or in the
Western world
it is more relevant than ever well.tell
spell that out first
well the dagger G of the oppressed since
we have someone who has been busy with
linguistics with us I am tempted to just
you know take the title like this and
say well okay pedagogy why pedagogy and
not didactics after all he was more
involved in you know adult education etc
so it's not less worry about children
but off off not for this is crucial and
oppressed the oppressed why
what does friary in this book understand
under the expression the oppressed as
far as I see and I read it again of
course before coming here a couple of
times I had a lot of time to read in the
last month I read it and I thought well
ok he is writing at the end of the 60s
in the context that you reminded us of
Howard and is of course extremely
involved in Latin America Brazil to
begin with and then Chile when his in
exile fine so what he describes are
oppressed people in the sense of poor
people the preferential option for the
poor that no mentioned that was that's
an expression of Gustavo Gutierrez
actually published after this look but
taken by the bishops conference in in in
Medellin and even more in Puebla 1979
the poor which kind of poor are we
talking about and there's the definition
of the oppressed that friary gave forty
five years ago still match with the
definition of the oppressed today my
very short answer to this one to begin
with and we'll come back to this later
on is the same the following of course
it does
the structure is still exactly the same
only it has become even more efficient
in terms of oppression than it was
probably back then however what might
have changed and that's at the
superficial level is exactly who are the
oppressed fryer in this book doesn't
speak too much about the middle class I
know that you don't use it here in the
US the way we use it in Europe the
expression middle class but actually in
the in the context is writing in the
middle class is maybe not that relevant
for his purpose so he's talking about an
elite the oppressors and the wide
majority of people who have basically
nothing and that is the oppressed now if
you look at our Western societies today
almost everybody I see around me is
oppressed in a way or another but at the
same time we are also oppressors
we are oppressed by not only the
oppressors above us but by the invisible
hand that we all know that and because
of that we all must have no choice but
to oppress people who are around this or
or or whatever and I think that we can
read again powder fryers work today
in this sense without taking anything
from his fabulous vision he was a
visionary definitely a prophet in the
true sense of the word the one who
announces and denounces and etc my sense
is that it is very easy for the
neoliberals today who are dominant all
over the place as you know to say this
is old-fashioned this is superseded this
is overtaken we can forget all this this
is what's good for the 60s let's just
known react to this but as Bruno
speaking what are you thinking thinking
of what happened since the 60s and it
was already beginning in the sixties in
the early 60s if you go back to Vatican
2
it was heresy the idea that you should
pay attention to the Gospels is absolute
heresy
there's a nice literary exposition of it
and dusty s Keys Grand Inquisitor you're
familiar with that sort of captures it
almost exactly but the idea that you
probably know the story but that the
Gospels is just too revolutionary and
too radical if you really think about it
and when this became taken over by the
Latin American bishops in fact a lot of
it under their influence particularly in
Brazil there was an immediate reaction
to stamp it out a dual reaction part of
the reaction came from the Vatican that
was the soft side that was shutting
people up like putting him under a band
chief enforcer for this was a Ratzinger
him
Pope Benedict later that started under
right away oh man almost after john paul
23rd died and started big reactions shut
them up but just historically we do have
20 years of john paul between yes he's
23 there's one of the leading figures
and shutting him up yeah he's very much
respected because he was in favor as
opposed to communism in Eastern Europe
and so on but no but he didn't Latin
America is quite different that's long
so the irony is I mean I think he he
said was genuinely beloved there so you
might say in what area yes did not
that's a much more mixed there's some
interesting quote by in their camera
about that which I think captures the
order debate around the liberation
theology he said something like when
when I give something to eat to the poor
they call me a saint when I asked why
they are poor and why they have nothing
to eat they called me a communist and I
think a their camera with that captured
or and he himself was silenced in 1970
right this is
in this interim period between the
Portuguese and the English edition
so that was the soft side the harsh side
was coming from us the United States
went to war against the church for a
brutal violent war against the church
ever since the early sixties the
Brazilian coup which we backed and
supported was first major step and it
went right on through the murder of the
archbishop and El Salvador the
Archbishop Romero who was called the
voice for the voiceless he was actually
a conservative archbishop who was
appalled by what was happening to his
priests they were getting murdered
because they were trying to do things
like pursue the pedagogy they oppressed
the liberation of the poor and that he
himself changes a very honorable person
fascinated the kind of ended not totally
but came to a symbolic end if you like
right at the time of the fall of the
Berlin Wall when an elite Albert
Salvadoran battalion trained and armed
by the United States which already had
killed nobody knows how many thousands
or tens of thousands of the usual
victims and peasants working people
human rights activists priests and
others were as they had just come back
from renewed training updating upgrading
their skills at the John F Kennedy
School of counterinsurgency in North
Carolina they came back to El Salvador
and under the xsplit direct orders of
the High Command they were ordered to
enter the university to murder six
leading Jesuit intellectuals of Latin
America
priest and also anyone else who was
there so there'd be no witnesses so they
murdered their housekeeper and her
daughter this is under the direct orders
of the High Command close connections
the American Embassy I doubt if there's
anybody who here who even mentioned
their name if you mentioned dissidents
in Eastern Europe everybody can mention
their names they were treated badly but
nothing like what happened in Latin
America during the same years and but
there are victims so therefore we don't
know about but through this period that
was as I said a really vicious war
against the church and the heresy was
pretty much stamped out not totally you
know residues remain still alive but
suffered a severe attack and that's what
comes to mind when I talk about this and
the same things happened with the
educational system my opinion at least
be there's a kind of imposition of
rigidity and conformism the banking
model fill the vessel model it's the
banking model actually has it won the
banking model has a double meaning now
since we're living in you know it's a
highly bang of fairies sense you know
pour water into that's since the night
it starts around the time of the same
repression of Latin America let's come
back to that in in a couple minutes but
I want to I don't want to leave Ferries
pedagogy unexplored so I want to ask you
a question but it's also for the
audience how many of you actually spent
real time either watching the work that
he did with adults peasants in Latin
America or analogous work in North
America or are we talking about
something like you know John Dewey
school which was only open for a few
years had a lot of influence but not
because there were many
had actually been there and seen there
but I'm asking about Freddie no not you
it's yeah but did either of you actually
ever see you know the kind of very equal
drawing out giving agency to the the
impoverished that he writes about or is
it something you just know from his
anyone who spent any time in poor areas
in Latin America and in fact other parts
of the world
no Caesar I see the things like this
happening but I'm this is this is not a
tribunal but I'm actually interested
whether you actually saw the freight
methods at work yourself yeah yeah I did
to some extent especially in Latin
America because as I said before in the
yeah North America and in Europe the
name friar ray is hardly known except by
experts and not even by experts maybe
from time to time but in Latin America
there are institutions which are
generally not mainstream by the way or
they cannot be mainstream which are
linked to the church or to this
particular movement within the church
liberation theology or coming from a
more Marxist kind of framework which is
you know dedicated to what is called
education popular and in some
institutions I have seen including at
university level people take this very
seriously and my sense is that
consciously enough they are extremely
influenced by by friary I say
consciously or not because again you
know sometimes you just it's always the
same thing what I when this student told
me you know that I had read too much of
Frary
and I said sorry I don't even know the
name of that guy I'm not suggesting that
I had reinvented everything myself of
course not
I had certainly been influenced
through all the channels unconsciously
by people who themselves have been
friends by by Ferrari and etc this is
always the problem how are you sure that
one idea of yours is original you can
never be completely sure now that the
point is that it's our Howard but in in
some universities and I remember that
very well in Mexico particularly I've
seen that in in Peru as well and in some
of the countries in the character that
that's quite obvious Ernesto Cardenal
you you may have met with him was a
Jesuit to us right exactly he became
Minister for education and then he was
sort of sacked by by the you know that
right exactly and in a very humiliating
way on top of that now the the fact of
the matter is that there are people
especially in Latin America who really
believe in the virtue of this same
pedagogy of the oppressed and try to
implement it but they face a lot of
resistance and inertia from above if I
may say so that's quite obvious but also
from the people they are addressing it's
feel freedom it's anything you want
you know friary describe that very well
that it is not that easy to go and tell
people think by yourself thinking for
yourself it is very dangerous and most
people would resist it device I can add
something to that remember the prayer it
was not just teaching literacy in fact
if you look at his pedagogy of the
oppressed its consciousness-raising
that's the point literacy is an
instrument for it and consciousness
consciousness-raising leads to should he
think sense that straight out leads a
radical and revolutionary change a
change in the institutions when people
understand actually this you know this
goes back to the history and I've seen
it all over the place not just in poor
communities and so that Colombia Latin
America but elsewhere in the world so
take India I don't know
I mean if you know anything about India
but there's one poor relatively poor
state in India Kerala which has an
extremely high level of literacy and
also specifically have been education
generally and incidentally of women's
education and that's the reason why
fertility goes straight down it's been a
consequence of women's education that
you get and so women have control of
what they can do that literacy that
fertility that goes way down that's not
it's a very poor place now if you're
visiting it you see it it's the one part
of India where you can kind of drive
around and see people sitting at a bar
or something sitting outside reading
newspapers and talking to each other and
so on I was the other place I saw it
hidden he's in West Bengal and the what
the KO punch I got the cooperative
villages which sprang up in the course
of a revolution it was a you know they
killed the landlord's brother Mao took
over the region and we could talk about
it but it's pretty amazing when you see
it and what you see is look at one of
them when I went in with a friend an
agricultural economist that happened to
be a village council meeting going on
these are very poor villages you know
and there was a an office and Indian
government officer in the background
years before he would have been running
the meeting telling everyone what to do
this time he was kind of in the
background occasionally they'd turned
him and asked for some information or
something but the village council was
local people talking pretty very
informed eloquent ways one of them was
actually a tribal woman yeah that's
about the lowest of the low and the
Indian awful caste system but she was
one of the council members talked others
people you know her opinion and so on
this is all the result of years of
conscientious ization in favor sense not
just literacy but learning who you are
what your rights are why you can
overcome oppression taking control of
your lives and that's what the heresy
wasn't Latin America the you know people
going to priests others going into the
poor areas and trying to bring this
about
sometimes borrowing for his methods and
remember that is much broader because
Cuba done something like it a couple
years earlier which he knew very well
talked about but and that's why they had
to be crushed
that's what again if you read the Grand
Inquisitor it says it very precisely
yeah I won this case the United States
was the Grand Inquisitor at the risk of
being a little bit pedantic I want to
draw out something which was stated by
Bruno and that is thinkers can have a
lot of influence on what we think and do
and if we don't know about them and I
think that probably there are you know
people here who knew nothing about forum
but whose ideas came to some extent
because of the diffusion also it was in
reading about him that I realized that
he was also the part of a wide-ranging
intellectual tradition as well as you
know somebody who not entirely through
his own desire was in Chile and wasn't
and here in Cambridge and so on and that
is he was very much influenced by the
French existentialists and the notion of
consciousness Sartain who sorrow and
that that phenomenology that's cool but
also i'm interestingly by people who
were looking at psychoanalytic ideas
like erich fromm and herbert mark mark
who's a-- and so here's a guy who on the
one hand is writing very practically
about what you should be doing if you
want to raise consciousness
and get people to have a sense of agency
but he's also involved in a web of
middle 20th century intellectual
influences whether they go back to the
17th 18th century probably at least him
implicitly they do I want to ask though
if there's anybody in the audience who
actually has an anecdote based on his
his or her own observation of her aryan
ideas even better if you if they were
explicitly called that because the india
probably people didn't know that
terminology and who knows where and
spontaneously from the situation in the
circumstance
okay okay well and we take this
gentleman here in the seventies in a
private university and i say half of my
university became very leftist because
of freres ideas and fray was really
truly very influential and actually the
term momentum was born it was used at
the time all these leftist friends of
mine and their ideas that were very
conscientious as soon today are very
wealthy people doing very well that was
a private university like this
University here University Ellison is
very expensive and the term emeritus is
those who love to be this way but end up
being this other way and and the the
sadness is is that one thing was the the
dream
although the desired thing to change
change things and you'd never happened
thank you I think that that's something
we're going to come back to at the end
when we talk about utopia and dystopia
and we've all been around long enough to
have been swung in different directions
is there anybody else one other person
yep please just this is not a setup
hi my name is Kadena and in Mexico and
my experience in Chiapas spending time
ins up Avista communities the school
system there the autonomous school
system is set up based on the principles
of Ferrari whether or not it's explicit
or otherwise the school does run under
consciousness-raising framework where
students are taught about what it means
to be themselves whether they be troll
or below the ball or whatever ethnicity
as well as citizenry within the Mexican
nation state and how neoliberalism works
in their lives and in their communities
so that I've seen that in action in
small very small communities in Chiapas
Mexico thank you
so as I was doing my homework I have to
admit that I was shocked when I picked
up the Paulo Freire a reader and
discovered that as early as page four of
the introduction the whipping boy was
the Harvard Graduate School of Education
and so I want to read a few quotations
no one was here at the time so and his
wife was teaching so they may have some
context and it's possible somebody else
in the audience as well so begins by
describing a professor who's not named
commenting on a graduate students paper
and the comment is critical especially
mentioning quote/unquote Freret and zero
zero is probably the leading student of
the student acolyte would be a better
word how else can one explain a culture
that pontificates about intellectual
rigor and yet allows a graduate course
titled politics of literacy to be taught
without any reference to frere
continuing in fact if one applies to
rigorous standards of the Academy we
suck we soon realized that most of the
professor's at HGSE that's what's the
words here are not among the most cited
educators in the United States the work
has done little to advance theoretical
debate they have contributed few
earth-shaking ideas that might help to
raise schools it's no wonder that after
a
lecture was given about Paulo Freire at
the School of Education yes this is
bruno here I don't want to sound naive
but who is this Paulo Freire the
professor is signing a lot and then this
is where it gets it gets angry
how can one expect this doctoral student
to know of the work of the most
significant educator in the world during
the last half century when the Harvard
Graduate School of Education sanctions a
graduate course called literacy politics
and policy without requiring students to
read critique and analyze the worker
fair and then I had to chuckle at this
last comment here what connects wouldn't
can expect from a culture in which a
professor responded to freres death
which was 1997 in the following manner
Farrah's coming to Harvard would have
made twenty students very happy while
making the rest of the students
extremely unhappy then person does say
now he's dead and we're all unhappy but
that may be a personal statement so can
you help us understand why this reader
begins with this is Harvard and metonym
here or do you know whether there were
things that were going on hmm well I
don't know but he doesn't blow for
education it's the entire so it's
metonymic said entire university is like
that I mean there are things as a
student you just don't learn and aren't
taught so take today for example May 1st
I mean this morning one of the first
coincidence well the first emails I got
this morning was from a friend and
Brazil and she wrote me that she's gonna
it's not going to go to work today it's
a holiday now what are they celebrating
there it's a day of coming I don't know
how many do you know this but it's Dave
commemorative it's a Dave's
supporting the struggle of American
workers for an eight-hour day that's
made a everywhere in the world except
the United States that's it you can UK
sorry but there's a day memory in the
whole world practically as supporting
highly oppressed American workers some
of the most oppressed in the industrial
world in 1886 modern and in the United
States nobody ever heard of it in fact
Ronald Reagan won the most extreme a
teen labor presidents turned it into law
day a day of celebrating our dedication
to law actually we have a Labor Day but
think when it is our Labor Day is when
people go back to work that's Labor Day
not the day in which they struggle for
their rights you know for an eight-hour
day well just pick that because it
happens to be today but the number of
things we don't learn is amazing like
for example how many of you learned
about the US war against the church and
in the through the 60s from the 60s to
thee through the eighties nobody learns
them how many of you heard of the names
of the murdered Jesuits actually I give
you an illustration of what on the 25th
anniversary of Archbishop Romero death
there was actually a commemoration in
Boston but it wasn't in Harvard swear it
was in Jamaica Plain in a poor Church
for immigrant Church yes there they had
a commemoration of Ramirez death one of
the speaker's was a woman area
was a had been assaulted or judge your
husband was also human rights activist
murdered by us trained forces and also
other who are carrying out huge
massacres but it's in Jamaica Plain on
the 30th anniversary of the
assassination of the Jesuits which is a
pretty serious event I mean if that had
happened in Czechoslovakia we probably
had a nuclear war you know but here 30th
anniversary there was a commemoration it
was in Boston College Jesuit college and
was quite well done the president is
pretty conservative was there that one
of the speaker's was father Yan Sabri no
he's the one surviving Jesuit from the
University he didn't happen to be there
when the assassination okay
so he spoke I gave a very moving speech
he says look we shouldn't be mourning
the Jesuit intellectuals who were killed
but rather their housekeeper and
daughter they're the ones we should be
focusing on the ones were killed so
there wouldn't be any witnesses because
they represent the people of El Salvador
the real victims not just the famous
intellectuals anybody know anything
about this you know these are things
that ought to be taught in grade school
and you can go on and on and the reason
why that fairy was unknown is because he
was not just talking about literacy if
he'd been saying here's a nice method
for teaching literacy to adults that
would have been fine but it went way
beyond that
it was literacy as a means for
consciousness raising for raising
questions about your position among the
oppressed and why you should accept that
and why you shouldn't what the society
is like in house is how it should be
changed by us standards he was a radical
revolutionary of course he's not known
let me ask and this is only if somebody
actually has anything any additional
comments because they were around at
this time there would be a chance to
speak up I may be around but I have to
admit I was wanting people who knew
Piaget and I not ferret though I was
aware of him but no different than I was
aware of Montessori or of Steiner these
were names and you picked up things but
certainly I was aware of other
intellectual traditions to having
dealing with Latin America Catholicism
radicalism I don't think there was any
conspiracy not to teach him here but I
think it's interesting that Machado does
use it metonymically but is there
anybody here who could provide any
additional context and this so should we
put it aside okay we'll give take quit
you don't look like you could have been
there but we'll we'll assume that you're
a historian it was interesting for me
when I came to the Graduate School of
Education that I saw an absence of
absolute absence of Ferraris name
anywhere and for all of the courses that
I took I didn't ever read frere and I
did in math bachelors at masters in
elementary education in there and the
book entire book was prescribed so I'd
read for array through six years of my
education in India when when I came to
the earth school here there was no
thought of there was no thought around
Ferrara's work and I also thought that I
don't think it's it's it's a random sort
of incident I also feel that it's part
of the larger larger weight which
curriculum is framed in this university
where there's no space for marxist
thought itself in the department of
economics there is maybe one professor
which teaches a course in Marxism in at
the at school when we talk about the
politics of Education we often we don't
ever discuss what does it mean - what
would Scotty's notion of Education what
was fair assumption of
what was you know some of these other
thinkers which think differently than
this larger new liberal regime of
standardized education thought about
education I just absolutely see an
absence of that debate in discourse in
America so I see this as a consequence
of sort of that framework rather than a
random incidence that's a very very
valuable contribution and I think we all
should feel a little bit bad that if you
that in India this was not this was not
a foreign in eight infecting agent I
mean I I'm not going to give a an
exposition on this school but I think
that we could do well to be much more
alert to intellectual currents including
ones that might make us uncomfortable
you know just just one you teach here
after all nobody tells you what to teach
sure I have to think about that that I
will actually just when you when you
read this this page Howard I was
wondering something in the same
direction
what would friary all the people who
have edited this book his widow and then
I don't say though say today about
huggsy not how it was 40 years ago I
mean it that I wasn't there you may know
but but what would they say today is the
banking system of Education alive even
in this very institution and if yes how
and is this really can can we learn
something from Friday and I'm on not
only talking about XE obviously but
about our universities in general and
how we train and well teachers and
people who are going to be responsible
for the future of mankind because this
is it actually now regarding that in the
in this country as far as I understand
the word communist is one of the worst
possible inserts you can imagine now if
if you have someone who quotes honor on
a regular basis in a small book like
that Karl Marx and Mao Zedong and habit
makuu's and Georg lukacs not George
Lucas at jo-ann Frantz Fanon and people
like that and even Che Guevara and it's
alone per se even if you just look at
the references it is probably enough for
quite a lot of people in our societies
to just discard it and say this is
dangerous stuff you know but well I'm
gonna interrupt here for a second
because I think the notion would not be
that it's dangerous the notion would be
that it's irrelevant
okay that's equally damning but it's a
very different that precisely I wanted
to come to that because there is
something in my view I said well Frary
we refers directly to Che Guevara and to
Gustavo Gutierrez who by the way were
born in the same year
19:28 which was a very good year for
poor thinkers I noticed that I noticed
that you were just exactly as janitor so
all the stars all the stars
exact exactly so fortunately we still
have no men Gustav with us now the point
is is this and that's exactly what
you're pointing at how it is not about
you know oh we don't want to hear about
that because it's dangerous you know
it's marks for its Darwin or whatever
you want to dimerize in a way or another
in in this country or in other Western
countries it is something like a very
sharp discourse that has developed in my
to my knowledge Auto for what I've seen
dramatically over the last 10 years is
to dismiss ideas like that as irrelevant
old-fashioned superseded over they you
you name it most of you are some of you
at least know where I come from and in
which institution I was working a talk a
bit about that cuz well yes what I
wanted a segue in and then we'll open it
up precisely and I spent I'm I'm almost
embarrassed to confess it right now but
I spent 14 years of my life at the OECD
in the Directorate for education explain
what OCD is highest organization for
economic not education Economic
Cooperation and Development among other
things the Directorate for education has
produced a few flagships that are
extremely well known such as Pisa for
instance and stuff like that well Pisa
is certainly a very interesting study
however some of us minority a small
minority had a critical stance from the
beginning and say well look Pisa is
interesting is certainly one of the most
powerful comparative tool that has been
developed so far in terms of you know
we're comparing performances of 15 year
olds here and there however its
statistics for God's sake and it's only
statistics you have statistics as with
you what does it tell you nothing you
remain at the surface of the whole thing
and then the discussion started but it
was crushed very quickly say oh you guys
are old-fashioned you you you are like
you know 68 errs or it's a look at your
hair you completely superseded no you
know exactly that sort of things and
then I said well look I wonder actually
if it's not too easy to say to take for
instance in a book like that or in what
we've done examples that are actually
yes maybe a bit out of date to
completely dismiss very powerful ideas
that go back well beyond 68 to the
Gospels or to other writing of wisdom
that we have in in all great
philosophical systems just one thing
quanta Freni a-- you know this tendency
of quanta frenita quanta friend you
heard it first here yeah right no no but
although some some some here familiar
with that I'm sure yeah it's this this
tendency of the Social Sciences to want
to put everything in numbers in order to
look serious like like the Natural
Sciences but in fact it is in the first
place to look serious but at the very
end of the day it is much worse than
that it is a way to not go deeper into
the explanation again it is one thing to
say so many people are living under this
you know standard of poverty once you
have said that you're still not asking
why are these people living under this
standard and when you say for instance
in this country or in that country in
stories like in in studies like Pisa
for instance so many children succeed so
many children do not succeed and etc
fine now let's talk why is that we can
go further we can go deeper Pizza
provides the tools for that but as soon
as you start to discuss it and say well
look at the social economic and social
cultural background
these kids who are failing at school
then you are called a communist or
something like that and this is very
related to this you know you mentioned
suckling Beauvoir and and so forth and
these guys were highly respected in
Europe especially in France you know
it's not every day that in France we
have great thinkers so we had we had the
captain in Beauvoir and and well and now
we have well now you know anyway but but
these people were highly respected in
the 60s I'm not sure that friary came
directly in contact with South but
through Franz fanon he certainly did
today these people are dismissed has
totally out of date I think just without
passing any judgment on I think at the
fall of communism as symbolized by the
wall falling gave many people license we
won't even evaluate it to dismiss pre
389 discourse I want to ask you know a
question which may make him even more
philosophical than he usually is
but you only mentioned something very
interesting that we were talking about
when you're sick what do you do and the
answer is you read and you mentioned
that you had read Hegel because you had
to go to the hospital and what else he
gonna do and how you said if he weren't
gonna read anal now you've never been
read him so I was there I was there in
the late 60s but not at all
Central than the way you were than you
were but looking at the last 40 years
could you have anticipated what we call
among ourselves the neoliberal trend and
to what extent isn't Hegelian in a sense
of synthesis of you know thesis and so
on or are there more accidental things
that you know
you know well I should say that Nixon
hadn't hung a Reagan hadn't come with
Thatcher I think it was already the case
it was already beginning tell us yeah
first of all I read Hegel because I
thought was quite funny I thought it's
some of the craziest I could I've
actually written about a little some of
those totally outlandish but but in the
but yeah but I'm talking about the
pendulum whatever yeah well by the late
for the early 70s there was already a
very striking backlash very visible
quite public against the liberating
democratizing tendencies of the 1960s
right here at Harvard in fact it was
very clear so for example one famous
Harvard professor Samuel Huntington a
professor of science of Government at
Harvard he was the author of he was the
rap word the American Repertory shove
the was called the trilateral commission
it's called the crisis of democracy you
should read it if you haven't yes very
interesting I think it's about came out
about 74 or 75 this the Trilateral
Commission represents the liberal fringe
of American politics so it's basically
the Carter Administration fact the
Carter Administration came off
completely from their ranks it's not the
right way what's the crisis of democracy
is mostly Huntington but also
representatives from France and Japan
who basically said the same things
crisis of democracy was that in the 60s
there was too much democracy and that
puts all sorts of groups that are
usually passive and acquiescent
and what are some that's called special
interests began to enter the political
arena to press for their own demands
their consciousness was
women young people old people working
people farmers all special interests
population in other words their special
interests and they were trying to enter
the political arena press for their
demands it's interesting that in this
entire discussion one group is not
mentioned the corporate sector the
business world and there's a reason for
that they're not a special interest
they're the national interest
that's tacitly understood goal but it's
sort of you made to understand that
that's part of being oppressed so
they're not mentioned but the special
interests have to be subdued we have to
have what Huntington called more
moderation and democracy they have to go
back to passivity and acquiescence and
they didn't miss the schools he talked
about what he what they caught what he
called the institutions responsible for
the indoctrination of the young okay
that's where you are responsible for the
indoctrination of the young the schools
the universities the churches and the
point was they're not doing their job
they're not indoctrinating the young
properly and you can see it by all these
you know women asking for rights of
people demonstrating against the war
these people are supposed to be
indoctrinated they're supposed to be
passive obedient acquiescence then I'm
supposed to have their consciousness
raised that's the early 70s incidentally
that's the liberal aspect of it at the
very same time I won't go into it you
but I urge you to read a very famous
memorandum called the Powell memorandum
it was that Powell who later became a
Supreme Court justice under Nixon he was
a it was actually a lobbyist for the
tobacco industry but a very influential
right-wing figure he wrote a memorandum
which was supposedly confidential
supposed to be confidential was
the American Chamber of Commerce main
business group that leaked people could
read it if they want it's worth reading
that's a harsh end what he says
basically is look the business classes
in the United States of the most
oppressed group in the country everybody
else is getting everything and we're
getting nothing
the radicals like Herbert Marcuse oh and
you know Ralph Nader and others are just
destroying the whole society there
they've got to be and the universities
are totally out of hand you know they're
all Marx crazies running around and we
the business classes of utterly
oppressed but then he says look we have
the money
we control the legislators we had
control the trustees we don't know we're
the owners of the media but we don't
have to let these radicals take over
everything and you have to read it to
see the rhetoric that's what it's like
so therefore we should use our power as
our control of wealth to beat back this
attack on the essentials of civilization
you know which is going on that's the
right-wing variants of Samuel Huntington
and the Trilateral Commission liberal
variant but both agree you've got these
institutions responsible with the
indoctrination of the young has to meet
the responsibilities and we have to
change them so they do that so when you
that's the early so let me become
Hegelian hold on hold on one second let
me say that for those of you who know
the history of American education
nothing new about this it goes back to
the origins of the mass education system
that was a great contribution of the
United States mass public education but
it had some qualifications a large part
of it was a effort to turn independent
farmers into obediently passed
factory workers and you had to educate
them for that and it was recognized so
Ralph Waldo Emerson for example pointed
out that he said he hears lots of
influential people calling for the mass
education and when he asks them why it's
be explained that look there are
millions of people getting the right to
vote and we have to educate them to keep
them from our throats because if they're
not properly it indoctrinated they don't
understand what's going on in the world
and they'll go after our throats and
here I would slightly disagree with a
distinction between dangerous and
irrelevant I think the same thing these
things are irrelevant because they're
dangerous if people think about them
they're going to go after the throats
you know symbolically of those with
power they'll ask for their rights too
and that's just much too dangerous
so and there's a current that you know
runs through it's related to the fact
that nobody knows what May Day is in the
United States is the snake forever world
all of this is part of the of a system
of indoctrination which in various terms
is it provides the culture of submission
in fact what he called the culture of
the freedom from fear except it over
from from from you know escape from
freedom and people have to and the idea
of the concept of consciousness-raising
programs of which the literacy program
was a part was to overcome this on the
part of people well we start getting the
reaction in the early 70s
and it goes on and it takes various
forms and it now reaches forms that have
names like No Child Left Behind or race
to the top which means every Child Left
Behind and race at the bottom that's and
anybody who's a teacher
I do want to open it up to the audience
but I'm going to be insistent on knowing
whether you think the 60s were an
anomalous blip you don't know the 30s
were similar the 1989-90 the 1890s
wasn't looking in the latter part of the
19th century
if anybody studies that the most
powerful and impressive radical
Democratic movements in the United
States took shape and were extremely
strong the farmers alliance insanely
which began in Texas this is not today
farmers Alliance was identified
throughout the country remember was an
agricultural country then so huge
organization you take a look at its
goals and actions they were pretty
radical they wanted to get rid of the
eastern bankers who were strangling them
they wanted to be able to control to
have cooperative marketing cooperative
banks run things by themselves massive
movement they tried to unite with the
Knights of Labor which is a huge labor
movement also calling for you know
workers ownership of the factories in
which they worked and all sorts of ideas
which now are considered outlandish ok
they were crushed by force but it was a
huge movement this is a deep I'm gonna
give both these guys a chance for a last
word as we get towards 7:00 so you can
be thinking about that I want to open it
up but I think the answer to your
question is you know you won't like this
you are shlessinger Ashlee's an Arian
and you think it's going to be about now
that we're going to have a swing of the
pendulum again I think it's constant
there's a constant battle going on it's
cool to know it's collective it's called
class struggle there's a constant battle
going on between poor and oppressed
people who are seeking their rights and
it can be pretty wealthy people like say
with middle class women
but are oppressed and seeking their
rights and those who want to keep them
in their place and just to remind you
what Marx did was to turn Hegel on his
head but then you have to go read it so
let's open it up and we'd like people to
just come up to the two mics and the
rules are pieces synced and a question
should have to do with what we talked
about if you want to know about the
status status of traces and linguistic
theory that's for another day sense
it strikes me that when he talks about
reading the word and reading the world
is very important to our context as well
what I'm wondering is why don't we have
a dedicated curriculum either in K
through 12 or at the university level
for critical literacy so often we focus
on content mastery wants something for
another but rarely in either K through
12 or a college do we actually have a
course dedicated on critical or Cisco
ensue something that would be an
important practice to the learning
process so I'm going to professor
Chomsky or anyone else we care to
comment on the need to introduce a per
area niall of critical literacy to our
context I think they will do is let's
take three or four questions I'll jot
down the key words and then we'll let
them riff please I noticed a lot of
people more people on that side of the
room I'm Tory theis and Homer I'm a
doctoral student here at the ed school
and before this I was trained at UCLA's
teacher education program where fair was
an integral part of our education so I
wondered if you had insight as to why
the Harvard Graduate School of Education
doesn't really teach fara and if it is
fear
please it's a pleasure to
yeah actually pleasure to be here and
thank you so much for having us all my
question goes related to Friday you know
he believed in the oppressed taking
charge of their education right and
making it their own example of
redemption rather than somebody
influencing them and under that context
we're seeing high in Latin America for
example in Ecuador they're building
cities of knowledge in Quito jochai
right cities of knowledge where they're
trying to empower the people to take
advantage of with resources and they're
trying to bring hundreds of PhDs from
all over the world to create like the
MIT you know of Latin America and things
like that and I find that amazing
because it hasn't happened you know yet
professor Chomsky what's your prediction
of the impact of schools like this in
100 years 200 years in that in America
where we're seeing some sort of
consciousness and awareness regardless
of your political beliefs in in this
part of the world I didn't quite get
that question I did you know what is
your what is your prediction of the
impact that this cities of knowledge
being built in cities of knowledge every
every developing country to be the next
senator why don't we take one more
question
Emilio we'll get to you later if there's
time okay my name is Heather Pritchard
and I'm a student here at the Graduate
School of Education I recently recently
read a book in which Donato Macedo was
interviewing free air and frere said
Donato
don't let them as in them in the US
import my ideas they are not made for
export please make sure they reinvent
them considering the idea that we here
in America may be oppressed and
oppressors at the same time what advice
would you offer to us here in this room
on how to practically reinvent Ferries
pedagogy of the oppressed nice question
thank you let me remind you guys of the
four questions then you can each make
some comments number one should we be
doing critical literacy
kay 212 number two why is there no fair
at JSC and I'm going to actually take
that one and if my answer I think will
surprise you
cities of knowledge there's that's a
buzzword what do we predict is going to
happen they're there and then finally
this very interesting quote which you
get from many great thinkers is they say
don't transport this stuff reinvent it
I've been paraphrasing Bruner Wang Shu
well yeah and try to be very short then
address it each and every question yeah
well another book written by and
published by Friday just after this one
is called education for critical
consciousness and I think it's an
extremely powerful work as well now to
answer your question or no not to answer
but my answer to your question would be
something like how do you run a country
you have more than say 60 or 70 percent
of the people actually able to
critically think it is it is a very sad
way of putting things everywhere I I
went so far and especially meeting with
the people in ministries and its central
policymakers and everybody says yeah we
want to raise you know the level of
education for everyone etcetera but in
fact it is not exactly true there is a
sort of tension here between two
different aspirations one is in order to
be competitive at economic level we need
to raise educational standards but at
the same time we don't want to raise
them too much otherwise it starts to be
dangerous for the power of those FRA
rico's the oppressors so my sense is
that there is a lot of Halloween
contagion there we want to raise
critical consciousness but at the same
time we make sure that it doesn't that
it's only effects and elite otherwise it
starts to be an
that it's one thing at the same time
friary
addresses a lot what he calls the
dichotomy student teacher and he is
dreaming of having you know students
teachers and teacher students I think
it's George I've said whoever ceases to
be a student has never been a student
and in fact well I know that many of us
try to do that when we teach because
actually we teach in order to learn and
etc and and our students know so many
things that we don't know and personally
I believe in the collective construction
of knowledge it is not very easy to
achieve but at least in a place like
that I think it is possibly probably
easier than in many other places and the
dichotomy student-teacher that phrase is
describing as something you know
negative and that's part of the banking
system and the top-down kind of
hierarchical relationship and etc that
has to be revisited overcome is not
suppressed is probably something that is
very important here collective
intelligence may be another form of
intelligence to be added to Howard's
multiple intelligences the ultimate
intelligence is something I cannot
believe that many brains are less
performer or unless can you say yeah
performing or less well performing than
just one and I think Friday in this
sense it's not political not really not
primarily political but I think it's
extremely powerful and he again as far
as critical consciousness is concerned
one thing that his stress is very much
and people who know me here in the room
know that it's one of my then indicate a
girl kind of say he opposes the doctor
to the lovers just a split I did I'd say
you are quoting the doctor you have this
beautiful expression in English which is
thinking out of the box identify the box
with the doctor in order to think out of
the box the very first thing that you
have to do is to identify the box know
that there is one see what it is see
what kind of function it performs
what what what purpose does it serve and
finally be sort of revolting against
this and say I want to be able to think
out of the box that is imposed on me by
the oppressors within invisible hand or
whatever and I think this is in my view
the one of the very still very powerful
messages by Friday he opposes doxa and
logos logos as you know as so many
translations but then we go back to the
Gospels as you said John 1:1 in the
beginning was the word the logos there
we are this is what we educators are all
about I think a poem as well as yes some
good all right there
I should just picking out button what
Bruner said there are functioning
examples of what you describe in fact I
happen to be have been in one for almost
60 years and any advanced school of
science is pretty much like that effect
the sciences would die if there wasn't
constant challenge and questioning
students in a you know a place like MIT
are not supposed to copy down what they
hear and repeat it an exam they're
supposed to say you're wrong you know I
got a better idea and if you're standing
up in the front of the room you learn
from that in fact that's the way it
works when you walk down the hall you do
see what would you commonly see is
students working together you know a
group trying to figure something out
contributing a large part of Education
I'm sure you all know this is just a
peer interaction my son actually went to
Harvard just sail through
funny told me that the most he learned
more from talking to his fellow students
then he learned from in class the
classes were okay but he just got a lot
out of the interchange and interaction
with them and I think that's that's so
for example one you know standard line a
place like MIT actually was comes from a
faint world famous physicists do you
probably know Vicki high school no great
physicist was famous because he taught
freshman courses like senior faculty do
and he had this he told he said that
when he was asked in the class by the at
the opening sessions what are we going
to cover this semester his answer was it
doesn't matter what we did would cover
it matters what you discover in your own
ways and that's education and that
incidentally goes right back to the
Enlightenment I mentioned earlier that
they were kind of to counter posed
models one was what Frary calls the
banking model you know fill the vessel
with water that's when it was condemned
another image that was used actually by
the founder of the modern university
system Phil Humboldt was that education
ought to be like laying out a string
along which the learner proceeds in his
or her own way and learns to inquire and
create and maybe push the string around
and so in other words this kind of stuff
structure there's a it's not just do any
random thing you want
yeah throw it at the wall there's a
structure but you're supposed to explore
it question it modify it and basically
learn how to create and discover and
you're wrong actually it's not
impossible I had mentioned for a moment
ago that Howard that I was at at having
to be in a dewy-eyed school when I was a
kid the temple university back 1930s
you know prehistoric times was a had it
had a very the education department had
a very strong Dewey eight element in it
and they ran an experimental school and
my parents sent it to me I was there
from about age 2 up until age 12 and it
was a fantastic experience I mean that
it was pretty much along these lines
there were tests but they were only to
let you know where you stand you know
something that you oughta know that you
don't know or maybe let the teacher know
I'm doing something wrong because things
aren't working but nobody there was no
evaluation of students and it wasn't
pretty necessarily in the world there
were students from families like my own
who just were very interested in
education but there were other kids who
were behavior problems in the in the
public schools they couldn't handle them
so they sent him here that was quite a
mixture but there was no evaluation I
literally didn't know I was a good
student until I went through an academic
high school afterwards very horrible
experience academic high school but
until then you know it's just a kid in
the class I mean I knew I had skipped a
grade but all that that meant to anybody
was I was the smallest kid in the class
nothing nothing else mattered when my
own kids went to school to what's called
a good public school Lexington public
schools and by the time they were in
third grade they were already ranking
the students he's dumb he's
you know listen that there was nothing
like that
and there was a lot of cooperative work
individual work followed your own
individual interests if you wanted to
teachers would not help you with
resources and things but encourage that
but also encourage and organize a lot of
cooperative work so I'm convinced that
can be done without our having asked for
it I think Noam Chomsky has actually
shared with us his educational
philosophy which I have heard about over
the years I think very very beautifully
I should mention that MIT I think over
the years you've been at MIT as long as
I've been in Harvard I think is somewhat
or more open to confrontational there's
a certain gentility at Harvard which I
think that's less directly
confrontational in many ways
I personally you know I thought I was
gonna say something about Frary at the
ed school I don't believe for a minute
that there was any sensory I think you
need and this is where the last question
was such an interesting one I really
need somebody who is who is going to be
a an enthusiastic presenter and who can
translate something which could seem
like it's another part of the world and
for adults into something which is I
think came out today you know whether
you agree with everything you said it's
much much much broader than that it has
universal aspects and it isn't tied
particularly to age and if Noam is right
you know there's a waxing and waning
over time with the extent to which these
raising of consciousness and the
flattening of hierarchy is more likely
than not since we're going past 7 I'd
like to be Bruno a chance if he has any
last words and also known and maybe
there'll be a stay around a bit more in
case
people have quick questions you know
Thank You Howard up one minute
you you sort of force Nome to come back
to Hegel because he had read Hegel
thanks to the hospital the Prairie
actually refers to Hager enter the
master-slave dialectic which he
parallels with the teacher-student
economy and of course when it comes to
oppressor oppressed and etc but my sense
is this
if friary is still relevant today it's
because unfortunately unfortunately
maybe for us because this is also
there's a reason for hope in this what
his describing is probably as old as
mankind and will stay even after us and
etc which is certainly no reason to just
say well okay when in that case what
does it matter
my sense is that what he says what
friary tells us today and again with
this sort of religious spirit that he
has that he was influenced by is that we
are spoon-fed a trinity where the father
is the capital the Messiah is the market
and the Holy Spirit is the free
enterprise and we are spoon-fed this on
a daily basis by the media by everything
remember
nomes manufacturing consent to agree
with this and that opposite to what
someone who died recently said there is
an alternative and certainly several so
there is a message of hope there my hope
each time I come here and I meet with
these great colleagues here at Harvard
and when I visit Nome regularly is that
I find people who still believe it is
possible to make this world a better
place I think that power of hiring
wanted to do that and for this reason he
will
[Music]
well I won't thank thank you all for
coming I have a feeling that you'll
remember this evening thanks to the
great conversationalist we had here and
I hope some of you will read fare and
engage in some dialectic in your own
mind and some dialogue with others then
it would be a good use of time
