decision the that's the Arab League
proposed in that context it calls for
normalization of relations with Israel
but for Kerry and also for Obama I'll
come back to that the only part of the
proposal exists is normalize relations
with Israel what's happened in between
for one day in nineteen seventy one two
three knows were gone Egypt offered a
full of peace treaty to this room
nothing for the Palestinians just
withdrawal from the silent Egyptian
territory okay if that had been accepted
Israel would have no skirty problems on
the Palestinian issue i think arisen way
they would pay attention to at least
egypt as the major military force in the
arab world full peace treaty would have
ended the security problems israel
understood this but they rejected they
rejected it in favor of expansion at
that time is expansion into the
northeastern china where thousands of
veterans are being forcibly expelled
driven in the desert israel was planning
to build a major city city with a
million people report yummy and a lot of
settlements to see him another
the neighborhood from which the
inhabitants were expelled so they chose
expansion into the Sinai over peace over
security and in fact that choice has
governed his early policy from then
until now security is interesting that
an expansionist much higher much higher
value well the crucial question in 1971
was what the US would do as it publishes
and there was an internal struggle in
the United in the in the government
between State Department William Rogers
who wanted to continue with what had
been to US policy namely no acquisition
of territory but force that means a
settlement on the creep Regency Saudi
border the international border with
minor and mutual modifications
straighten out some curved lines from
the ceasefire he continued supposed to
continue with that Henry Kissinger was
national security advisor was at that
time trying to take over the State
Department's they run the whole show
my opinion is if Rogers had said it's
raining Kissinger with the sun shining
but any event is instantly Rogers was in
favor of this kiss interpret the
opposite position and his position was
what he describes proudly in his memoirs
still me meaning no negotiation was just
forced he went out and be your attic
competition and the United States backed
Israel's rejection of peace and favor of
expansion and that's what's in the
policy ever since up until this minute
in 1976 the Arab states brought a
resolution to the Security Council
calling for a two-state settlement by
that time the Palestinian issue had
reached the international agenda the
Tuesday settlement on the 67 borders the
precinct own borders international
border the US reacted by be doing a u.s.
pito worth bearing in mind is a BB to
one thing it doesn't happen and for
another thing it's wiped out of history
so try to find a reference for it
anywhere sup from the margins or special
review specialist same thing happened 90
80 another
well under court also by the united
states that meanwhile the issue shifted
the General Assembly were similar
resolutions are brought up most annually
standard folks were like 150 to 250 one
two three sometimes dominica Marshall
Islands or somebody were to me but
essentially blocked by the u.s. systemic
there were you and because we're after
the press so a state could not just John
Kerry President Obama he has so far made
one major foreign policy declaration
mainly when he announced the appointment
of his Middle East negotiator George
Mitchell read this speech was
interesting he said that of course their
main concern in the region is the
security of Israel everything else is
secondary but he said there are
constructed moves coming from the Arab
side for the first time and he like
Kerry mentioned the Arab League peace
proposal the very constructive elements
in it calls for normalization of
relations
Israel and the art state should not
proceed to implement that and adding
very conceptual reconstruction and the
reorganization that means join us in
this alliance against Durant a real
enemy Obama's intelligent person chooses
his words carefully surely knew that
that was not the Arab League proposal it
called for the two-state settlement that
the US alone has rejected for over 30
years and in that context normalizations
of his omission of that is a clear
signal that he attends the us to
continue with its projectionists program
have been very rare departures from this
room of the prayer and temper has been a
consistent position and it's made very
clear that's one continue so Carrie for
example in his speech that among other
indications that the Israel finally has
that partner for peace that it's been
desperately hearing for is it not only
the Arab states that yes they want to
normalize relations with you but also
the Palestinians are evening to
and he mentioned one example the
Palestinians have accepted a military
force term arm by the u.s. of course
trained by a general US general sulfide
the germanium dictatorship and that
military force has proven that it can
the Palestinian Authority can finally
act responsibly and he explained ever
did that during the Gaza attack the US
runs security horse was able to prevent
any expression of sympathy for people in
Gaza by the population of the West Bank
so they're doing their job and that
means they're the inning that
responsibly maybe we couldn't admit them
into the civilized world he also said
that of course Israel tested through
some things to not just palestinians and
arabs he said it has to freeze
settlements what does that mean well all
the settlements are criminal that's not
even questioned like Israel was informed
by its highest legal authorities back in
1967 that any settlement in the occupied
territories is in violation of the
Geneva Conventions the foundation of
international terror law and they
recognized it that's what state students
were going to do it anyway that was
reiterated a couple of years ago by the
World Court including the US Justice and
a separate declaration said that yes the
Geneva Conventions apply to be occupied
territories so when you hear talk about
Israel should remove its illegal outpost
that's meanings every person there's
they're illegal every settlement is
illegal and
Carrie says you should freeze the
settlements he's saying continue the
criminal activity that is breaking up
the West Bank into a viable can tons and
making it possible a meaningful
Palestinian state there's another aspect
to freezing settlements I'm sure Carrie
does know his animals do you can read
about it that a new record of it selling
the Israeli human rights organization
just Connecticut isn't that one of the
ways in which you pretty settlements is
by expanding so put a ring around them
which takes in Palestinian land private
land and just keeping it pushing it as a
call to security barrier that you can do
anything then push it outward and of
course you have what's called natural
growth so if these natural
between the settlement turns into the
city so that's Harry's recommendation
for the US and Israel
