if the fog had settled in on the Boston
Airport 10 minutes earlier you would
have been had had a free afternoon we
just got out in time a field of inquiry
no matter what it is is established by
some array of questions that we pose and
as any researcher knows asking the right
questions is often the hardest part of
the task if you can do it you may have
won more than half the battle the right
questions are those that open up a
program of inquiry that leads to insight
into problems that are worth
understanding there's no shortage of
wrong questions and in fact they come in
many varieties I'll return to some of
them later on finding the right
questions is harder often the right
questions are very simple they invite us
to become surprised about perfectly
ordinary things things that we had taken
for granted a classic example of this is
the Scientific Revolution of the 17th
century which essentially set off modern
natural sciences if we are satisfied
that an Apple falls to the ground
because the ground is its natural place
and things seek their natural place then
the world will remain a complete mystery
if we're willing to find the fact
surprising and puzzling and the
properties of the motion as well then
the door is open to naturalistic inquiry
in the modern sense particularly if
we're willing to adopt what the
physicist Steven Weinberg once called
the Galilean style that is to search for
hidden realities that lie behind the
misleading and largely irrelevant flux
of phenomena the 17th century also
initiated
revolution and psychology effect that's
less known or what we nowadays some
people nowadays call cognitive science
and that revolution was also initiated
by a crucial act of imagination of a
rather similar sort in specifically by
the unwillingness to be satisfied by
certain obvious common sense accounts of
ordinary things that had long been taken
for granted so suppose I were to draw a
triangle on a blackboard assuming there
were one there and you would look at it
or suppose for that matter that you look
up here at where I'm standing what you
would see in the case of the blackboard
is a triangle a certain geometrical
figure what you see when you look at me
is a person a human being standing and
speaking now there was a traditional
explanation of the fact the explanation
is that the object in front of you has a
form and that form is transferred to
your brain and it's implanted there so
if you look at a cube and you see it
then there's a cube in your brain now
the major scientific contribution of de
cartes was to dismiss this traditional
explanation as nonsense and to insist
that the phenomena merit a real
explanation because they are in fact
very puzzling why should you see a
triangle when you look at the blackboard
and why should you see a man then with
hats when you look at something out the
window and in the street he argued that
that's a puzzling fact and one that
demands explanation and also argued that
the traditional explanation makes no
sense for a whole variety of reasons the
first reason is that there simply is no
way for a form to float through the air
and enter your brain and if you look at
the bit card and other Cartesian writers
there's lots of ridicule of this notion
a second fact is that the stimulus which
what's actually which are actually
interacting with is highly impoverished
so for example when you look up
here what you're seeing is scattered
fragments and the question is why do you
interpret those scattered scattered
fragments as a person or if you look at
a two-dimensional presentation you might
see it as a cube with depth and in fact
the retinal image is any event
two-dimensional but you see it as a cube
with depth or there may just be a
sequence of stimuli striking striking
your eye as your eye scans corners and
edges but you see it as a cube in modern
experimental situations the obvious fact
which it is is sharpened up and made
even more striking so for example in an
apparent motion experiment subject can
actually be presented with two flashes
of light and what the person may see
under certain circumstances in fact will
see is a line going from one point to
another point with no break if there
happens to be a barrier in the middle of
may actually you can see a line going
around a barrier although what's
actually hitting the eye is just two
points of light or if you're presented
with four dots four points of light in
succession what you may see is a rigid
object in motion let's say a cube
turning in space and so on in many cases
in short the stimulus that's reaching
you is highly impoverished but you're
seeing something in considerable
richness in the case of seeing a person
it's even more apparent that a lot of
richness is being assigned to the
impoverished stimuli that are presented
to you
another related point is that the figure
that you're presented with is typically
a distorted image at best makes almost
highly distorted as in the apparent
motion experiments but at best it's a
distorted image of what you actually see
if you like so for example if you're
looking at that triangle that I didn't
write on the non-existent black
what you would see is a triangle but
what would be there would be something
different it would be some sort of
distorted figure let's say one line a
little bit curved and two of the lines
maybe not quite coming together or
whatever but you don't see it as a
perfect example of whatever crazy figure
it is what you see it as is as a
triangle or maybe if it's too bad as a
distorted triangle and that raises
questions to why what why do you do that
why don't you see it as a perfect
example of what it in fact is as I say
the question becomes more dramatic if
what's actually hitting your eye is
points of light successive points of
light furthermore all of this seems to
be done pretty much without any
experience descartes couldn't prove it
but speculated plausibly that the same
would be true an infant said if and if
an infant with no experience were shown
a distorted triangle what the infant
would see is that at the store to
triangle just like an adult wouldn't see
a perfect instantiation of what is there
although in real life you're never
presented with things like triangles
that's a physical impossibility David
Hume a century later looking at the very
same phenomena and drew the opposite
conclusion from them he concluded that
you have no concept of a straight line
and you have no concept of a triangle
the reason being exactly the same facts
all your ever presented with our
physical things which will never be a
straight line and in fact if one of them
by accident worried you couldn't tell it
from a slightly bent line anyway
so therefore he concluded you just don't
have concepts like straight line and
triangle and geometrical figure and so
on well that's kind of a reductio and he
in fact that followed from his
assumptions about the way ideas were
formed and infected to reductio ad
absurdum of these assumptions and
plainly do have a concept of a straight
line and a triangle
and they cart speculations about such an
infant are in fact very well accurate as
was sort of obvious at the time and as
we now know it's kind of intriguing it's
an interesting chapter of intellectual
history that hymns reductive absurdum of
his assumptions was interpreted in the
subsequent period as a demonstration of
his assumptions and the alternative and
things went on from there
de cartes obviously correct
interpretation of the same phenomena was
pretty much forgotten after some period
and didn't enter into the modern sort of
scientific tradition that's a chapter in
intellectual history but it's fact again
if you look at seeing looking at the you
know what you interpret is men wearing
hats walking around the street or person
up here speaking the problem is even
more complex why didn't you see those
things as persons person is a very
strange notion a person is what you see
is something that has a kind of psychic
persistence so for example if say my
hair were to be chained combed in the
opposite direction you would take it to
be the same person on the other hand if
say or let's say if if you look at a
person on the person's arm is cut off or
replaced by something else it's the same
person on the other hand if the person's
mind were replaced let's say by a brain
transplant so that they had different
memories and spoke a different language
and so on presumably wouldn't be the
same person it would be something else
not the identity conditions would have
been broken and that's the way you
perceive things and that's the way you
interpret them whether it's a
geometrical figure or something more
complex like a person and the question
is why that's true it can't be that you
were taught it in fact if you begin to
look closely you don't even know what
the properties are without a lot of work
but those are all aspects of what makes
the problem a very puzzling one and in
fact Descartes was right these are
extremely puzzling facts and the
traditional explanations are completely
hopeless Descartes went on to
provide an answer a proposal it was a
two-pronged proposal one aspect of it
was a mechanistic theory of stimulation
on the model of a blind man with a stick
so if a blind man of the stick is poking
at the parts of let's say a chair
there'll be a succession of stimuli
coming to the hand and it's that
sequence of stimuli coming to the hand
that are there relevant that evoke the
concept the percept of the chair and on
a card argued that the when you see a
chair it's exactly the same thing the
your eye scans the chair and there's
actually physical contact because he
held that there were small particles as
if a rod extended from the charity or I
and sort of pushed at it and there was
accession of stimuli on the eye and
you're exactly like the blind man with a
stick you see a chair because that's
what your mind does and that's the
second part of the theory there's a
mechanical theory of stimulation and a
psychological theory the psychological
theory was what we would nowadays call a
computational representational theory of
mind a picture which said that the line
carries out certain computational
processes and forms representations and
it does it on the basis of rich innate
structure so the you see a triangle or a
chair or a person because the resources
of your mind create those conceptions as
exemplars for interpreting experience on
the occasion of very scattered
stimulation of the kind that you
normally have the psychological theory
then says in case the triangle that the
mind has the principles of Euclidean
geometry built into it and that's why
you see the thing in front of you as a
distorted triangle not as an exact
example of what it is on the occasion of
scattered or even sequential
stimulations and the same would be true
of person
or anything else and the structure
itself must be largely built in because
it is essentially available
independently of experience so it's not
a par with whatever it is about an
embryo that gets it to turn into a
person rather than say a mouse on the
occasion of nutritional inputs or that
makes the embryo if it happens to be a
human undergo puberty at some relatively
fixed point in later life postnatal lot
development rather than do something
else that an organism might do it's got
to be built in and it's whatever it is
is the can be modified or maybe
triggered by something that's happening
in the environment and they cart argued
the same is true essentially of mental
life well that gives an answer to a
problem sometimes called plato's problem
and mainly the problem of how we're able
to know so much and to perceive such
richness in the world with so little
evidence for any of it and why do we all
do it more or less the same way even
though all of us have scattered and
different and accidentally different
than highly deficient evidence and in
fact the carts answer is pretty much
along the lines of plato's answer at
least partially the part that's in
common is that the experience at most
stimulates or awakens or sharpens
internally determined mental structures
very much in the way in which nutrition
stimulates growth along a course that's
determined by natural law guided by
internal an internal program that would
distinguish a person from a mouse now as
far as we know they cut answer is
largely correct
principal at least not detail and it was
amplified in quite interesting ways
through the 17th century and little
beyond it was then as I mentioned
largely abandoned and in fact it was
revived not very long ago by now it's
essentially taken for granted in its
essentials and a lot is known about the
mechanisms that enter into these
processes and explain the puzzling
phenomenon at least partially so here we
have another case where the right
questions were finally asked after a
long period and simple ordinary
phenomena were regarded as puzzling as
indeed they are much like an apple
falling from a tree and when you address
them you set off a course of inquiry
which can actually in some cases lead to
understanding well the 17th century
cognitive revolution raised similar
questions about natural language it also
found things that were puzzling and
asked for explanations now there's a
welter of confusion but out of it you
can detect some pretty similar answers
in many respects again the insights they
were real were largely forgotten they
were revived only fairly recently and
exactly isn't in the case of vision they
were revived in complete ignorance of
the earlier history bits and pieces of
which were running discovered later the
history really was forgotten even in the
scholarly literature in fact sometimes
most strikingly in the scholarly
scholarly literature the phenomena of
language are puzzling in very much the
same way and we quickly find that out as
soon as we are willing to find simple
facts surprising like the fall of an
apple in fact the comment that I made
about the word person already suggests
some extremely surprising phenomena well
take something parallel division take
linguistic perception a signal hits your
ear and you hear a sentence
what you hear is a sentence say
the sentence John is painting the house
brown now the signal that you would that
actually reaches your ear could be
highly distorted typically is could be
masked and all sorts of noise it could
be interrupted it could be from what we
call a different dialect meaning some
other language that's close enough to
yours so you can make contact with it
not a determinant notion and what a
model typically standardly be the case I
mean it'd be an amazing miracle if any
of you shared my language with its
special features that come from having
been brought up in a particular block in
Northeast Philadelphia with a father
came from the Ukraine and then you know
travel to Boston later and whatever
other crazy nonsense forms the way I
talk it doesn't so you're hearing a
distorted signal but if I say John is
painting the house brown that's what you
hear you hear it the way you understand
it the way you would have said it well
what you're creating in your mind what
your mind is creating it's some sort of
a complex representation some sort of a
complex object which is a collection of
properties a collection of phonetic and
somatic and other structural properties
that's a linguistic expression a
collection of such properties you hear
it as an in fact point by point the
problem is similar to that of seeing a
say a triangle you hear that noise that
signal that distorted signal as a
collection of properties which includes
six words and to some of the words sound
alike like the last two words house
Brown sound alike they have therein
actually a formal formal relationship
called assonance they have the same
vocalic nucleus if you made him a little
more alike they would run like house and
house and you
here that expression is carrying with
certain entailments so for example if
John painted the house brown then John
is applying paint to the exterior of the
house not to its interior just kind of
curious if he's painting if he's playing
painted the interior he may be painting
a room brown but he's not painting the
house brown and you know that when you
hear somebody say John's painting the
house brown you want to find out if it's
true you look outside not inside now how
do you know and we can go on and I will
in a moment how do you move all of these
things well it's very much as in the
case of say the triangle experience is
utterly inadequate even the shallowest
investigation will demonstrate that at
peak periods of language acquisition
children are picking up maybe a dozen
words a day understanding them in this
fashion meaning they're picking up words
virtually on a single presentation
experimental studies have shown that
children will pick up the meanings of
words to a very in a very restricted
fashion with a lot of richness even if
the words are presented even if they're
in a period of language use where they
don't produce sentences they just
produce maybe two words which somebody
will interpret as a sentence but they'll
pick up the meanings of words from long
expressions pretty complex expressions
that they couldn't possibly produce
nonsense words which are made up for you
know to test it and so on and so forth
but even apart from experiment the
phenomenon is obvious enough if you're
willing to be surprised at things like
the fall of an Apple when you look at
the acquisition of structural properties
or semantic properties of bigger
expressions long more complex
expressions the whole problem deepens
very very rapidly well there's only one
plausible line of answer possible
direction in which any of these things
could be answered short of miracles and
that's essentially the same as Descartes
his reasoning carries over and in fact
inquiry into these questions which
begins with the recognition that they're
pretty puzzling
into these questions leads quite
plausibly to psychological theory very
similar to de cartes
a theory which involves computational
representational theories of the mind
the linguistic expression that full
collection of properties is evoked by
scattered stimulation distorted from
your point of view and you don't
understand what your own mind produces
on the occasion of that stimulation very
much like seeing the triangle or seeing
a person interpreting scattered stimuli
in a rich and specific way and you can
do it
because that's the way you're
constructed you can do it for the same
reason that as an embryo you move to
grow into a person and not a mouse
part of the brain is a set of properties
we don't know hardly know where to look
but presume that they're they're not in
the arm so part of the brain is a
collection of structures or elements of
some kind which we can call the language
faculty it has an initial state
determined by your biological nature
much the way most everything else about
you is and that initial state becomes a
particularly egde under the impact of
the triggering effect and partially
modifying effect of rather limited
experience much as the embryo becomes a
person through the impact of nutrition
if you're willing to be puzzled about
simple things you will have a plausible
research program for naturalistic
inquiry you have a potential science
which can give answers or these partial
answers to the questions that
immediately arise it's worth knowing
noticing that it was only quite recently
that these questions were regarded as
puzzling if you go back 40 years ago
saying the standard view was that the
problem about language is why it takes
much experience to drive it into a child
given that it's so utterly trivial the
problem was supposed to be one of over
learning why does it take years and
years for these trivial things to get
into the child's mind and the assumption
was well we understand very well how
it's done it's all done by conditioning
and it's a collection of habits and
habits structures and so on and that is
about as plausible as the idea that an
Apple falls to the ground because that's
its natural place or the idea that you
see a triangle because the form of the
triangle implants itself in your brain
even the most minimal inquiry into the
facts demolishes that picture instantly
nevertheless it was the almost
universally held picture and in fact in
all of the thousands of years of quite
fruitful inquiry into language and it's
an old old subject it's apart from a few
blips here and there like the 17th
century it's only quite recently that
these problems will regard it as
puzzling and problematic and were
seriously addressed well what kind of
questions do arise if you're willing to
face them first question is what in fact
is the computational representational
system and one the state that the
language faculty attains second question
is what is the biologically determined
initial state what's the nature how does
the language faculty start off by virtue
of the given program which is apparently
very similar across the species very
slight differences as far as we know so
we can ignore them for the sake of of
the discussion without anything
problematic at least in this context a
third question that arises is how the
computational representation is how the
computational representational system is
put to use in ordinary human actions
actions like say articulating your
thoughts or referring the cats or
telling stories or interpreting what you
hear and so on normal things that people
do
obviously uses this system but in what
way does it use them another question
you can ask is what is the nature of the
interstate transitions how do you get
from the initial state of the language
faculty to successive States finally
apparently to a highly stable state
after which there isn't very much change
maybe around puberty what kind of role
does experience play in triggering these
changes and maybe partially modifying
them there are further questions there's
a question that you might call the
unification question a complex system
like the brain can be studied from many
different perspectives at many different
levels you can study the brain in terms
of say atoms or molecules or cells or
cell assemblies or neural networks or
computational representational systems
at any of those levels you may or may
not be able to construct a true theory
about what the brain is and what it's
doing if you can construct a theoretical
explanatory account which merits certain
degree of faith you can then ask the
unification question how do these
various levels of inquiry relate to one
another well from now there's really
only one well grounded theory as far as
things like language are concerned and
that's the those are the computational
representational theories we assume
essentially on faith that there's going
to be an account of all of this in terms
of say atoms ourselves with a much
greater leap of faith when they assume
that what's involved in all of this is
neurons and networks of neurons not say
the vascular system although there's
plenty of blood flowing around in the
brain a lot more than one might expect
enough to lend some credibility to
Aristotle's thesis that the purpose of
the brain is the cool of blood still we
tend to assume with a huge leap of faith
and basically no evidence that the
neurological structures not the vascular
ones are somehow implicated in all of
the
is there is incidentally a kind of a
common slogan in the so called cognitive
sciences which runs something says that
the mental is the neurophysiological
at a higher level so you don't have to
be scared about the mental where the
mental includes things like
computational representational systems
well that slogan has the story backwards
at least from the point of view of the
Natural Sciences from point of view of
the Natural Sciences what we ought to
say is we want to have a tentative
hypothesis recognizing there's very
little evidence for it and the tentative
hypothesis would be that the
neurophysiological is the mental at a
lower level lower in quotes where the
moodle is the only one we have any faith
about from the point of view of the
criteria of science at least because it
really does have a reasonably rich
structure of explanatory theory that
accounts for things that would be the
realistic approach and one might even
hope that the theories that the
theoretical apparatus theoretical
perspective that does seem to have
reasonable grounding in empirical fact
and explanatory wealth that it may
provide the guidelines for inquiry into
what it is about the brain that makes it
have these properties possibly along the
lines of say chemistry in the 19th
century which studied things in the
world from a rather abstract point of
view like valence and periodic table and
organic molecules and so on and so forth
the physics of the day couldn't the
unification problem was wide open nobody
knew how that related to the physics of
the day and in fact it turned out it
didn't relate to the physics of the day
because the physics was completely
deficient and had to be radically
revised in order to accommodate those
properties that could turn out to be the
case here - or it could turn out to be
the case that we have something on the
model of say genetics about 40 years ago
or it turned out you could do something
like reduction instead of what you might
call expansion
has happened in the chemistry physics
case or there might be something else
there's a unification problem and you
never know in advance how it's going to
be settled if at all at least if you're
following the principles of the nature
of naturalistic inquiry the principles
of the sciences well what kinds of
things do we find out if we try to
address these questions let's for
simplicity keep to this sentence this
linguistic expression John is painting
the house Brown which recall as a
certain array of phonetic and somatic
and other properties well what we find
out is that some properties of that
expression are universal which means
they're unlearned others are particular
or language particular they are selected
by experience from some innately
determined set of options which turns
out to be rather narrow set so on a
phonetic side it's a universal property
of that expression that the vowel of the
word house is shorter than the value of
the word Brown then the quality of the
vowel within some range is language
particular so for me it's the same as
the vowel of hat and for you it may be
some other vowel and then rough range
the turning to say somatic properties
and one is the one I mentioned the brown
house has a brown exterior not interior
that appears to be Universal property
not just of that word but a whole big
category of words roughly container
words including ones that we made invent
so it's true words like box or airplane
or igloo or
into or spherical cube or whatever you
might choose to consider if you're
painting a spherical cube brown you're
giving it a brown exterior not interior
that's appears to be Universal property
a particular property is the one that
distinguishes the word house from the
word home so in English say if I I go
after work I go home if I was talking
Hebrew I would go to the house if you
take a closer look you find a good deal
more complexity determined by the
computational representational systems
and in fact really determined by their
innate fixed structure so consider again
the fact that the exterior surface of
the house or any similar word is somehow
distinguished that carries over to a lot
of other things if you see the house
you're seeing its exterior surface we
can't see this building from here
although we could see the building let's
say if a piece of it was say I was in an
airplane now I guess case you could see
Frankie sitting inside and you can see
the airplane if say you can look out the
window and see the wing then you can see
the exterior surface or if there was a
more outside and was reflecting the
exterior surface you could see the the
house or the building or the airplane or
the igloo or the spherical cube or
whatever so basically these things are
our geometrical entities exterior
surfaces which are a strange way to look
at things but that's the way we look at
such that's such that's the way we use
that's that's the nature of these
conceptions that we use to talk about
things on the other hand the house is
not just its exterior surface that is a
geometrical entity so for example
suppose that say Peter and Mary are
equidistant from the exterior surface
but Peter is inside the house and Mary's
outside the house well
not Peter the one inside is definitely
not near the house Mary could be near
the house depending on what the current
conditions on nearness is similarly our
similarly the house has chairs inside it
not outside it so the house involves its
exterior surface and its interior
however the interior is very abstractly
conceived so for example if I fill the
house with cheese or say I move the
walls it's the same house on the other
hand if I clean the house
I made interacting only with things in
the interior space so the house is
conceived as an exterior surface and an
abstract interior space with quite
complex properties of course all this
time the house itself is a concrete
object and we know that perfectly well
the house can be made of bricks or wood
and a wooden house doesn't have is not
one with a wooden exterior in contrast
to a brown house which is one with a
brown exterior we can look at a house
from both of those perspectives at once
so a brown wooden house has a brown
exterior looking at the house abstractly
as a geometrical surface but it has a
woman it's made of wood
taking the concrete perspective if my
house used to be in Philadelphia but
it's now in Boston then a certain
physical object was moved in contrast if
my home was to be in Philadelphia and is
now in Boston then no physical object
was moved although my home is also
concrete so my home is made of bricks or
wood or whatever it's some physical
structure houses concrete in quite a
different way my home can be the house
in which I live or the town or the
country or the universe that's not true
of house though they're both concrete
now that house home distinction has
numerous consequences I can go home but
I can't go house I can live in a brown
house I can't live in a brown home in
many languages the counterpart of the
word home is essentially an adverb
which is pretty much the sense in encase
in English to all these are aspects of
our concept of house and that wherever
we look we find exactly the same thing
so whether something is say a desk
rather than a table or a hard bed
depends on such things as the intentions
of its designer or the ways in which
people intend to use it or take say a
book a book is a perfectly concrete
object you can refer to books that way
you can say so for example this book
weighs five pounds or you can refer to
books from abstract perspective you can
ask who wrote the book which is not some
physical object or even he wrote the
book in his head but then he forgot
about it or you can refer to a book from
both perspectives simultaneously you can
say the book he wrote weighs five pounds
or the book he is writing would weigh
five pounds if he were to finish it
let's say and it were to get published
and the same is true again wherever you
looked so take a city like for example
London London isn't a fiction it's
something non fictional but when you
consider it as London that is through
the perspective of a city name a
particular kind of linguistic expression
then you get a very curious properties
so London could be completely destroyed
and it could be rebuilt up the Thames in
a thousand years and it would still be
London under some circumstances you can
regard London with or without regard for
its population so from one point of view
it's the same city if all the people
desert it from another point of view you
can say that London has come to have a
harsher feel to it through the thatcher
years which is a comment on how people
act and live and to such perspectives on
london can fit quite differently into a
system of beliefs that yields of the
puzzles of the philosophical literature
puzzles that might very well dissolve
incidentally if we abandon some of the
assumptions on which they're based such
as the assumption that there is a
relation of reference holding between
words and
moans or that there is a common language
in which from which those words are
drawn on assumptions which are very far
from obvious I should say in fact don't
even seem coherent well even in these
trivial examples we see that the
internal conditions on meaning are rich
and complex and unsuspected in fact
barely noon the most elaborate
dictionaries don't even dream of such
subtleties these concepts are acquired
by the child and there are full richness
and any possible explanation for that
must be that they were already there
there are only marginal modifications of
the kind Illustrated and I stress again
that these are very trivial examples
when you look at prior examples it
becomes even more obvious these are some
of the notions that seem most concrete
but they're already often a domain of
quite considerable complexity
predetermined complexity now there seems
at first glance at least to be something
kind of paradoxical in these conclusions
so take houses and homes again they're
concrete though they're concrete things
houses and homes but they're concrete in
quite different ways from another point
of view also we consider them to be
quite abstract so again abstract in very
different ways it's not that we have
confused ideas or inconsistent beliefs
about houses and/or homes or igloos or
boxes or spherical cubes or whatever
rather lexical items provide us with a
certain perspective for viewing what we
take to be the things in the world or
for that matter from the constructions
of our mind what we conceive in other
ways they're kind of like filters or
lenses they provide a certain way of
looking at things and thinking about the
products of our minds the terms
themselves do not refer but people can
use them to refer to things viewing them
from a particular point of view through
a particular lens if you like that's a
point of view which is quite remote from
that of the Natural Sciences which seek
to divest their concepts of all of these
parochial human
interests and concerns as far as
possible well these are trivial cases we
move beyond lexical structure the
conclusions about the richness of the
initial state of the language faculty
and it's apparently special structure
are reinforced very considerably so to
take such expressions as say he thinks
John as a genius and compare it with
John thinks he is a genius in the first
case him you take he to be somebody
other than John in the second case he
could very well be John he thinks John
is a genius versus John thinks he's a
genius well that's not the effect of
lunar order for example in the sentence
his mother thinks John is a genius you
can again take he on his to be referring
to John and typically you would so
there's some kind of structural
conditions that determine what you might
call referential dependence whether a
pronoun can pick up its reference the
way you use it to refer from some non
phrase in the sentence
now the principles underlying those
facts appear to be universal at least in
large measure and will perceive them
they yield rich conditions on somatic
interpretations on intrinsic connections
of meaning long expressions including
incidentally analytic connections
furthermore in this domain you begin to
have theoretical results of some depth
which pretty surprising consequences so
the same principles appear to play a
significant role in yielding the
semantic properties of expressions that
are superficially quite unlike these
take say the sentence John is too clever
to expect anyone to talk to Bill and ask
yourself who's doing the expecting the
non expecting well it's John John is too
clever for John to expect anyone to talk
to Bill John is expecting no one to talk
to bill suppose you take the same
sentence and you drop the final word
John is too clever to expect anyone to
talk to well then everything changes
then you're talking to John and it's no
longer John who's doing the expecting
it's somebody other than John and that
same property holds for a huge class of
other constructions and it seems that
the principles that explain those
curious interpretations are pretty much
the same principles as the ones that
deal with referential dependence as in
the examples before well at this point
you're reaching to quite non-trivial
properties of the computational
representational system phenomena that
looked totally dis OSI ated can be
accounted for on the basis of simple and
pre elegant and pretty far-reaching
principles which interact to yield some
quite complicated results at that point
one is really warning something about
the nature of the language faculty
well I won't proceed with our examples
but that's what you get into as soon as
you take the question seriously and try
to give answers to them instead of
waving your hands about over learning
and habits and forms flying through the
air and things falling to their natural
place and so on what kinds of conclusion
conclusions does one reach from this
inquiry well there are number of
plausible results one of them is that a
language consists of two different parts
one is the computational
representational system the other is a
lexicon a collection of things like
house and London and so on the
computational system takes an array of
items from the lexicon and it converts
it into a linguistic expression like
John is painting the house brown or John
is too clever to expect anyone to talk
to with its full array of phonetic and
semantic and other properties and if
that's the case there are going to be
two acquisition problems this problem of
accounting for the growth of the
computational system and accounting for
the growth of the lexicon and these two
problems look in some ways different as
far as the computational
representational system is concerned
it's possible
but the answer to the problem is trivial
that is that there's only one that the
initial state of the language faculty
only has one instantiation there's only
one possible computational
representational system and in this
respect only one language the with
regard to the lexicon on it can't be
quite like that but it may be
surprisingly close to it one part of the
company of the lexicon is concepts like
say house and person and desk and so on
and it may be that these are fixed that
they don't allow much or maybe even
anything in the way of variation and
somehow given although we don't know a
lot about the principles that enter into
into them the selection of them of
course will be language specific so
we've selected in childhood house and
others have selected igloo but the
properties of these expressions are
remarkably similar and what's similar
about them is apparently predetermined
beyond that there's what's sometimes
called sorcery in arbitrariness after so
sewer that is you can pair up concepts
and phonetic sound representations in
arbitrary ways that's the sort of
trivial part of language variation
there's also variation among what are
called grammatical elements things like
say case so if you study Latin you got
to memorize all sorts of paradigms and
you know where you use what the form of
the accusative case is and fourth
declension and all that kind of business
and similarly with verbal inflections
and so on and there's some difference
among languages in this respect so I
mean be learning English you have to do
all that stuff or so you think
actually chances are that English is
very much like Latin in this respect and
maybe all languages are very much alike
in this respect and the only difference
between them is what comes out the mouth
so that's very likely that the Latin
type systems in fact are there in
English it's just that they're all done
by mental computation that pretty much
the same often far-reaching consequences
that the systems have in languages where
you see them
hear them come out the mouth but it's
just that the mental computations feed
the articulatory apparatus at a
different point in the computational
system hence you get what appear to be
very different languages although from
the point of view of us a rational
Martian the differences would be pretty
trivial just what comes out the mouth
not what's going on in the internal
computations if that's the case then the
differences among language would reduce
to some of the lexical selections the
caesarian arbitrariness choices in
grammatical elements which may vary
largely have to do with what is
articulated not what is computed of
course very small differences in an
intricate computation then only one
computational system only one technique
for converting all of this into
expressions with a rich array of
properties and then some differences on
the phonetics I'd notice until you'd
expect more possibility of difference in
the phonetic side of the system than in
any of the others and the reason is that
it's only the sound side of the system
that you actually get very much evidence
about not all that much but at least
some at least you hear the signals the
rest of it you all just have to
basically make up and since you have to
basically make it up it must be that
most of it is built-in so you'd expect
more variation on the sound side and on
the caesarian arbitrariness where you do
get direct evidence that on most of the
other things in fact anything i've been
talking about and that appears to be the
case again going back to the Martian
scientist if the Martian scientist
approached humans the way we approach
say fruit flies the Martian scientist
would presumably conclude that they're
basically all identical the languages
they speak are all the same there are
some marginal variations like there
might be some differences in the fruit
flies in a sample which you'll overlook
for the purposes the experiment that
looks closer to reality than one might
have anticipated not many years ago even
it noticed that very small changes
in an intricate system can you would
appear to be substantial phenomenal
differences but they may be highly
misleading they may be just different
modifications of the essentially same
thing and that looks very largely true
well another thing that you find and
must find is that language is embedded
languages just some kind of mental
computation some computational
properties of the brain computational
representational properties of the brain
and it's embedded in performance systems
at least in humans these are systems
which use all of these resources for
various human actions things like
articulating your thoughts or for
interpreting what you hear or for
talking about cats or for telling jokes
or whatever else you do with these
things
the reason it makes sense to call these
computational systems language is
because of the performance systems in
which they're embedded in principle if
might be biologically impossible but in
principle there could be another
organism which would have the very same
language that you do this very same
internal system but would use it as
instructions for locomotion just
embedded in different performance
systems in that case we wouldn't want to
call our language the language in other
words is a real thing it's a state of
the brain we assume and such that real
thing could be integrated in different
kind of systems ours happens to be
integrated in a system for articulating
thoughts and referring to cats and
interpreting what you hear and hence the
study of all of this is languages or
integrated in something else we couldn't
call it that it's even conceivable that
some other organism has this system
completely and there just aren't any
performant systems that access it so the
organism has the capacity for light has
language in fact just no way to access
it and you'd have to find that out in
some other ways not more indirect
fashion that's why no means an absurd
possibility but it probably isn't
the prevailing systems appear to be of
two different categories there are
unknown receptive systems on the other
hand there are productive systems the
receptive systems take a signal in a
collection of an array of circumstances
they have access to the language they
produce an expression or linguistic
expression so you're you hear a signal
John is painting the house brown and the
particular circumstances you ruin your
perception says you're receptive system
accessing the computation your
interpretation of that expression with
its sound and other properties that the
problem of investigating this is beyond
inquiry but you can proceed to some
idealizations that may make some sense
the standard idealization is to assume
that there's what's called a parser
which just takes the signal forgetting
about the circumstances accesses the
language and produces the structural
description on that occasion it's also
typically assumed that the parsers
invariant that is it's the same for all
languages and it doesn't grow the way
language grows in childhood the main
reason for assuming that is ignorance
nothing much is known about parsers so
you make the simplest assumption which
is there's only one and it never changes
if in fact the whole idea of a parse the
existence of a parser is much more
questionable than the existence of the
language that it accesses that's almost
almost hard it's very hard to imagine
that that's not true the use almost
incoherent to question that on the other
hand a parser might very well not exist
there might not be any part of the brain
that just acts it uses signals accesses
linguistic knowledge disregard
circumstances and comes out with an
interpretation it's a guess that such a
thing exists
May there are lots of other it's
commonly commonly the opposite is
assumed very commonly assumed that the
parser is uncontroversial the
problematic part is the so-called
competence the language if you think it
through it's just the opposite at least
again on scientific grounds there are
other assumptions about parsers which
are common but don't withstand even the
slightest inquiry for example it's
commonly argued and you can find this
all of the literature including the
linguistic literature that parsing is
what's called is easing and quick you do
it very fast and very easily so
therefore the language must be very well
designed for parsing some and in fact
the criterion for a theory of language
must be that it explained this fact that
you can parse so quickly you do it so
fast
in fact almost instantaneously when you
listen to what I say the problem with
that thesis is it's just flatly false
empirically parsing is extremely
difficult very often and often quite
impossible and there's whole categories
of expressions which are well known and
which are studied precisely for this
reason other given various kinds of
names like garden path sentences or
Center embedded expressions and all
sorts of others in fact even ones like
the one I gave you
John is too clever to expect anyone to
talk to people often find that rather
slow parsing it takes time to figure out
what it means parsing is anything but
easy and quick and it's often what's
called wrong being what the perceptual
apparatus produces is different from
what the language tells you is the
actual structure of the sentence anyone
who's taught elementary logic is
familiar with this give people even
professional mathematicians sentences
that have a negation and a disjunction
in them and their parsing goes
out of whack this is so extreme that
even some of the common idioms of our
language our interpreters many
interpreted as meaning the opposite of
what they literally mean so if two
airplanes come close and almost hit we
call it an illness but I think it true
in your spare time and you'll notice
that it's an ear hit if it was and your
miss they hit but just any even the
slightest introduction of something
negative and our parsing apparatus
collapses when we look at more complex
structures it's off the wall so pressing
is anything but easy and quick it's very
often very difficult and often in fact
impossible so how come we can
communicate so readily well we just use
the parts of language that are readily
parsed some parts of this system are in
fact very easily parsed those are the
ones we lose and those are the ones that
since other people are just like us they
have any trouble with them so certain
parts of the language are usable and the
parts that are usable are used and
that's it
like pathologies beyond the tautology
there's nothing to say about this as to
the idea that languages world is mined
for parsing and not only it's hard to
say that it's false because it's not
even clear that it's meaningful to talk
about what a biological system is
designed for or adapted to presupposes
some gives some promissory notes that
can't be filled it assumes you go and
talk about what a system is well adapted
to if you had some space of possible
systems and of possible functions and
some metric that said pick an arbitrary
system out of there and an arbitrary
function and there's such-and-such a
likelihood that they'll be adapted to
one another and if you could show that
the system you have in mind say the
kidney your language is has AHA you know
is more is better adapted than a pair of
systems and functions picked at random
if you can go through those steps you
could talk about when systems are well
adapted but that's all fantasy can't
talk about any of these things so it's
not cool
anything to say that a system is well
adapted to a function at least in any
useful sense in an event if he can make
some sense of that it's not going to
turn out that language is well adapted
to the system of the function of
communication because it isn't you only
use the scattered parts of it that have
that property
turning to the matter of production
there's very little to say this was in
fact a crucial point in Cartesian
philosophy in fact the criterion of mind
was held to be one of the major criteria
of mind was held to be the capacity to
produce linguistic expressions to
express thoughts in the manner in which
humans do it and that was held to be
outside the bounds of mechanical
explanation and the general idea and may
very well be sound anyway there's
nothing much to say about it except at
the level of sound structure there are
other questions for example the
unification question the relation of the
well-grounded computational
representational systems to cells or
conceivably neuronal networks or
whatever is the right array of
mechanisms that pretty well lies in the
future there are questions about
evolution of such systems that's there
it's doubtful that the questions are
even being put in the right way anyway
there's nothing to say about as far as I
know well that's a kind of a quick tour
through some of the right questions or
what seem to me the right questions
right because they lead us to inquiry
that provides insight into matters that
are worth understanding and do it in the
naturalistic style with the rational
exploit expectation of ultimate ultimate
integration into the Natural Sciences
maybe by modifying some of their
assumptions as in the past there are
also plenty of wrong questions that lead
more where for all sorts of reasons to
mention a few possible reasons some of
the wrong questions are wrong because
they're just premature you just don't
understand enough to know how to proceed
so or perhaps you could imagine how to
perceive but inquiry is barred in other
ways the unification problems like that
the problem of relating computational
representational systems to the brain
sciences not enough is known about how
the brain what mechanisms you don't even
know what mechanisms of the brain would
look for pretty much at this point maybe
study if computational representational
systems will provide some guidance on
that but right now it's questions up in
the dark and to the extent that you can
think of ways of studying it you can't
carry out the methods so you're not
going to carry out say ablation
experiments and so on interestingly
there are on your intrusive methods
which are giving some kind of intriguing
results relationships between
event-related potentials electrical
activity of the brain and surprisingly
subtle aspects of linguistic structure
and maybe maybe something will be
learned about all this but at the moment
it's mostly it's it's premature or at
least there are also problems which are
of the kind that are often called too
many variable problems like the problem
of determining the course of a falling
feather or just about any phenomenon of
ordinary life so for example the actual
state of say John's language faculty is
not worth studying that some weird
jumble of systems reflecting the
accidental course of his history about
as interesting as the course of the
feather
how John interprets what Peter has in
mind when Peter says something or other
in particular circumstances that's also
so rich in relevant factors that it's
not worth studying like most phenomena
of ordinary life there are other
questions that just fall beyond the
scope of the system under investigation
so suppose you're studying you're enough
to take an undergraduate physics and
you're in a mechanic's class and you're
doing an experiment rolling a ball down
an inclined plane and the lab manual you
know has a prediction that if
take that amount of time you roll down
so somebody falsifies the prediction by
reaching over and picking up the ball
and throwing it out the window
well that didn't count for something
reason it was the person who threw the
ball out the window was outside the
system so you didn't refute physics by
that experiment actually to answer the
question why you didn't refute physics
is not so trivial you might want to
think about it but we assume that you
didn't the system is somehow closed and
things outside it even physical
mechanisms like people outside it they
don't count and there are a lot of
questions like that they're not easy to
sharpen up but we just recognize them
often at least if you want to account
for say which linguistic expressions are
amusing or verifiable or refer to cats
or something like that that's just
outside the scope of the system I'm like
reaching over and throwing a ball out of
a window when you try to refute a
mechanics experiment in this domain you
often find questions that don't have
general answers though they might very
well have answers relative to specific
circumstances usually to specific human
interests and concerns trouble is these
can vary in every imaginable way so
there's nothing of any generality to to
say about them take say the idea of John
and Bill speaking the same language well
under particular conditions we with an
answer to that so I could say if
somebody in the audience that person
that I speak the same language but
somebody in Tokyo we don't speak the
same language the problem is there's no
general answer to that question it's
like the question is Boston or New York
well from my point of view no you know
if you live in London maybe yes there's
no right answer to whether Boston is
near New York or does John look like
Bill from certain points of view yes
from certain points of view no these
aren't questions that have answers or
could have answers there are no
idealization x' there are no natural
categories
there are no natural neighborhoods if
you like those are just highly interest
relative questions perfectly usable and
fixed circumstances but trouble is
circumstances can vary in every
conceivable fashion notions like common
language or public language that people
know or as often claim that people
partially know that makes to talk about
that makes about as much sense as an
effort to determine objective height
categories or neighborhoods or
look-alikes or something like that
sometimes it's argued in the literature
that you have to assume a common public
language or you can't account for the
possibility of communication that's just
a fallacy in order to account for the
fact that John and Bill look alike you
don't have to postulate a common form
that they both share and to account for
the fact that John can sometimes
interpret what bill says you don't have
to postulate any mystical concept like a
common language that they both share or
maybe partially know or anything like
that
let them seem to make any sense at all
very likely although here the territory
is more obscure the same is true of the
notion of reference that is a
relationship that holds the allegedly
between words and things so for example
what the word suppose you ask what the
word water or house or London or one of
these things refers to looks as though
that question is meaningless without
further specification of circumstances
you can say that words are used to refer
and in fact used to refer in a manner
determined by their internal semantics
from a particular perspective or a
vantage point say as a person or as a
house or as a desk or as London or
something like that but it doesn't seem
to make any sense to ask general
questions about the reference of a word
or a phrase abstracted from those
conditions or about reference and its
nature as if it were something like
looking alike and its nature or being
near in its nature if that's true and it
does look to be true then it will also
make no sense to seek some notion of
content which is understood as a
property of an expression
that fixes its reference that's been a
major topic of the philosophy of
language since Fraga but it's not so
clear that there's an actual topic there
also it wouldn't make sense to ask
what's the meaning of a word just as we
can't ask what's the sound of a word
this a word has a sound in particular
circumstances and occasions but there's
no such thing as the sound of a word and
it's not clear that there's anything
more to say about the meaning of a word
though the properties of the uses the
the articulate the sound articulations
and the uses in a variety of human
actions those are very narrowly fixed by
which internal properties of the kind
that I've indicated you can talk about
how a word is used to prefer or how it's
used to pronounce but it's not at all
clear that it makes any sense to ask
about its meaning or its sound or its
reference or anything like that
now a good deal of the modern study of
language relies on such notions as
common public language or reference or
content and so on and that in fact
includes much work a lot of work of
great sophistication a lot of work which
in fact eliminating in many ways
nevertheless the reliance on these
notions in my view is much too
uncritical and it's not at all clear
what would remain if what seemed to be
quite dubious props are kicked away now
there are other categories of wrong
questions that are worth noting for
example you can ask pointless questions
using technical concepts that no longer
lack any clear sense so you know how
much phlogiston is there in that fire
over there are questions about vital
force or questions about material body
those are all terms that at one stage of
science had a certain meaning they fit
into a quasi explanatory schemes but
they no longer do and you can't make any
sense out of sentences questions like
our computational representational
systems material unless you somehow
resurrect these abandoned notions are
there are also problems of what's
sometimes called epistemic now
business humans are we assume biological
organisms not angels and as such there
is going to be certain they have certain
capacities which are fixed they may be
very rich like the language faculty very
rich faculties enable you to do very
many things but they also exclude very
many things mainly the ones that don't
conform to those rich faculties and
whatever faculties of the mind are
involved and say doing scientific
inquiry or solving problems and so on
there's only two possibilities either
they're so vacuous that we can never do
anything or their structure in which
case there are a lot of things we can't
do and other things we can do well
that's true of every organism we know so
for example rats can do some things well
but by that very token other things
badly and if we're part of the natural
world the same is true of us which means
that there will be questions that are
poseable that are behind our
intellectual grasp though some
differently organized intelligence might
have no problem within just as we can
deal with some of the problems that rats
can't face because they know the right
concepts in principle no that means
there's got to be some assuming we're
part of natural world there will be some
notion of epistemic boundedness there
will be some pure mysteries just you can
may pose the question but can't do much
about it like a rat trying to run a
prime lumber maze within the domain of I
will know what those bounds are although
conceivably you could learn about them
there's nothing self contradictory and
assuming that we might even come to
understand those bounds within the
domain of reasonable questions there is
a naturalistic approach that doesn't
appear to raise any questions of
principle at least beyond those of the
Natural Sciences generally and has some
sometimes far-reaching sometimes
surprising results about human language
faculty about its nature about its
acquisition about some of the ways in
which the mechanisms are available and
sometimes put to use these so far at
least progress along these lines has
mostly been at the computation
representational level and entirely
there are many questions that we can
formulate but we can begin to answer
some of them are doubtless quite real
which don't understand enough some are
perhaps only apparently real maybe
pseudo questions on a par with how the
things work or why do they happen
questions that have the form of
questions but only indicate areas of
inquiry and there are many different
kinds of mentioned a few one has to
somehow be able to avoid those and
identify and focus on the real questions
the ones that yield a successful
productive line of research inquiry we
know of some cases there are others
where we remain pretty much in the
domain of mystery
you
I think there's a mics around if anybody
wants to there and there
three back
yeah I see the University of North
Carolina I just wanted to ask you
whether you have any evidence that the
lexicon is in fact distinct from the
mental computational representational
complex or our lexical representations
also computational are the is the
lexicon separate from the computational
apparatus well it depends I think it's
not so much a question as a matter of
bookkeeping the it's all computational
representational okay but the question
is whether the computational
representational system falls into two
radically different categories in terms
of its properties and its
characteristics and so on and that seems
to be the case that is the lexicon seems
to have it does have computational
properties but they look very different
from those of the which call sometimes
called syntax now there are some real
questions there at some very interesting
questions for example take a take a word
like say shell as in John shell the
books meaning John put the books on the
Shelf doesn't literally name that but it
means something kind of close to that
shelve is a word and the question is as
the in the real world the world in your
head and in my head is does our
computational system reach into the
lexicon pull out the word shelve stick
it in the position of in that position
or does it take some much more abstract
representation and form John shelfie
book and there's evidence of the latter
kind in that case interesting and subtle
evidence so in that kind of sense some
of the things that we might in advance
think of as being a lexicon we might
have
we're on Glee place maybe they aren't in
the lexicon but it does seem that we're
FS seem very plausible to believe there
is a fundamental conceptual distinction
between an array of elements they're to
be picked out and a computational
procedure which picks them out and does
things with them what's in that array
that's open to question for example does
it include the word shell does it
include the word break as in John broke
the window or is that formed by some
operation and similarly for lots of
other cases so it's short the choice of
what's in it is not entirely clear by
any means but the conceptual distinction
looks reasonably clear and that in the
sense that there just isn't any other
coherent account of what goes on
yeah
I'd like to ask you a less technical
question perhaps the plunge tell us
anything about language to puns Coons
for example if I said professor Chomsky
doesn't like my language you know are
you referring to maybe the curses I've
heaped on somebody or the language I'm
using or the particular language I speak
or whatever do these occur in all
languages or some and particularly I'm
wondering if there's any significance to
why some people like them and some
people hate them those are all perfectly
real questions but over there they have
the form of questions let me say but
it's not clear that they are yet real
questions I mean so like one could ask
would observations of the moon taken
from Jupiter be useful evidence about
physics maybe you know let's try it
you've got to show that it is there's no
way of knowing in advance what kind of
phenomena are useful evidence things
become useful evidence when somebody can
figure out what to do about them as far
as puns are concerned notice that they
have to do with language use not with
language itself you can't really ask
whether every language has puns you can
only ask whether every language user has
does use puns or whether every language
user has the capacity to use funds puns
if that capacity has probably awakened
the answer to the second question is
probably yes the answer the first one's
probably no it's not clear what we learn
from that what makes something upon
might or might not be illuminating
you'll only know when somebody gives the
answer like any other kind of phenomenon
under a theory of universal languages in
which all languages are essentially the
same how would you approach the
traditional claim that in in every
language there are certain words that
are considered to be untranslatable and
that sometimes there are entire works of
literature such as the Quran which are
considered to be untranslatable well you
can't really answer that because the
notion of translatable doesn't mean
anything it's a little bit like the
notion refer at what level are you
translating something properly like when
you hear me say John is painting the
house Brown and you're interpreting what
I say are you giving a translation or a
different interpretation there's no
answer to that question that's like is
London near Cambridge you know the
question only has answers relative to
certain specific human concerns relative
to certain kinds of human concerns a
sentence in one language in say my
language may or may not be translatable
into your language I may have different
associations I may embed it in a
different array of interests and
understanding and so on but we have no
question so you can't give an answer I
don't know are certain things that you
can give answers to there are other
questions which where the which just
aren't answerable for the kinds of
reasons I mentioned you similar you
couldn't say whether they're like
answering the question what makes a
feather fall on a particular course or
even worse questions than that when
people talk about translate ability
they're talking about cultural wealth at
a level that goes way beyond this
discussion
I want to say that I always had trouble
when I was growing up learning the
difference between Elson and home so I
don't know if I got it in one pass
alright yup I doubt that very much
frankly I wanted you cut you kind of a
during your talk you'd assimilated a
theory that the stimulus is impoverished
and we have to construct it internally
to Descartes and referred in passing to
behaviorism and plug that I sort of had
the opposite sort of take on the issue
that that you know why why is it taking
so why is it takes so much stimulus to
sort of get for a child to learn the
concepts linguistic concepts and I was
wondering if you would comment on say
other theories of the that involve rich
stimuli I'm thinking of ecological real
Gibson's ecological realism and why is
it not as naturalistic approach why is
it not naturalistic to look for
properties in the environment say
properties environment that would
correspond to a container object instead
of saying that that structure is in the
in a language faculty well the problem
with that is that you can it's pert you
can probably will say that houses those
things in the environment have all the
properties that I mentioned that's true
houses are the physical thing out there
is from one is at on the one it has the
property of eliciting a point of view
which says you're just an exterior
surface and it has the property of
eliciting the point of view that says
you're an exterior surface plus a
distinguished interior with abstract
properties and has all of those
properties must have in fact it has
exactly the properties that enabled me
to think about it in that way but the
trouble is it also has every other array
of properties now has a new array of
properties you like if I design a
different organism that decides to look
at a house with a distinguished interior
surface
the you know some other property you
know the exterior plus things ten feet
away
has that property to so you're back to
the question why do I pick out that set
of properties and the only answer to
that short of you know design
intervention has got to be that it's
coming from inside me so we're back to
the same theory there's only the
appearance of a different approach there
that's self delusion
there seems to be an assumption
underlying your theory of natural
language that there is a close link
between the signifier and the signified
that I guess to use your analogy to
Dakar that when you and I both look at
this figure we both see a perfect
triangle that you're not seeing a
triangle and I'm seeing a square one
thing that I'm interested in if you if
you do agree that this is an assumption
that underlines the that underlies this
why do you make that assumption because
it's true and also I mean it's
overwhelmingly supported but not you
know it's not always true in every
possible case but in the case of in de
cartes case you know look at the
triangle it's true but you can
demonstrate it in the laboratory how do
you respond them to say post structural
theories to come from a radically
different assumption well if I
understood what they were talking about
I guess I could respond but not
understanding what they're talking about
most of the time I can't respond and if
somebody can make a coherent can present
to me I mean I won't say that I don't
understand anything I mean there are
some things that I read and they kind of
evoke images and associations in my mind
that I can sort of make up a story and
say well it probably means that it
usually turns out to be something pretty
obvious such as the fact that your
interpretation of a text depends on you
know all sorts of things that you're
bringing to it or that the environment
you know that the history is bringing to
it and so on and so forth sure that's
obvious
when I try to understand something to
try to form something
obvious I can't find it maybe that's my
defect like maybe I'm lacking a gene or
something but anyway when I read it
that's what happens I should also say
that I have you know there are a lot of
things in the world I don't understand
so for example if I pick up a latest
issue of the Physical Review and I read
one of the articles in it or you know
some set theory journal I'm not going to
understand that either but there's a
radical difference between these cases
in the case of the physical review first
of all I know that if I made the effort
I could get to understand it and I know
what course to undertake to get closer
and closer to understanding it I've done
it in cases which I happen to be
interested in furthermore I know that I
can go to my friend in the physics
department and say look this looks like
total gibberish to me explain it to me
at my level of ignorance and stupidity
so that I'll be able to understand that
he can do that you know on the other
hand when I try this with a page of
Derrida nobody can explain to me what it
means and I don't know what process to
go through to get it to the other than
just words spitting around on the page
so maybe it's some more variety of human
intellectual achievement that goes
beyond quantum physics and set theory
and all these other things but anyhow it
does look qualitatively different to
that as I say hey that's my defect
that's why I can't answer the questions
dr. Tomsky if I understand correctly
your you hypothesize the natural
language that kind of functionality in
the brain and what we actually speak is
a kind of a simple epiphenomena on top
of that and that the actual language is
more complex and rich than we actually
ever use do you have any hypothesis and
how all this excess capacity came to be
there yeah so and it just seems to be a
fact that our language capacities
involve I mean some things just seem to
be factually correct say that there are
garden path sentences there are
sentences which are aligned the
mechanisms of our mind assign to them a
certain set of properties but when we
perceive the sentence we don't our
interpretive capacity doesn't doesn't
assign them those properties we have to
go through some other course of inquiry
using our scientific capacities and so
on to notice that discrepancy there seem
to be things like that and that just
looks well-established so why did it
happen you know why did we get this
system that's like asking how we got
anything else why'd we get a circulatory
system why do we have arms you know very
virtually nothing is known about those
questions I mean you know there's things
known at the very you know there's
something known about why a mixture of
simple gases with an electrical spark
going through it can ultimately turn
into something remotely like a not
really like but the beginnings of a
bacterium I'm at that level some things
are understood and they understood
because the physical laws involved are
more or less grass there are things
understood some of things understood
about the basic forms that exist in you
in life you know bilateral symmetry you
know there's some biophysical things
that are understood more or less but
when you ask why particular organs exist
you can't say any you can say some weak
things you can say that things won't be
around if they're harmful to
reproduction because then they'll die
off through natural selection that you
can say and you can say a few other
things you can say some things about
population genetics and so on
but you can't say anything much about
these topics and in fact you know I
don't think serious evolutionary
biologists have any doubts about this if
you want to get a good picture of it
from the point of view of one of the
best I have a look at Richard Lewontin
x' article on the evolution of cognition
in the third volume of the Encyclopedia
of cognitive sciences that was published
edited by Daniel Ashur's and other
people by published by MIT press a year
or so ago where he goes on to give I
think a very plausible argument as to
why not only do we know nothing about
the evolution of cognition but it's not
even clear that there's a question there
that we can ask seriously I mean the
reason why we have the kinds of systems
we do in the brain is probably because
that's the way physics works you know as
he says pretty reasonably for all we
know when the brain reaches a certain
level of maybe you know the brain may
have gotten very big in order to do
things like to take a semi joke which he
gives the cool of blood no and it could
have been a thermo regulator it's not
impossible like Aristotle thought that
the brain was a thermal regulator cool
the blood that's why you got so much
blood flowing around when it reached a
certain scale and complexity because of
the way physics works and biology works
and so on it just had certain properties
and one of those properties could have
been you know sort of ability to solve
some kind of problems or a language
capacity or something else if cognitive
capacities are like other things in the
biological world that's probably the
right kind of answer now you know once
some of those capacities were around
it's conceivable that they contributed
to differential reproduction in which
case you wouldn't
and have more individuals around with
those properties but as he points out
even that isn't very reasonable I mean
if you remember that most of human
evolution was sort of small
hunter-gatherer societies you know
little groups of people who are sort of
foraging around than the for food and
trying to avoid saber-toothed Tigers and
things like that and as Lawton points
out and if you want to consider you can
construct all kind of fairy tales and
stories about this he says well how
about the following fairy tale how about
the one that says that you were more
likely to live and hence reproduce if
you were dumber and less imaginative now
this is he points out there's some
plausibility to that I mean if you've
got a group of hunter-gatherers and one
of them happens to be courageous and you
know imaginative and he wants to try to
see where that saber-toothed tiger is
going and so on he'll probably hit he's
more likely to get killed
now his presence in the tribe really
helped the tribe survive but his genes
are going to be transmitted because he's
more likely to get killed the ones were
more likely to survive or the Windsors
cleverly sitting at home and waiting for
him to kill the tiger and bring in the
food so maybe there's selection for
stupidity and for lack of imagination
and so on so that then you get the
opposite of the development of cognitive
development as he points out that's as
good a fairy tale as any other you know
and then in fact in this domain we
really are talking about fairy tale the
richness you describe in language that
sounds like it's something that's in in
the logical system and what's in the
brain is an imperfect ability to follow
that the brain has developed all sorts
of capacities many of which are never
put to use I mean we just know that for
a fact um let's say take the take
another capacity which is more or less
well understood the number faculty
that's you know that's simplest like the
language faculty you got to know what a
number is in order to
anything about numbers how does a child
know that after it's taught the count is
six but there's going to be another one
you know why did it end there let's say
and you know how do you have the
capacities that enable you to comprehend
what a prime number is if you get that
four well those capacities whatever
there are they can't be learned because
you just think through the logic of it
you can't learn an already have them the
usual story but those capacities were
present in the human species long before
they were ever used in fact there are
human societies today and their entire
Witcher have the same genes we do in
every relevant respect which in their
entire hundreds of thousands of years of
history have never used it although you
can quickly evoke the capacity and those
species as soon as you present you know
you sort of give them right stimulations
so these capacities are just sitting
there you know waiting I mean why are
they there well probably because they're
piggybacking on some other capacity like
it's been argued that they're
piggybacking on the language capacity
I'm going to curious fact about
languages it has this odd property of
discreet infinity it's a digits and
infinite digital system which is
extremely rare in the biological world
so it and that's like the number faculty
so maybe the number of faculty is just
kind of an abstraction from the
linguistic faculty that doesn't look at
it's complicated properties and just
looks at its basic structure well that's
a nice fairytale maybe true and if so
you'd have a number of faculty around
long you know without any without ever
being used and there could be lots of
other faculties like that I mean the
chances are just none kind of grounds of
biological plausibility that if there is
a faculty sitting there that would
contribute to reproductive success if
you used it chances are it will be used
and that's just on grounds of
plausibility you know over a couple
hundred thousand years somebody would
have tried it and they would have
succeeded and so on and so forth
but that's about the level of what you
can say in these area
a little while ago a fairly well-known
neural network person whose name escapes
me now came here and compared rule-based
systems to what he did not using a
chemistry physics analogy but an analogy
and I'm not an astronomer but something
about an older mathematics for figuring
out orbits that was fairly accurate but
it didn't really describe the physics of
what happened to a newer mathematics
that's more accurate and actually
showing that really happened that's I
know it's a pretty big and vague
question but if any kind of answer to
that well on no network systems I mean
there's nothing general to say I mean
it's like any other mathematical
conception you can just ask does it you
know does it doesn't neuron that does
the particular neural network very
abstract notion question is does it does
it abstract from this physical thing
above your neck properties relevant to
some particular question that's what you
asked so in fact you ask the same
question about it that you asked about
any computational representational
system us suppose somebody says well I
think the representations of the brain
are in first-order predicate calculus
using the notations of coins
mathematical logic okay that's an
empirical hypothesis and then you can't
ask a general question you can just say
well is it true let's ask whether it's
true and the same about some particular
neural network proposal now in the there
are some areas where which I don't have
enough knowledge about to make judgments
like some aspects of you know peripheral
visual perception were people whose
judgment I trust tells me that these
models have some success there is
nothing to talk about in the case of
language as far as I know there's
nothing there's simply nothing to talk
about you know that you can't point to
something but that has any success so
you can't know whether there's any point
to pursuing this or not maybe there is a
point nobody's figured out how to do it
or maybe there's no point but it has no
prior plausibility you know it's based
on the assumption that this particular
way of abstracting from physical systems
is a good way well you know there are
endless numbers of ways of abstracting
from physical systems and in fact as I
mentioned we don't even wear even at all
sure that we know what properties of
these physical systems are the relevant
ones to pick out for abstraction so what
you can do is look at someone's
particular proposal I mean I really
actually don't agree with him but the
point he was making that I wondered if
you had a response to was he felt that
then his mathematics were very closely
modeling what was really happening in
the brain and that made them somehow
superior to a model that didn't have
that well legitimacy could know that you
you could be right he could be wrong but
the only way to answer the question is
to have a look at his mathematics to see
what the explanatory formwork is and
what the empirical successes are that's
the question in the case as far as
language is concerned I don't know of
anything to look at
yeah
I'm just looking for some illumination
on one point where you were saying that
the idea of a shared language is
unnecessary
I sort of hit a wall on that let's say
you need do we have a shared language it
would it would seem so
why would are you and I do you and I
look alike in certain aspects a well we
have a shared language in certain
aspects - okay and the trouble is
there's no you know there's no topology
of those aspects that means anything so
it's it's more like what we think of as
shared a language we don't really think
of it would be just aspects of the thing
that you call why would you sell things
as being near each other - relative to
particular interests we think of things
as being near each other like you know I
have live in Lexington in the next town
over is Arlington and I think of
Arlington as being here Lexington but
there's no answer to the question is
Arlington your Lexington it depends on
your interest at the moment but now from
the point of view if we have the purpose
of getting along pretty well without too
much trouble
you and I share the same language
because we're going to be able to do it
if there's somebody out there who's
native languages Japanese and he starts
talking Japanese to me I'm not going to
be able to do it so from a point of view
of that particular human interest we can
impose a kind of metric on the system if
we like pick some other interest you'll
do it differently it's very much like
being here I mean suppose I ask the
question is John almost home there isn't
any answer to that in general question
is relative to what interest so these
things are just on a sliding scale and
don't fall neatly into categories
something I'm going neatly aren't going
to any categories okay there are like
hype categories I mean people differ in
height you know all over
place if your interest is putting
together a professional basketball team
then you might say well there's two
categories you know above seven feet and
below seven feet or something but if you
have some other interest you'll do it
differently there's no answer to the
question what are the height categories
it's just a not a sensible question and
the same is true about common languages
now we get easily diluted about that
because there are things around like
oceans and conquests and national TV and
so on which impose you know which do
impose a kind of topology if you like
but you know that's has nothing to do
with the nature of the language faculty
if you go to parts of the world where
these factors haven't operated quite the
same you just get any mess you like I do
understand that a little better now
thank you
yeah oh right yes the hope nation doubt
they are saying uh maybe uh trees are
not analogical like you said my lease is
excellent me hit and I can find some
other examples in Chinese you see if I
say he almost didn't come to the same as
he almost didn't he almost can versus he
almost didn't come notice again it was
negation and yes standard a negative
type ya means that they express the same
thing and also that's illogical so how
to deal with this phenomenon in your
competition mental conditional system to
deal with we just observe it it's like
dealing with the fact that you know that
you're standing next to a chair it's
just the fact I mean we can kind of
explain it I can explain the fact that
you're standing there you wanted to say
something now when we explain this
partially on the grounds that are
interpretive mechanisms simply block
when they're faced with certain kinds of
semantic structures and we can find some
of those blockages like the presence of
anything of a in any way a negative
character like the word mess is a
typical case try try to ask both suppose
that you go somewhere every Christmas
let's say you go home every Christmas
and you usually see some friend of yours
and you didn't see me last year and this
year and you want to say I kind of
expected you to see you last year and I
didn't do you say I missed seeing you
last year or I missed not seeing you
last year nobody knows the answer to
that question I mean there's gotta be an
answer it's determined by the semantics
of our language but nobody
get out and we sort of and the reason is
that words like Miss have a sort of a
negative aspect to them and which is not
well equipped to compute debt that's why
students that's why people have such a
rotten time doing proposition
propositional calculus is one of the
hardest things to do this most
elementary part of mathematics
absolutely trivial you can construct an
algorithm with children you know solve
every problem in principia mathematica a
fraction of a second but try and give it
to a professional mathematician they
have a horrible time with it we're not
well equipped to do those problems just
like rats aren't well equipped to run
mazes if another question hmm I still
remember your famous sense like a
colorless green ideas sleep furiously
and many people claims that it is
syntactic right but this mentally wrong
makes no sense but a cadastre that is
politically right if you say it in an
appropriate context like if somebody
asks me what I didn't do to you tonight
I just posit colors cooing ideas lips
fiercely you can use in all kind of ways
for example it could be a code which
says drop the bomb tomorrow that would
be perfectly correct usage of it and
there's nothing you know any
the human action could possibly have any
all sorts of ranges of any signal that
we can produce could be used for all
kinds of purposes depending on tacit
agreement sir explicit agreements and so
on the question is what are the
properties of that expression where all
the properties of that expression in
fact see here incidentally is a case
where the unification problem actually
the unification issue actually provides
some insight from a computational
representational point of view there are
some theories which tell you what the
properties of that expression are when
we look at evoked potentials it turns
out that again some correlations so
expressions of that type that's
interesting that tells us that you know
from two different points of view
looking at the brain we find a
categorization that comes out the same
that's interesting but the general
question you know is it a sentence of
the language that is no meaning I mean
you know there's probably good sense in
which an expression of Chinese is a
sentence of English if you would I don't
know a word of Chinese but if you were
to say something in Chinese using my
language capacity I would have signed a
certain interpretation to it
automatically for example I would
distinguish it from the screeching of a
door now suppose that there's a guy over
here whose language is Swahili and he
listens to you that person will assign
probably a different interpretation to
it okay which means that his language
and my language each assigned some
interpretation to a sentence of Chinese
namely with whatever properties it has
I have to clarification questions I
wanted to ask the first is about the
nature of the language universals as you
define them I'm a little bit unclear on
ease and I was hoping you could answer
this question about how we are to
interpret them as laws no language laws
this is an example you gave you said
that in the two sentences he thinks John
is a genius and John thinks he is a
genius that in the second one key the
pronoun can refer also to the subject
whereas in the first one the pronoun he
cannot refer to John referentially
dependent on the subject my accident
happened to refer to the same person but
it's not our intention in using it to
have he to assign he the reference of
Junon and he thinks that John is
intelligent all right al seems to be
universal all right that's okay now do
you feel that if I were to create some
sort of environment for a language user
where I consistently violated this
universal rule and made the reference of
the pronoun dependent on the name would
that person evolve in such a way or
would they acquire the language in such
a way that they would use this they
would substitute the ruler are you
saying that this is a rule that in fact
we couldn't really answer that if you
think about it you already know you know
that rule without any experience you
will be it's not that as a child you try
to do it the wrong way and your mother
said that's not the way we do it okay
but if I tried to make my child do it
the wrong way would they grow up being
able to desert you could probably raise
your child to speak propositional
calculus you know I mean it won't be it
may be you can raise your child not to
you
it's language faculty but to use other
faculties of mine the second question I
had was about your budget you could
raise you know you could raise a child
to crawl instead of walk
I didn't say walk on four-legged or
instead of walk and probably couldn't
maybe would end up doing that and lose
the fascinating walk just with me using
that family I wanted to ask you about
the performance structures versus a
language and you said that someone could
have a language but not have the
performance structures with which to
manifest it in principle idea
I would rather doubt that that's
biologically possible but you know you
could you could imagine as a conceptual
possibility so usually a sharp
distinction between language and
language usage which would almost
account for sort of innate ISM where
somebody who never had any sort of
capacity could still have a language but
we all accept that I mean that's not
even a question so for example suppose
that suppose that say I have a stroke
let's say and I completely lose the
ability to use English I can't say a
word I can't understand the thing okay
that happens and suppose that the
effects of the stroke are overcome let's
say by drug or just through time and so
on and in the peer in which the effects
are gonna overcome I don't hear anything
I had no experience well if they're
successfully overcome the effects of
this drug procedure I think the right
kind of drug or something I hope
which blonde in fact even happens
recover my ability to use English I now
let's look at me during the period when
I didn't have the ability did I have
knowledge of English well the answer has
got to be yes otherwise how come as the
effects of the stroke receded or I took
the drug I ended up knowing English and
not Japanese and having experience
during that period so how come it came
out elvish not Japanese whereas if it
had been my monolinguals Japanese friend
had the stroke under the same
circumstances he would have ended up
knowing English those are real things
were not inventing them well what can i
that notes during the period it was
neither of us had any ability whatsoever
we both had some sort of cognitive
system namely a cognitive system that we
couldn't use at all and later we
regained the capacity to use it and not
sure that we already had it well suppose
we have another guy he has a stroke and
he never recovers but let's say autopsy
shows those were some sophisticated
brain science of the future autopsy
shows that that guy has all the same
brain structures that I do in the
relevant parts of the language faculty
well it would be only reasonable to
assume that that person retained the
knowledge too that we would have
absolutely no empirical evidence for it
from behavior that's just normal science
is hard to think of an alternative
account of this in fact I think we're
always we just automatically assume it
what we say is that no in ordinary
language we say that you know you're the
people with the stroke know the language
but they can't use it and they may be
able to access that knowledge as the
effects of the stroke recede in which
case they will be able to use it
furthermore that ordinary description
seems almost forced on us unless again
you resort to miracles I mean you have
the account attempt the problem with
explaining why I recover English and my
friend over there recovers Japanese even
though neither of us has any evidence
why didn't it work out the other way
around
I recover Japanese and he recover
English I should say that this issues
come up in the philosophical literature
people like say I think any human
victims die answer various types of
wanted to crown that knowledge is
ability have given some very strange
answers to this kind of question which
in fact and want to inventing a new kind
of ability different from the usual kind
which is invested with all the
properties of knowledge that doesn't get
us anywhere yes sir I would dumb over
here I would like to ask a question like
know if there's any evidence that the
the real the world can influence or
inform or change the actual or the
phenomenological for example or for
instance the can the signifiers we use
to stand for the the spoken signifiers
we use to stand for the noise dog makes
um actually inform the noise that we
hear that the dog makes you know very
good I mean may very well be true like
it may be that you know we hear roosters
saying cockadoodledoo and some other
language they hear him saying cuckoo
Riku maybe you could even show that in
an experiment but I would I don't know
of any experimental results but I would
imagine it would be true thank you very
much
um
every time I hear about your assertion
that certain principles of language are
innate I can't get over my response that
that seems an explanation of sorts of
last resort
and I keep wanting to think to think to
say instead that we have not yet figured
out how we can extract those principles
from experience and that's a common
reaction and I think it's an interesting
fact that people have that reaction so
it's very in fact what you're saying is
very characteristic and it's an
interesting fact about the intellectual
culture which goes back hundreds of
years and notice that you have I assume
we would have a very different reaction
to say let me ask you the following
question suppose that as far as I'm
aware nobody knows anything about the
biological factors involved in puberty
okay I suppose that somebody comes along
and says and also as far as I'm aware
every embryo in every developmental
biologist assumes that puberty is
basically programmed I mean it'll happen
or you know when it'll happen can effect
be affected by a nutritional level or
something and so on suppose somebody
came along and said well that's an
explanation of last resort it really
results from peer pressure but we just
haven't figured it out yet I mean it
really results from the fact that you
know the these young people ten years
old see their friends going through
puberty and they want to be like
everyone else that's why they're doing
it okay well you know that's conceivable
now the point is when you make that
proposal everybody laughs when you make
the comprable pros a proposal about
anything sort of above the neck to put
it metaphorically everyone thinks is
very reasonable
now the question is what's the
difference why do we think it's
ridiculous in one case and plausible in
the other case as far as more of the
evidence
about the same in fact the evidence for
an eighth structure is probably better
for things above the neck because there
were not a total ignorance you actually
have some four strong proposals about
the innate principles and some
explanatory force to them too
so by the standards of the sciences at
least we have more reason to believe in
the innate principles of both of the
neck and below the neck and in fact they
also did in 17th century the one case
that I mentioned if you go through it
works marking messing about they card
and Hume as an example of that now there
were some phenomena around everyone
agreed on a phenomenon there was very
strong evidence by the criteria the
science Sciences to take take arts
solution that it's you need that's why
it happens nevertheless the long-term
consequences were acceptance of Joan's
solution with its self reputation that
we don't have the concept of a straight
line now I think that reflects that same
strange intuition that people have above
the neck will insist that everything's
got to be experience below the neck
we're quite willing to accept the idea
that everything is the way any rational
person would think if you have things
that happen without information it must
be coming from inside and I think the
question is why the dualism well if
there were any rational support for it
you could look at that argument but
there isn't any what it comes down to is
exactly the feeling that you express and
that's the standard opinion so we have
to ask a question about irrational
attitudes why this particular irrational
attitude that's what it is and you could
have various speculations about it and
not my extra Frank opinion is that it's
a reflection of a kind of something
which also showed up in traditional
dualism so I mean as humans it's very
natural to think of people as having a
mind and a body which are separate and
the problem that had to connect them you
know traditional non body dualism was
very commonsensical I think it's
probably is the way we taught to think
about people that's why we would
someone as being the same person if
their body underwent all you know what
we call their body will underwent all
sorts of changes but we will think of
them as a different person if you rang
coded their brains and they had somebody
else's memories and language and
thoughts and so on okay that's just the
way we look at people and it's very hard
to get out of it just like it's very
hard to look at the Sun setting and to
tell to tell yourself it's not setting
the Earth's turning
I mean you sort of know that at some
level but there's no way for you to look
at that and stop seeing it as the Sun
setting you just can't and I think when
we look at people it's extremely hard
for us to look at them and not see them
as Minds inside bodies well traditional
dualism metaphysical dualism collapsed
for scientific reasons but that doesn't
mean we can get out of our skins we
still look at people this way and I
think we're as replace traditional
dualism is a kind of an epistemological
dualism
which comes out pretty much like this it
says below the neck I mean that
metaphorically like you know on the
things that people call physical we're
willing to pursue the methods of the
sciences and if they lead us to conclude
that things are internally programmed
we'll accept it above the neck we're
going to be completely irrational we're
going to insist on what we would never
dream of in the case of things that are
fall on our side of the intuitive
boundary physical and I think that's
probably correct I don't see any other
way of explaining this strange
phenomenon for the last hundred to
several hundred years that the very that
even that the very same kind of evidence
in fact even better evidence then that
which would make us laugh about puberty
and peer pressure has made people think
we can't do that in the case of mental
activity if there's another explanation
oh not but I think we're in the domain
of trying to account for irrational
human beliefs
is that it does seem to me that when I
ask linguists this question I really
appreciate your full answer because very
often I get the answer if you won't even
accept what I say that far then we have
no grounds to continue to discuss you
the right answer now why should you
accept what any linguist says for that
matter with any physicist says I mean if
a physicist if you asked let's take my
hypothetical story about you know
opening up this month's Physical Review
and my looking at an article which looks
to me like gibberish and I go over to
the physics department and I ask some
friends over there tell me what it's
about if he just says look take my word
for it
then I don't trust him I mean I may
decide he's a postmodern theorists you
know if what he tells me is if he does
what in fact he can do you know find my
level of ignorance and give me some
account at my level of ignorance which
will introduce me to what's going on and
even explain to me a plausible way in
which I could go further then we're in
business and I think you would have the
same reaction to those linguists I don't
think all this stuff is that deep you
know it's not physics it's much simpler
than that and it seems to me the you
know it should be possible to give
answers at the level of understanding of
anybody I mean I've talked about these
topics in junior high
