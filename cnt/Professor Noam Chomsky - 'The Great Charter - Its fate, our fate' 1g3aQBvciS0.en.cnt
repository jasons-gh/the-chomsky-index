ladies and gentlemen warm welcome to all
and my apologies those of you who are on
time and a very good seats in the
Buchanan but it didn't see they're not
let as many people as possible have the
experience this oxygen so I I appreciate
for errands Gordon and as payback I'm
going to 40 the bottom person
introduction don't see that I had
prepared because it is absolutely about
he does not need any introduction we are
never this said the state of the
reactions of this nature is completely
unprecedented so involved in patient
long enough so and definitely without
further ado give you professor Noam
Chomsky
first let's just always is in a hurry
and I usually halfway through will start
telling them they have heard of words as
you all know the university was founded
reading about that time of the 200th
anniversary of the one of the great
events in the establishment of civil and
human rights the issuance of Magna Carta
looking down the road only a few
generations the millennium of myocardial
will ride whether it will be celebrated
or more or ignored is not all clear that
should be a better serious immediate
concern I think the reason is that what
we do now fela food that will determine
what kind of the world will greet that
event and it's not an attractive
frustrated with the present tendencies
persist and not least because the Great
Charter is being shredded before our
eyes the first scholarly edition of
Magna Carta was published by the amateur
blackstone and it wasn't easy task there
was no good text available as he wrote
when the by eight the Charter has been
unfortunately gone by brass comment that
carries the rats left unfinished by
stylus edition includes to charge the
title was the Great Charter in the
treasure of the forest the first Great
Charter is the charter of Liberty
instance widely recognized as the
foundation of the fundamental rights and
english-speaking people's or as Winston
Churchill hooded more expansively the
Charter every self-respecting man at any
time in any land Churchill was actually
referring specifically to the
reaffirmation of the Charter by the
Parliament than the petition of right
imploring King Charles to recognize that
the law is so not the King Charles the
greedy briefly but soon by the his flesh
set the stage for the murderous civil
war with the restoration the charter of
liberties
prominent place that one of the leaders
of parliament Andrew that Dane was
beheaded on the scaffold bang try to
read a speech announcing the seconds as
a violation I departed but he was
drowned out of a trumpet to ensure that
such scandals words would not be heard
by the cheering crowd of a major crime
had been in traffic petition calling on
people his words the original of all
just power and civil society not King my
god that was the position that had been
strongly indicated by red womens the
founder of the first free society what's
now the state of Rhode Island in the
United States his heretical views
influence Milton unlock the Williams
actually went much further than they did
he found that the modern doctrine of
separation of church and state which is
still much contestant even the liberal
democracies at least the United States
shortly after the band's execution King
Charles granted a royal charter to the
robot on plantations declaring that the
form of government is democratic and
furthermore declaring that the double
our freedom of conscience even for
biggest a Jew's hurts even Quakers who
were one of us feared and brutalized the
many sects that period of tribulation
all this is quite astonishing the
climate of the times a few years later
the Charter was enriched writing in his
Corpus Act of 1679 formerly entitled an
act to the better superior the Liberty
subject and for prevention of
imprisonment eon sees the US
Constitution which bar from English
common law of course affirms of quoting
it the writ of habeas corpus shall not
be suspended except in case of rebellion
or invasion and in a unanimous decision
the Supreme Court held with the rights
guaranteed by this act were considered
by the founders of the American Republic
as the highest safeguard of Liberty all
of these words should resonate today the
significance of the companion Charter
the Charter of the forest is no less
profound and perhaps even more pertinent
today actually these topics are explored
in some depth by Peter line boys rich
stimulating history of Magna Carta and
it's later trajectory the charter of the
forest demanded protection of the
Commons from external power came
time the Commons were the source of
Cessnas for the general population their
fuel food their construction materials
in fact everything that was necessary
for life and the forest was no primitive
wilderness it was carefully developed
over generations maintained in common
its riches available to all and
preserved for future generations those
are practices found today primarily in
traditional societies that are under
threat throughout the world the Charter
the forests imposed limits on
privatization the Robin Hood myths
capture the essence of its concerns and
it's not too surprising that the popular
British Brotherhood film that many of
you I'm sure have seen was written
anonymously by Hollywood screenwriters
who were blacklisted for leftist
convictions by the 17th century this
Charter had virtually disappeared it had
fallen victim to the rise of the
commodity economy and capitalist
practice and morality and with the
Commons no longer protected for
cooperative nurturing and use the rights
of the common people were restricted to
what could not be privatized it's a
category that continues to shrink to the
virtual invisibility fact it's now down
to pretty much area in Bolivia the
attempt to privatize water was beaten
back by an uprising that brought the
indigenous majority power for the first
in history about 10 years ago the World
Bank has just ruled a couple of days ago
that the mining multinational Pacific
Rim can proceed with its case against El
Salvador for trying to preserve flags
and communities from highly destructive
gold-mining environmental constraints
deprive the company of future profits
those are crimes that can be punished
under the rules of the investor rights
regimes that are mislabeled free trade
agreements now this is only a tiny
sample of struggles that are underway
all over the world some of them with
extreme violence perhaps the most
extreme is in eastern Congo where
millions of people have been killed in
recent years to ensure an apple supply
of minerals for your cell phones and
other uses and of course Apple profits
for those who are privatizing it the
rise of capitalist practice and morality
brought with it a radical revision of
how the Commons are treated and also how
they're conceived so the prevailing view
today is capture captured by a
influential argument by Garrett Hardin
that the freedom in the Commons brings
ruin to us all that's the famous tragedy
of the Commons in other words what is
not owned will be destroyed by
individual avarice there was an
international counterpart to that that
was the concept of terra nullius it was
employed to justify the expulsion of
indigenous populations that the settler
colonial societies of the Anglosphere
offshoots of England their extermination
the founding fathers of the American
Republic described it sometimes with
remorse long after their own
participation criminal participation was
passed according to this useful doctrine
the Indians had no property rights since
they were just the allegedly Wanderers
and the untamed wilderness and the
hard-working British colonists that
could create value where there was none
by turning the wilderness to commercial
use in reality the colonists knew better
of course they were elaborate procedures
of purchase and the ratification both by
Crown Parliament later an old by force
when the ungrateful creatures resisted
extermination the doctrines often
attributed to John Locke but that's
dubious he was colonial administrator he
understood perfectly well what was
happening and there's no basis for the
attribution in his writings temporary
scholarship I think has shown that
convincingly the grim forecasts of the
tragedy of the Commons are not without
challenge 2009 the late to Elinor Ostrom
when the nobel prize in economics for
her work showing the superiority of user
managed fish stocks pastures woods lakes
and groundwater basins commons but the
conventional doctrine tragedy the
commons has forced if we accept its
unstated premise namely that humans are
blindly driven by avarice nothing else
no other aspects of their personalities
that's what American workers 150 years
ago
the Industrial Revolution called the new
spirit of the age gain wealth for
getting old but self like peasants and
workers in England before them american
workers bitterly denounced the Duke
spirit that was being imposed on them
regarding it as demeaning and
destructive an assault on the very
nature of free men and women and I
stress women among the most active and
vocal and condemning the destruction on
the of the rights and dignity of free
people by the capitalist industrial
system where the so called factory girls
the young women from the farms driven
into the regime of supervised and
controlled wage labor which at that time
was regarded as pretty much the same as
chattel slavery differing only from
actual slavery and that was temporary
that stand was considered so natural
hundred fifty years ago that it was a
slogan of the Republican Party it was a
banner under which northern workers
carried arms during the American Civil
War well that was under fifty years ago
in Scotland at the same time so I've
been informed it was pretty much saying
huge efforts have been devoted since to
Elk inculcating the new spirit of the
age there are major industries devoted
to the task public relations industry
advertising and marketing generally a
very large component of gross domestic
product of the economy they are
dedicated to with the great political
economist Thorstein Veblen quote
fabricating once in the words of
business leaders themselves the task
to direct people to the superficial
things of life like fashionable
consumption that way people can be
atomized separated from one another a
seeking personal gain alone diverted
from dangerous efforts to think for
themselves and to challenge authority
this process of shaping opinion
attitudes and perceptions that was
called engineering of consent by one of
the founders of the modern public
relations industry in 1920s it would
realize he's a respected Woodrow Wilson
Roosevelt Kennedy progressive much like
his contemporary walter Lippmann the
most prominent public intellectual of
20th century America and also a liberal
progressive he praised what he called
the manufacture of consent which he
called a new art and the practices
democracy both of them recognized
quoting them that the public must be put
in its place marginalized and control
for their own interests of course they
are too stupid and ignorant to be
allowed to run their own affairs so that
task must be left to the intelligent
minority and they must be protected from
the trampling of the roar that
bewildered heard the ignorant than
meddlesome outsiders the rascal
multitude if they were cooled by their
17th century predecessors just like you
protect the three-year-old from running
into the street while freedom the role
of general population is to be
spectators not participants in action in
a proper
functioning liberal democracy and the
spectators must not be allowed to see
too much President Obama and fact has
set new standards in safeguarding this
principle and protecting the spectators
from trying to understand what their
betters are doing that he has in fact
punished more whistleblowers than all
previous presidents combined it's a real
achievement for an administration that
came to office promising transparency
both famous cases WikiLeaks this case as
you know with British cooperation well
over time societies have become more
free than the resort to state violence
has become more constrained and it has
therefore been recognized that it's
urgent to devise more efficient methods
of control of attitudes and opinions
this is recognized for example by the
British Conservative Party 100 years ago
and it's very natural that the immense
public relations industry propaganda
industry basically developed was created
in the more free societies where it's
needed you don't need it so much if you
have the cudgel the US Britain the first
modern state propaganda agency was the
british ministry of information as it
was cold these ministries always have
were lillian named the
the British Ministry of Information was
formed about a century ago and in secret
it defined its task as to direct the
thought of most of the world actually
what they were interested in primarily
it was progressive American
intellectuals who had to be mobilized to
come to the aid of Britain during World
War one there was a u.s. counterpart
established by woodrow wilson midian
public information another Orwellian
title its goal was to drive a pacifist
population to violent hatred of all
things German with remarkable success so
for example the Boston Symphony
Orchestra wouldn't play beta
german-american a commercial advertising
pulsa deeply impressed others gurbles
was particularly admired and he adapted
it to Nazi propaganda Bolton
successfully the Bolshevik leaders have
also admired it and they tried but their
efforts were clumsy and ineffective ever
worked as well as the Nazis a primary
domestic task has been to keep the
public from our throats Ralph Waldo
Emerson describing the concern of
political leaders when the threat of
democracy was becoming harder
suppressant his day mid 19th century in
more recent years the activism of the
1960's elicited elite concerns of what
was called excessive democracy and kohls
for measure
to impose more moderation and democracy
that one particular concern was to
introduce better controls over what were
called the institutions responsible for
the indoctrination of the young the
schools of universities of churches
which were failing that essential task
actually including reactions to the
1960s from the left liberal end of the
mainstream spectrum that the liberal
internationalists who staffed the carter
administration their counterparts in
Europe and Japan the right wing was much
harsher one of the many manifestations
of this is the sharp rise in tuition
which has no basis on economic grounds
as i think is easily shown but the
device does however trap and control
young people by dead often for the rest
of their lives and it does contributes
to more effective discipline
indoctrination well pursuing these
topics farther who we see that
destruction of the charter of the forest
and its obliteration from memory barely
known today that relates rather closely
to continuing efforts to constrain the
promise of the charter of liberties in a
new spirit of the age cannot tolerate
the pre-capitalist conception of the
forest as the shared endowment of the
community at large cared for commonly
for the run use
for future generations protected from
privatization protected from the
transfer to the hands of private power
for service to wealth and profit not the
needs of the public that commoners and
earlier terms and inculcating the new
spirit of the age is an essential
prerequisite for achieving this end and
for preventing the charter of liberties
from being misused to enable free
citizens to determine their own fate the
most famous part of the charter of
liberties is article 39 which declares
that no free man shall be punished in
any way nor will we proceed against or
prosecute him except by the lawful
judgment of his peers and by the law of
the land through many years of struggle
progress and regression but through many
years of struggle the principle it's
come to hold more broadly so the US
Constitution which borrowed from Magna
Carta provides that no person shall be
deprived of life liberty or property
without due process of law and a speedy
and public trial by peers the basic
principle is what's called presumption
of innocence it's what legal historians
described as the seed of contemporary
anglo-american freedom referring to
article 39 and with the Nuremberg
Tribunal mind described as a
particularly American brand of legalism
punishment only for those who could be
proved to be guilty with a fair trial
through a fair trial with a panoply of
proceeding of procedural protections
even if their guilt for some of the
worst crimes in history who is not in
doubt as you may recall the Churchill
and others the one in just kill them and
the Americans dominated and insisted on
a kind of a fair trial many questions
you can ask about it some kind of a
trial at least the founders of the
American Republic of course did not
intend the term person to apply to
persons for example Native Americans
were obviously not persons their rights
are virtually nil they had the right to
be exterminated women were scarcely
persons the wives were understood by
Blackstone British common law are a law
to be covered term was under the civil
identity of their husbands in much the
same way as children were subject to
their parents including Blackstone the
very being or legal existence of the
woman has suspended during the marriage
or at least as incorporated and
consolidated into that of the husband
under whose wing protection and cover
she performs everything one of the
arguments in the United States were not
praying vote the women was it would be
unfair because the husband would get to
vote his
his property in fact in general women
were the property of the fathers and
their husbands those principles
incidentally extend right to the modern
period so for example until a US Supreme
Court decision of 1975 women in the
United States did not have a legal right
to serve on juries they were not pierced
so triggered and apply to them just two
weeks ago a Republican opposition bar
was called the fairness Patriot Act the
guaranteeing women equal pay for equal
work and in fact it goes far beyond
persons still the concept person hasn't
properly extended yet to women of course
slaves were not persons actually they
were three fifths human under the
Constitution so as to grant their owners
greater vote voting rights protection of
slavery was no small concern to the
founders of the American Republic it was
in fact one factor some legal historians
believe the major factor in leading to
the American Revolution reason for that
in 17 was cake famous case in 1772 the
Somerset case when where Lord Mansfield
determined that slavery is so odious his
word that it cannot be tolerated in
England although it continued to British
possessions for many years American
slave owners could see the handwriting
on the wall if they if the colonies
remained under British rule that would
apply to them and you have to one should
bear in mind that the slave states
Virginia had the greatest power and
influence in the American colonies one's
pretty much ran the way you can easily
appreciate dr. Johnson's famous quick
that we hear the loudest guilts for
Liberty among the drivers of new groups
post Civil War amendments extended the
concept person to african-americans
ending slavery in theory not in reality
there was a decade of relative freedom
but after that a condition akin to
slavery was reintroduced by a
north-south compact which permitted
effective criminalization of black life
so for example if a black man was found
standing on a street corner he could be
accused of vagrancy if somebody said he
is looking the wrong way at a white
woman it could be accused of attempted
rape and once they were prison that very
few chances of ever escaping the system
of slavery by another name it's the term
used by wall street journal bureau chief
Douglas Blackmon and quite arresting
studying recent study of this topic
bringing to light a lot of what was only
the corners of scholarship this new
version of the peculiar institution
provided much of the basis for the
American industrial revolution it
created a perfect workforce for the
steel industry Andrew Carnegie one of
your representatives and the mining
along with agricultural production and
famous chain gangs workforce that was
docile obedient no strikes no need for
employers even to sustain their workers
improvement over slavery the system
lasted in large measure until World War
2 then free labor was needed for war
production and then the came the
post-war boom that offered employment a
black man could get a job and unionized
auto plant earn a decent salary maybe
bye-bye house maybe send his children to
college that lasted for about 20 years
until the 1970s when there was a radical
redesign of the economy and I stress
design didn't happen by economic law was
it decisions the new redesigned on the
newly dominant the neoliberal principles
established over the world in the United
States that meant rapid growth of
financial institutions and authoring
after ducky well that meant that the
black population was largely superfluous
and not surprisingly it's been
recrimination rates in the United States
were within the spectrum of industrial
societies a little toward the high end
but not out of the spectrum by now far
beyond others like by far the greatest
in the world for any country that has to
this day the targets are primarily
blackmailed increasingly also black
women and Hispanics they're largely
guilty of
lyst crimes under the largely fraudulent
Greg worse to very little to do with
drugs but a lot to do with getting rid
of the specialist population and
counterinsurgency abroad meanwhile the
wealth of african-americans Mike
african-american families has been
virtually obliterated virtually down to
zero after the latest financial crisis
in those small measured thanks to the
criminal behavior of financial
institutions with of course infinity for
the perpetrators there now Richard more
powerful and ever getting critical ready
for the next crisis well if you look
over the history of african-americans
from the first arrival of slaves almost
500 years ago to the present they've
enjoyed the status of authentic persons
for a few decades one indication of what
a long way there is to go to realize the
promise of Magna Carta the post Civil
War amendments didn't grant the right of
persons to former slaves though mostly a
theory at the same time they created a
new category of persons persons with
rights corporations almost all the cases
brought to the Supreme Court under the
Fourteenth Amendment the main
and had to do with corporate right not
the rights of freed slaves and by
century ago the courts not legislation
but the courts had determined that
cokely's as the legal literature calls
the collectivist legal fictions which
are established and sustained by state
power corporations have the full rights
of persons of flesh and blood in fact
they have far greater rights because of
their scale their immortality and their
protections of limited liability in fact
by now their rights far transcend those
of middle earth humans under the
mislabeled free trade agreements as i
mentioned Pacific Rim consume El
Salvador for seeking to protect
communities in the environment that
individuals of course cannot that
General Motors can claim national rights
in Mexico there's no need to dwell on
what would happen if a Mexican demanded
national rights in the United States
domestically recent Supreme Court
rulings greatly enhance the already
enormous political power of corporations
of the super-rich and striking further
blows against the coterie relics of
functioning political democracy assume
you've been following that in recent
weeks meanwhile Magna Carta is under
more direct assault so recall again the
habeas Corpus Act of 1679 which in
particular barred imprisonment beyond
the seas and certainly of course bars
the far more vicious procedure of
imprisonment beyond the seas for the
purpose of torture what's now more
politely cold
rendition as when Tony Blair rendered
the Libyan dissident of the bill
Highlands now a leader three billion
rendered him to the mercies of Qaddafi
than a good friend or when US
authorities deported Canadian citizen
mehar RR to his native Syria for
imprisonment than the torture later
conceding that there was never any case
against it and many others very often
going through the Shannon Air Base which
did lead to courageous protests in
Ireland the concept of due process has
been extended under the Obama
administration's international
assassination campaign which is highly
held the Justice Department explained
that the constitutional guarantee of due
process of tracing back the Magna Carta
is satisfied by internal deliberations
within the executive branch and the
constitutional lawyer and the White
House breed with this that pink job
might have nodded with satisfaction this
issue arose after the murder of Anwar
al-awlaki he was accused of inciting
jihad and speech and writing and also
unspecified actions headline in the New
York Times captured the general elite
reaction when he was assassinated in a
drone attack along with the usual
collateral damage other citizens sitting
next to him couple other people the the
headline read the West celebrates a
clarence death that is the deliberate
murder of Clara
the wrong things there were some
eyebrows lifted and because he was an
American citizen and that does raise
questions about due process that which
are considered irrelevant when
non-citizens are murdered with the whim
of the executive and they're irrelevant
for citizens to under Obama
administration legal innovations well
what about presumption of innocence
that's also been given a new and useful
interpretation putting the New York
Times from the Justice Department mr.
Obama embraced a disputed method for
counting civilian casualties that did
little to box him in it in effect counts
all military-age males in the strike
zone as competence according to several
administration officials unless there is
explicit intelligence posthumously
proving them innocent so in other words
post assassination determination of
innocence maintains the sacred principle
of presumption of innocence would be
perhaps ungracious to recall the Geneva
Conventions foundation of modern
humanitarian international law they bar
the carrying out of executive executions
without previous judgment pronounced by
a regularly constituted court affording
all the judicial guarantees which are
recognized as indispensable by civilized
peoples wherever they may be the most
recent case most famous recent
of executive assassination was of course
Osama bin Laden was murdered after he
was apprehended by 79 naval seals you
know super special forces defenseless
accomplished accompanied only by his
wife his body was reportedly dumped at
sea without autopsy well whatever one
thinks of him he was a suspect and in
fact nothing more than that even the FBI
agreed I said they had any suspicions
that he was responsible for 911 in this
case celebration was overwhelming you
really had to look hard to find them a
question there were a few on the fringes
few questions about the Latin rejection
of the principle of presumption of
innocence that particularly when trial
was hardly impossible straightforward in
fact these criticisms were met with very
harsh condemnation and are pretty
interesting the most interesting one
that I saw was by respected young left
liberal political commentator matthew
Yglesias he explained on quoting him
that one of the main functions of the
international institutional order is
precisely to legitimate the use of
deadly military force by Western powers
okay so in his words it's amazingly
naive to suggest that the United States
should obey international law or other
conditions
we righteously demand of the week only
tactical objections can be raised to
aggression assassination cyber war or
other actions that the holy state
undertakes of course in the service of
mankind like their predecessors if the
traditional victims see the matter
somewhat differently that merely reveals
their moral and intellectual
backwardness and the occasional Western
critic who fails to comprehend these
fundamental truths can be dismissed as
silly Iglesias explains and cell he's
referring specifically to me and I
cheerfully fest night guilty perhaps the
most striking assault on the foundations
of the traditional liberties is a case
that's the whole known virtually
undiscussed was brought to the Supreme
Court by the Obama administration who
won with the help of the right wing
justices it's called over the
humanitarian law project if you want to
look it up the humanitarian law project
was condemned for providing what's
called material assistance to the
Kurdish PKK it's listed as a terrorist
group by the State Executive there were
rulings about material assistance but in
the past it meant providing weapons or
something like that but the Obama
administration extended material
assistance in this case to include but
specifically legal advice we have legal
advice to
that they designate as terrorists that's
material assistance the wording of the
ruling to read it appears to apply quite
broadly for example to discussions and
research inquiry that even advice to
keep the nonviolent means that's
material assistance justices explain why
the right-wing justices until they
didn't go quite as far as the Obama
administration wanted they wanted an
even more a severe attack on elementary
civil liberties well again there was a
marginal fringe of criticism but it's
interesting that even the limited
published criticism accepted the
legitimacy of the state terrorist list
these are arbitrary decisions by the
state executive with no recourse their
counterparts and other Western societies
the record of the terrorist list is of
some interest so for example in 1988 the
Reagan administration declared Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress to
be one of their words one of the more
notorious terrorist groups include
therefore Reagan couldn't continue his
support for the apartheid regime and its
murderous depredations at home
particularly in a burden countries as
part of his war on terror after 20 years
later Mandela was finally removed from
the terrorist list he now can traveled
in the United States without special
dispensation special waiver another
interesting cases Saddam Hussein it was
from the terrorist list in 1982 so that
the Reagan administration could provide
it with support for his invasion of Iraq
and thats part was quite significant in
Britain to its deadly support continued
well after the war ended in 1989
President Bush that's Bush number one
the good wish even invited the Iraqi
nuclear engineers to the United States
for advanced training in nuclear weapons
production well more information that
must be kept from the eyes of the
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders one of
the ugliest uses of the terrorist list
has to do with the tortured people of
Somalia immediately after September 11th
the United States closed down a Somali
charitable network brought a crowd on
the grounds that it was financing terror
if you look back you'll see that this
achievement was hailed as one of the
great successes of the war on terror on
to publicity in contrast the
Washington's withdrawal of the charges
is without merit barely was mentioned
but meanwhile things happened Alberta
 was responsible for about half of
the 500 million dollar remittances to
Somalia that's more than it earned from
any other economic sector and ten times
the amount of foreign aid that's valeo
received or into a UN
you the charity read major businesses in
Somalia which were all destroyed the
leading academic scholar of Bush's
so-called financial war on terror grant
Ward day he concludes that apart from
devastating the economy this frivolous
attack on a very fragile society that
may have played a role in the rise of
Islamic fundamentalists some other
familiar consequence of the so-called
war on terror actually the very idea
that the state should have the authority
to make such judgments is a serious
offense against the charter of liberties
as is the fact that it's considered
unconventional try to find a comment
about it and if the charters fall from
grace continues on the path of the past
few years of the future of rights and
liberties looks quite dim I think well
if you final words on the fate of the
charter of the forest recall that its
goal was to protect the source of
sustenance for the population the
Commons as they were then cold protect
them from external power in those days
royalty over the years enclosures other
forms of privatization by now predatory
corporations and the state authorities
who cooperate with them and are properly
rewarded and that damage is very broad
if we were to listen to voices from the
south today we could learn quoting that
the conversion of public goods into
private property through the
privatization of our otherwise commonly
held
environment is one way neo liberal
institutions remove the fat fragile
threads that hold African nations
together that politics today has been
reduced to a lucrative venture where one
looks mainly for looks out mainly for
returns on investment rather than on
what can contribute to rebuild highly
degraded environment communities and a
nation this is one of the benefits that
structural adjustment programs inflicted
on the continent the enthronement of
corruption quoting a Norwegian a
Nigerian poet and activist Nemo passage
is the chair of Friends of the Earth
International it's a searing expose of
the ravaging of Africa's wealth to cook
a continent the latest phase of the
Western torture of Africa goes way back
at first and tortured that has been
planned at the highest level ported to
recognize that and still is so at the
end of World War two the United States
of course held the position of
absolutely unprecedented global power
and not surprisingly careful and
sophisticated plans were developed about
how to organize the world each region
was assigned what was called its
function by State Department planners
they were headed by the distinguished
diplomat George Kennan and he determined
at the time that the United States had
no
so interesting Africa so therefore he
recommended that Africa should be turned
over to Europe to exploit his word for
the reconstruction of Europe in the
light of history one might have imagined
the different relations between Europe
and Africa but there's no trace of the
internal record that any of that kind as
they were considered well more recently
the United States has recognized that it
too must join in the game of exploiting
Africa and joined by other new entries
among the China which is busy work
compiling one of the worst records and
destruction of the environment the
oppression of its hapless victims it
should be unnecessary to dwell on the
extreme dangers posed by one central
element of the predatory obsessions that
are producing calamities all over the
world with the attack on the commons
namely the reliance on fossil fuels that
courts global disaster and perhaps addai
not too distant future details and be
debated but there are a little serious
doubt that the problems are serious if
not awesome and that the longer we delay
in addressing them the more awful the
legacy left two generations to come
there are some efforts to face reality
but there are much too major tomorrow
the Rio plus 20 conference opens with
meager aspirations and
even lesser expectations meanwhile power
concentrations are charging in the
opposite direction led by the richest
and most powerful country in world
history congressional Republicans are
now dismantling they limited
environmental protections that were
initiated by Richard Nixon who would be
something of a dangerous radical in
today's political scene the major
business lobbies quite publicly
announced their propaganda campaigns to
convince the public that there's no need
for undue concern admit some effect as
polls showed the media cooperate by not
even reporting the increasingly dire
forecasts of international agencies and
even of the US Department of Energy the
standard media presentation is a debate
between alarmists and skeptics alarmists
or virtually all qualified scientists
skeptics or a few holdouts definitely
not part of the debate is a very large
number of experts if far beyond the
skeptics includes as it happens the
climate change program at my own
University MIT among others these
skeptics that criticize the scientific
consensus because it's too conservative
and too cautious and they argue that the
truth is much more dire not surprisingly
the public is
used in his State of the Union speech in
January President Obama held the great
prospect of a century of energy
self-sufficiency that thanks to new
technologies that permit extractions of
hydrocarbons from Canadian tar sands and
shale other previously inaccessible
sources and others agreed the London
Financial Times forecasts a century of
energy dependence independence for the
United States including they say a
century global hegemony the report does
mention the destructive local impact of
the new methods poisoned water supplies
and so on but unasked in these
optimistic forecasts is a very simple
question that what kind of a world is
going to survive they were patients
onslaught of another century of rapid
exploitation of fossil fuels in the lead
confronting the crisis throughout the
world are indigenous communities those
who have always upheld the charter of
the forest just as the commoners did in
England of the 13th century the
strongest stan has been taken by the one
country in the world that they govern
Bolivia poorest country in South America
and for centuries a victim of Western
destruction of the rich resources of
what had been one of the most advanced
of the developed societies in the hem
Columbus quite davila after the
ignominious collapse of the Copenhagen
global climate change summit in 2009
Bolivia organized that people summit
with 35,000 participants from 140
countries that not just representatives
of governments as a copenhagen but also
civil society activists they produced
what they call the people's agreement
which called for very sharp reduction in
emissions and a universal declaration on
the rights of Mother Earth as they
called it that's a key demand of
indigenous societies all throughout the
world it's ridiculed by sophisticated
Westerners but unless we can acquire
some of their sensibility they're likely
to have the last laugh and it will be a
laugh of grim and despair
thank you very much professor Chomsky
and thanks all of you for coming and
afraid the room was too big and the
microphones to spare to allow for
questions so again please join me in
thanking personal
you
you
