well philosophers at least certain
old-fashioned philosophers have wanted
to to peddle the idea that not only is
there an explanatory gap between what we
know about the nature of the brain and
the emergence of conscious phenomena but
that the explanatory gap is somehow
mysterious and could never ever be
closed now first of all notice that to
conceive of the explanatory gap as
something that you could never in
principle close is to make a really
strong prediction it's a prediction
about what science never ever will even
in the long haul discover and I think
humility requires more of us humility
requires that we recognize that very
very often in science we have discovered
things which many centuries before would
have seen so mysterious as to be
undiscoverable in principle so my
feeling is there are of course
explanatory gaps there's explanatory
gaps all over the place
with regard to neuroscience we don't for
example really understand yet how a
brain gets built we don't there's so
many questions that we have about the
nature of neural development that nobody
could possibly say at this point that we
really understand brain development
there are many aspects of learning that
we don't understand many aspects of the
many memory systems that are still very
very puzzling there are many aspects of
perception decision-making even of
reflexes that we do not understand we
don't understand yet how it is that
mammals maintain a constant temperature
there's an explanatory gap so of course
there are explanatory gaps the question
is so what do you want to make of it
what I as a neural philosopher want to
make of it is great those are the places
where we do research and close those
gaps certain philosophers
to say oh but these gaps are so special
that you'll never be able to close that
you
there's a conceptual distinction between
mysteries and problems we don't know
where various aspects of the world fall
in those two categories that's an
empirical question but the conceptual
distinction nevertheless remains I mean
assuming that we're not angels let's
assume that we're organic creatures okay
if we're organic creatures we have a
fixed cognitive structure otherwise we'd
be angels okay so we have some fixed
cognitive structure like any other fixed
structure of the organism it has a scope
and it has limits we are genetically
programmed so that we can become humans
and not bees okay but we're not
genetically programmed so you become
anything if we were if you could become
anything you'd never become any never
becoming anything at all you know you'd
just be some kind of a amoeboid creature
so so we have internal structure that
directs the process of growth in certain
ways allows some changes not others into
the environment that do intrusion and
maybe some days people figure out a way
to turn on bad into a mouse or something
but there's a limit you know and the
sames got to be true of our cognitive
structures unless of course we're angels
so if we're not angels then we have
cognitive structures which are going to
have scope and limits okay that yields
the distinction between problems and
mysteries mysteries will be what lies
beyond our cognitive limits which must
exist unless were angels problems will
be things that are within our cognitive
limits now let's go to the question of
vitalism was an open question whether
it's notice that the problem and mystery
is a biological concept it's relative to
the organism so what's a problem a
mystery for say a B is not a mystery for
me necessarily I'm conversely because we
have different cognitive structures so
the notion is relative to humans it's a
normal biological concept just like the
visual system
for my granddaughter can become a male
in but not insect the same sort of
distinction but the question of what
lies within the two categories is an
empirical question to be discovered so
perhaps it was believed at one point
that life is beyond our cognitive reach
it's a mystery for humans okay it was
discovered that it's not beyond our
cognitive reach Hume and Locke argued
that the prophets of motion are beyond
our cognitive reach and Jim said the
Newton's greatest discovery was to have
demonstrated that as far as I understand
there as far as we know they're correct
but it's an empirical question maybe
someday we'll be able to comprehend not
just the theories of motion but the what
lock inhuman Galileo wanted comprehend
to really understand how these
mysterious properties work instead of
being mystified by the fact that you
know I can move the moon by moving my
hand as we are of course but that
they're just two separate issues and
Churchill is just missing the point
there's a conceptual distinction then
there's an empirical question of what
lies within these domains so let take to
go particular cases like say
consciousness we have no idea maybe
it'll turn out to be like like motion
we'll be able to develop a theory of it
but it won't be but the company want to
be able to conceive of how the theory
works so it's like the fact that I can't
conceive of the fact that when you take
a drop of water or a new thin electric
current through it it ends up as two
gases I mean I know it happens was I
learned it in a chemistry course but I
don't have the kind of conception of it
that Galileo and Newton and the founders
of modern science aimed for we've given
up that hope doesn't matter what we can
conceive of anymore we accept what the
best theoretical explanations give us
and it may turn out
very likely will turn out that the that
the Priestley's approach to
consciousness namely discover try to
discover the organic structures that
yield these phenomenon
maybe that will yield a result like
Newton's theory of motion exoplanet or a
theory but not one we can conceive of in
the sense of
