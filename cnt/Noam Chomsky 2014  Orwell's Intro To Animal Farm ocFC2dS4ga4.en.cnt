and in fact when this happens in a
democratic society citizens are much
more culpable than when it's done in an
authoritarian State Alexei suppose Iran
was murdering people who were
threatening it in the United States and
Israel and probably Britain well
Iranian citizens couldn't do very much
about that it's a harsh authoritarian
state it's different here we're we're
pretty free and if we accept that and
tolerate it that is morally very cold
you may recall I hope you've read or
wills a introduction to Animal Farm as
you probably know it was not published
filmed three years later and his
unpublished papers but it's interesting
in it he addresses himself to the people
of England free England and he says you
shouldn't feel too self-righteous about
this satirical denunciation that Altaria
an enemy because in England action
according he said in England unpopular
ideas can be suppressed without the use
of force and one of the mechanisms that
he mentions is a good education if
you've gone to the best schools
LSE thank you for that o'clock rather
ambivalent then you have instilled into
you the understanding that there are
certain things it wouldn't do to say and
I think we gonna add it wouldn't do to
think that's a significant element in
free societies and carries with it
severe moral responsibility much more so
than people who suffer in authoritarian
or totalitarian states I think that's
something we take much too little
attention
