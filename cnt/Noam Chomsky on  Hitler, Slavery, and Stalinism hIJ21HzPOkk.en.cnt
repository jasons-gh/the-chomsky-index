because there's been like increasing
standards of living in America and isn't
in them one way like a justification for
it the wide still around by capitalism
for mine standing has triumphed and it's
still not I don't think so
I mean there was rising standards of
living in slave society slaves were much
better off in the early 19th century
than in the early 18th century said an
argument for slavery
well I'm it's a terrible argument you
know I mean any system in fact you can
give that argument for Stalinism there
was a very substantial economic growth
in the Soviet Union it's the second
world not the third it was until 1989 it
was the second world not the third world
now it's back in the third world because
it's undergoing capitalist reforms
something you're not allowed to say
incidentally but if you read you'll
notice they've had ten years of
capitalist reforms which have driven
them right back into the third world
where they came from okay but if you
just look at it in terms of economic
growth it was reasonably successful
that's exactly what bothered Western
leaders if you read the documentary
record right up to the 1960s where it
sort of runs dry at the moment you find
that the great concern was that the
second the Soviet Union was presenting
itself as a model for modernization
within a single generation and that was
raising all sorts of trouble not only in
the third world but even in the rich
countries I didn't care about Russian
aggression but they cared about or you
don't Stalin's terror or anything and
didn't bother anybody
in fact Truman admired Stalin you know
thought he's an honest man you know deal
with him and so on he said he didn't
care what happens in Russia you know so
on but the same with Churchill
incidentally who's defending Stalin and
cabinet meetings is a great man and so
on and so forth they kills great people
as they want that's irrelevant the
problem was then they never expected
them to be attacking anybody you know
but they what they were afraid of was
the economic growth which was especially
in the third world considered quite
impressive actually the same is true of
Cuba
the documents have just been released
and they're interesting on Kennedy in
the Kennedy administration in Cuba and
it's kind of interesting to see the way
the facts are being hidden so for
example just to illustrate that when you
know this thing is going on at the World
Trade Organization the European Union
has brought charges against the United
States for violating the World Trade
Organization agreements with the
helms-burton Act and the Cuban embargo
altogether
and the United States has isolated on
that I mean in international arena
the only votes for the United States are
Israel which is reflexive that's like
saying the Ukraine voted with Russia and
in the old days so Israel and Uzbekistan
for some reason I don't know why it's
done and Israel are the only countries
that voted with the United States on
this whole European Union's against it
what was interesting is that when the
United States I simply withdrawn from
the World Trade Organization
jurisdiction says you have no right to
deal with us because we're the boss of
the world but the reasons were
interesting the reasons were that this
is a policy that goes back they said
falsely to the Kennedy administration
we've had three decades of a policy of
overthrowing the government of Cuba and
the European Union has no right to
challenge our policies
I was Stuart Eizenstat the government
spokesman well there was no reaction to
that it's kind of interesting in itself
that's taken for granted that we have a
right to overthrow another government if
we feel like it and if anyone challenges
that they're off base but there was an
interesting response on narrower ground
by Arthur Schlesinger in The New York
Times had a letter and he said to remind
his friend Stuart Eizenstat that he
misunderstood the Kennedy administration
policies the policies he said were based
on I'm quoting Castro's troublemaking in
the hemisphere and the Soviet connection
but now that's past so it's an
anachronism well as Schlesinger was here
comes the discipline of the educated
classes for example the people in
Fletcher school and so on
certainly know what I'm going to tell
you right now the documents that came
out not long ago from the early 60s and
bear directly on this question Arthur
Schlesinger was the head of the Latin
American mission of the Kennedy of the
incoming Kennedy administration which
was laying out you know talking about
the problems and the plans for Cuba and
there he explains what troublemaking in
the hemisphere means and what the Soviet
connection means he said the problem
with Castro he said is the I'm quoting
the spread of the Castro idea of taking
matters into your own hands okay which
he said has great appeal to people in
Latin America most of whom live in
terrific poverty and oppression and are
trying to find a more decent life and
with the model of this Cuba in front of
them they're likely to do all sorts of
things so that's Castro's troublemaking
in the hemisphere
what's the Soviet connection well the
Soviet connection he said is that in the
background the Soviet Union is
presenting itself as a model for
modernization in a single generation
okay that's the Soviet connection well
yeah so therefore we have to overthrow
the government because of that kind of
troublemaking and that kind of
connection and in fact that extends much
more broadly you know Kennedy and
Macmillan in their discussions in the
early 60s were worried about the in
North you know the potential for
economic growth of the Soviet Union Oh
what it would imply the same was true of
Dulles in goes right back to 1970 so the
facts of the opposite of what you're
describing
perhaps my question could be put
differently if if this system is so bad
and everything why hasn't there been
excuse me power system our system is so
bad why hasn't why hasn't that been
great of movements to challenge it well
is in challenge all the time I mean we
have a for example we have a very
violent labor history and hundreds of
American workers were being killed right
into the late 30s and finally they got
labor right there has been a very
extensive
through the 50s in the sixties the whole
thing blew up and in fact many
concessions had to be made and it still
continues I mean we right now happen to
be in a period of regression but as I
say it's cyclic you know it was much
more regression in the 1920s when labor
was really crushed so yes there's always
challenge and struggle but when you say
is the system so bad I don't even know
what that means I mean slave societies
went on for centuries and centuries
without any challenge okay
did that justify them and in fact if you
really want to be serious about it the
slave owners were giving arguments
rather like yours
so slavery very much like it take a read
say George Fitzhugh who was the leading
spokesman for the American you know
South slave owners in the south at the
time when it was becoming a serious
issue like around the 1840s he had
pretty powerful arguments in favor of
slavery what he was saying is he was
saying as look the reason you northers
northerners are against slavery is
because you're any Negro racists we are
not racists we think that you should
take care of your subjects so we treat
them nicely and we even do that on
economic grounds because they're our
capital you know like if I own make an
anachronistic analogy if if I buy a car
and you rent a car okay and somebody
comes a year later and has a look at the
two cars which cars not be in better
shape
okay well mine because I own it so I'm
gonna take care of it
not yours because you rent it and you
can just throw it away and get another
one okay that's exactly Fitzhugh's
argument he says look we own people you
just rent them so therefore we take care
of them we treat them well we respect
them there are capital besides we have
human relations with them we're
pre-capitalist we still have human
relations you just treat them as tools
under wage slavery and they're much
worse off and so we're the ones who are
moral you're the ones who are immoral
and in fact under
under the slave system if you take a
look it was reasonably efficient you
know conditions were sort of improving
people live better slaves live better in
1850 than in 1750 okay everything you're
saying could stand there's a perfectly
good art now I could be a good argument
for slavery but was offered as an
argument for slavery similar arguments
were given for Bolshevism 6ei fascism
why was Hitler so popular no Hitler was
the most through the 30s it was the most
popular leader probably in German
history well the reason is he carried
out a social revolution people are
living a lot better I mean like not
everybody you know not Jews for example
but people were but Germans were living
a lot better it was very successful
Hitler on either understood or you know
figured out or his advisers did that
large scale scale state expenditures
could rescue a morbid capital economy
from destruction
pretty much what American business
learned during the Second World War and
he was doing it and it was the economy
was booming they were better off and so
on is that an argument for fascism I
like to thank dr. Tomsky for a good
speech and a good exchange
