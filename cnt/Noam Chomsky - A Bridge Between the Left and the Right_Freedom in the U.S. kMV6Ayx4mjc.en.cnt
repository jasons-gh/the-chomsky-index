there are people who believe that the
program is right and left make them
diametrical opposite
forever there are others who see you
know that there's some possibility for
communication between the right
pleasure
it sounds a lot what you mean by the
right in the left so her example at Cato
Institute is right okay but look I mean
for years until before Z was founded in
fact the only Journal in the country
that I could write for it was a journal
the Cato Institute because we agreed on
a lot of things we disagreed
fundamentally on basic things but on say
state terrorism a lot of things
International Affairs interventions on
it so what we agreed so it was and it
was pretty open so I could write things
there well that's right left if you look
at the militia movements I think they
are pretty complicated phenomenon I take
somebody like Timothy McVeigh you take a
look at his background I'm he's a guy
who golf war who knows what
experiences he went through wasn't very
pretty I'm sure the his he's somebody
whose life has come at his big community
that he comes from the Secretary of the
population that he comes from their
lives have completely fallen apart I
mean in the last twenty years their
incomes of declined sharply their you
know their wives have to go out and work
to put food on the table which they
don't like from the culture they come
from and no nobody would like if people
want to work fine but they're forced to
work you know just to survive the kids
don't pay attention to them you know
there's the whole world of the way he
perceived it is falling apart so you
know you lash out you lash out at the he
didn't blow up a corporate headquarters
notice you bought the federal building
because you've had it drilled into your
head that the enemy is the government
not because of the bad things the
government does but because of the good
things it does namely it supports you
know it has it has some function part of
its function is to serve the public
interest that's why it's attacked so
much but that's all he hears you know
government is the bad guys so let's go
blow them up well that's kind of you
know you have to understand that it's
not coming out of nowhere these are
parts of the population that back in the
1930s would have been organizing the CIO
well that option isn't open at the
moment so go to other ones
I think there's in fact if you go back
to the union organizing days it was
bringing in sectors of the population
that we're very destructive before if
the alternative options are open same
sectors can become very constructive is
that a bridge between the left and the
right well if you make it you know I
mean I think I don't know babe but I
think people like that could be made to
understand that their enemy is not the
federal government their enemy is
private power and the federal government
insofar as it's run by private power
which is most most of it there's been a
kind of interesting shift in just mass
entertainment in this respect over the
years that so I've been told maybe you
know better than me but you go back to
the 1950s and state television the FBI
was just you know gods now I think the
FBI is if you look at a standard cop
show the FBI is the bad guys it's the
local police who are the good guys and
the FBI is coming in and screwing
everything up you know and they gotta
get them out of their hair and so on and
so forth I understand that that's been
quite a considerable shift and if you
think about the way the FBI was
glorified back in the 50s it's a pretty
remarkable shift well I suspect that
that's part of the general propaganda of
trying to make people hate the federal
government but support the parts of the
federal government that protect them
from all kind of enemies and in fact
funnel money to rich people it's kind of
nuanced but I think that's happening and
you see that in the official movement
let's attack the federal government as
the enemy because not private power and
of course let's keep the Pentagon you
know and they don't know that the NIH
and the NSF are doing the same thing
look I mean you live here just as much
as I do everything in the everything
that reaches people is you're overtaxed
you're giving the money away to these
pointy-headed bureaucrats and these
welfare mothers in these third-world
countries and so on and you're suffering
because you're paying too much taxes
that's all anybody hears well you know
it's very hard when you're sitting alone
and you hear nothing but this flood of
stuff to say wait a minute what would
you know maybe I'm not over maybe we're
under text so it's interesting if you
ask people you look at polls the same
people who say that they're overtaxed
say they would like to have better more
money spent on education on on mass
transportation on preservation of the
environment actually even on welfare if
you don't call it welfare because
welfare has been demonized but if you
say if you have a take a look at a poll
where they say should we provide should
we guarantee health and you know sub
sufficient food and decent living
conditions for everybody yeah most
people say yes if you call the same
thing welfare they say no if you ask
people to estimate how much of the
federal budget goes to welfare they give
estimates which are kind of you know
like off the map way beyond anything
that it is like a third of the federal
budget or something that's standard
estimate if you ask people how much
money should go they give estimates that
are higher than the amount that does go
same with foreign aid you ask people how
much money should the United States
spend in foreign aid they give some
the standard answer is way higher than
it is if you ask people how much money
do we get from for foreign aids they
think it's way too high and already cut
back well you know that's not that
people are bad you know that's what they
hear what they hear is we're giving all
our money away to these you know third
world people are living in luxury and
I'm working hard why should I give my
money to them on the other hand if you
say well should we give this amount of
aid bro they say yeah sure it's a lot
more in fact so where's the propaganda
come from well you know every time you
turn on the tube and every time you read
the newspaper and every time you read
the journals of opinion and so on it's
constant I mean the United States is in
fact 100 texts if you look at the at the
actual facts which are available they're
not hard to find the poverty level here
is the United States has the worst
record among the industrial countries
behind none and things like child
poverty hunger
you know inequality and so on every just
about every measure it's the worst if
you want the latest figures UNESCO which
still barely exists it just came out
with its 1997 report it was just data
you know good data on things like child
poverty and mortality and so on for the
countries of the world
it's just alphabetical but if you look
at the industrial countries the United
States is flat out the worst okay
no now where does that come from okay
well if you look at in actual income the
United States is not the worst so if you
take say the if you look at the
distribution of income from say wages
the United States is more or less like
other countries so how does it get to be
the worst and child poverty and
inequality well because it's the worse
than transfer payments so for example in
France or Sweden or whatever the
government intervention which means the
public intervention to provide people's
needs has a kind of progressive
character
okay so it shifts funding to some extent
from the rich to the poor in the United
States it doesn't so if you look before
transfer payments the US isn't often you
know redistribution whatever government
redistribution there is like welfare and
stuff like that if you look before that
the United States is sort of the norm if
you look after it it's the worst well
that's because we're in your text and
not only under tax but regressively
taxed I mean every country is but the
u.s. is worse and that disparity shows
it quite strikingly it's the it's that
component of the system the transfer
payments in which the United States is
by far the worst and the result is we've
got hunger child poverty you know
starvation among the elderly you know
all these things that other countries do
and it's because we're under taxed but
you know how many people know this I
mean how many people read the you know
biennial report state of working America
which has all this data like you know
people we know this who reads it well
look I'm reading it you can read it you
know but it's not going to go to the
mass of the population okay because in
order to get to the general population
that see look I can read it because I
like I'm a university professor right I
got free time I have resources I got
money
you know I have all these things that
make it possible to do it suppose you
and you're you know suppose you have a
couple who were working each 50 hours a
week to put food on the table yeah I
read this book they don't know it exists
you know they couldn't even know that
this data exists they wouldn't know how
to find that if it if they if somebody
told them it did exist I mean they don't
have they're not part of that tiny
privileged sector of the population
which can do these things well okay
that's what radical organizations are
for to make it available to the general
population I mean that's look that's
what our labor movement is for a big
part of the labor movement was always
worker education like when I was a kid
my you know my family was what was
mostly first-generation immigrants who
were working-class they knew all these
things
a lot of never went to school you know
but they knew all of these things factor
knew him very well you know better than
the people in universities yeah they
were part of a lively organized labor
movement and political movement actually
the political movement was often the
Communist Party back in those days but
whatever you think about it it was a
political minute I didn't like it you
know but it was a political movement
that brought people in and gave them a
way to participate well okay the labor
movement political movements and so on
they can make these things available
this week world's demonized
working mothers and this this weekend
while attack daycare I will talk about
divorce some more and say how awful that
is and the morals why is the
misinformation why is it there because
the misinformation is very much in the
interests of people with privilege and
power so since they have the privilege
and power and resources why shouldn't
they put it out I mean what do you
expect them to do tell the truth why
should they
[Laughter]
that maybe that is proof of the power of
these propaganda machines that was the
whole system that it can allow someone
who's who's saying your version of the
truth to exist as they're still doing
their own thing well what would be the
alternative what I mean like who would
remember this is this look this is more
or less I mean it's not a capitalist
society capitalist society couldn't
survive for three minutes but if you
look at the spectrum of world societies
this is toward the capitalist end okay
now in a in a real capitalist society
everything is a commodity you know
everything's available you get as much
as you can buy okay and that's also true
of freedom and if you think about the
United States it's very free I mean the
amount of freedom is very large compared
with other societies and you get as much
as you can buy well I can buy a lot okay
furthermore other people from my same
class background would not want the
state to have the power to act against
me so if the state were to act against
me I would get supported by rich
powerful people because they don't want
the state to have the power to act
against people like them namely me okay
well for ugly reasons you get a lot of
freedom and actually this covers quite a
large part of the society on the other
hand if you're a black organizer in the
ghetto you can get murdered because
nobody cares whether the state has the
power to go after them you know and they
don't have the resources to buy a lot of
freedom
I mean it's a very unequal class Society
and I suspect all of us certainly may
benefit from that in the sense that we
can buy a lot of privilege that's why
we're here you know how many people have
the opportunity to spend some time in a
place like this you know you got to be
part of a fairly privileged sector even
to be
part of it okay and this is a rich
country super rich country by world
standard so an offer a fair number of
people are in this position
