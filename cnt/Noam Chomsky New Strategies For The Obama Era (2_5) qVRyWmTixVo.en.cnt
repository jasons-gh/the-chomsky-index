the vomiting for Institute and then
bombers and they have effects so one of
the most troubled regions work is a lot
of fighting going on is the jrb province
what's called the Pakistani side of the
Durand Line local back militants there
don't depress that the fighting was
largely motivated by a drone bombing
which I don't think was he reported here
where the Pakistani President a drone
hit a madrassa school killed from 80-85
people and these are what Winston
Churchill called uncivilized tribes they
don't understand hi marlon cultural
level when they get upset by things like
that so it started the reaction which
blew up into the war everyone the
permanent tax has that effect honey
Karzai the President of Afghanistan his
first message to Obama was a plea to
stop the attacks on Afghan civilians he
also called for a dia a deadline for
withdrawal of all foreign troops he even
went on and said that he's once
negotiations among the whole Afghans
he's invested that he would be glad to
welcome Omar the head of the Taliban was
an Afghan for discussions about how to
terminate the conflict and he said that
if the US but like that they'll have a
choice of either accepting it or
throwing now well the second choice is
the one that was made as soon as cars
that scar that was very popular remember
love about it is wonderful costume and
so on but hey that's just announced Lee
after these breaches of discipline his
image changed sharply he's condemned as
corrupt infective so on we have to do
something about it and what's being done
about it is we can expect Britain in the
United States agreed to replace it they
can't formally do it but they're going
to restructure Afghanistan which
supports that right so that a new
administrative officer will be
introduced to directly take
responsibility when you take orders from
us and as far as I can be a symbolic
figure I don't think his letter to Obama
was ever answered except by more attacks
the
there is that it is there another
possibility yeah they're there are other
possibilities I mean there's an Afghan
peaceful substantial one which three
years that's been calling for an end to
the violence put down your guns you want
to be here or find that come to paid and
reconstruction exactly the scale is
known but at Western polls taken out of
Afghanistan indicate that about
seventy-five percent of the population I
want negotiation one Afghans that mean
to all Afghans and they want to settle
it run affairs have a communal assembly
dear God devoted to peace and the fires
are there they should be there for eight
and reconstruction for killing we don't
know the numbers Washington Post one of
the few comments on it the corresponding
panel it Constable's that one of the
problems ii the US forces the new forces
are going to face when they get that
genistein it gives one of the problems
will be insurgency the other problem
will be there not one and that they'll
have to somehow deal with this tricky
issue
far as I said is not super popular
popularity runs about fifty percent
according to Western polls bus almost
twice as high as the popularity the
Western forces the American forces there
so that's another technical difficulty
has to be dealt with in another aspect
of the escalated attack in half pad is
the consequences which would be
extremely grim for Pakistan as well as
Afghanistan another aspect is that the
NATO as you know is being encouraged to
take a bigger role in this it raises
interesting questions but why does
native exist it's a pretty simple
question there was a detective
theoretical reason up until about
nineteen ninety believe it or not just
another question but his claim that it
is neither the defensive alignments to
protect Western Europe from being
overrun by the marvels of directed in
Moscow okay maybe maybe not but whatever
one thinks of that argument it was gone
by the time that the Soviet system
collapsed at that time
Gorbachev premises Gorbachev made an
astonishing concession to the west he
agreed to allow a united Germany to join
non-person militarized Germany to join a
day of hustle military alliance that's
pretty remarkable when you consider that
Germany alone have practically destroyed
Russia twice in the past century and now
it was going to join allowed to join a
major military alliance so targeting
Russia and led by the world's most
awesome super power and history very
hostile but he did insist on condition
this was the bush number one
administration was favorite the
condition was that it was accepted by
pushing Baker that NATO would not expand
one inch to the east that was that would
give brushes some kind of a buffer zone
he also made a proposal that there
should be the nuclear weapons-free zone
from the Arctic the Baltic which were
also be a way of easing potential
tensions as far as i know that never got
a response not only Karzai's please and
stuff filling us so that was ejected but
Bush and Baker did agree pledge not to
extend they'd 0 pitch to the east Bill
Clinton won the next election one of his
first acts was to extend these very
threatening packed up to the Russians
and of course it increased
hostility Russia dropped its pledge no
first usually no first use of nuclear
weapons NATO has never Trump but Russia
has drafted insulated and rearmament
development of offensive weapons of
course continued for all of that
escalated sharply under under Bush same
aggressive militarism leads to that
natural response makes the world more
dangerous well Obama's national security
adviser James Jones former marine
commandant is the leading exponent of
the idea that NATO should expand farther
to the east end to the south the hoop
Shepherds that head of NATO has
explained that native must become
intervention force to protect pipelines
and ceilings others to ensure that
europe united states have control of the
world's energy system and that's what we
can anticipate as you probably know
there's major demonstrations next week
and stressful and protesting made it its
expansion in fact natives existence and
one task for the future for us not far
future now it's to try to do something
about this
so starting here they shouldn't be
Afghanistan and there's no reason why I
should be anywhere well that's a little
bit of one piece of the story a fact it
is of course much worse the Bush
administration has Akkadians to plans to
establish over an anti-missile system in
Eastern Europe and Czechoslovakia and
Poland a theoretical
