welcome everyone to the
fourth and final lecture in Noam
Chomsky's lecture series here at UCLA
before Noam starts I just wanted to make
a couple of brief announcements first I
wanted to acknowledge the support of the
Dean of humanities and his discretionary
fund to help support this visit I also
want to acknowledge two graduate
students at UCLA whose idea it was to
invite norm to come and speak to us and
they actually made the initial move to
invite him one of them I think is here
Richard Stockwell wherever you are and
oh there you are right okay
and Nico's Angelo Poulos who
unfortunately had to go back to Greece
to finish his dissertation but we'll be
taping we're taping these and he'll be
here in spirit finally I thought I would
just share a little piece of trivia that
I learned today and that is that Nome
has a be named after him do you know
about this yeah it's called let me get
this mega Kiley Chomsky and it was
discovered in Texas in 2013 so now
you're all in possession of the same
trivia without further ado please
welcome Nome for his final lecture
I never did find out whether it's a
honeybee with a waggle dance but I hope
somebody will find that out for me well
this has been pretty sketchy especially
yesterday there's lots of loose ends
that ought to be tied up
I hope actually I think it would be best
maybe to delay that to the discussion
period tomorrow so I hope you guys will
come in with lots of questions and
objections and will be able to see if we
can fix up what wasn't done properly of
which there's a lot there was actually
one question came up in the question
period yesterday about an important
matter and I didn't actually give the
right answer to it so let me go through
it here get this to work so the
paradigmatic example that I was giving
about what distinguishes the legitimate
from the illegitimate ones who can
illustrate it with parallel merge the
thing that people tend to write like
this where you have this is the work
space and then you would join this to
this and that's supposed to give you
this thing which in fact gives you and
this one becomes illegitimate because
you can explode this to something
complex as you like and since this is
accessible you can move there then you
have a chain connecting these two things
which can violate all conceivable
properties of language so that's
legitimate the argument that it is
illegitimate is it adds two instead of
one accessible terms namely this one
here and this one here
and you're only allowed to add one in
the minimal system of the resource
control so the question was well why
doesn't this block ordinary I am so
suppose you have this guy over here now
we have why can't you do the same thing
you think about it for a minute which I
didn't when the question was asked this
turns out to be a case of late merge
what you're doing is trying to tack this
into something that you've already test
and that doesn't work for the reasons I
discussed last time late merge first of
all adds too many new accessible items
and then it also requires an extra
operation of substitution so it's the
worst case of illegitimate City so that
one's out the difference is once you've
intuitively once you've passed a certain
point in the derivation you can't go
back and do something to what you've
passed but that a problem doesn't arise
in the parallel merge case because these
two guys are separate and nothing is
protecting the thing that you moved from
so that makes the right distinction well
there are a lot of other things that
need to be
clarified but instead of that I'd like
to turn to something else at least touch
on a few other things briefly just to
bring them up and won't be able to go
into them in sufficient detail one point
is that in addition to the symmetrical
operation merge there's quite good in
fact I think completely compelling
evidence that we also need another
operation an isometric operation in
addition to merge this is clear
intuitively simply from simple adjuncts
so for example if you have a phrase like
young man it's there's an asymmetry
between the two that's clear that
element that's formed is a noun phrase
not an adjective phrase so the old is an
adjunct that's not changing the category
notice this is quite different from
symmetrical merge in symmetrical merge
if you have a if you haven't have a head
and an XP then the head will in fact be
the label the thing that traditionally
projects but that's just a case of
minimal search and that doesn't work for
i junked a symmetry so if you have old
portrait of John portrait of John is not
a head it's complex could be arbitrarily
complex but it's still the label of the
of the whole unit so there's a clear
asymmetry beyond that there's a problem
that's been lingering for 60 years
that's the serious problem it's the
problem of unbounded unstructured
coordination so if you have something
like the guy is young happy eager to go
to college you know tired of wasting his
time
endless number of possible adjuncts
there's no structure among them they're
strung together they're unbounded and
that's a real problem for one thing you
can't do it in any kind of phrase
structure grammar because you'd need an
infinite number of rules that's even
true interestingly of of the universal
case unrestricted rewriting systems the
ones that allow you to do anything
rewrite anything you'd still need an
infinite number of rules
notice that unrestricted rewriting
systems as was proven by a great
mathematician ml post long ago or
Universal those are universal Turing
machines in effect which means you can
code the right result by some devious
means but you don't get it by just
rewriting the rules and looking at the
structure so that's out totally from
phrase structure grammar about 60 years
ago when george miller and i were
working on mathematical linguistics we
thought we had an answer to this in
terms of generalized transformations but
howard lies and it can pointed out that
that doesn't work either so there's no
method around no device around that
allows this however it is allowed
immediately simply by the device of a
symmetric pair emerge what we need is a
new device and since we're trying to get
the simplest possible operations the
simplest operation after set for
ordinary simple set formation is just
pair formation so we need an operation
pair emerge which will also apply to the
simple adjunct case like young man a
young will be a join two will be
attached to man but you don't see it in
the labeling okay because it's often
some other dimension and the unbounded
unstructured case
show you in effect that there were
unbounded ly many dimensions to what's
going on up there it's not
two-dimensional like a blackboard you
can add any number of adjuncts at any
point so we want some device that we
want to we want to work this out that
means intuitively that every member of
this coordinated construction every
individual member of it is individually
predicated of what it links to now we
know that the order of the unstructured
unbounded elements this sequence we know
that the order of it matters it matters
because of reasons that were pointed out
by Jim McCauley about 40 years ago
namely notions like respectively so if
you say John and Bill's or common Mary
respectively the order in which they
appear affects the semantic
interpretation so it's not just a set of
paired things it's a sequence of pair of
things
furthermore the more evidence that it's
a sequence is that adjuncts can repeat
so you can say the guy is young tall
happy young eager to go to Harvard so on
and so forth you can repeat them as much
as you want so what we have a situation
where in order to generate these objects
you generate a set finite set you pick
out of you form from that set a sequence
and it could be any sequence of elements
and there's in fact infinitely many
possible sequences you pick one out of
those and that sequence s call it is the
thing that you're then going to merge
into the construction to proceed with
the interpretation this operation of
picking a particular element out of the
set of sequences
is the this formal ways of doing it
which are familiar those of you who know
some logical recognize that this is
David Hilbert's an epsilon operator
which picks a single thing out of a said
it was part of his work on foundations
of mathematics basic operation so it's a
straightforward operation but it does
have the property that it's
indeterminate okay so it's that's part
of the nature of production as I
discussed last time well what this means
is actually there's clearly two kinds of
coordination conjunction and disjunction
so what we're doing is forming objects
that look like this we're forming a
sequence which begins with some
conjunction and then contains a sequence
of elements each of which is predicated
of something so we have things of
sequence of things that look like this
link
and in fact we couldn't say ever'one and
but in fact all the links have to be
identical but one of the aspects of
coordination is your your attachment or
joining everything to the same point
okay so we can so we have an object like
that that's the basic object that gives
you an unbounded coordination when you
get down to just one case when N equals
one that's just playing a junction so
the old young man's on no notice that
each element of these pairs is
inaccessible so if you say the phrase
old man say you can't extract man and
leave old that you can't extract the old
and leave man
so the elements of the pair's are
inaccessible and if that's if that were
all there was to it
notice that this would yield at both the
coordinate structure and the adjunct
island that constraint you have the
coordinate structure constraint because
every term is inaccessible you have the
adjunct Island extra constraint because
you can't pull the things out however
quite it's not quite that simple in fact
as the I mentioned earlier paper by Jaco
Boscovich which shows that there's which
just reviews lots of different kind of
complicated cases there are languages in
which you can extract the odd you can't
extract the anything inside the adjunct
there are others where you can extract
something that's inside but not the edge
until
and in a couple of other cases so
there's more work to be done and what it
in fact shows is that this is that the
concept of adjunct is just not
sufficiently refined there's a number of
different kinds of adjuncts which
behave quite differently and this is in
fact kind of a an unexplored
domain it hasn't been looked at
sufficiently but you have to here's a
major research project is to ask how can
we deal with the class of cases that
Boscovich left unexplained in his
bringing together the two kinds of
mysteries there are they're still there
so here's a first step and how to
capture it but more has to be said well
the next question is what is ill what do
you link things to so let's take the
simplest case say noun phrase and verb
phrase coordination you know John bill
Tom the young man etc etc they read the
book walk to the store so on and so
forth
what's the linking in those cases well
the assumption that comes to mind right
away
is that saying incidentally I should say
that I'm going to assume here that not
that nominal phrases are actually NPS
the DP hypothesis which is widely
accepted was very fruitful that do a lot
of interesting work but I've never
really been convinced of it I think
these things are fundamentally nominal
phrases actually is a very good paper by
Maus Oishi who's here who kind of spells
out and how this could work this would
mean that say Ana nominal phrase things
like definite articles are actually
features of the nominal phrase they're
not elements merged into it very much
like semitic where it's just a feature
of the nominal phrase and that the
definite article appears in every
element of the nominal phrase including
the determiner that seems to me probably
the way it works
as far as determiners are concerned like
say that i suspect they're at
so I'll be assuming that the core system
is basically nominal as I say Moss's
paper spills a lot of this out
that's so one suggestion you might have
is that L is just n but that runs into
an immediate question if you accept L
which I am accepting here the Hoggett
Barrera Malik Marantz theory of route
categorization which i think is pretty
strongly motivated you have the roots in
the lexicon are independent of category
they become nominal or verbal adjectives
Allah by virtue of a categorize ur that
attaches to them and incidentally that
would surely be pair merged so pair
emerges to them and it's probably the it
has to be the first operation in forming
forming a derivation you search first
attach the root to the category the
category to the root and you sort of go
on from there with a pair of merged
element but that element say n for a
root that's going to become nominal it
can't be identified with the end that is
the link here because this was there
this one is just much higher up in the
in the syntactic object that you're
constructing same with verb it means
that the small V which is the categorize
ur which is linked to the root bye-bye
pair emerge can't be the same as what we
call small v or small v star high up in
the derivation and in fact i think that
things like v and v star have been
somewhat misinterpreted they're not
really the it's not really a verbal
categorize err it's basically a phase
marker
and I think we should think of both in
what we've been calling or what I'm now
calling small in and small we used to
call small V as being basically the two
kinds of phase markers the and I think
kind of natural way of capturing this is
to go back to a classical distinction
actually goes back to classical Greece
which has been used sometimes in
generative grammar and to assume that we
really have two fundamental notions
classical terms they're the notions
which gives you four categories plus s
minus P which is minus s plus P which is
verbal and in classical grammars that's
all there is so if you look at the
classical Greek grammar errors up till
late into the Latin the Roman period
those are the only categories there's no
adjectives adjectives we can add but
we'll consider it a non primitive
category it would be both substantive
and predicated and then there's the
course the fourth one which is neither
and that's the rest of the junk that's
lying around preposition as and so on
and so forth but the two major
categories the ones that really count
are probably the ones that are the
perfect substantive and the perfect
predicate the ones from essentially
classical grammar and there is some and
these are distinct from the categorize
errs N&V those are totally different
notions on these things then would mark
the phases and it's kind of striking
that and they would be the links all of
these would be the things that
coordination conjunction disjunction
link to the notice that there's a
well-known phenomenon about extraction
that holds of both nominal phrases and
verbal phrases there are some nominal
and verbal phrases which resist
extraction you can only extract to the
edge you can't go out of the element so
we'll call those strong in the case of
verb phrase
it's the transitive verb phrases the
ones that usually marked these store
those constitute strong phases that you
can't move out of you've got a first go
to the edge then you can go on the weak
phases say annika sitive passives you
can extract all the way and there's the
same distinction in nominal phrases so
the complex noun phrase constraint it's
been known for a long time it works
strongly for definites but not for
indefinite it's nonspecific and specific
so the extraction out of a definite noun
phrases violates the rules extraction
out of a indefinite nonspecific it's a
very straightforward so it looks like
both the nominal and verbal phases have
the category break into the categories
say strong and weak and what we're
calling V and little the two types of
flavors of a V and V star probably just
strong and weak phase markers perhaps
framed in this in this system the there
is another that there's been a lot of
discussion over the years about whether
noun phrases are really phases like verb
phrases and the one problem about it was
that they have a lot of similarities but
there's one notable difference and that
is you don't have an escape hatch in
noun phrases there's no nothing that
allows you to go to the edge and then go
on but fortunately as I learned a couple
of weeks ago there's a nice African
language called bully which has which
does have an escape hatch has a marker
that says okay if this is here we can
add on to the noun phrase and then go on
so if we simply assume that the basis
for all languages is Semitic proto
Semitic and boolean then everything
works out so we're off and running just
have to find the right languages other
languages like say English are defective
in this respect they don't have that
extra morphological element that's one
of the nice things about doing
comparative work you can fill in the
blanks that oughta be there well if you
play with this you'll notice that it can
get pretty complicated so for example it
could be that one of the con junks say
s0 yes you know the third element in the
sequence it could if this is a
conjunction
the third one could be a disjunction
okay you can stick a disjunction inside
a conjunction
and that disjunction could be an
unbounded on structure element and if
you play with it gets very complex I'll
put that aside the the principles for
dealing it are straightforward but the
actual working it out becomes pretty
hairy but it's not a fundamental problem
just a technical problem now there is a
fundamental problem which was made very
clear by recent work of Barry shines I
don't know if he's around here somewhere
but Barry has a very terrific book a
great book that every cement assist or a
study carefully which I think is the
longest book with the shortest title and
the entire literature's the book called
and 600 pages of details about the
extreme intriguing complexities that you
get in the somatic interpretation of
coordinate structures it's all done in a
kind of an event calculus Neil David's
own in event calculus so here's the task
the task is to take assuming that this
is the right kind of syntactic formalism
you might play around with it a little
assume that if this is correct how can
you go to this from this to those
somatic objects okay I'll come back
later if there's a little time to the
nature of these semantic objects but I
think he gives good evidence that that's
the kind of target that the mapping from
syntax to formal semantics is trying to
achieve so here's a huge unsolved
problem for those of you are looking for
dissertation topics one of many that
nice fortunately there's lots of such
topics hanging around I should say
incidentally that this is a dramatic
difference from say the 1950s and even
the 1960s at that time it looked like
there was almost no topics it looked
like this whole field was finished I
think I mentioned this earlier and one
of the really striking things that's
happened during my lifetime is that the
field went from one that was terminated
to 1 that's entirely endless and open
everywhere you look there's just more
problems that's a good sign that at
least something's on the right track
because that's the way things ought to
be people who are just coming into the
field now probably aren't struck by the
dramatic difference but if you look back
it really is dramatic
well the another case that's an
intriguing one is see how to bring this
in well that's probably too complicated
to go into it I'll skip this
well there are lots of other there are
plenty of other candidates for para
merge some of them are interesting
unsolved problems so for example if you
take the paradigm things like John Mary
saw the man walking down the street
saying or Mary saw the man walk down the
street you run through that and familiar
paradigm you notice that there's a gap a
strange gap in it with the bare verbs
like Mary saw the man walk down the
street you can't passive eyes so you can
say the man was seen walking down the
street but not the man was seen walk
down the street this holds for two
categories of verbs perception verbs and
quasi causative verbs like make or let
you know so I made the guy walk down the
street but not the guy was made walking
down the street those two categories
this has been a kind of a funny sort of
gap for a long time no good explanation
for it there is a proposal and
interesting proposal by Norman Richards
in terms of his continuity theory that
it has to do with the output of passive
ization but that doesn't work because
the same problem arises with in situ
passives so kind of a little awkward in
English normal in most languages but not
bad in English if you saw say things
like there were seen walking down the
street
three men let's say that's more or less
okay but if you try there were seen walk
down the street three men that's
hopeless okay so there's a sharp
distinction between
passives and non passives whether or not
you move the object okay so that can't
be what's involved so what could be
involved well what could be involved
this kind of suggested by the fact that
this holds for the quasi positives let
and make one might imagine may be that
these things really are just spelling
english-style spilling out of causative
morphemes which attach to a to a verb
which are all over the place English
tends to not use affixes to spell things
out us words but these things could be
affixes so it could be that let and make
are just the causative affix is attached
to the verb bear verb then comes an
interesting question why should
perception verbs have the same property
but putting that on the Shelf if they
all have this property what you might
expect is that all of these are hair
emerged to the bare verb and the pair
emerged element is just immune to the
passive operation say whatever you think
passive is maybe dropping the case case
let's say so that's that would fill in
the gap making use of the pair emerge
device there are other interesting
proposals one of them's he said key
Tijeras suggestion about what has always
been a pretty serious problem the head
raising head raising has none of the
right properties it violates the
extension condition it it's always
described incorrectly if a verb raises
to inflection say to tea it's always
described as if it's a tea but it's not
it's a V the things somehow that's a
joined is really verbal not inflectional
and the fur will further move of V to C
is really kind of visa the second
phenomena not a tea second phenomena so
there's all kind of problems another
kind of problem with it is
it's sort of head raising has properties
that are kind of shared the cross syntax
and phonology so it's almost entirely
like phonological processes in that it
doesn't have semantic consequences so
with the arrays say take Pollock's
analysis of french and english which
many of you know if you raise in french
you tend to raise the verb and english
not to raise it but the semantics
doesn't change if you have a v second
language it's has the same semantic
properties as a non v second language
and in fact you have to look very hard
way out of the fringes to find some kind
of semantic consequences to hedge
raising that makes it look phonological
but the trouble is its successive cyclic
which makes it look syntactic so it's
kind of problematic all alone but the
real question is how do you get around
this how can you actually create it
without violating all the rules well he
says proposal is this essentially we'll
just take the VMP t2c case the same for
the others you generate
you generate see then that's just
ordinary sign and generate see is in the
workspace because that's where the
lexicon is so you just look at it it's
there in the workspace then you merge
these two para merge them see we now
have a set the workspace now contains
this this notice by merging C and T you
haven't increased the number of
accessible elements because neither of
these is accessible okay that was as
we've already pointed out they're just
like old man so and once you've done
this you now simply merge this thing and
if you think about it you can do all the
head raising that way I thought for a
while that there were some problems
about this he said I responded about it
but I think the problems are easily
overcome so that's a possible way of
approaching the entire problem of head
more of head raising which has been a
tricky and serious problem so leave it
in your your hands to play around with
that and see if you can handle the rest
of head raising that way but a simple
way to proceed which doesn't violate any
of the rules doesn't add accessible
elements just follows all that's just
available you know and then anything new
for it
and it's crucially has to be para merge
for one thing because that's the way
these things end up they end up as
adjuncts not as sets and secondly it
doesn't add accessible items so it
doesn't violate the resource constraint
so it has the right properties in that
respect
well the
there's plenty of questions like this
there's there's a lot of the a major
task that is faced is to take all of the
cases that took two tasks an our first
one take the cases that have been
described usefully by illegitimate
operations to take all the cases that
have been handled by say late merge
which is very widely used or by parallel
merge which gives you all the
multidimensionality cases and so on take
that whole class of cases and show how
you can handle them by legitimate
operations I gave a couple of examples
last time like a TB parasitic gaps but
do it for the whole slew of them and of
course the broader task is take a look
at that massive data out there and see
if you can make some sense out of it
that's we we now have a criterion for
what make sense means make sense means
get a genuine explanation where a
genuine explanation means one that's
that that can be that meets the
conditions the crucial conditions of
learnability and evolvability
and if you can reduce it to merge you've
solved that problem because there's no
question of learnability
and the problem with evolvability as I
mentioned it's basically solved you have
to look at the details of how it worked
but we know it happened okay so if you
can get to that you have a genuine
explanation if you can reduce things to
pair merge you've come pretty close you
still have to ask the question of how
pair merge could have evolved but at
least that's an easier question than
lots of other things you can imagine we
would then like to try to show that the
other devices that seem critical for
explaining things like say phase theory
can be reduced
- third factor properties of minimal
computation they do in fact reduce
computation so if you could show that
that's another third factor condition
like resource or striction you'll have a
genuine explanation now that's the
general project but notice it and make
its again should be clearer going back
to my first lecture that this project
only arises if you accept a particular
version of what the whole enterprise of
linguistics is if you pick a particular
kind of answer the initial question
what's what is language what are we
doing the answer is the the enterprise
is one that attempts to deal with to
address that what I called earlier the
Galilean challenge the challenge that
was posed at the beginning of the
Scientific Revolution which translates
in our terms into capturing the basic
property of language the property of
that each of the Faculty of language
permits the generation of an infinite
number of structured expressions with
somatic interpretations and the option
of ancillary operation of mapping at the
one or another sensory motor condition
if you accept that project and then a
particular variant of that project which
not all people who do generative grammar
accept the second variant is to assume
that this is part of natural science ok
in other words follow what's called the
bio linguistic program take this
property to be a property of human
beings not some object out in the
external world which somehow magically
human beings connect with but just an
actual property of human beings then you
meet you have to meet the conditions of
evolve ability and learn ability then we
have the notion of genuine excellent
nation then all this mass of questions
arises often with solutions often not
notice again that not excepting this
enterprise is perfectly legitimate it's
a way of getting describing things in
ways which might be very useful it's
also useful for engineering projects
kind of Silicon Valley linguistics where
you don't really try to explain it just
get something that works lots of
interesting things you can do but this
is a very specific approach to language
saying it's part of natural science it's
trying to meet the galilean challenge if
that's the enterprise then these are the
kind of questions that arise well
there's another topic that I oughta at
least mention there's not much time for
it which is just left out entirely a
computational system has rules and atoms
things that are the smallest elements of
the computation I mentioned earlier that
if you have if you have merge and a one
element lexicon you know just one thing
in the lexicon one atom then in fact
internal merge gives you the successor
function and I showed some reasons to
think that that's a natural outcome but
in any event they've gotta be atoms and
I haven't said anything about those so
what are the atoms of computation and
right at this point we're moving to a
domain that I really didn't talk about
namely the general domain of cymatics so
what how does the domain of cymatics fit
into this enterprise well here you have
to be a little careful I have to ask
what you mean by semantics there's a
classical notion she goes way back in
history but in the modern period it's a
frigging charles sanders peirce tarski
Quine you know that tradition this
concept of semantics has basically to
two essential notions the one is one is
the notion truth and reference which are
essentially the same thing and the other
is the notion entailment with many
variants so let's take a look at those
two notions first of all the notion
entailment is not semantics its syntax
okay
it's called logical syntax entailment as
a matter of the formal relations among
expressions the world doesn't even have
to exist okay semantics is the field
that tries to relate the internal mental
computations to the world the actual
real world out there that semantics
that's truth and reference but
entailment is logical syntax and if you
look at what's called formal semantics
which are some of the richest and most
exciting work going on in the field in
the last couple of decades notice it's
all syntax it's all pure syntax and it's
an interesting kind of syntax it's sort
of analogous to phonology if you think
about the externalization process what
do we have the syntax generates a set of
objects we then want to externalize it
and that process of externalization has
two steps the first it's called you know
traditionally more phonemic sore
phonology in the sense that say Mars and
Allie Mars Hallie and I use the term but
it's the mapping of the syntactic
structures to some sort of phonetic form
the phonetic form
as a syntactic object of course and the
mapping is a it's a symbolic
manipulation so it's again syntax in the
general sense it's a particular part of
syntax I should say that this task of
mapping with generative phonology
mapping syntactic structures the
phonetic form has pretty much been
abandoned in modern phonology
contemporary phonology is mostly
optimality theory and that simply
doesn't look at this question okay its
deals with other questions but this
question of generative phonology which
was in fact the first thing that was
discussed back in the late forties early
fifties has been pretty much forgotten
but it's it's there you know it's a
problem that has to be solved if you are
concerned with externalization with how
language you know gets out there to be
sounds or signs the so one-to-one task
which is really part of syntax is
generative phonology mapping syntactic
objects to say narrow phonetics then
there's another task and that is taking
the narrow phonetics and telling us how
it relates to motions of the articulator
Zoar to sound waves or if you haven't be
doing sign now your gestures end up you
know actually being formed you know how
do you move your fingers and so on
that's phonetics acoustic and
articulatory phonetics if you think go
back to semantics formal semantics is
like phonology it's syntactic operations
setting the stage you hope for eventual
relation to the outside world just as
phonology generative phonology is
syntactic operations setting the stage
for the connotation to fill in
relates to moving your articulate errs
around okay which gets into the outside
world something outside language well
this then comes the question notice that
of all of the domains of the study of
language it's almost all syntax it's
what we call kind of narrow syntax just
forming the syntactic objects what I've
been talking about the last couple of
days another a part of syntax is
generous phonology another part of
syntax is formal semantics all of this
stuff is going on inside the head right
doesn't get to the outside world
it's neither phonetics and/or semantics
the of all of these areas the area of
formal semantics is different from the
other two in the way it's been pursued
which raises interesting questions it is
the only domain that has not been
subjected to the effort to find genuine
explanations so there's no effort within
formal semantics to ask what's the
simplest way to do it the problem is
let's just find a way to do it you know
if you can get a way to do it by
sticking in lots of lambdas and so on
and so forth okay we'll do it that way
but the question of what's the best way
to do it the way that really gives
explanations that really hasn't been
raised now that's not a criticism it's a
very hard question and so if it's not
been raised well hard questions often
tend not to be raised but one should
remember that it's a question to be
dealt with someday as formal semantics
develops this branch of syntax develops
it should go the way of the generative
syntax and generative phonology in the
case of generative phonology is a lot of
work on how to get the optimal way of
doing it in fact that
but things like sound pattern of English
are about and many other plenty of other
work and narrow syntax kind of stuff
we've been talking about formal
semantics that part of syntax the
question really hasn't arisen sooner or
later it should arise another
interesting aspect of formal semantics
is it's it's kind of tacitly assumed to
be invariant
so if you there's no proposals that
languages have parametric differences
and how you interpret say quantifiers
and variables there's a way of doing it
and if you do it that's universal which
is a very reasonable assumption because
if you think about the things that are
being investigated there's absolutely no
empirical evidence for them a child has
no evidence about any of them so if you
look at the literature you look at the
things that are people are studying
they're totally without evidence so
either they're just not accurate or if
they're accurate they're gonna be
universal so it does make sense to say
that this part of syntax is invariant
I've talked a little about whether
narrow syntax is invariant that's an
open question it doesn't look like it on
the surface but a lot of the work that's
been done is kind of restricting the
domain of variability of narrow syntax
to the point where you might imagine
that the core of narrower syntax what's
dealing with the galilean challenge the
yields of a struct the operations that
are yielding the semantically
interpreted objects maybe that doesn't
vary that we don't know it's an open
question could if it doesn't vary at all
then the variability of language is
entirely an externalization we're
certainly varies all over the map no not
any question there I mean not you know
it's not free there's very interesting
restrictions but a lot of variation
possible so that's the kind of picture
that seems to be emerging I think and it
leaves open this thing here where does
that fit in how do we relate this stuff
that's going on inside the head to the
outside world turns out not to be such a
simple question the in fact if you look
at the proposals and formal semantics we
they sound as if they're relating to the
outside world but when you look at them
they're actually not so it takes a model
theoretic approaches the elements of the
model are sort of one treats them as if
they're actually out there but in fact
if you look at the elements of the model
they're completely mental objects
there's nothing in the outside world
that is corresponds to those postulated
objects of the model so the model
theoretic semantics works fine you know
you can do all kind of things with it
study necessity you know so on and so
forth but it's all pure syntax it's not
getting to the outside world
what about event semantics which is a
very rich and productive field the kind
of neo David Stone in event semantics
well what are events I mean our events
things in the world does the world come
packaged in events actually it doesn't
you know events are our mental
constructions imposed on whatever is
going on so events are really internal
and we know that to try to count the
number of events that's going on it's
kind of meaningless so for example
thanks to Zeno we know that if you walk
across the room there's a continuous the
number of events is the power of the
continuum okay and same with anything
else you're looking at so there are
about as many events as you decide to
impose so event semantics which is very
productive and rich is again another
form of syntax so how do we get beyond
syntax well we have to look at the
notion of reference truth will depend on
reference and if we want to look at the
notion of reference we start naturally
by looking at the words that purport to
refer so you look at the literature on
reference mostly philosophical
literature say London is taken to be a
prototypical a referential word a lot of
problems arise say Kripke's polls of
belief when you try to ask questions
about London but is London a thing in
the outside world well you can ask
yourself so for example I can tell you
that I visited London before it was
burned down and rebuilt 20 miles up the
Thames so is there an object in the real
world which is physical because it can
be burned down but then can be rebuilt
somewhere else
with different physical objects and
looking differently is there such an
object in the physical world and the
outside in the material world certainly
not I could we could decide to rebuild
Carthage let's say what's gone a couple
thousand years ago we could rebuild it
somewhere else look different but it
could be carthage so whatever these
things are they're not names of things
in the outside world what about other
words are there in fact we might rest
the question whether there are any words
and language at all that refer to
anything in the outside world I think
the answer is there aren't some of the
reasons for this were given as far back
as classical Greece so for example
Aristotle
asked the question what is a house and
his answer was a house consists of the
amalgam of two different kinds of
elements in his metaphysics they're
matter and form so the matter of the
house is the timbers the bricks you know
the stuff it was made of the form of the
house is the design that what it's for
that what the architect had in mind how
it's used and so on so something might
look physically just like a house but in
fact be something totally different it
could be a library let's say it could be
garage you know could be a paperweight
for a giant could be all kinds of things
it depends on what the architect had in
mind and how it's used what it's for
basically but the properties of form are
not in the physical world
they're in the mental world know when
our Aristotle talked about this this is
from his point of view metaphysics in
fact it's in his book metaphysics but
when you go to some 17th century again
there was a kind of a cognitive
revolution and a lot of these ideas were
reinterpreted in terms of modes of
cognition which i think is the right way
to look at them so reinterpreting it and
that those terms a house is something
that we constructed our minds which has
a material element but of course the
crucial part of it is what Aristotle
called the form that's something that's
part of our mental operations so when we
use the word house we're not referring
to an object and we are and we're
carrying out the act of referring like
I'm referring to that object over there
but the word house is not referring okay
you think about every word in the
language it's exactly the same
there's a example even earlier than
Aristotle the pre-socratic example used
by a Heraclitus who argued that you
can't cross the same river twice because
when you cross it the second time it's
completely different physical object and
you're a different physical object so
it's impossible to cross the same river
twice of course we do cross the same
river twice which simply tells us that
our notion river does not refer to
anything in the material world it refers
to a construction that we developed and
if you start playing around with how do
you individuate these objects becomes
pretty tricky so for example take River
again say the the Charles River which I
used to cross on the way to work up and
back every day in boss mode suppose you
take the Charles River and you reverse
the course of the water goes the
opposite direction okay
you've still the Charles River I suppose
you diverted into a different direction
because you don't want it to go into the
bay but somewhere else
still the Charles River in fact you can
play around with it and make all sorts
of massive changes in the physical
object and will still be the Charles
River on the other hand there are
trivial changes that will prevent it
from being a river at all so suppose you
put barriers along the side and you
start using it for say commercial
tankers going up and down now it's
between two points then it's a canal
it's not a river anymore
suppose you even make a more miniscule
change you make what and physics is
called a phase change from the liquid to
the glassy state tiny change almost
undetectable instruments but now it has
a hard surface and you paint a line down
the middle and
you start using it to commute to Boston
okay now it's a highway you've made an
almost undetectable change if you play
around with it some more you can see
that you can make huge changes in the
physical object stays the Charles River
you can make virtually undetectable
changes it's not a river at all take a
look at any other word in the language
you finds pretty much the same so it may
be that language simply does not have
the concept of truth and reference at
all which means it doesn't have
semantics
there is no semantics there's syntax and
there's modes of use that using the
objects you've constructed roughly
what's called pragmatics it could turn
out that the whole study of language
reduces to syntax and pragmatics with
syntax having these many different
variants in fact my guess is that's
probably what we're gonna find when we
when we pursue the topic further that
raises many very interesting questions
so for example take these terms like
house or River London whatever you like
where do they come from if we look at
animal symbolic systems a very striking
feature of them is that the atoms of
these systems the elements within them
do in fact pick out identifiable
physical events okay so you take the
take the B that's has my name attached
to it if it's a honeybee and does the
right source of things then it's you
know it does the famous waggle dance it
flies out to a flower comes back to the
waggles and the things that it's doing
are one-to-one identified with
particular physical phenomena
to the B the distance to the flower the
height of the flower the orientation in
which you have to fly and quality the
flower and so on every animal system we
know is like that monkey calls for
example if there's something we call a
warning call what it means is the leaves
are fluttering in a certain way that
monkey reflexively emits some noise
other monkeys run away maybe an Eagles
coming something like that animal
systems seem to be like this completely
the human systems are not like this at
all that raises a very interesting
question another one of those mysteries
where did this come from
and if you look at the array of
mysterious things there are plenty of
them and they fall into a couple of
categories two categories one category
is the category of mysteries where we
just can't get the right kind of
evidence because it's just empirically
impossible for us to do it we can't go
back say 200 thousand years and hear
what people were saying and in principle
yo its it's an empirically possible
it's a theoretically possible test but
you just can't do it that's one kind of
mystery but then there's the deeper
kinds of mysteries which have to do with
things like selecting the sequence given
by the Hilbert epsilon operator when
you're trying to form a coordination or
more generally just picking what
sentence you're going to produce and
these kinds of mysteries are the kind
where you really don't even have bad
ideas
there's no idea as to how to proceed
those we could ask what that category of
mysteries is like could mean that some
restriction on human cognitive
capacities a lot of debate about this
most
scientists vigorously reject the idea
that there could be a limit on cognitive
capacities but if you think about it
it's just strange position if humans are
similar or part of the organic world not
say angels we ought to have the same
properties as other kinds of organisms
some respects every organism we know has
scope of cognitive capacity and limits
of cognitive capacity and in fact the
two are kind of logically related
whatever is yielding the scope is also
imposing certain limits and you might
ask why humans should be exempt from
this so I hope the former phonologists
and Samantha cysts in the audience who
are now sin tactician z-- will have
questions may the questions begin yes
here in the front down here yep the mic
is coming well first of all thank you so
much and I would like to ask you
considering all this fascinating theory
how could you define madness for us
define madness in Portuguese locota
given what you have said so far could
you define madness and and I could go I
would like to go a little further and
ask you what could you say about these
writers I'm thinking people like Samuel
Beckett or Antonin Artaud Antonin Artaud
and the French one whose texts are
always dealing us this
being seen thanks with disturbing syntax
yeah okay literature would you maybe
also like to comment on Samuel Beckett
or the second author was otto Anton uh
octo whose writings are about disturbing
syntax yes no not about but whose
writing are always really disturbing
syntax oh okay thank you know a good bit
of creative literature makes use of the
properties of language but purposely
distorts them to impose tasks for the
reader so if you read say serious
literary criticisms a book like William
empson's seven types of ambiguity which
is a kind of a famous work of the 1950s
Empson argues that poetry in particular
he said is designed to have actually
completely minimal use of language to
impose on the reader the task of
creating interpretations and using the
readers imagined of resources to
reconstruct what's not presented in the
text so poetry would be different from
say a literal description which tells
you everything that's happening because
it's calling on the reader to create and
invent theirs
if you go back further of the classical
aesthetic theory like Slagel for example
Coleridge borrowed from we're familiar
with this mostly from Coleridge but it
comes from Schlegel he argued that he
had an interesting argument that he
argued that poetry was the most exalted
of the arts and he pointed out that when
you talk about the poetic quality and
music you're talking about its
imaginative character when you talk
about the musical quality of poetry
you're talking about something less
significant you know the way it sounds
or something and then he asked the
question why should poetry have this
special status and he argued that every
art form has some medium so sculpture
deals with marble painting deals with
colors you know each one has its medium
poetry also has a medium language but
language differs from the others and
it's inherently creative it has an
inherently creative aspect that's the
galilean challenge again recognized it's
got this capacity of creativity
internally to it
so therefore the art form that makes use
of this modality will be uniquely
creative and in fact will be used in
such a way as to draw from the reader
the the imaginative resources that are
inherent and the in the medium itself
now when you get to say Samuel Beckett
or literary artists in general they're
playing with this all the time for
trying to compel the reader to think and
create and imagine I wouldn't call it
madness Plato did Plato argued that
there was recognized there's various
levels of creativity there's the kind of
creativity that exists and say normal
language use when you're kind of like
constantly creating but there's a higher
form of creativity that has this true
aesthetic value and a Plato argued that
that's as a form of madness
so okay question over here
thank you I would like to know what your
perspective is about natural semantics
metalanguage the approach that provides
sixty-four words that are supposed to be
semantic Prime's and that provides a
semantic foundation for universal
grammar oh that my proposed a foundation
for that do you have a comment on
natural semantics which provides a meta
language of 64 developed by an Africa
and Qatar in Australia I don't but I can
repeat it again it was by Godard and
another pika another Sica Australian
well I think it's interesting work she's
trying to find fundamental elements that
appear and somatic systems generally
then it's I'm not really very conversant
with the work but I've looked at it and
I think it's in you know it's a
promising virtual direction she has some
interesting insights but it's an attempt
to find as I understand that the basic
elements that can't that are
constitutive of the knight of the
systems of natural semantics in the
world which is a reasonable project over
here
Gabe in the red shirt hi um so it seems
like one of the main philosophical
motivations for positing an externalist
notion of reference is that you need
that in order to get some notion of
objective truth so when I make claims
about London say I'm not just expressing
some perspective I have on the world I'm
making a claim which can be
independently evaluated as true or false
do you think that this sort of
internalist notion of reference that you
have is there a way of reconstructing
objective truth or are we kind of
condemned to have a merely subjective
I'm it's true if I'm talking about
London if I say I take the sentence I I
gave as an example suppose I say again
something like this I visited London
last year before it was burned down by a
fire and was rebuilt 20 miles up the
Thames that's a statement that can be
evaluated but the question is is there a
physical entity identifiable in the
outside world that I'm picking out and I
don't think there is I'm talking about
the world undoubtedly there is what
Aristotle called the material element so
you know it's 20 miles up not 50 miles
up that it was this place that people
lived in now it's some totally different
place it's still London meaning what the
criteria of individuation and
identification are in fact mental
conditions but notice that that
shouldn't surprise us too much because
that's true of cognition in general we
don't have what's called immediate
experience is already constructed by the
mind you know there is sensory
stimulation hitting your retina but
that's not what you
they were two experienced depends on
what were called in the 17th century
modes of cognition ways of interpreting
the data that's immediate experience so
the most immediate experience we have
the most we're most confident about and
certain about is already constructed
whatever is objective is something we
postulate we hope that there is a real
world out there which is somehow giving
us the data that we experience but what
that real world is for that we go to the
physicists and they have some very
strange answers so for example you go to
the Institute for Advanced Study and
talk to the late John Wheeler great
physicist for him the world consisted of
answers to questions that we posed
that's what he calls the it from bit
there's no world at all we just ask
questions we get answers that's the
world ok that's what he says but
whatever it is it's something we
postulate it's not something we
experience so in fact if the words we
used to refer also have this property it
shouldn't really surprise us that much
that we are different from other
organisms in that respect one of the
many respects from Gabe Gabe
another game they say that a picture is
worth a thousand words let me stand up
but we might say that a picture entails
a thousand sentences and your picture of
entailment is as a kind of syntactic
relationship but in this kind of case we
have a relationship between domains that
very different syntaxes and so i'm
curious about what is your general view
of entailment coreference other kinds of
apparent semantic relations that
obtained between representational
modalities
I don't know that I can do justice yes
let me give a one-sentence version sorry
what is until if entailment is syntactic
how do we entail from vision to language
if entailment is syntactic how do we
entail from vision to language well
that's not until meant that's inference
which is something quite different
so entailment is a formal relation among
syntactic objects you know you take a
look at quantification theory tells you
how this syntactic object relates to
that syntactic object inference is an
act that we carry out very mysterious
act we have we face problems there's
some thing out there that's puzzling you
know why does across-the-board deletion
work let's say and then you invent you
somehow come construct a theoretical
idea which you then try to ask does this
account for the basic properties of the
data nobody knows how that works if you
take Corson's Jerseyan studying physics
at UCLA I'm pretty sure there isn't a
course on methodology there might be in
the sociology department but it's very
unlikely to find one and the physics or
the chemistry department of course there
is no method it's just something that
you manage to do somehow some people do
it better than others but nobody knows
how it's done this actually relates to a
concept that I just was using as if it's
straightforward and neutral but it isn't
that's descriptive adequacy so one of
the things we want to do in studying
linguistics is to make sure that our
explanations meet the condition of
script of adequacy at least we get the
facts right but that's a very complex
notion what's descriptive adequacy and
it's not just all the data you have
around for one thing the data that are
out there are not pure data they're not
data that specifically come from the
particular source that you're trying to
investigate that's why scientists do
experiments instead of just you know
cataloging things that go on the world
the reason every experiment is a high
level abstraction each experiment is a
very complex abstraction theory-driven
which says I'm gonna throw away lots of
stuff that's going on and look at this
particular thing because I think somehow
this particular thing bears on an
explanation of what might be going on in
the world that's that's the most
elementary part of science it's already
trying to abstract away from all the
noise out there and seeing what might be
useful for explaining something and
those things are the properties of
inference but you know the way you learn
how to do that in the sciences is just
by watching other people do it you say
here's the way it was done I'll see if I
can do that myself but there's nothing
you can you can't teach it you know you
can't teach how to carry out successful
inference you learn it the way kind of
the way a carpenter learns his craft you
know by watching skilled artisans do it
and you sort of pick it up but I think
that's about all the one can say about
inference time of course there's you
know philosophical discussion of it but
you have to really cautious about the
discussion so for example one of the
ideas that people scientists commonly
uses the notion of poppers notion of
falsifiability so if you have a theory
that can be falsified
real and if you get a negative result
you throw the theory out every scientist
knows you never do that if you get data
that falsifies your theory what you
usually do is say well I'll put it on
the shelf
maybe somebody will figure out what's
wrong with it but if the theory looks
good I don't care if it's falsified you
know and if you look at the history of
science that happens all the time on
crucial cases you know so they're kind
of rules of thumb but they don't really
work that's not the way scientific
enquiries done or rational inquiry in
any area you know not just Natural
Sciences that the sciences of the best
place to look because it's most refined
you know they're you really have deep
results and so on you learn how things
are done but it's part of just ordinary
life you had asked earlier I just had a
clarification question probably I
misunderstood so it is for dealing how
we dealt with head raising over there up
on the board so I just wanted to clarify
that just want a question about head
raising oh you've got over here on the
board yeah so my question was the parent
head raising is it the set C T and T P T
V P or is it C and the said T V P once
can you repeat that please is it the
pairs in the head raised in case T - C
case is it the set C T and T V P or is
it C under satty VP I didn't hear you it
precisely but the question was that when
you were discussing head raising and you
had the set T VP TVP yeah which then
further raises to C so the new set
formed SCT or is the set form to C along
with T V V is the new set that is formed
see along with TVP no just T
actually if you want to get the right
answer the source of this is sitting
right here so if I'm not giving the
answer correctly you fix it but I think
you have TVP yeah you've got see inside
the lexicon so you take C and T form the
pair C key that's just some new thing
out there you haven't had an
accessibility cause both of the elements
are inaccessible
now that you have C T sitting out there
and you have the old TVP you can just
merge them that gives you the the thing
you're trying to so how does it how is
it exactly different from external merge
them how exactly is it different from
external merge from peril
well that's an interesting question like
why can't you that's one of the problems
that he said and I have been
corresponding about for a while so you
could imagine that after you've
constructed CT TVP you start off
somewhere else and you construct some
other T V P and then you take this C T
and you stick it on to that that would
be an illegitimate operation but the
question and I thought for a while that
that was a serious objection to this but
on reflection I don't really think it is
because what you're getting that way is
something you can always produce and
it's illegitimate because the you're
just getting a case where the T that you
have up there is trying to be a copy of
something down below but it isn't it's
just a repetition of it so it's it's
just something that's incoherent and you
could always do that you could not not
quite apart from this operation after
you've constructed TVP you could make up
some other things
XP and just merge that on and it would
be nonsense so you can always construct
nonsense and I think this would just end
up being a particulars ends notice that
there's a subtle difference between the
illegitimate we do want the system to
generate non grammatical constructions
that but we don't want it to generate
things that violate linguistic
principles that's quite different
there's quite a distinct thing like it
takes a negative polarity items things
like say ever you can't say John was
ever here but you can say I doubt that
John was ever here but notice that in
order to generate I doubt that John was
ever here you first have to generate
thought John was ever here so we
certainly want to allow the system to
generate ungrammatical sentences
otherwise we can't get dramatical
sentences and in fact we're perfectly
happy to have the system generate things
like metaphors that deviate from normal
argument structure phrases like misery
loves company for example which violate
the selectional restrictions of the verb
we want lots of things like that but we
don't want the system to generate things
like the books is on the table or a
violation of island constraints that's a
crucial difference not a very in many
ways not a very clear one you have to
think about it but that distinction just
has to be there and this kind of case
that you're suggesting would be one in
which you're essentially creating
something nonsense nonsense achill but
not violating linguistic principles as
distinct from parallel merge does it's a
subtle but interesting distinction
Oumar over here well okay thanks I
really enjoyed these lectures and I just
wanted to ask you what role does
language change what role does the study
of language study change to play in
increasing our understanding of language
in general quite alone I mean languages
don't change in arbitrary ways they
change in very specific ways and by
looking at the kinds of ways in which
language change we get evidence about
what the system is like what are the
dimensions in which language can change
and which can't change and what what
kinds of phenomena could cause that
change notice this is very similar to
the study of language acquisition we're
asking how bits of data that come around
lead to modifications of the system
that's in the mind the language
acquisition does it in one way language
change does it another way so it's a
probe into the kinds into the structure
of the system that you're investigating
what kind of things can happen what
can't happen what makes them happen what
doesn't have an effect and so on whether
it's language acquisition or language
change or you know dialect things like
when you when you're mixing pieces of
one one dialect into another or forgot
the name for that also tells you things
it can happen in certain ways not other
ways lots of ways of studying the system
you have a complex system you perturb it
in all sorts of different ways you learn
things over here
hi my question is about you saying that
truth and reference are essentially the
same thing because while we were
listening to the lecture and doing the
Q&A everyone's taking notes in these
really different ways reference I'm
actually taking notes in three different
ways I have an AI AB transcribing
everything using an NLP then I have this
kind of like josef novak concept map of
my own stuff and I'm also texting my
friends like oh my god Noam Chomsky said
truth and references basically the same
thing so why are they not exactly the
same thing why did you say they are
essentially the same thing and yeah that
I mean that sentence was like she was
intrigued by your statement that truth
and reference are essentially the same
thing and she asks
she says she's familiar with three very
different kinds of reference but she
wonders why you didn't say they're
exactly the same thing maybe you want to
elaborate on that issue well you know a
theory of truth says typically I have a
name and a predicate and the name refers
to an object out there and the predicate
either does or doesn't apply to that
object and if it does apply the
statement subject predicate is true so
if I say you know the Sun is in the sky
the idea is the Sun refers to a
particular object that's reference in
the sky is a certain property my
statement the Sun is in the sky is true
just in case that property holds of the
object for language that that doesn't
really work for the sciences it it does
work but it does work by stipulation
when you're
tests which are doing is constructing
inventing concepts which do you hope
have the property of reference so when a
linguist develops the concept phoneme
let's say they're saying I hope that
there's something in the external world
that this thing that this concept refers
to if a physicist defines electron say
they're saying I hope there's a thing
out there that this one the one refers
to okay so scientists are essentially
trying to construct systems that do meet
the referential criterion and therefore
will be producing true or false
sentences which can be evaluated by you
know by experiment or observation but
ordinary language just doesn't work like
that
at all the concepts that we have involve
complicated interactions between what
Aristotle called form and matter you
know just fact about natural language in
contrast animal communication systems
seem pretty close to that of course they
don't make true statements i'm indy you
know the bee who's waggling is not
trying to make a true statement he's
just doing whatever the internal
structure of the bee is telling him to
do
[Music]
so can can we go back and maybe get a
little bit of expansion on what you went
through yesterday on a DB DB why don't
we let that go till tomorrow because
it's a long story
