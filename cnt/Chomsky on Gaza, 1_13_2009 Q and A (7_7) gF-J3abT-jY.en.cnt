professor Chomsky given the fact that
there are dozens of schools in the
Boston area and over at least over a
hundred thousand students that could
pretty easily organize themselves would
you support an area divestment campaign
divesting university and college funds
in those businesses that are doing
business with Israel on the model of the
south african anti-apartheid divestment
campaign and I'm not hearing very well
I'm afraid would you support a
divestment campaign publicly on the
model of the South African boy huh yeah
well that Naomi Klein is just cadet
analogy is brought up a lot but I'd urge
you to pay some serious attention to the
South African boy good it was important
and it had an effect but look at when it
had an effect on the South African I'm
there was an academic boycott of South
Africa back in the 60s but on very
narrow grounds because the universities
were excluding lags okay so you know it
didn't want to support racist
universities but that doesn't work in
this case the the real boycott that you
know began to be a mass movement with
effects was mostly in the 1980s that was
after decades of serious education and
organizing it was at a time when
American business was opposed publicly
opposed to apartheid when congressional
resolutions were condemning apart height
when mayor's were getting arrested you
know protesting this in that by the time
you had really mass public opposition to
apartheid yes then you could have a
boycott movement but that preliminary
work has not been done and call for you
know call for a boycott is a tactical
move it's not a principled move it's a
tactic you know I have to ask what its
consequences are and I think if you
think through the consequences before
you've done the work
the educational organizing work have
probably backfire no we just you know
screams about anti-semitism more support
for Israeli atrocities and so on so take
a look at the history it's worth looking
at incidentally by the 80s it did get to
the point where Congress passed
legislation and barring a US trade with
South Africa that's very different from
where we are now where Congress almost
unanimously supports every Israeli
atrocity that comes along with Dennis
Kucinich and two other people voting
against it also it's worth remembering
that the Reagan administration violated
the Congressional legislation and in
fact trade with South Africa increased
after the legislation and at the peak of
of the administration that's Reagan
Colin Powell and the rest as late as
1988 just right before the collapse of
apartheid the US the Pentagon Palace
Pentagon declared that the African
National Congress was one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
that's Nelson Mandela and the African
National Congress in Colin Powell's
Pentagon 1988 in fact Mandela was on the
terrorist list until a couple of months
ago I finally took him off because the
African National Congress was a
terrorist organization that did carry
out terror undoubtedly and I'm you know
no the South African literature but i'm
sure they condemned it for you know
hiding in public places and not standing
out in a field with uniforms so they
could be shot down and so on and so so
yes I think it's something to think
about but also to think about see in
fact if we could ever get to the point
where you had enough active activism and
organization to even
Boyka you could do something much
simpler get the u.s. to join the
international consensus as the majority
of the population already wants them to
do then I'll talk about what good so I
don't think it's a it just doesn't seem
to me like a sensible tactic professor
Chomsky I just had a two-part question
what the first part of the question is
what exactly is the planned outcome is
Israel's planned outcome after the
recent bombings and recent action
against the Gaza Strip and post-invasion
do they are they really after just
disarming Hamas is military wing or do
they have a complete coop land and also
my second question is where could people
find reliable death tolls and
information about destruction in Gaza
and in Israel because I see you know a
variety of numbers being thrown around
about how many thousands of rockets are
launched into Israel but I never see
much of a death toll associated with the
thousands of rockets I'm not sure really
what their capacity is and you know some
people say that they're resembling of
bottle rockets I don't know but I'd like
to know more about them and I'd like to
see if there is legitimately collateral
damage in being you know conducted in
Palestine or if it is in fact overkill
well you know I don't think there's any
question that its massive overkill let
me just look at the official casualty
figures in the current invasion the
latest i saw it's coming close to a
thousand palestinians which is almost
undoubtedly and under estimate because
they don't count people who died because
you know they starve or can't get water
or can't go to a hospital and so on and
i think i don't know i think this like a
maybe half a dozen israeli soldiers or
something like that some of them killed
by friendly fire I mean
can't talk about overkill you know we're
out of that league for reliable
information about the questions you're
asking the best place I know to look as
in the major Israeli human rights group
b'tselem which has regular publications
in English pamphlets you can find them
on the web be ' TSE LEM and they give
very judicious careful analyses of
everything that's going on as to the
numbers killed by the Rockets in the
last year's I mean you know I forgot the
exact number maybe it doesn't or
something like that and it's just you
know this but but you can find them and
as for numbers of rockets well you can
find them to like I quoted the figure
7700 shells attacking northern Gaza
before the onslaught in july in jun 19
2013 2006 that comes from Human Rights
Watch and you know they do analysis one
information I white phosphorus yeah it's
coming from Human Rights Watch which is
which tends to be pretty supportive of
Israel incidentally no although they do
good work but its elements best source I
know as to Israel's plans well maybe you
know I told you what I think about the
reasons for the invasion and I presume
if that's correct that the plans are to
make those reasons work the plan is to
get quiet peace and quiet quiet of the
graveyard if it has to be which will
enable Israel to carry out its criminal
acts on the west bank with us support
now without any air feirense I presume
that's the plan
Thanks thank you yep
we are stood and the crossroad and this
crucial
change in this
we're going to see
