good evening and welcome to this special
live version of John Birch Society
roundup here on Somerville community
access television tonight we've actually
gone out and captured from his home in
Lexington Noam Chomsky and we're holding
him hostage until he recants everything
that he said over the past thirty years
I'm Barry Crimmins and it's a pleasure
to be here actually this is dead air
live I just know that I live in
Somerville and I get to watch the
excellent John Birch Society program and
you should too because it is information
that we all need to know other people
believe it's a pleasure to be here with
dr. Chomsky a man who actually writes
faster than I can read I bye everybody I
have your stuff delivered to my house
each day we're discussing tonight the
first hundred days of the Clinton
administration and a change which was
the theme of the campaign people in the
and on the street and on the street
interviews talked about health care and
jobs and change what kind of change do
you think well the it's true the Clinton
administration the Clinton campaign
focused on the magic word change and the
Clinton one of their main documents that
the campaign put out was in fact
entitled mandate for change and things
were really going to be new they didn't
tell you that the phrase mandate for
change is one that they borrowed
actually it had been invented by Dwight
Eisenhower's PR people but they were so
innovative yeah so and in fact that
tells you about how much change you can
expect the same kind of mandate for
change that Eisenhower had is the kind
of mandate for change that the Clinton
people have now there is a mandate for
change there's no doubt about that the
general population has been moving
almost off the spectrum of policy
choices
however it's not too well-known
but right through the 1980s the same was
true so if you looked at public opinion
studies through the 80s the population
was strongly opposed to almost all the
major Reagan policies right through the
80s the general population was drifting
towards a kind of New Deal style you
know social welfare type system I mean
the population was when people were
asked you know would you like to have
social spending or military spending it
was social spending a huge margin right
education welfare health and so on and
so forth and there has been that mandate
for change all along and there still is
and if you look at the popular attitudes
on major issues there's pretty clear
attitudes on things like health and jobs
and trade issues and industrial policy
and so on however if you compare those
attitudes with the policy choices the
printed range of policy choices around
they're very remote from one another so
the mandate for change is there but the
change is not very likely to come well
it's the healthcare for example look
they matter-of-factly throw out Canadian
for health care as is even a possibility
now that's an interesting that's one of
the interesting cases I mean the
business community is almost entirely
opposed to a what we call a Canadian
style program single-payer later then
that's how you need to know with Clinton
that essentially ends that means the
press is almost 100% opposed to it if
you look at press commentary right
it's about it's almost unanimous in
support of what they call manage
competition now occasionally they even
tell you why so for example the New York
Times had a and one of their many wrong
studies of this at a very upbeat big
front-page story you know running onto
an inside page about the marvels of
managed competition using California as
a model and it's a bureaucratic
nightmare we layer after layer of
bureaucracy and administration and
complexity and so on toward the end they
they asked some health care health
industry executive
what about what about the possibility of
a single-payer plan and he said well
that's not politically possible and the
reason is because it offers nothing to
the insurance companies right which is
exactly right offers nothing to the
insurance companies now what about
popular attitude really not depends loge
have to be careful in interpreting
answers to questions but a considerable
majority of the population has been
consistently in favor of a single-payer
program they can look across the border
and see what happens right all right the
last poll I saw it a couple days ago is
buried in The New York Times was about
60% in favor but it's not an option and
it will not be an option until people
make clamour enough and make enough
pressure so as to put on the political
agenda the things that they want in this
case the population has been pretty well
still there the probably program that
will be initiated we sort of see the
contours of it will in fact leave plenty
of room for the insurance companies and
it will still be a bureaucratic
nightmare with the u.s. system as
compared with say Canada or England or
continental Europe and so on spends an
enormous amount on just administered of
course alright and you know that doesn't
when they make those calculate I mean
maybe five times as much or ten times as
much not strong numbers when they make
those calculations they don't even count
in the major cost right they only talk
about the cost of doctors how about the
cost of the person who has to fill out
those forms I I mean it's a nightmare
and it will probably continue that way
well there's a case where there's a
mandate for change but unless there's a
lot of popular pressure the change is
going to come well I think it was
telling that it seemed like Clinton was
tunnelled Clinton was telling us during
the campaign we needed to run this
country more like a corporation and I I
sort of think it already is run an awful
lot like an awful lot of corporations
well it it is in one striking respect
namely the people who run it are from
corporations right or from corporate law
firms that are from investment firms and
so on and their basic concern not
surprisingly is the interests of
investors
right and in fact that's something that
goes back to the origins of of the
Republic the and not the interests of
the people that actually have to go out
there and be wage slaves not the general
public is supposed to be and there's a
theory about this the general public is
supposed to be passive
they're supposed to be spectators not
participants and the participants are
the people you know who have what they
call the national interest right at
heart but the national interest
primarily means the interests of the
wealthy the interests of NGOs here is
the interest of owners and so on there's
never really been much of a secret about
this it's and it's not very surprising
that people who dominate the
decision-making apparatus who can you
know who control the resources who can
make the decisions that affect other
people will naturally use that power to
influence the government now you know
the general population can make a
difference but they've got to we've got
to work on it there are some interesting
cases where popular grassroot pressure
is making a difference and is putting
popular attitudes into the political
arena one striking case has to do with
the north american free trade agreement
all right it's a very striking kate
conscience free trader well it's very
interesting to watch the course of that
this was in visit that you know this is
an agreement which is going to bring
supposedly Canada Mexico and the United
States together in a huge trading area
the major question is you know that the
big disparity is Mexico in the United
States a very see there's never been an
effort to make a free trade bloc between
a well they're afraid a lot of workers
from Arkansas going to flee to Mexico to
get a job now what it's not so much of
the workers market now that well no work
a lot there really yeah right yeah which
is going on anyway I mean for example
General Motors is closing planting close
about two dozen plants and North America
states in Canada it's the biggest
employer in Mexico because you can get
labor a fraction of the car right under
high repression there's no danger of
unions the union leaders can be beaten
Kaldur very little in the way of
environmental standard so naturally it's
a that's a way to shift work over there
well now the North American Free Trade
Agreement doubtless everyone agrees will
be very good for investors
you know what the effect will be on the
general population that's an open
question but it will have a large effect
that's agreed not strikingly it's a
secret agreement it was designed to be
pushed through without the general
public knowing and even people and
members of Congress Saturday and they
still have a hard time when getting a
copy of the flag enhance account ceiling
pages long and well what happened need
your answer tomorrow that's exactly what
happened I mean the leak the agreement
was signed by the three presidents on
August 12th right in the middle of the
electoral campaign at that point it was
still a secret agreement nobody knew it
was in it it was then supposed to go to
Congress on what's go fast track writing
Congress wouldn't bother looking at it
the according to US trade law there is a
major trade law 1974 a trade law that
establishes an input into trade related
issues primarily through the labor
movement it established something they
call the labor Advisory Committee which
is supposed to provide advice and an
analysis on any trade related
legislation that's the main citizen
input well you know they were informed
that their report is due in mid
September September 9th they were given
the document a couple of thousand pages
of text one day before to ensure that
they couldn't even meet you know I mean
utter contempt for democracy and in fact
to this day we would remove a lot they
passed the way they the way Bush is
trying to push it through from what I
understand it would literally remove a
lot of the constitutional authority that
the Congress had in fact that's part of
the purpose of it is to take away
authority from democratically elected
bodies right that are with a state or a
local or federal and put them in
Lock them into a treaty arrangement
which where decisions will be made by
executive Commission's mostly of
Representatives of Business Corporations
or lawyers and so on but the public
won't influence it well the striking
thing about this is that although it was
being pushed through as relatively as a
virtually a secret executive agreement
and although Congress had abdicated any
rule and although the business community
is overwhelmingly for it and the press
is just about a hundred percent for
right nevertheless Knoblauch has been
opposed and what's more of that public
opposition took sufficient form so that
it is now threatening the passage of the
legislation right now they can't they
probably can't pass it in its present
form well I mean what elected official
who doesn't have a chance to read
something that's that extensive and that
for our reaching could could go back to
his/her constituency and say I made an
informed decision see the difference
between this and healthcare striking in
both this case in the healthcare case
the public has pretty well and there's a
majority opinion in the NAFTA case that
opinion has turned into activism and it
has therefore compelled the
administration to respond to it and
they're trying to evade the public
pressure in fact just the public
pressure really has to do that's not the
issue isn't should it be an agreement or
shouldn't there the issue is what kind
of an agreement should there be right
the current agreement the one they're
trying to ram through protects property
rights right it protects the rights of
property and wealth period nothing about
environmental rights nothing about
workers or safety the public pressure is
trying to put in teeth in the to enforce
labor rights and environmental
protection now just a couple of days ago
almost in secret the Clinton
administration and announced that they
are not going that there will be no
teeth and the there are several
Commission's that look into labor rights
and environmental protection but they
said well these will just be advisory
commissions
won't even be able to carry out
investigations only what they call it
studies and they'll be able to give
advice but if we're biased and that we
wish if the general okay yeah that sort
of thing now again here's a clear case
where democracy could function if the
public does become organized if the
grassroots groups which are mostly labor
and environmental religious and other
groups if they are remain active on the
issue well they can force through those
changes otherwise not and if they don't
some of those jobs that the gentleman on
the top of the show are talking about
our gone well they're drifting that way
anyway I'll continue to I mean the
there's a very clear agenda here the
agenda is to protect the rights of the
wealthy and to protect the rights of
property the general public may what
happens that the country may decline but
the us-based industry and us-based
investment that's doing quite well right
and we were discussing before around air
about Eastern Europe Eastern Europe fits
right into this it takes eight let's be
concrete take General Motors and the
biggest corporation their closing point
where plants here are trying to they're
the biggest employer in Mexico because
they can get very cheap labor and a kind
of high repression low wage area they're
also opening plants in Eastern Europe
they just opened the big high-tech 700
million dollar plant in East Germany and
the international financial press the
business press is very frank about what
it's about I mean they say look they're
they're opening with very high
expectations there's tremendous
unemployment almost 50 percent
unemployment and they can get wages I'm
now quoting at 40 percent the cost of
the pampered Western workers Western
workers are pampered by writing this
press is concerned they under they get
them for forty percent the the wages and
no benefits in longer hours so it's
terrific for profits not very good for
the people in the way and the pampered
you know West Poland's even better
they're they get them for 10 percent of
the wage level because the government's
repressive enough to be able to break
strikes and so on and so forth they're
opening plants in Russia for the same
reason you get
educated labor skilled labor very
low-cost healthy people you know that
very good health system but very
low-cost and it's against the new
third-world running up which undercuts
Western levels and they literally could
start stealing jobs from Mexico I think
yeah and it's very frank I mean capital
can move you know you can remove
investments from that's that's going to
move it look that's what they're
breaking the borders down exactly you
want to be able to move capital but keep
labor fixed right that means if you look
at the country as a geographical entity
it may very well decline if you look at
the country as a place if you define the
United States is us-based corporation
right they're not declining they're
doing very nicely right now speaking a
us-based workers one of one of the Clyde
promise of the Clinton campaigns with
the was to deal with the rights of
laborers labor unions seems do that
seems to disappear during these first
hundred days that's a serious issue
eight in nineteen ninety two was
striking a year in that respect this is
nineteen ninety two one very striking
thing apathy the caterpillar corporation
major corroboration right brought in
strike breakers the break strike now
that hasn't happened for sixty years in
a major corporation and it's a is
unknown in the industrial world what we
call here permanent replacement workers
right apart abs come in and take the job
replacements worker as a replacement
word for scab not the fact that a major
corporation felt was strong enough to do
this is an interesting reflection of the
success in breaking down the labor
movement and shifting power from the
general working population which had
just met everybody to be to the rich and
the owners it took this has been going
on for a long time it took it
accelerated during the Reagan years
being when Reagan broke the patio strike
right right off that set the thing in
mode once you can get rid of those
people I you know once they when
caterpillar was doing it that really set
a signal I mean the Wall Street Journal
had a study of executives right after
that and they
about 40% of them are planning to do the
same thing well that's so far off the
spectrum that the United States was
actually condemned by the International
Labour Organization in been affiliate
which is extremely rare they never say
anything negative about one of the big
rich countries but they said that the
United States should review its labor
practices well we labor when it
supported Clinton was expecting and
hoping but one of the first things that
they would do in the first hundred days
would be to introduce legislation to put
the United States back into the spectrum
of you know industrial society rights
they haven't disappeared haven't seen
anything about them
nothing is disappeared as Clinton's
commit commitment to the Haitian people
yeah well I mean there was a whole draft
of campaign promises of which one of
them was to to do something about the
atrocities in Haiti where the democratic
government was overthrown a brutal cool
and has just led the tremendous
persecution and tens of thousands of
refugees coming one of the first moves
that he made was to rescind those
promises now not only rescind them he
actually harshman's the bush program and
it says nothing said of just turning
back refugees on the open seas they
actually put a blockade around Haiti
right which is radical violation of
international law you can't blockade in
the country right
they put a blockade there to make sure
that refugees don't come out there is
some good that's for the wrong gift that
you know if we decide what's right or
right not then you know they stay and
get beaten and tortured and killed
because we decide that's for the right
right the there is some talk about a
diplomatic solution which will
reinstitute the elected president
president are Stede but they'll believe
that when I see it my expectation is
that some arrangement will be worked out
in which our seed will be given the
formal presidency but deprived of power
what the United States has government
has opposed is the fact that and what
really appalled them is that I recede
president seed came into power
with the support of a very lively
grassroots move right Louisville ah so
it's got a big popular movement which
was really bringing people into actively
taking part in their own affairs and I
it's so funny because he's so free so
similar to the leaders of Kuwait you
would figure that people of this country
would forget behind his reinstitution
iris-t yeah I'm yeah I understand to the
fact about the polar all right right
well are in that part of the world we
talk about foreign aid a lot people talk
in terms of foreign aid in a one of the
big lies that this is we live in a
incredibly benevolent country it sighs
giving all this aid to the rest of the
people in the world is it linguist and
someone with great deal of political
insight could you discuss just the the
use of the one that aid well first of
all but the facts or knowing actually
there was a study done the University of
Massachusetts on public attitude of
public awareness of campaign issues and
one of the questions they asked they
asked people what do you think is the
biggest item in the federal budget
well it's military right a longshot pray
nobody very few people said that what
they picked was aid most people think
that foreign aid is the biggest item on
the federal budget in fact it's
undetectable the United States is one of
the lowest countries among the you know
the OECD the rich country rich
industrial countries and it's it's one
of the lowest in foreign aid and what's
called foreign aid is in fact coming
home is mostly a kind of export
promotion right so Aid means in fact
that's why the aid doesn't go it does
not go primarily to the poor the needy
or countries because they're not good
consumer if you look at the way the aid
works it's basically aid from the US
taxpayer to US businesses and which
enable the businesses to sell to the
countries on money that the US taxpayer
gives them it's very small amount I
should say but what there is
turns out substantially to be export
promotion and in a realistic sense it
doesn't leave the kind
it goes from one pocket into another
pocket from a pocket of taxpayers into
the pockets of the exporters now
sometimes the population that receives
it benefits sometimes not often it's
harmful to them because of the way it's
elected so for example take something
like say food for peace what could be
more benign than that giving food to the
third world right or well you know it's
not the nine I mean when you look at it
the effects are to undercut native
agriculture to make people dependent on
us agra agra business exports and to
force them into agricultural exporting
right now which incidentally often means
coca of car hoarding but that and that
in fact it is designed for that purpose
and looks benign it's very hardly so you
can see the way this has worked over
decades I mean the Alliance for Progress
Kennedy's Alliance for Progress right
ascribed is very benign in this way and
it had interesting effects of not
surprising if you look at what they were
posed but they did succeed in Latin
America in in expanding export so the
Latin American countries expand it's
like takes ate beef and beef exporting
just right but there is no more but they
get rid of the beans the people they are
yeah I know that but beef consumption
declined and beef consumption declined
you know beans and rice local
subsistence agriculture will decline the
Alliance for Progress ended up being a
tremendous gift for American so we could
all raise the wrong stuff Center well
fast food restaurants and we it was
terrific for us exporters and for you as
importers and for the tiny wealthy
sector in Latin America and it was a
disaster for the population and in fact
the aid program was designed for that
purpose there's a there's an illusion
here that the rich countries give aid to
the poor on trees it's quite the other
way in fact when in fact it's it's an
elaborate ruse through which they
actually bill people for stealing their
natural resources and knowing that and
in fact if you look at the actual
capital flow and
last ten years the flow of capital from
the south to the north from the four
countries to the rich countries is about
the equivalent of six Marshall plans
that's something like half a trillion
dollars and it's it's a even if you look
at the US and Mexico it's probable with
Mexico subsidizes the us rather than
conversely I know we're talking about
aid you're saying there's two two major
areas for aid well if you look at the
very small amount of what we call a
mostly not aid the large mark the
biggest chunk of it by far goes to two
middle-east countries Israel in Egypt
which get roughly the same amount except
remember Egypt that's ten times the
population so Israel gets much more per
capita and Israel per capita gets aid
beyond it's just off the chart rise
nothing like it in world affairs Egypt
gets a lot and then Turkey is the next
recipient role middle-east countries and
then another new block of a that's
picking up now so-called aid is Russia
and parts of Eastern Europe the purposes
of this these are not the poorest areas
of the world buy anymore they're not
giving aid because people need it
right Eastern Europe in fact by third
world standard is quite well all right
it used to be part of the third world
pre 1917 but it sort of pulled out of it
and right and in fact what we're trying
to do with the aid is return them to a
third world status we want them to be
the kind of country where we can use
their reason we have access to their
resources American corporations like say
GM and others can move production
facilities there and get cheap labor as
they can in Mexico and we want them to
when we say we want them to open their
markets and accept capitalist reforms
that's exactly what it means
it means turning them return returning
them because that's what they were - a
kind of third-world service area the
Western countries the rich Western
countries they don't accept these
capitalist reforms like we don't have
them and England doesn't have them in
Germany doesn't have him in Japan
doesn't happen but we want the third
world to happen because then they'll be
able to provide the their serve their
role sort of right sources of raw
materials resources and cheap labor and
so on and so forth the aid to the Middle
East is for different reasons I mean
that's - that's been a but basically
designed to ensure us control over the
oil production of the region Israel in
Egypt and Turkey are kind of regarded as
sort of guardians of the wealthy the way
we run the oil system is it there's a
lot of potential wealth in the Middle
East and it we have to make sure as the
British did before us that that wealth
does not go to the people of the region
but that it comes to the west and the
way that's handled is by having family
dictatorships right which run the oil
production and invest their money and
their profits in the United then US
Treasury bonds and right you know kwaity
investment firm in London and so on and
they ought to be protected from their
populations who don't really understand
whether the population of the region you
know many many people is not persuaded
by the logic that says the wealth of
their region has to come to the west not
that what they're impoverished so you
need sort of protectors and Israel and
Turkey and Pakistan and Iran when it was
under the Shah or kind of this
protectors we got to support them Egypt
is the biggest Arab country and they got
to be bought off to become part of the
system and that's the main reason why
the aid is going there how about to
clean knowing and I Robot selectable
backwards here we're going to discuss
Clinton's cabinet looking more like
America in a moment but before they talk
about just who he's appointed in this
region well they've been interesting
point that his chief middle-east adviser
is a man named Martin
Indic there's actually an Australian he
was given citizenship about ten days
before he was appointed so that it would
be legitimate and they came to the
United States I think about ten years
ago and became a he was appointed by
APEC which is the yeah registered
Israeli Lobby right and he worked for
the Israeli Lobby and then they decided
that it would be useful to have a kind
of a think tank and that's not
officially connected with the lobby also
look more independent and it could
present that point of their point of
view but with the look of independence
so they spun off this think tank called
the Washington Institute for Near East
policy because he headed and it was
basically I mean nobody it wasn't a
great taker especially in Israeli
propaganda agency and he moved directly
from that to becoming Clinton's chief
adviser the next person on the list of
Samuel Lewis who was the he wasn't a US
ambassador in Israel and he was kind of
a joke in Israel because he was so you
know he was sort of like more holy than
the Pope you know and when he was there
it is off of him hobnobbing with right
right wing and so on and so forth that's
this is the this that's the main
decision-making apparatus apparatus and
it reflects the I frankly don't think
it's going to have a big policy effect
here I disagree with others but it I
would expect Clinton pretty much to
follow what's been you this is not going
to improve it's certainly not going I
mean I think he's going to follow the
policy that the US has been following
for a long time namely to try to ensure
that Israel which is the main US ally is
the dominant force in the region and can
be part of this system that protects
it's called what's called a strategic
asset you know keeps what they call
stability meaning keep local for
local nationalist forces from developing
and they want Egypt to participate in
that the Palestinians have no role and
no rights and the nigga that they don't
contribute to these strategic interests
at all they're just people and I think
that the that's been the framework and
Clinton if anything will probably
intensify in Europe in the film that's
out about you things that you haven't
seen but I have which is excellent and
in release right now and everyone should
go see it you quote John Jay one of our
beloved founding fathers and I found the
quote very telling when I thought about
Clinton talking about a cabinet that
looks more like America and I think that
word looks is very admirable because I
you know it might look more like America
but I certainly don't see any poor
people on but what was the John John
Jason John Jay is his favorite Maxim was
that the people who own the country
ought the government he was present at
the Constitutional Convention how erotic
sets the Supreme Court upset do you
think he would be with the Cornyn
cabinet really just they are the people
who are in the country or right in fact
it's biased even more than usual towards
wealthy corporate lawyers and investment
bankers you know people from Congress
who are noted for their cozy relation to
major business interests Rubin who's one
of the chief economic advisors comes
from this he comes from the largest
investment what is now probably the
largest investment firm in the country
goldman sachs and the rest of them are
from the same background the good folks
at goldman say yeah right it's a it's
been claimed I don't know exactly with I
think Time Magazine's it claimed that it
had more millionaires than any preceding
or even though they are a journal look
at their computations but it's plausible
they got the point whether the details
are right daring story for Time Warner
Gibran
speaking that part the world
manehattan we had one of the biggest
events of the first hundred days it's
affected a lot of other things is the
World Trade Center bombing how do you
see that at first I thought it was just
an NBC News rehearsal it got a little
bit out of hand how do you see that and
have what ramifications do you think
that well there is first of all a
question I mean let's let's assume for
the sake of the discussion that the
people that they've fingered or the
right and if that's the case what does
it take a rocket scientist to blow up
the World Trade Center there's a lot of
very strange things out that expects a
little to have for one thing it's
there's been some interesting discussion
about this in the Israeli press that you
were pressing Israel who raised some
obvious questions I mean you know the
the people who carried out the bombing
look as if they wanted to be caught
I mean mostly the method of bombing the
trails that they left behind I mean
coming back a couple of times to pick up
my little kind money $400 for a rental
car I mean the connections to the
connections of fraud and so on and so
forth and they pointed out plausibly
that there's only two possible
interpretations one is that it was just
an unbelievably incompetent group of
people I mean doubt you've done mean
even from the kind of bomb that they
picked the gang that could I load up
straight it's just so that's one
possibility just unbelievable in
gravitons the other possibility is that
they were infiltrated by a very
professional outfit who wanted them to
expose who had a purpose and there are
some there was things I think of the
grassy knoll well you know I mean it's a
it's a kind of certain people who would
not be very well how do you think this
place I mean I right here in Somerville
now they're talking about not me I would
I don't think it means much that this is
a quote-unquote sanctuary city except as
a gesture says you know
going to harass immigrants in this town
but now they're talking about rescinding
that you know the City Council is and I
think we should have and I think it we
should have let's continue to assume
that what the FBI says is correct and I
don't I think it probably is one of the
interesting things that developed in the
world trade running thing was a letter
of it was you know given the front page
all the out of times you know they from
the group that claimed to be responsible
and which some regard as authentic I
mean maybe they used the Arabic numbers
in it I mean there's some questions
about let's assume it to be a I'm at in
my opinion is probably uh huh all right
but it's interesting to read it I mean
what if we paid attention to what it
said
honestly we might learn something so for
example the core part of the of their
letter said that the American people
should question the role of their
government in carrying out or supporting
terrorism throughout the world and if
the American people don't question that
and do something about it they too may
be subject to terrorism well you know
those are words that we should listen to
because in fact they had a point the
u.s. is one of the major terrorist
states in the world right and there are
plenty of people around the world who
are you know who have suffered from
us-run terrors right and care about it
people here may not care about it but
the victims do and they're all over the
world if you don't have it the price of
a ticket to bagged and you can go look
at the World Trade Center it's not all
through the Middle East Lebanon Lebanon
for example it has been a major target I
us direct us or else us rated terror the
Central America and the Caribbean have
been targeted for u.s. terror operations
that go beyond anything that you know
Libya Iran can dream up there are in
fact these people were in fact correct
the terrorist operations around the
world can often be traced right back to
Washington in fact the World Trade
Center bombing itself is not an
uninteresting example the the people who
were charged with having carrying it
carried it out or there
electoral leaders have pretty good CIA
credentials and they were part of the
CIA funded operation in Afghanistan
which I mean I think it had an element
of legitimacy I mean if they make sense
to help people resisting foreign
invasion however the people that they
picked out you know the people that the
CIA did not pick out you know secular
nationalists to support it picked out
radical fundamentalists fanatics one of
them particularly groupid in Hekmatyar
who was the main you know the main
beneficiary of CIA support right has
been just tearing the country apart he's
been shelling Kabul you know killing
thousands of people driving out hundreds
of thousands after the political
settlement now that these people were
all associated with that group with
probably the most radical fanatic
Salonika fundamentalist group in the
world amply funded by the United States
and Saudi Arabia well a trail happened
to blow back to New York if you can
believe the FBI but it's only one
example of the CIA supported of us
supported terrorism throughout Europe
yeah now that's these are the the press
commentary on the World Trade Center
bombing for the captivity had things
like the United States we always thought
we were right now in the world of
terrorism it's something out there you
know it's now we're feeling terror
senseless logic is if we had nothing to
do with it we have a lot to do with and
we should be honest to the point is and
is if that one instance is the first
time there's been any violence in the
society that may do to people really I
mean it's really that usually we export
every island right so most of our
violence is elsewhere I'm it's a very
violent society but would not only cons
it said I'm infinitely violent society
internally but government supported
violence is a reverse external right all
right here
fortunately the government doesn't carry
out extensive violence against its own
violation we carry out our violence yet
although you know what I saw in the news
this evening I saw Marines practicing
taking urban locations at Camp Pendleton
then they were putting this
television just to show people that
they're ready for it's happened I mean
the u.s. is not three state fund right
so for example if you look at US labor
history it's unusually violent hundreds
of workers were killed in labor actions
here at a time when no drives being
killed in Europe but still it's true
that overwhelmingly government initiated
violence is against replicar elsewhere
populations in the third world including
large-scale terror operations and we
people here may not know about it but
people elsewhere in the world know very
well about it right here the target it's
no secret like the secret and I'm happy
I'm going to yes we really read news
over there it's not news to the
grounders mm thank you here Louis when
they go on if we were to pay attention
to the contents of this letter authentic
or not we could learn something from it
if we're honest about it we have a phone
call back something let me see if I can
figure this now
now we don't okay they gave up they gave
up for the Jews ah now these are number
six two eight eight eight to nine or six
to eight eight eight to six six to eight
eight eight to six I didn't give away a
secret lucky control room number
anything okay so if anyone wants all
they can and not be cut off maybe odd
they weren't yeah I don't know I think
they had given up now had they okay
maybe this is them living thank you okay
fine well there seems to be some
flashing now what do you think about the
cabin in general the cabinet
appointments that were bought the the
whole attorney general Fiasco yeah that
was a I'm he made political errors but
there was something pretty cynical about
that I mean whatever you think about zoe
baird i mean if those Attorney General
Electric I mean if those condition I
mean yes starting with who she was
because what who she worked for that I
cared about yeah it wasn't in doing in
the moral she only exploited immigrants
she was sure she wasn't but you know the
kind of
infraction that she was picked up on I'm
not not many people would remain in
government it's like if you write on the
other hand around you know neither her
background is not very whatever returned
in one or the current Attorney General
well she sent a lot of people into the
electric chair hasn't she here let me
just try this again
hello good how are you tonight who's
calling I have a geopolitical theory
which calls for a global us system the
world divided into states in which
everybody would have a vote within the
US system a global democracy I'm just
wondering where mr. Chomsky thinks about
that whether he thinks the US system
could be a global system in which
everybody could vote for a global
president in Congress well I'd like to
start with something simpler turning the
US system in flaw which it's very far
from as we do have the right to push you
know to push levers every couple of
years but the question is whether the
population actually can play a
meaningful role in managing its own
affairs and I don't think it does all
we've been talking about illustrates
that popular for example popular
attitudes are very different from the
spectrum of government policies the
population is expected to simply be
observers they are what are called
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders and
the way the theories are designed so we
could start by trying to create a
meaningful democracy here before we
start exporting what we have thank you
very much thanks for calling we have
another call what's Sam thing in this
twice in a row hello you're on dead air
live who's calling
yeah definitely have equipment for that
bit don't you I believe okay speak of it
yeah my person is that you think that
there's a possibility that preppy that
obviously might be local that the
portrayal over well I certainly hope
that he'll go back
but if you want my speculation it's of
course a speculation my speculation is
that the arrangement that is now being
crafted will have him be the official
president whether he stays here or goes
back under protection but with a prime
minister who will have effective power
and who will represent the interests of
traditional elites and you know the US
businesses who run assembly plants there
and on the plantations and so on I hope
that that doesn't happen but if but I
think that that's what is going to
happen what the u.s. so far at least has
strongly opposed is the popular
grassroots movement which which swept
him into power with two-thirds of the
vote that US businessmen and the Haitian
elites don't like any at all
so what I'd anticipate is a formal
arrangement in which he'll be a kind of
figurehead President and unless we do
something here to stop that I think
that's what's likely to come thank you
doctor thank you possibly only one thing
on the upside with the first hundred
days the Clinton presidency some
reasonable signs you discussing before
with Social Policy there by and large
the Republicans and the Democrats have
the same general policies there are just
factions of it they're kind of a
business party and they're just two
factions of it so their prime commitment
on major issues is to the welfare of the
rich Investor's owners and managers and
so on and they don't different much in
that respect but they do differ in the
kind of popular constituency that they
appeal to so the Republicans are
somewhat more openly the business party
they don't pretend to be anything else
as a result they don't have an eat
traditionally they have not had an easy
appeal to the majority of the population
already
the majority of the population say you
know hey guys we want to enrich the rich
as the Reaganites did for the last ten
years one of the reasons why Reagan is
the most unpopular living president next
to Nixon he and Nixon are tied sort of
tied for last
oh really haven't haven't done a nice
quiet fact you'd be surprised you know
who the most popular expertly Carter
Carter by a long shot for two second
that's very very best next President
Ford people vote for two thousand it was
Tim I don't remember you know who he
wasn't a bit to bed but Nixon and Reagan
bring up the the rear I don't even well
they shed yeah but the the you can't go
to the public and try to garner votes
that way so the way that the Republicans
tend to develop mass appeal is by
appealing to racism or jingoism or
religious fundamentalism or something
like that and they get Nakia pretty
groups that way in a trouble Society the
Democrats on the other hand claim to be
the popular party their policies aren't
all that different when they get in but
they do appeal to different
constituencies they try to organize
mobilize to vote not to act labor
working people women ethnic minorities
you know the elderly and so on now when
the parties get into power on issues
that are of crucial interest to the
business community they don't really
differ very much NAFTA on the other hand
on issues that are not of great
significance to the business community
say civil rights they do differ they're
they you know they sort of throw crumbs
to their constituency so a Republican
administration as we saw in the last ten
years is going to be very harsh with
regard to things like civil rights in
fact it might be repressive you know
it's going to to help to to introduce
censorship through to introduce harsh
punishments to make it in difficult even
impossible sometimes to bring civil
rights issues to the court
it will restrict the right of free
choice for women about abortion I mean
things like that are the kinds of things
you'd expect it to do given its popular
constituency the Democrats with their
popular constituency will not do that so
I'd expect and we already see an
improvement in the civil rights climate
that more more protection for human
rights to the right for people's freedom
of choice for I mean family leave for
example and business doesn't care much
one way or another but that's what
working people do care right that that
kind of thing happened and that's the
kind of in these domains the parties do
carry out different policies now those
those differences are very important for
human life you know I don't mean I play
them down on the other hand they don't
matter much to people to the people who
own the country and therefore govern it
so therefore they can change right and
in the area of social policy I would
expect changes of a kind at least I
would regard as an improved some
improvement we have a office that
there's a nickels worth of difference
between Democrats and Republicans and
what there's if I took a nickel and put
it on the table a Democrat would steal
it from me
and a Republican would kill me for okay
let's say hi you're on dead air live
who's calling what are dickens calling
hi and I'm in Somerville now and if I
could talk on or ask about two issues I
like to but if not understood I'll deal
with let's see if we get to it okay the
first one is based on a comment that no
made about we not having a democracy now
and making the system more open to the
public I am curious as to how he would
imagine getting from where we are now to
there without making a situation a lot
worse than it perhaps is and let me just
add that I'm hard pressed like that most
people would be capable of making the
technical decisions that often go into a
lot of legislation I
we don't and I spent a lifetime solving
the news Christopher - okay let's snow
on that well let's take the I don't
think very difficult prick I have a I
don't share your skepticism of people's
ability to think through problems and
make decisions about things that matter
to them I'm it's true they have to have
access to information and they have to
have interaction with one another they
have to have opportunities to discuss
and so on but you know that's what
organizations are about and I don't know
of any reason to believe that the people
who do make the decision are any more
qualified they just have different
interests they make the decisions with
different interests in mind now how can
these things happen well take the two
examples that we started that we began
to discuss so you know at the beginning
the program takes a healthcare and math
to take those two issues on both of
those issues the general public has
opinions which happen to be different
from the spectrum of the the spectrum of
policy choices on the healthcare issue
the public has not been organized and
has not acted in any way to try to
realize what they want so therefore
they're not going to get it on the case
of NAFTA there happens to be a network
of groups environmental groups labor
groups religious based groups and others
which have functioned to try to you know
to articulate a point of view to develop
an articulate point of view from based
on grassroots participation and to put
it into the public arena by pressure and
they're getting somewhere well that's
the way democracy works that's the way
every every social change that's been
worthwhile has come about these things
are not given as gifts by you know
experts or benevolent autocrat they're
struggled for and fought for that's why
that's how labor got the right to
organize in the first place in the mid
1930s and even in those cases build
usually the decisions come about through
representation and I'm a member of a
union myself and often me of like
representatives who make decisions
the membership get to talk to our
representatives but in the end
especially when it's a close call I mean
there is someone within representative
you to the board until I see in almost
any case we will happen up with a
representative form of government and I
don't represent you sure I don't think
is the representing form of governance
is going to be representative I mean I'm
going to get to a million people sitting
in a room and making a decision so
there'll be representation the question
is who controls like in your union the
question is do you determine the
decisions and does your representative
do what you say where does your
representative do what he or she wants
and you just sort of read about in the
papers okay well thank you very much I
got two questions in the same subject
get Nick out there in the column
okay thank you John looks like the
phones are cool um soon we have it
covered here excited got thrust into
this same thing I know what I wanted I
wanted to promote something on September
28th I'll be doing a benefit at Johnny
D's for the sister city program and El
Salvador raising money and you know what
that brings up an interesting oh yeah
but huh what's happening in El Salvador
is important yeah amnesty worth paying
but what very telling it's extremely
important I mean the the the there was a
peace treaty which stopped the fighting
the peace won the crucial part of the
peace treaty was establishing what was
called a truth commission United Nations
run truth commission which would
investigate a sample small sample of the
atrocities conducted in the last decade
and they did conduct a rather detailed
inquiry into a number of the atrocities
and discovered something which will come
as a plain no surprise to people who
have been following the story outside
the mainstream right namely that they
tributed eighty five percent of the
atrocities to the security forces right
another
10% to the paramilitary forces and death
squads which are associated with the
Granton the big device interest so that
means 95 percent were attributed to the
people we support it we trained armed
directed and supported and 5% were
attributed to the guerrillas
well another part of the peace treaty
was that people who are implicated in
crimes must be punished for them the
first thing that the government did was
to pass an amnesty right which
exonerated almost all people not only
those who had committed crimes but those
who are implicated through records
Commission or later investigations so
that eliminated the threat of punishment
thereby undermining the peace treaty but
they it's interesting what they excluded
not everybody was under the amnesty I
mean doubt that this group people who
they call internationally protected
persons well that means American
military who were there advising the
killers if somebody shot at them that's
not if he killed American Church women
that's okay right
but if he shot at an American Marine
that's not okay right that's an
interesting decision I mean that's that
would be scandalous by international
standards of wolf climbing and and it is
and we'll the question is do we care
about it are we going to act I was very
interesting sure this did a piece that
really prompted up the xenophobic fear
of people entering our country at the
beginning and then the last piece and
then they meet between it's some fluff
piece and indeed the last piece is about
Salvador and if you watched it in the
opposite order you would know why people
would flee countries to come here a lot
of a lot of these foreigners that were
so afraid of are in fact fleeing u.s.
foreign policy and ironically this is
the natively there are tens of thousands
of people who are slaughtered there in
u.s. armed and directed terror that was
interesting comment about this by the
that went in one of the last major
seconds yeah crimes was the killing the
Jesuits the person who replaced the
rector of the university that has
pointed out that there's somebody
missing in this whole scenario namely
the US government we that's our
responsibility
and and you keep an eye on all our
responsibilities and inform those of us
that try to be responsible and it's a
pleasure and an honor to beer with you
in dead air live tonight dr. Chomsky
we'll see you around the campus good to
see you
do you have one minute to say anything
you wanted to I would tell them as
important as he thinks social issues
these social areas are to put that aside
for time Dean Dean brushed into another
controversial social issues of gave gays
in the military and all that and I I
don't diminish the importance that has
to the people who directly involved but
other things like where the next
paycheck is coming from a problem with
what you have made on originally I'm
from Haiti so one thing I'd like to say
to him is that that he helped the
Haitian people or the country hating and
get our state back yeah that's what I'd
like to say it'll like I say good luck
you
