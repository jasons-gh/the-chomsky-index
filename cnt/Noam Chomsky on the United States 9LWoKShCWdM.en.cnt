people are suffering bitterly throughout
the world there are a lot of things we
can do about it and that seems to be a
responsibility that comes with privilege
and freedom which we have to an unusual
degree maybe unique degree to involve
ourselves in these issues what do you
think of the United States I think it's
a complicated country it has wonderful
achievements it's in some domains it's
gone beyond any other country in the
world
protection for freedom of speech for
example many other liberties it's got
tremendous advantages incomparable had
the biggest economy in the world over a
century ago you know I don't think it's
used them properly the there's plenty of
many of the actions that the US
government has taken in the world I
think are deplorable then should be
stopped and reversed and it's you can't
really comment on a country there's just
too many facets to it there's a society
there's a culture there's just too many
things I mean when I take my grandson to
a baseball game as I did last Sunday I
enjoy being part of mainstream America
when I look at US government foreign
policy or the domestic highly regressive
domestic policies I'm extremely critical
