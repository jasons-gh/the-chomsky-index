hello this is de bourree ah with
redirecting I'm going to be playing a
video from a gentleman by the name of
Noam Chomsky and in this video he is
talking about how President Donald Trump
number 45 is a big distraction so I'm
gonna play the video and then I'm going
to come back with a very very brief
commentary give us power he's harming it
but from the point of view of US elites
he's giving him everything they want I
mean in fact what's going on in the
United States if you think about it is
kind of a two-level wrecking ball if you
want to call it that Trump his role
whether this is conscious or not I don't
know so you can see what what's
happening trump's role is to ensure that
the media and public attention are
always concentrated on him so every time
you turn on a television to trump open
the front page of the newspaper trump
and in order to maintain he's a con man
basically a showman and in order to
maintain public attention you have to do
something crazy otherwise nobody's going
to pay attention to you if you do normal
things you'll be way back somewhere so
every day there's one insane thing after
another and then you know the media
makes them crazy
meanwhile he's on to something else and
then you go to that one and while this
show is going on in public the what in
the background the wrecking crew is
working Paul Ryan executive orders and
what they're doing is systematically my
14 government that works for the benefit
of the population this goes from workers
rights to pollution and pollution
pollution of the environment rules for
protecting consumers I mean anything you
can think of is being dismantled and all
efforts are being devoted kind of almost
with fanaticism to enrich and empower
their actual constituency which is super
wealth and corporate power who are
delighted that's why the stock market
goes up stock market us and not much to
do with the economy but keep coming
because that's the rich people and they
love being granted now the worst
policies that he's carried out the most
dangerous are barely discussed those are
the two existential threats that we face
have to face the fact that humans are
now in a situation which has never
arisen in human history this generation
has to decide whether organized human
existence is going to continue and it's
not a joke
it's global warming and nuclear war
those are the major issues they ought to
be big headlines every day and Trump's
actions are making both of them much
more dangerous in the case of nuclear
war the policies are significantly
increasing the threat of nuclear war a
case of global warming it's
indescribable
but not only has the u.s. pulled out
uniquely alone in the world
it's pulled out from the international
efforts to do at least something about
it but beyond that it's the Trump
administration is going out of its way
to increase the threat look listen to
his State of the Union address the only
phrase about global climate was to talk
about our beautiful clean coal the worst
polluter there is which we have we have
a thousand years of it you know and look
at the new budget that's coming out
sharply cuts research and support for
any kind of renewable energy more
subsidies and support for the most
polluting destructive things and it's
not just Trump it's the entire
Republican leadership so if you look at
the 2016 election at the primaries every
single candidate not a single exception
either denied the global warming is
taking place or said maybe it is but we
shouldn't do anything about it which i
think is worse they were called the
moderates like cases so then and if you
look at Trump himself or say Rex
Tillerson Secretary of State and they
know perfectly well that humans are
causing global warming the fact that
Trump has golf courses all over he's he
hasn't built a wall in Mexico yet he's
building walls around his golf courses
to make sure that the sea level doesn't
destroy them that Rex Tillerson was CEO
of Exxon Mobil since the 1970s
scientists at Exxon Mobil have been we
now know they've been made public forced
to be making it public they've been
producing severe ones the leadership
about the effect of the use of petroleum
on destroying the environment so they
won't know about it but they're not
doing anything about it
which is a level of criminality that
most hard to find words to describe I'm
here you know educated well-off rich
people a very lead who know that what
they're doing is destroying the
prospects for a human resident organized
human life and do it anyway because they
make more profit tomorrow can you think
of an analog to that in human history I
really can't I mean I've said sometimes
what's considered an utterly outrageous
comment that the today's a Republican
Party is the most dangerous organization
in human history sounds outrageous but
think about it for a moment
I mean Hitler didn't intend to destroy
the prospects for human existence the
Atilla the Hun didn't intend that nobody
finish but that's what these guys intend
and it's not ignorant uneducated you
know religious fundamentalist whatever
you want to blame people these are the
most educated the best supported people
in the world and they're doing this eyes
open because you make more profit
tomorrow it's hard to imagine anything
like that's it's not just my opinion it
takes a the bulletin of the atomic side
the Doomsday Clock famous Doomsday Clock
that's set up by The Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists since 1947 they each year
they gather distinguished physicists
political analysts others to look at the
state of the world and make a judgment
of how far we are from terminal disaster
midnight is terminal disaster in 1947
the clock was at 7 minutes to midnight
after the outer mom moved up and back
since now it's at the closest it's been
to midnight ever they just moved it to
two minutes to midnight that's where it
was in 1953 when the US and later the
USSR exploded thermonuclear weapons
which were
could totally destroy the world so went
to two minutes now it's back to two
minutes and that's the Republican Party
that's the ones who were running the
country and dominating the world there's
never been a situation like this okay so
as you listen to the gentlemen speaks he
tells you any outlines very clearly how
this man is a distraction to not just
the American population but the world
population all of the shenanigans that
are surrounding him are just off the
charts but I spoke before in a previous
video and I talked about distractions
and how they are to be dealt with
because there are things we need to know
and things that we must pay attention to
but our minds need to get to the point
where we can learn how to separate these
things and keep them from becoming a
distraction you can know and keep it
moving we should be able to know things
and keep it moving but unfortunately
some people they get engulfed in these
things and they just this becomes the
the headline of their mind to where they
can't focus on spiritual things and they
don't understand that the handwriting is
on the wall spiritually so they're
focusing so much on the natural that
they are ignoring and cannot pay
attention to the spiritual things that
is the problem with things such as this
we need to understand that there is a
boogeyman that there are things that are
happening and that there are systems at
work and demonic activity that we are
surrounded by and all kinds of things
are taking place but don't allow them to
become a distraction no understand and
keep it moving
unfortunately not too many people are
able to do that so that's one of those
things where you have to daily renew
your mind know how to see and observe
the world around you being able to know
and identify the signs of the time but
also being able to identify the
spiritual things know what all of this
means and where you fit into all of this
because as we stated in a previous
broadcast we all have been given one
moment in time before we cross over into
each
so be able to separate your mind from
these things to where they don't become
a distraction but at the same time
knowing and being aware of what's going
on some people cannot be aware of what's
going on without getting to fully and
grafted into it you can be aware of a
lot of things you can hear the news of
what's going on pay attention to the
headlines but don't let them become your
focal point your main focal point
because the the watchman of the most
high are trying to sound the alarm
also on the spiritual things and not
just paying attention to the things of
this world so many things are going to
happen in this world that your mind will
be pulled into all of those directions
if you are not spiritually capable of
separating these things listen to them
but keep it moving and don't allow
yourself to be overtaken by the cares of
this life so pay attention to the man
number 45 in the white house understand
that all of this stuff dealing with him
is surrounding him is a distraction but
don't allow yourself to be distracted I
hope that makes sense family okay with
that I will say Shalom
you
