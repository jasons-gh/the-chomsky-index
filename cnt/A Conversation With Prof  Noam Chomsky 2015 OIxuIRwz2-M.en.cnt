day with world-renowned political
dissident linguist author Noam Chomsky
he is written over a hundred books most
recently on Western terrorism from
Hiroshima to drone warfare his
forthcoming book co-authored with Ilan
Pappe is titled
on Palestine and will be out next month
Noam Chomsky is Institute professor
emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology where he's taught for more
than 50 years Noam Chomsky it's great to
have you back here at Democracy Now and
particularly in our very snowy outside
but warm inside New York studio
delighted to be here again well known
let's start with Netanyahu's visit he
will is set to make this unprecedented
joint address to Congress unprecedented
because of the kind of rift it is
demonstrated between the Republicans and
the Democratic president President Obama
can you talk about its significance for
both president Prime Minister Netanyahu
and the Hawks in Congress most
Republican the primary goal is to
undermine any potential negotiation that
might settle whatever issue there is
with Iran they have a common interest in
ensuring that there is no regional force
that can serve as any kind of deterrent
to Israeli and US violence the major
violence in the region and it is if we
believe US intelligence don't see any
reason not to their analysis is that if
Iran is developing nuclear weapons which
they don't know it would be part of
their deterrent strategy there they
would get their general strategic
posture is one of deterrence they have
low military expenditures there
according to US intelligence their
strategic doctrine is to try to prevent
an attack up to the point where
diplomacy could set in I don't think
anyone with a gray cell functioning
thinks that they would ever conceivably
use a nuclear weapon or even try to the
country would be obliterated in 15
seconds but they might provide a
deterrent of sorts and the US and Israel
certainly don't want to tolerate that
they are the forces that carry out
regular violence and aggression in the
region and don't want any impediment to
that for the Republicans in Congress
there's another interest namely to
undermine anything that Obama you know
the Antichrist might try to do so that's
a separate issue there the Republicans
stopped being a ordinary parliamentary
party some years ago there they were
described I think accurately by Norman
Ornstein very respected conservative
political analyst American Enterprise
Institute he said the party has become a
radical insurgency which has abandoned
any commitment to parliamentary
democracy and their goal for the last
years has simply been to undermine
anything that Obama might through in an
effort to regain power and serve their
primary constituency which is the very
wealthy and the corporate sector they
try to conceal this with all sorts of
other means and doing so they've had to
you can't get votes that way so they've
had to mobilize sectors of the
population which have always been there
but we're never mobilized into an
organized political force evangelical
Christians extreme nationalists
terrified people who have to carry guns
into Starbucks because somebody might be
after them and so on and so forth that's
a big force and inspiring fear is not
very difficult in the United States it's
a long history back to colonial times
of as an extremely frightened society
which is an interesting story in itself
and mobilizing people in fear of them
whoever them happens to be is an
effective technique used over and over
again and right now the Republicans have
their their non policy has succeeded in
putting them back in a position of least
congressional power so this the attack
on this is a personal attack on Obama
and intended that way is simply part of
that general effort but there is a
common strategic concern underlying and
I think that is pretty much what US
intelligence analyzes preventing any
deterrent in the region to US and
Israeli actions you say that nobody with
a great cell thinks that Iran would
launch a strike were to have nuclear
weapons but yet Netanyahu repeatedly
accuses Iran of planning a new genocide
against the Jewish people he said this
most recently on Holocaust Remembrance
Day in January saying that the
ayatollahs are planning a new Holocaust
against us and that's that's an argument
it's taken seriously here it's taken
seriously like people who don't stop to
think for a minute
but again Iran is under it's extremely
close surveillance US satellite
surveillance knows everything that's
going on in Iran if Iran even began to
load a missile that is to bring a
missile near a nuclear weapon the
country would probably be wiped out and
whatever you think about the clerics The
Guardian Council and so on there's no
indication that they're suicidal the
premise of these talks Iran gets to
enrich uranium in return for a lifting
of US sanctions do you see that as a
fair parameter does the US have the
right to begin with to be imposing
sanctions on Iran what are the right to
impose sanctions Iran should be imposing
sanctions on us
now it's worth remember when you hear
the White House spokesman talk about the
international community it wants to live
around to do this and that it's
important to remember that the phrase
international community in the u.s.
discourse refers to the United States
and anybody who may be happening to go
along with it
that's the international community if
with the international communities of
the world it's quite a different story
so two years ago the online former
non-aligned movement it's a large
majority the population of the world had
their regular conference in Iran in
Tehran and they once again vigorously
supported Iran's right to develop
nuclear power or as a signer of the
non-proliferation treaty
that's the international community of
the United States and its allies are
outliers as is usually the case and as
far as sanctions are concerned it's
worth bearing in mind that it's now 60
years since the during the past 60 years
and not a day has passed without the
u.s. torturing the people of Iran began
with overthrowing the parliamentary
regime and installing a tyrant the Shah
supporting the Shah through very serious
human rights abuses and terror and
violence as soon as he was overthrown
almost instantly the United States
turned to supporting Iraq's attack
against Iran which was a brutal and
violent attack u.s. provided a critical
support for it pretty much won the war
for Iraq by entering directly at the end
after the war was over
the u.s. instantly supported the
sanctions against Iran and though this
is kind of suppressed that's important
this is george w HW bush know he was in
love with saddam hussein he authorized
further aid to Saddam in opposition to
the Treasury and others he sent a
presidential delegation a senator a
congressional delegation to Iran it was
April 1999 in 1989 two headed by Bob
Dole the Congressional around to Iraq to
do Iraq sorry yeah to offer his
greetings to Saddam his friend to assure
him that he should disregard a critical
comment that he hears in the American
media we have this Free Press thing here
and we can't shut them up but they said
they would take off from Voice of
America take off critics of their friend
Saddam that was he invited Iraqi nuclear
engineers to the United States for
advanced training in weapons production
this is right after the Iraqi reward
along with sanctions against Iran and
then it continues without a break up to
the present there have been repeated
opportunities for a settlement of
whatever the issues are and so for
example in I guess was 2010 an agreement
was reached between Brazil Turkey and
Iran for Iran to ship out its low
enriched uranium for storage elsewhere
Turkey and in return the West would
provide the isotopes that Iran needs for
its medical reactors when that agreement
was reached it was bitterly condemned in
the United States by the president by
Congress but the media Brazil was
attacked for breaking ranks and so on
the Brazilian Foreign Minister was
sufficiently annoyed so that he released
a letter from Obama to Brazil proposing
exactly that agreement presumably on the
assumption that Iran wouldn't accept it
when they did except that they had to be
attacked for daring to accept that then
it's 2012 2012 you know there was to be
a meeting in Finland December to take
steps towards establishing a nuclear
weapons-free zone in the region this is
an old request pushed initially by the
Egypt the other Arab states back in the
early 90s there's so much support for it
that the u.s. formally agrees but not in
fact and has repeatedly tried to
undermine it the this this is under the
UN auspices and the meeting was supposed
to take place in December Israel
announced that they would not attend a
question on everyone's mind is how Iran
react they said that they would attend
unconditionally a couple of days later
Obama cancelled the meeting claiming the
situation's not ripe for and so on but
that would be even steps in that
direction would be an important move
towards eliminating whatever issue there
might be of course the stumbling block
is that there is one major nuclear state
Israel and if there's a Middle East
nuclear weapons-free zone that would be
inspections in either of Israel and of
the United States will tolerate that I
want to ask you about major revelations
that have been described as the biggest
leak since Edward Snowden last week
al-jazeera started publishing a series
of spy cables from the world's top
intelligence agencies in one cable the
Israeli spy agency Mossad contradicts
Prime Minister Netanyahu's own dire
warnings about Iran's ability to produce
a nuclear bomb within a year in a report
to South African counterparts in October
2012 the Israeli Mossad concluded Iran
is not performing the activity necessary
to produce weapons the assessment was
sent just weeks after Netanyahu went
before the UN General
Assembly with a far different message
Netanyahu held up a cartoonish diagram
of a bomb with a fuse to illustrate what
he called Iran's alleged progress on a
nuclear weapon this is a bomb this is a
fuse in the case of Iran's nuclear plans
to build a bomb this bomb has to be
filled with enough enriched uranium and
Iran has to go through three stages by
next spring at most by next summer at
current enrichment rates they will have
finished the medium enrichment and move
on to the final stage from there it's
only a few months possibly a few weeks
before they get enough enriched uranium
for the first bomb a red line should be
drawn right here before before Iran
completes the second stage of nuclear
enrichment necessary to make a bomb that
was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in September 2012 the Mossad
assessment contradicting Netanyahu was
sent just weeks after but it was likely
written earlier it said Iran quote does
not appear to be ready unquote to enrich
uranium to the highest levels needed for
a nuclear weapon a bomb would require
90% enrichment but Mossad found Iran had
only enriched to 20% that number was
later reduced under an interim nuclear
deal the following year the significance
of this noam chomsky as Prime Minister
Netanyahu prepares for this joint
address before Congress to undermine a
u.s. Iranian nuclear deal the striking
aspect of this is the Hudspeth involved
I mean Israel has had nuclear weapons
for probably 50 years or 40 years they
have the
very the estimates are maybe a hundred
two hundred nuclear weapons and they are
an aggressive state Israel's invaded
Lebanon five times its carrying out an
illegal occupation carries out vertol
attacks like Gaza last summer and they
have nuclear weapons but but things the
main story is that if incidentally the
Mossad analysis corresponds to us
intelligence analysis they don't know if
Iran is developing nuclear weapons but I
think the crucial fact is that even if
they were what would it mean it would be
just as US intelligence analyzes it it
would be part of a deterrence strategy
they couldn't use a nuclear weapon they
couldn't even threaten to use it Israel
and the land can has in fact threatened
the use of nuclear weapons a number of
times so why isn't doing this because he
doesn't want to have a deterrent in the
region that's simple enough if you're an
aggressive violent state you want to be
able to use force freely you don't want
anything that might impede it do you
think this in any way has undercut the
u.s. relationship with Israel the
Netanyahu Obama conflict that what Susan
Rice is called destructive there is
undoubtedly a personal relationship
which is hostile but I that's happened
before back in the round 1990 under
first President Bush the James Baker
went as far as the Secretary of State
telling Israel we're not going to talk
to you anymore if you want to contact me
here's my phone number
that would in fact the u.s. imposed mild
sanctions on Israel enough to compel the
Prime Minister that resign and be
replaced by someone else but that didn't
change the relationship which is based
on deeper issues than personal
antagonists
and meanwhile support for the occupation
continues so much so that during the
Gaza assault the u.s. rearmed Israel it
was kind of interesting how the u.s.
rearmed Israel the arms it's true that
the Pentagon sent more arms to Israel
they were actually running out of arms
and this vicious assault against totally
defenseless population the arms were
taken from arms that the u.s. stores in
Israel their pre-positioned in Israel
for eventual use by u.s. forces that's
one part of the us-israel strategic
alliance one small part of it is that
Israel is regarded as essentially an
offshore military base so we store pre
position arms there and some of those
arms were transferred to Israeli control
so that they could complete continue the
massive destruction of Gaza which is
horrific and one of many indications of
the nature of the Alliance it's a very
close alliance and deep enough so for
example one of the interesting leaks
from WikiLeaks was a US government study
of the Pentagon study of sites and the
world that are of such high significance
that we must protect them at all costs
that one of them was right near Haifa
it was the Rafael military industries
it's one of the main producers of drones
and other high-tech military equipment
and the relation and that's a hot one of
the highest strategic sights of highest
importance and in fact the relationship
is so close that Raphael actually
transferred its management offices to
Washington where the money is the
contacts are this is it's essentially an
offshore the military base in many ways
also a major source for US investment
a high tech investment so Intel for
example is setting up its its major new
facility for next-generation chips and
Israel Warren Buffett just what a big
Israeli company there are many very
close relationships and they're not
going to be affected by a personal
conflict between Baker and show me or
Obama the Obama administration has taken
great pains even as this division has
taken place to show its support for
Israel on Sunday Secretary of State John
Kerry said the US has intervened on
Israel's behalf hundreds of times in the
international arena that was US
Secretary of State and ABC's this week
the most one of them was actually
received a fair amount of publicity
because it was so remarkable that was I
suppose February 2011 roughly at the UN
Security Council there was a resolution
proposed to the Security Council calling
on Israel to abide by official US policy
the official US policy is objection to
settlement expansion it's a pretty minor
issue incidentally that's what's talked
about but the issue is the settlements
not the expansion they're all illegal
they're criminal activities they
undermine any hope for any peaceful
settlement but US policy is that
settlement expansion is as they put it
not helpful to peace the Security
Council proposed a resolution asking
Israel to abide by official US policy
Obama vetoed it you know that's real
support for Israel we're gonna break and
then come back you now democracynow.org
the war and peace report
i meani Goodman with Aaron Matta our
guest for the hour is MIT Institute
professor emeritus Noam Chomsky known
around the world for his political
writings we're gonna turn right now to
the issue of Russia and Ukraine
Secretary of State John Kerry's meeting
with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov
and Geneva to discuss the conflict in
Ukraine
the meeting comes just days after Carrie
publicly accused Russian officials of
lying to his face about their military
support for separatists rebels Russia
and Ukraine are also holding direct
talks in Brussels to resolve a dispute
over delivery of Russian gas the UN said
today the death toll from the nearly
year-old conflict is top six thousand a
recent ceasefire continues to hold over
a shaky start also in Russia the murder
this weekend on Friday night of the
opposition leader Boris Nemtsov a former
Deputy Prime Minister turned dissident
politician Nemtsov was shot dead Friday
night near Red Square he was going to
lead a major rally that was critical of
Vladimir Putin on Sunday it grew much
larger after his death with tens of
thousands perhaps 50,000 people marching
past the Kremlin carrying signs reading
I am Not Afraid noam chomsky if you can
comment on what's happening in Russia
and Ukraine what's happening is quite
ugly and I think the criticisms are
mostly accurate but they're kind of
beside the point there's a background
that we have to think about it's it's
fashionable now in the United States and
Britain to condemn Putin as some sort of
distorted mind there's an article in
Psychology Today analyzing his brain
asking why so arrogant he's been accused
of having Asperger as a irritable
rat-faced man as he's described by
Timothy art garden ash and so on this is
all very reminiscent of the early 1950s
when I was a graduate student then at
that time the US had overwhelming power
and it was able to use the United
Nations as a batterer
I am against its enemy the Soviet Union
so Russia was of course feet doing lots
of resolutions condemning it and the
leading anthropologists in the United
States and England the developed earth
were began to analyze why the Russians
are so negative what makes them say no
at the United Nations all the time and
their proposal was that the Russians are
negative because they raised their
children and swaddling clothes and that
makes them negative the three or four of
us at Harvard who thought this is
ridiculous used to call it diaper ology
that's being re-enacted that take off on
criminology and this is a being
reenacted right now but the fact is
whatever you think about Putin okay
irritable rat-faced man with Asperger's
whatever you like the Russians have a
case and you have to understand the case
and the case is understood here by
people who bother to think so for
example that was a lead article and
foreign affairs the main establishment
journal by John Mearsheimer but the
title something like the West is
responsible for the Ukraine crisis and
he was talking about the background the
background begins with the fall of the
Soviet Union like 1989 1990 there were
negotiations between President Bush
James Baker and Mikhail Gorbachev about
how to how to deal with the issues that
arose at the time a crucial question is
what happens to NATO NATO had been
advertised since its beginning as
necessary to protect Western Europe from
the Russian hordes okay and no more
Russian hordes so what happens to NATO
well we know what happened to NATO but
the crucial issue was this Gorbachev
agreed to allow Germany a unified
Germany to join NATO a hostile military
alliance it's a pretty remarkable
concession if
think about the history of the preceding
century half century its Germany alone
had practically destroyed Russia several
times now he was agreeing to have
Germany join a hostile military alliance
led by the only superpower but there was
a quid pro quo that Germany that NATO
would not move one inch to the east that
was the phrase that was used in the
interchanges meaning to East Germany and
on that condition they went forward NATO
immediately moved to East Germany when
Gorbachev vigorously protested naturally
he was informed by the United States
that it was only a verbal commitment it
wasn't on paper the unstated implication
is if you're naive enough to think it
could make a gentlemen's agreement with
us it's your problem they didn't say
that I'm saying that but the NATO moved
to the East Germany under Clinton moved
right up to Russia's borders just a
couple of weeks ago a US military
equipment was taking part in the
military parade in Estonia a couple
hundred yards from the Russian border
Russia is surrounded by the u.s.
offensive weapons sometimes they're
called defense but they're all offensive
weapons and the idea that the the new
government in Ukraine that took over
after the former government was
overthrown last December late December
it passed a resolution overwhelmingly I
think something like 308 or something
announcing its intention to take steps
to join NATO for a no Russian leader no
matter who it is could tolerate Ukraine
right at the geostrategic
center of Russian concerns joining a
hostile military alliance I mean
we can imagine for example how the US
would have reacted say during the Cold
War if the Warsaw Pact had extended to
Latin America and Mexico and Canada were
now were planning to join the Warsaw
Pact
of course that's academic because the
first step would have led violent US
response and would have gone any further
missile crisis you know and it's very
interesting to think about what actually
happened at the Cuban Missile Crisis
which is very striking the issue the
crucial issue at the missile crisis was
the peak moment was October 26th and
27th right at the end Khrushchev had
sent a letter to Kennedy offering to end
the crisis by simultaneous public
withdrawal of Russian missiles from Cuba
and US missiles from Turkey
these were obsolete missiles for which
withdrawal order had already been given
because they were being replaced by much
more lethal US missiles and Polaris
submarines invulnerable submarines so
that was the offer they would withdraw
the missiles we would withdraw obsolete
missiles which were already being
replaced by more of the lethal ones the
Kennedy refused and his his own
subjective assessment whatever that
means of nuclear war was 1/3 to 1/2
that's got to be the most horrific
decision in history first chef back down
that fortunately the US did secretly say
that it would withdraw the obsolete
missiles of course which didn't need
anymore
but the if you take a look at the
balance of power that was assumed to be
legitimate
we are you have to establish the
principle that we have a right to
surround anyone with lethal offensive
weapons that can obliterate them in a
second that they can't do anything
anywhere in their ops salmon is it would
take a look at the conflict with China
over the
marathon conflict where's it taking
place
there's off the coast of California is
it in the Caribbean
no it's off the coast of China that's
where we have to protect what we call
freedom of the seas not in China's
waters this is part of the concept that
we basically own the world and we have a
right to do anything any way we like and
nobody is a right to stand up to it in
the case of the Ukraine the whatever
again whatever you think about Putin
think he's the worst monster since
Hitler they still have a case and it's a
case that no Russian leaders want to
back down from they cannot accept the
Ukrainian move of the current government
to join NATO even probably the European
community there is a very natural
settlement to this issue a strong
declaration that Ukraine will be
neutralized it won't be part of any
military alliance that along with some
more or less agreed upon choices about
how about the autonomy of regions you
can finesse it this way in that but
those are the basic terms of a peaceful
settlement but we have to be willing to
accept that otherwise we're moving
towards a very dangerous situation I
mentioned before that the Doomsday Clock
famous clock of the bull of American
Tomic scientists has just been advanced
to three minutes before midnight that's
very close
midnight means were finished that is the
highest the closest it's reached since
1983 and we might remember what happened
then what happened then was that the
Reagan administration as soon as it came
into office began highly provocative
actions it wanted to probe Russian
defenses so they simulated air and naval
attacks against Russia very publicly and
openly they wanted the Russians to know
to see how they'd respond it was a very
tense moment
Pershing 2 missiles were being in
stole in Western Europe with five to ten
minutes flight time to Moscow Reagan had
announced the so-called Star Wars
program which is called defense but
strategic analysts on all sides agree
that it's a first strike weapon which
called missile defense it was extremely
tense period the Russians were concerned
was known at the time that they were
concerned but Russia recently released
archives Russian ARCA as indicate that
the concern was very high there's an
America recent US intelligence report
analyzing in detail what the reactions
were and concludes it's words are the
war scare was real we came close to war
and it's worse than that because right
in the nineteen eighty four right at the
peak of this this is when the Doomsday
Clock was approaching midnight right in
the midst of that Russian automated
detection systems which are much worse
than ours that we have satellite
detection we can detect missiles from
takeoff
they have only radar detection
line-of-sight so they can only detect
missiles when you can kind of see them
with radar they detect that a US missile
attack the protocol is for that
information to be transmitted to the
high command which then launches a
preventive strike it went to a
particular individual on a Slav Petrov
he just decided not to transmit it
that's why we're alive to talk about we
have to break then come back to Nome
Trump's this is democracy now
democracynow.org the war and peace
report I'm Amy Goodman with Aaron Matt a
Noam Chomsky's our guest for the hour
the world renowned political dissident
linguist author of over a hundred books
MIT professor emeritus Aaron yes no I
wanted to ask you about Isis the big
news is that Iraq is planning a major
offensive to retake Mosul it's currently
launching strikes to recapture Tikrit
with us support my question is about the
effectiveness of the US strategy to what
extent is the u.s.
strained by its own policies in terms of
the effectiveness of defeating Isis
constrains in terms of its ties to Saudi
Arabia and its refusal to engage with
Iran and groups like Hezbollah which
you've been effective in fighting Isis
it's Patrick Coburn who's done by far
the best reporting on this describes it
as an Alice in Wonderland strategy of
the US has claimed wants to destroy Isis
but it's opposing every force that's
fighting Isis so the main state that's
opposed to Isis is Iran they support the
Iraqi government Shiite government but
Iran is you know on our enemies list
probably the main ground forces fighting
Isis are the PKK and its allies which
are on the US terrorist list that's both
in Iraq and in and in Syria Saudi Arabia
our major ally along with Israel is both
traditionally for a long time the main
funder of Isis and similar groups not
necessarily the government rich Saudis
other people in the in the Emirates not
only the Thunder but the their the
ideological source Saudi Arabia is
committed as dominated by an extremist
fundamentalist version of Islam Mahabad
doctrine and Isis is an extremist
offshoot of the Hobby doctrine Saudi
Arabia's a missionary state that
establishes schools mosques spreading
its radical Islamic version so there are
a lie our enemies are the those who are
fighting Isis and it's more complex is a
monstrosity there's not much doubt about
that didn't come from nowhere it's one
of the results of the u.s. hitting a
very vulnerable society wracked with a
sledgehammer which elicited sectarian
conflicts that had not existed they
became
violent us violence made it worse
we're all familiar with the crimes out
of this came lots of violent murderous
forces Isis is one but the Fiat and
militias are not that different they're
carrying out their the kind of the when
they say the Iraqi army is attacking
it's probably mostly the Shiite militias
with the Iraqi army in the background
I'm the way the Iraqi army collapsed is
an astonishing military fact this is an
army of I think 350,000 people heavily
armed by the United States trained by
the United States for 10 years
a couple of thousand guerillas showed up
that they all run away
the generals run away first the soldiers
didn't know what to do they ran away
after 20 seconds we have 20 seconds well
know it's basically the effect it's hard
to see how Iraq can even be held
together at this point it's been
devastated by the u.s. US sanctions the
war the atrocities that solid from it
the current policy whatever it is is not
very likely to even patch up put
band-aids on the cancer we're gonna have
to leave it there but we'll continue
this discussion tomorrow on democracy
now our guest Noam Chomsky Institute
professor emeritus of the massachusetts
institute of technology - org the war
and peace report I'm Amy Goodman today
part two of our discussion with Noam
Chomsky the world renowned political
dissident linguist and author Institute
professor emeritus at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology where he's
taught for more than half a century on
Monday on democracy now Aron Mata and I
interviewed him about Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech on
Iran to Congress today in part two we
look at blowback from the US drone
program the legacy of slavery in the
United States the leaks of Edward
Snowden us meddling in Venezuela and the
thawing of u.s. Cuba relations we began
by asking professor Chomsky how the US
should respond to the self
proclaimed Islamic state it's very hard
to think of anything serious that can be
done I mean it it should be settled
diplomatically and peacefully to the
extent that that's possible it's not
inconceivable I mean there are Isis
it's a horrible manifestation of hideous
actions it's a real danger to anyone
nearby but so are other forces and we
should be getting together with Iran
which has a huge stake in the matter and
is the main force involved and with the
Iraqi government which is calling for
and applauding Iranian support and
trying to work out with them some
arrangement which will satisfy the
legitimate demands of the Sunni
population which is the which is what
Isis is protecting and defending and
gaining the support from there not
coming out of nowhere they are one of
the effects the main effects of the US
invasion of Iraq
there are many horrible effects but one
of them was to incite sectarian
conflicts that have not been there
before if take a look at Baghdad before
the invasion Sunni and she lived it her
mingled the same neighborhoods
intermarried sometimes they say that
they didn't even know if their neighbor
was
Oh sunny or she was like knowing what
Protestants say your neighbor belongs to
it was very cool pretty close it wasn't
not climbing was he wasn't utopia there
were conflicts but there was no serious
conflict so much so that Iraqis at the
time predicted there would never be a
conflict well within a couple of years
it turned into a violent four little
conflict look at Baghdad today it's
segregated what's left of the Sunni
communities are isolated people camped
off to the neighbors this war going on
all over the ISIS is murderous and
brutal the same is true of the Shiite
militias which confronted and this is
now spread over the region there's now a
major sunni-shia conflict rending the
region to shoot apart variant to shreds
now this cannot be dealt with by bombs
this is much more serious than that it's
got to be dealt with by steps towards
records recovering remedying the massive
damage that was initiated by the
sledgehammer smashing Iraq and has now
spread and that does require the
diplomatic peaceful means dealing with
people who are pretty ugly and we're not
very pretty there for that matter but
this just has to be done exactly what
steps should be taken it's hard to say
there are people whose lives are at
stake
like the Assyrian Christians the other
day and so on apparently the fighting
that protected the we don't know a lot
but it looks as though the ground
fighting that protected the Yazidi
largely was carried out by PKK the
Turkish guerrilla group that's fighting
for the Kurds and Turkey but based in
northern air
and they're on the US terrorist list we
can't hope to have a strategy that deals
with Isis well opposing and attacking
the group that's fighting them just as
doesn't make sense to try to have a
strategy that excludes around the major
state that supporting the Iraq and its
battle with Isis what about the fact
that so many of those who are joining
Isis now and a lot has been made follow
of the young people young women and
young men who are going into Syria
through Turkey
I mean Turkey is a US ally and there is
a border there they freely go back and
forth that's right then it's not just
young people one thing that's pretty
striking is that it includes people with
educated people doctors professionals
and others whatever we we may not like
it that Isis is the idea of the Islamic
caliphate is does have an appeal to
large sectors of a brutalized global
population which is under severe attack
everywhere has been for a long time and
something has appeared which has an
appeal to them and that can't be
overlooked if we want to deal with the
issue we have to ask what's the nature
they appeal why is it there how can we
accommodate it and lead to some if not
at least the amelioration of the
murderers conflict and maybe some kind
of settlement
you can't ignore these factors if you
want to deal with the issue I want to
ask you about more information that's
come out on the British man who is known
as jihadi John who appears in the
Islamic state the heading videos
mohammed emwazi has been identified as
that man by british security they say
he's a 26 year old born in Kuwait who
to the UK as a child and studied
computer science at the University of
Westminster the British group cage said
he faced at least four years of
harassment detention deportations
threats and attempts to recruit him by
British security agencies which
prevented him from leading a normal life
emwazi approached cage in 2009 after he
was detained and interrogated by the
british intelligence and agency mi5 on
what he called a safari vacation in
Tanzania in 2010 after him huazi was
barred from returning to Kuwait he wrote
quote I had a job waiting for me and
marriage to get started but now I feel
like a prisoner only not in a cage in
London in 2013 a week after he was
barred from Kuwait for a third time and
huazi left home and ended up in Syria at
a news conference cage research director
Aseem Qureshi spoke about his
recollections of my Z and compared his
case to another British man Michael
adebolajo who had to soldier to death in
London in 2013 sorry it's hard because
you know it's hard to imagine the
trajectory but it's not a trick that's
unfamiliar with us for us we've seen
microlight of the larger once again
somebody that I met you know he came to
me for help looking to change the
situation in this system when when are
we going to finally learn that when we
treat people as if they're Outsiders
they will inevitably feel like outsiders
and they will look for belonging
elsewhere that's kage research director
a same Kureshi your response to this
Noam Chomsky right the same if you take
a look at the those who perpetrated the
crimes and Charlie Hebdo they also have
a history of oppression of violence they
come from Algeria in the background the
horrible French participation and the
murderous war and the 90s in Algeria is
their immediate background they live
under and these harshly repressed areas
those there's much more than that so you
mentioned that information is coming out
about so-called jihadi john' the British
press other information is coming out
which we don't pay much attention to for
example the Guardian had a an article a
couple of weeks ago about a Yemeni boy I
think it was about fourteen or so who
was murdered in a drone strike and
shortly before they had interviewed him
about his history his parents and family
went through them were murdered in drone
strikes he watched them burned to death
we get upset about the headings they get
upset about seeing their father burned
to death and a drone strike
he said they live in a situation of
constant terror not knowing when the
person
was suddenly going to be blown away
that's their lives
people like those who live in the slums
of around Paris or in this case are
relatively privileged a man under the
heart pretty hearts repression in
England they also know about that we may
choose not to know about it but they
know when we talk about the headings
they know that in the us-backed Israeli
attack on Gaza at the points where the
attack was most fierce like this via
neighborhood people weren't just
beheaded there were their bodies were
torn to shreds people came later trying
to put the pieces of the bodies together
to find out who they were you know these
things happen too and they have an
impact all of this has an impact along
with what was described and if we
seriously want to deal with the question
we can't ignore that that's part of the
background of people who are reacting
this way you spoke before about how the
US invasion set off the sunni-shia
conflict in Iraq and out of that came
Isis I wonder if you see a parallel in
Libya where the US and NATO had a
mandate to stop a potential massacre in
Benghazi
but then when much further than a no-fly
zone and helped topple Qaddafi and now
we are four days later we have Isis in
Libya and they're beheading Coptic
Christians Egypt now bombing and with
the u.s. debating this expansive war
measure Libya could be next on the US
target list well that's very important
than allergy what happened as you say
there was a claim that there might be
massacre and then Ghazi and in response
to that the there was a UN resolution
which had several elements one the call
for a ceasefire and negotiations which
apparently Qaddafi accepted
there was a no-fly zone okay to stop
attacks in Benghazi the three
traditional imperial powers britain
france in the united states immediately
violated the resolution no diplomacy no
ceasefire they immediately became the
air force of the rebel forces and in
fact the war itself had plenty of
brutality the violent militias attacks
on my African Michael Africans living in
all sorts of things the end result is
just a tear Libya to shreds by now it's
torn between two major warring militias
many other small ones it's gotten to the
point where they can't even export their
main export oil it's just a disaster
total disaster that's what happens when
you strike vulnerable systems as I said
with a sledgehammer that all kind of
horrible things can happen in the case
of Iraq it's worth recalling that the
there had been an almost a decade of
sanctions which were brutally
destructive we know about we can if we
like know about the sanctions people for
not to but we can find out there were -
there was a sort of humanitarian
component of the sanctions so-called it
was the oil for feet space program
instituted when the reports of the
sanctions were so horrendous you know
hundreds of thousands of children dying
and so on that it was necessary for the
US and Britain to institute some
humanitarian part that was directed by
prominent respected international
diplomats Dennis holiday resigned and on
stron sponeck both Halliday and fauns
Phonak resigned because they called the
humanitarian aspect genocidal that's
their description a fun spa night
published a detail the important book on
it called I think a different kind of
war or something like that which I've
never seen a review of or even a mention
of in the United States which detailed
in great detail exactly how these
sanctions were devastating the civilian
society supporting Saddam because the
people have been simply huddle under the
umbrella of power for survival probably
they didn't say this fella loud it
probably saving Saddam from the fate of
other dictators who the US had supported
and were overthrown by popular uprisings
and there's a long list of them Somoza
Marcos Abu to devalue a even Ceausescu
US was supporting they were overthrown
from within so that wasn't because the
society the civil society that might
have carried that out was devastated he
had a pretty efficient rationing system
people were living on it for survival
but it just it severely harmed the
civilian society then comes the war you
know massive war plenty of destruction
destruction of Antiquities there's no
know properly denunciation of Isis for
destroying antiquities the US invasion
did the same thing
and the millions of refugees horrible
blow that's the society these things
have terrible consequences after there's
a interesting interview with Graham
fuller he's one of the leading Middle
East analyst long background and CIA US
intelligence in the interview he says
something like the u.s. created Isis he
hates him said that he's not joining
with the conspiracy theories that are
floating around the Middle East about
how the u.s. is supporting Isis of
course it's not but what he says is the
u.s. created Isis in the sense that we
established the background from which
Isis developed as terrible off MIT
professor Noam Chomsky when we come back
from break he talks about Cuba US
relations with Venezuela Edward Snowden
US drones the legacy of slavery and a
new chapter and nomes own life stay with
us
RC now democracynow.org the war and
peace report
i meani Goodman as we continue our
conversation with Noam Chomsky we turn
now to Latin America Democracy Now is
Aaron Mott i sat down with Noam Chomsky
yesterday on Democracy Now the MIT
professor emeritus we asked him to talk
about the thawing of u.s. Cuba relations
and us meddling in Cuba the US has been
at war with Cuba for since late 1959
Cuba was had been essentially a colony
of the United States virtual colony in
January 1959 the Castro guerrilla forces
took over by late that year around
October u.s. planes were already bombing
Cuba from Florida in its March 1960
there was a formal decision internally
to overthrow the government
John F Kennedy came in shortly after at
the Bay of Pigs after the Bay of Pigs
that was almost hysteria in Washington
about how to punish the Cubans for this
Kennedy made some incredible speeches
about how you know the future of the
world is at stake and dealing with Cuba
and so on the u.s. launched a major
terrorist war against Cuba we kind of
downplay it and what you get reported is
CIA attempts to you know to kill Castro
bad enough but that was a very minor
part of the major terrorist war as part
of the background for the Missile Crisis
which almost led to a terminal nuclear
war right after the crisis the terrorist
war picked up again meanwhile the
sanctions have been very harsh sanctions
against Cuba right from the Eisenhower
regime picked up extended by Kennedy
extended further under Clinton who
actually outflanked bush from the right
on extending the sanctions the world has
been totally opposed to this the votes
at the General Assembly can't do it at
the Security Council Casillas vetoes
everything but at the General Assembly
the votes are just overwhelming I think
the last one was a hundred and eighty
two to the US in Israel and sometimes
they picked up Papua or something like
that this has been going on year after
year the u.s. is utterly isolated not
just on this issue many others finally
notice that Obama didn't end the
sanctions in fact it didn't even end the
the restrictions many of the
restrictions on travel and so on they
made a mild gesture towards moving
towards normalization of relations
that's presented here the way it's
presented here is we have to test Cuba
to see if
long as Obama put it our efforts to
improve the situation in Cuba have
failed right big efforts to improve the
situation terrorism
sanctions the sanctions are really
incredible
so if say Sweden was sending medical
equipment somewhere which had Cuban
nickel in it that had to be been you
know things like that just went on into
the 90s with the worst part was under
Kennedy then picked up again in the late
70s and so on
major terrorists are provided refuge in
Florida the late Bosh is one Orlando
Bosch the Posadas another you remember
there was something called the Bush
Doctrine pushed to a country that
harbors terrorists is the same as the
terrorists themselves that's for others
not for us we harbor them and also to
support their activities but we have to
test Cuba to see if they're making
successful gestures now that our old
policy of bringing freedom and democracy
didn't work so we have to try a new
policy I mean the irony of this is
almost indescribable the fact that these
words can be said is shocking it's a
sign of again failure to reach a minimal
level of civilized awareness and
behavior but the steps I mean it's a
good it's good that there are small
steps being taken it's interesting to
see what the Cuban the the Cuban
intellectual community there is a
dissident intellectual community in Cuba
reacting to effect is an interesting
article about it
my daughter of each who's a cute of a
specialist but we don't look at that we
don't hear what they're saying the what
are they saying
what they're saying is I was just saying
you know it's a good step that the u.s.
is beginning to move but they've got to
begin to face up to the reality of
what's been happening which is the u.s.
been attacking Cuba and the reason for
the primary reason probably for Obama's
slight moves or that the US was becoming
completely isolated in the hemisphere
it's not just that the world is opposed
the hemisphere is opposed and that's a
remarkable development speaking of Latin
America overall I wanted to turn to the
latest that's happening in Venezuela and
with the u.s. Venezuelan relations
Venezuela has announced the arrest of an
unspecified number of Americans on
charges of espionage at least some of
whom have reportedly been released and
left the country speaking at a rally the
Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro
said the suspects were trying to stoke
anti-government political sentiment
we've detected activity and we have
captured some US citizens and undercover
activities in hidden activities
espionage trying to win over people in
towns along the Venezuelan coast trying
to win over people in some neighborhoods
into jira we captured a pilot of a u.s.
plane of latin origin with all sorts of
documentation president Maduro also
announced new restrictions on the number
of US diplomats allowed in Venezuela and
rule changes that will subject Americans
to the same visa requirements
Venezuelans face in the United States
president Maduro has also unveiled a
list of American politicians barred from
entering Venezuela in response to US
sanctions against Venezuelan officials
last year Maduro has repeatedly accused
right-wing opponents of fomenting a coup
with us support now the White House has
denied the charges but said last week
it's considering tools to quote steer
the Venezuelan government in
correction they should be headed unquote
professor Noam Chomsky a response what's
happening well one question we should
immediately ask ourselves is brought up
by your observation that Venezuela is
planning to impose on US citizens the
same restrictions that the United States
imposes on Venezuelans why do we impose
those restrictions suppose say that Iran
was sending people to the United States
to foment opposition to the government
then the call for change in the regime
how would we react to that unimaginable
but we consider it our right to do that
elsewhere incidentally that is not this
is not a justification of Venezuelan
actions the fact that we do it doesn't
make it justified if others do it no
it's not justified Venezuela has severe
internal problems there's no doubt about
that what is your assessment of Maduro
and how he compares to President Travis
well Maduro Chavez had a charisma and
popular support an appeal that Maduro
doesn't have but there is hard there are
difficult economic circumstances to face
within Venezuela the the economy is in
difficult shape for the during the
Chavez years that were progress in many
areas but there was no success in moving
the news whele away from a strictly oil
based economy there was very little in
the work diversification of the economy
at development of agriculture
development of industry and so on and
that's a pretty weak read for an economy
to rest on it's not a successful
development for
and that's now showing up there were
there inflation problems as they were
never able to deal with the problem of
internal violence it's a not the most
violent country in the atmosphere but
it's pretty bad and these are serious
internal problems they're undoubtedly
being exacerbated to some extent by US
involvement by rights we should be
trying to support the Venezuela to
overcome its internal problems and not
trying to like fires that will make them
worse we could for example eliminate
those restrictions that you're talking
about we could be providing economic and
technical assistance that could be used
to overcome internal difficulties and
these are things that could be done
instead what we're doing is maintaining
a position of extreme hostility this is
not there's plenty of problems
internally and our actions are purposely
making them worse it's not by accident
we want the US government wants to make
them worse because it once the regime
overthrown Chavez's own estimate whether
it's accurate or not I can't judge but
what he's his position is that that the
United States was willing to tolerate
his government up to the point when he
began to play a significant role in OPEC
and convinced the OPEC countries the
oil-producing countries to a lower
production in order to raise prices and
the US was strongly opposed to that and
what he says is that's when the US
government turned against him in fact
the US backed openly back to 2002 which
which briefly overthrew the government
and has continued the subversive
activities
that's his judgment MIT professor Noam
Chomsky coming up he talks about over
with Snowden drone warfare the legacy of
slavery in the United States and gnomes
new love all that and more coming up at
Regas and luis eduardo Altay here on
democracy now democracynow.org the war
and peace report
i meani Goodman with Aaron Mott a we're
spending the hour with MIT professor
author and activist Noam Chomsky we sat
down with him Monday I asked him about
the significance of the leaks by
National Security Agency whistleblower
Edward Snowden and whether he should be
allowed to return to the United States
without facing any charges
he should be welcomed as the person who
carried out the obligations of the
citizen he informed American citizens of
what their government is doing to them
that's exactly what a person who has
real patriotism not the flag-waving type
but real patriotism would do so he
should be honored not just allowed back
it's the people in the government who
should be I was talking to a friend who
is saying you know when you talk about
Edward Snowden what about the issues of
terrorism and having to spy on those who
might want to hurt others if they want
to the the first of all its we can raise
this question but it's academic because
they are not preventing terrorism you
recall when the Snowden revelations came
out the immediate reaction from the
government highest level keith alexander
others was that these NSA programs had
stopped I think they said 54 so acts of
terror gradually when the press started
asking questions it was whittled down to
about 12 finally it came down to one and
that act of terror was a man who had
sent I think eighty five hundred dollars
to Somalia
that's the yield of this massive program
so it is not intended to stop terrorism
it's intended to control the population
that's quite different you have to be
very cautious and accepting claims by
power systems they have no reason to
tell you the truth and you have to look
and ask well what is the truth
and this system is not a system for
protecting terrorism after you can say
the same about the drone assassination
program that's a global assassination
program far away the worst act of terror
in the world it's also a terror
generating program and they know it from
high places you can find quotation after
quotation where they not I take this one
case that I mentioned before this child
has was murdered the drone strike and
after having watched his family burned
to death by drone strike in Yemen what's
the effect of of this on people well
it's to create terror the closer
analysis have shown that that's exactly
what happens very important book by well
important anthropologist who's a
Pakistani native studies tribal systems
it worked in the Northwest Territories
and so on and it's called the fissile
and the drone and he goes through in
some detail the effect on tribal
societies of simply murder with it from
their point of view just murdering
people at random the drone attacks
remember are aimed at people who are
suspected of maybe someday wanting to
harm us I mean suppose say that Iran was
killing people in the United States in
Israel who they thought would might
someday want to harm them they could
find plenty of people would we consider
that legit
it's again we have the right to carry
out mass murder of suspects we think
might harm us someday how does the world
look at this how does the people look at
this in this village where this child
was said that they're terrorized by
constant drone strikes all over
northwest Pakistan that's true now it's
over most of the world the u.s. war so
called war against terror has been a
smashing success there was a small group
up in the tribal areas of mostly
Pakistan Afghanistan al-qaeda we have
succeeded in spreading it over the whole
world
everywhere you know West Africa
Southeast Asia simply generating I think
it's you know it's it's not that the
u.s. is trying to generate terror it's
simply that it doesn't care I wanted to
ask you about syriza in Greece a
movement that started as a grassroots
movement now they have taken power Prime
Minister Alexis tsipras and then you
have Spain right now we recently spoke
to Pablo Iglesias the secretary-general
of the group called podemos that was
founded what an anti-austerity party
that has rapidly gained popularity a
month after establishing itself last
year they won five seats in the European
Parliament in some polls show they could
take the next election which would mean
that Pablo Iglesias the 36 year old
political science professor and longtime
activists could possibly become the
prime minister of Europe's fifth largest
economy he came here to New York for
just about 72 hours and I asked him to
talk about what austerity measures have
meant in Spain austerity means that
people is his policy of their homes
austerity means that the
the social services work anymore
austerity means that public schools have
not the element the means to develop the
activity austerity means that the
countries have not so blend in anymore
and we we became a colony of the
financial powers and economy of Germany
austerity probably means the ends of
democracy I think if we don't have
democratic control of economy we don't
have democracies impossible to separate
economy and democracy in my opinion that
was Pablo Iglesias the head of this new
anti-austerity group in Spain called
podemos which means in English we can
the significance of these movements is
very significant but notice the reaction
the reaction teresa was extremely savage
they made a little bit of progress in
their negotiations but not much the
Germans came down very hard on them in
dealing with sort of forced them to back
off from almost all their proposals
what's going on with the austerity is
really class war as an economic program
austerity under recession it makes no
sense it just makes the situation worse
so the Greek debt relative to GDP is
actually going up during the period of
which is the policies that are supposed
to overcome the debt in the case of
Spain but that was not the public debt
it was private debt it was the actions
of the banks and that means also the
German banks remember when a bank makes
a dangerous risky borrowing somebody's
making a risky lending and the policies
that are designed by
tareka you know I'm basically paying off
the banks the perpetrator is much like
here the population is suffering one of
the things that's happening is that the
policies welfare state is being eroded
that's class war it's not an economic
policy that makes any sense is a serious
recession and there is a reaction to it
Greece Spain and some in Ireland growing
elsewhere France but it's a very
dangerous situation could lead to a
right-wing response very way I'm the
alternative to syriza might be gold dawn
do not see Florida and then you have in
the United States movement around
accountability overall it's the 50th
anniversary of the Selma Bloody Sunday
March 7th when John Lewis now a
congressman and scores of others had
their heads beaten in by Alabama state
troopers it's fifty years later and you
have the black lives matter movement to
have these stories repeatedly around the
country of police officers killing young
people and not so young people of color
what do you make of this movement and do
you see the anti-austerity movement in
Europe the accountability movement in
the United States the movement around
climate change do you see these
coalescing in any way in actual fact the
degree of coalescence is not high we
should remember that take Selma if you
listen to the rhetoric on Martin Luther
King Day it's instructive it typically
ends with the I have a dream speech and
the Voting Rights the Martin Luther King
didn't stop there he went on to
condemning
war in Vietnam and to raising class
issues he began to raise class issues
and turn to the north at that point he a
lot of favor and disappeared he was
trying to he was assassinated when he
was trying to organize a Poor People's
Movement and he was supporting a
sanitation worker strike and in Memphis
there was supposed to be a march to
Washington to people establish a poor
people's what would appeal to Congress
to do something about class issues well
the March actually took place after his
death but his widow ended up in
Washington they set up a tent city
resurrection city Congress is the most
liberal Congress and history probably
tolerated it briefly then sent in the
police in the middle of the night and
drove them out of town that disappeared
from the rhetoric on Martin Luther King
Day so it's it's okay to condemn a
racist sheriff and Alabama but not us
please touch our privilege and power and
that's a large part of the background
these issues are very real there's more
issues here racism is a very serious
problem in the United States there's
take a look at the scholarly work on it
say George frederickson's
study of white supremacy comparative
study it concludes I think plausibly
that the white supremacy in the United
States was even more extreme and savage
than in South Africa just think of our
own history you know our economy our
wealth or privilege relies very heavily
on a century of horrifying slave labor
camps the cotton cotton production was
not just the fuel of the Industrial
Revolution it was the basis for the
the financial system the merchant system
Commerce England as well these were
bitter brutal slave labor camps there's
a recent study by Edward Baptiste which
comes out with some startling
information it's called actually the
title is startling something like the
half was never told which is more or
less true was never told but for example
he shows pretty convincingly that in
this slave labor camps the plantations
would call them politely the
productivity increased more rapidly than
an industry with no technological
advantage advanced just the bull with
just by driving people harder and harder
to the point of survival they were able
to increase productivity and profit and
it's not just the he also points out
that the word torture is not used in
discussion of this period he introduces
and should be use these are camps that
could have impressed the Nazis and it is
a large part of the basis for our wealth
and privilege is there a slave museum in
the United States actually the first one
is just being established now by private
some private donor I mean this is the
core of our history along with the
extermination or expulsion of the native
population but it's it's not part of our
consciousness
no you're headed off on a Latin America
trip right now for a month you'll be in
Brazil you'll be giving talks in
Argentina when you go to Brazil you're
gonna be meeting your new family correct
and I was wondering if you could talk a
little about that we've been talking
about a variety of things that range
from
unpleasant too horrific but we shouldn't
overlook the fact that the world has
some wonderful things in it - and I got
a unexpected wondrous gift from Brazil
that fell into my arms
not long ago we're now filaria we're now
about to celebrate our first anniversary
and off to Brazil to be hilarious family
and what is that like for you you are
seen around the world by many as not
only as a person who shares incredible
political insight in the world but
really is a role model and so can you
talk personally about your your own life
very private person I've never talked
about my own life much but you know I
personally have I've been very fortunate
in my life I thought there have been
tragedies there's been wonderful things
and Valeria's sudden appearance is one
of those wonderful things you said after
your first wife Carole died that life
without love is empty something along
those lines can you talk about that I
could produce some cliches which have
the merit of being true in life without
love is a pretty empty affair and your
own tireless schedule keeping up your
lectures writing extensive articles and
still tirelessly answering the emails
from correspondents from people around
the world when I was in college I
remember I brought you several times and
got back these long detailed answers on
complex questions and there's people
across the globe who could attest with
similar experience do you feel a certain
obligation to respond to people because
nobody would fault you at the age of 86
now if you took more time for
yourself I don't know if it's an
obligation exactly
it's a privilege really these are the
important people in the world
remember wonderful comment by Howard
Zinn about the countless number of
unknown people who are the driving force
in history and in progress and that's
people like I didn't know you but people
like you writing from college these are
people who deserve respect encouragement
to the hope for the future their
inspiration for me personally you
mentioned your daughter avi being an
expert on Cuba among others you have
three children that you and Carol raised
now broadening your family to valaria as
well can you talk about your philosophy
of child rearing in a very politically
active family you have said in the past
that you thought because of your
opposition to the war in Vietnam for
example you might spend years in jail
I'm very close I'm close enough so that
by 1967 68 when resistance activities
were at the heights and I was an
unindicted co-conspirator one trial and
prosecutor announced I'd be the leading
person the next trial in which trial in
which trial these were the so called
trials of the resistance the first was
called the SWAT coffin trial a lot to
say about that the next was the next
ones were called off mainly because of
the Tet Offensive in Vietnam which
convinced the American business
community that the war dragged on and
they
rather significant powerfully they
compelled Johnson to start backing off
and one of the things they did was end
the trials but it was serious enough so
that my wife Carol went back to school
after 16 years to get a finish up with
her doctoral degrees since we had three
kids to take care of but during those
years although I was extremely active I
mean there were times I was giving you
know seven talks a day and going to
demonstrations and so on but I always
managed care to spend as much time as I
could quality time with the kids when
they were growing up so what gives you
hope
things like what you described also the
wonderful things in the world of the
kind that I mentioned like my wife
