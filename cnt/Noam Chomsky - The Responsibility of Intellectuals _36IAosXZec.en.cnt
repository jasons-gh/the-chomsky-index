you wrote a piece in 1966 which changed
your life probably in some ways because
it was a piece at first I imagine for
many in the public brought you to the
responsibility of intellectuals and
profoundly important piece in which you
said it's the responsibility of
intellectuals to speak the truth and
expose lies intellectuals are in a
position to expose the lies of
governments to analyse actions according
to their causes and motives and often
hidden intentions in the Western world
at least they have the power that comes
from political Liberty from access to
information and freedom of expression
for a privileged minority Western
democracy provides the leisure the
facilities and the training to seek the
truth lying hidden beneath the veil of
distortion and misrepresentation
ideology and class interests through
which the events of current history are
presented to us and it seemed to me that
that that that epitomizes what what has
been your role as a public intellectual
is that is that your is that your
guiding principle whether it's been the
role or not is for you to decide but
it's certainly been the guiding
principle something that ought to be
done and yet at the same time yeah
I should say we're entering the part of
the program where there's giving a lot
more applause so we'll get used to it
you have at the same time pointed out at
the same time as talking about what the
response believe in intellectual is I'll
spend a great deal of time essentially
castigating intellectuals pointing out
that the role of intellectuals has not
been that the role of intellectuals in
our society which I guess I first
learned when I was in your class which
surprised me has really been to be
completely complicit in the lies and
distortions and in fact provide an
underlying fabric and story on which
those people can then use to discuss
that it's unfortunate but as a fact I
think that's a well-documented fact
remembered intellectuals of the people
who write in history so they come out
looking pretty good but you've got a
take as usual you have to challenge
things look sort of obvious if you think
about the history of intellectuals I
think you can show that it's quite
different actually the the term
intellectual came into use in its modern
sense pretty much with the Dreyfus trial
in France late nineteenth century no
today we admire and respect respect the
Dreyfus Arts in Missoula you know others
who stood up for justice and so on you
look back at the time they were
persecuted minority the great
intellectuals you know the Immortals of
the French Academy bitterly condemned
and denounced them now how dare you
challenge the Auguste character of the
state you writer with no competence how
can you claim that our army is deceiving
us and so on and in fact animals all I
had to flee from France and that's
pretty typical take almost any society
you like and you find that there's a
fringe of critical dissidents and
they're usually subjected to one or
another form of
it depends on the nature of the society
so if was in Eastern Europe in the last
50 years
they could be jailed say like VAT
Safavieh wasn't it to jail if it was in
our domains in Central America that have
their heads blown off that we don't like
to think of that comparison but it's in
fact true the torture murder
you know atrocities and with our in our
own domain say Latin America was much
worse than what was going on in Eastern
Europe and the post Stalin era but in
both cases there's a harsh repression of
people who are critical of established
power and that goes back as far as you
like it goes back to classical Greece so
who drank the hemlock in classical
Greece it was the person who was
corrupting the youth of Athens and by
asking hard questions that you're not
supposed to ask Socrates
take a look at the biblical record at
roughly the same period you know it's a
kind of oral history but what's
reconstructed from it there were people
who by our standards could be called
intellectuals people who condemned
criticized the king and his crimes who
gave geopolitical analysis and they
warned a warning that the acts of the
kings were going to lead the disaster
who called for mercy and compassion for
widows and orphans and so on now those
are people who are called the
translation is prophets it's a kind of a
bad translation of an obscure eevr word
but in our terms they were functioning
roughly the way dissident intellectuals
do how are they treated you know they
were imprisoned and driven into the
desert and marginalized
there were intellectuals who were
respected flatterers at the court
centuries later they were called false
prophets
but not at the time and I think if you
think through history that pattern is
replicated very consistently let me let
me give a quote of yours to that I want
you to call me I have two quotes in that
regard I wanted to comment on before we
actually get to some of the specifics
which I want to get to you point out
that no one would be disturbed by an
analysis of the political behavior of
Russians French or Tanzanians
questioning their motives and
interpreting their actions in terms of
long-range interest perhaps well
conceived but concealed behind official
rhetoric but it's an article of faith
that American motives are pure and not
subject to analysis although it is
nothing new in American intellectual
history or for that matter in the
general history of imperialist apologia
this innocence becomes increasingly
distasteful as the power it serves grows
more dominant in the world affairs and
more capable therefore of the
unconstrained viciousness that the mass
media present to us each day I I think
that's a defensible state
the point and I remember this vividly
when remember that this statement is the
conclusion from extensive documentation
yeah and and substantiate it and I have
many pages as I've been turning over
because we don't have time to read your
substantiation but I do remember you're
making the statement to me many many
years ago something that that seemed
obvious and that I guess if you asked a
five-year-old I think is the way you put
him they'd give you the answer but you
never hear which is would you expect
that this country would behave
differently than any other country and
would you expect that foreign policy
wouldn't be wouldn't be carried out in
the interests of those who are most
powerful in that country instead of in
terms of altruism but we grow up with
this illusion I didn't grow up in the
United States but but it was the same in
Canada the illusion that somehow this
country was somehow morally superior to
all others yeah it's called American
exceptionalism the only crop the couple
of problems with that concept that
concept is held by every great power
yeah
so there's British exceptionalism French
expection exceptionalism and so on
secondly it's note the exceptionalism is
wrong the roll all the same
now in fact yeah well as there's some
great things I must get but but but I
want you to also come in on this quote
because this is in real our and also
regard to your view towards certain
types of intellectual activity in short
the experts on values spokesman for the
great religions and philosophical
systems will provide fundamental
insights on moral perspectives and the
experts on social theory will provide
general empirically validated
propositions and general quote unquote
general models of conflict from this
interplay new policies will emerge
presumably from application of the
canons of the scientific method
the only debatable issue it seems to me
is whether it's more ridiculous to turn
to experts in social theory for general
well confirmed propositions or to the
specialists in the great religions and
philosophical systems for insights into
fundamental human values I think again
that that's defensible
so so what do we do what we do is
recognize that people like us I suspect
virtually all of us are a privileged
minority we do have unusual freedom by
comparative standards you know there's
plenty you can criticize about the
country but by comparative standards
it's very free the ability of the state
to repress and constrain is quite
limited for anybody who has a degree of
privilege now it's not true if you
happen to be a black kid in the slums
but for people like us you know people
have gone through college or relatively
well-off you know of the have the
resources have the time and have the
access to the Internet have plenty of
opportunities I think that yields
conclusions about what we ought to be
doing I mean quite generally a privilege
confers opportunity an opportunity
confers responsibility and
responsibilities means dedication to
challenging questioning the verities
that are imposed on us by doctrinal
systems and structural arrangements that
are based on hierarchy and domination
and working not only challenging them
but doing something about it
and to the degree that you have
privileges there's more that you can do
I think that's just as simple as that
