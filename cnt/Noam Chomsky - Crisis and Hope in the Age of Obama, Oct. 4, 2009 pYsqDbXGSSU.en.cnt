you
welcome to the first unitarian
universalist church of san francisco a
welcoming community for the liberal
spirit are there any liberal spirits
here today I can't hear you are there
any liberal spirits here today well you
found the right place my name is greg
stewart and i serve this congregation as
its senior minister in this religious
community we do not teach people what to
think instead we teach them how to think
for themselves for we believe that this
present age needs more folk who can make
up their own minds about what the
evidence leads them to believe so
wherever you are on your spiritual
journey you are welcome here with all of
your doubts and all of your certainties
you are one of us to all who are here
this morning I say or this afternoon I
say welcome home and now at this time
church member Delores Peres Priam will
introduce our distinguished guest Flores
before I start could I please ask you
all to turn off your cell phones thank
you I want to say a few words about our
esteemed guest Noam Chomsky who we all
respect and admire when I asked
professor Chomsky to come to speak to us
at the unitarian universalist on behalf
of Unitarian Universalist for peace san
francisco and the school of the americas
watch san francisco he only agreed to
come because he wanted to talk directly
to activists and here we are right as
the title of this event suggests our
nation is in crisis we need to hear the
words and ideas of this insightful man
like many of you whenever I hear or read
Noam Chomsky I am inspired and
challenged he analyzes for us the
inaccuracies of the theories and
political misinformation with which we
are inundated every day as we try to
clarify the issues of our times without
clarity we cannot achieve solutions and
trying to address the problems of our
society whether to stop the wars defend
civil rights or achieve social justice
we have had strong intuitions about what
we must do to make things better dr.
chomsky's research and writings have not
only confirmed our intuition but have
provided answers to these concerns and
have emboldened us to walk the path of
activism through rethinking
reconsidering and recommitment to our
work I come to you today to introduce
Noam Chomsky and to thank him and
acknowledge how grateful we are for his
prophetic voice and a lifetime of
sharing his scholarship and truth with
us so with gratitude
his generosity of spirit let's give him
a big warm San Francisco welcome
no I I guess I misread the programming
thought that David was going to talk but
ok well I was asked to discuss three
major crises one the two wars going on
in the Middle East Iraq and what's now
called F pack Afghanistan Pakistan the
second crises in Latin America and third
the economic crisis at home
unfortunately that doesn't exhaust the
list but i'll keep to those the three
speakers afterwards we'll go into these
areas in more detail i thought it would
be useful for me just open with a couple
of words of background partly the reason
for that is that policies have been
stable for a very long time i'll start
with the Second World War but it's just
like today the policies are pretty much
fixed there's despite the huge changes
in the world system the policies remain
the same adapted the new circumstances
than pretty much bipartisan you know
sometimes one of the parties goes off
the edge the way George W Bush did gets
bitterly attacked even in the mainstream
he's went off to a kind of rattled
radical extremism that harmed the
interests of the main policy that
sources of policy which is mostly in the
private economy is harming them so pull
it back now back in the mainstream again
but the basic concepts and thinking are
very stable and it's important to
understand that and they're stable
because they're based in institutions
and the institutions are stable so
things change but the power continues to
reside in pretty much the same sectors
and they're thinking about the world and
plans about how to deal with the world
carpet corresponding they are pretty
much in very so go back to World War two
and just think about foreign policy
during the world during World War two
from nineteen thirty nine to nineteen
forty-five there were a high-level
meetings of high officials of the
Roosevelt administration State
Department planners and others from the
Council on Foreign Relations the main
extra governmental input into foreign
policy and they laid it they discussed
they took for granted from 1939 that the
u.s. that the words want to end with the
u.s. in a dominant position in the world
the US was going to replace Britain as
the world dominant power the only
question is how domin and they developed
the concept which they called the grand
area the grand area was going to be a
region where the United States quoted
some of the phrases would hold
unquestioned power with military and
economic supremacy throughout the ground
area and would act to ensure the
limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by any state that might
interfere with its global designs well
that's the bush doctrine from 2002 which
caused such anger and fury pretty much
the same and it's been won't go through
the record but it's been pretty much the
same since night from 1939 till today
before the World War the United States
was the richest country in the world by
far but it wasn't really a major player
in the world it was in the hemisphere to
an extent in the Pacific it entered the
Middle East sort of warned its way into
the Middle East but still Britain was
you know the major player though not the
richest one well they knew that that was
going to change so what would the Grand
area be well at a minimum the grand area
was going to include the entire western
hemisphere the traditional backyard the
Far East other powers including the
victims of
japanese aggression were kept out of the
arrangements of san francisco peace
treaty and that ended formally and the
pacific war of the asian countries
except for the philippines which was
colony dis refused to attend because it
was so because their interests were
eliminated the charges against the
japanese even the trials that began in
december seventh nineteen forty one
that's ten years after japanese
aggression over asia devastating effect
so they just stayed away even India so
the Far East was going to be included in
the Grand area the former British Empire
all of it which the United States would
take over and of course the Middle East
that's the grand area at the beginning
they assumed at the time the Germany
would survive the war in effect you know
be a dominant power in Eurasia so there
would be an us controlled world with the
borders that I mentioned and a German
controlled world well as the Russians
began to wear down the German forces the
ver month it became clear it was
becoming clear by about 1943 that
Germany was not going to survive the war
so the Grand area planning expanded to
include as much of Eurasia as possible
but certainly Western Europe which is
the commercial industrial economic core
of Eurasia was at the time well that's
the Grand area and these this conception
of world order remains constant
terminology changes everybody's familiar
with the bush through doctrine people
are less familiar with the Clinton
doctrine which was actually more extreme
than bush it was just presented with a
quiet voice not brazen arrogance didn't
arouse antagonism according to the
Clinton doctrine was
that the US has the right to use force
anywhere to protect markets and
resources now that's considerably more
extreme than Bush to Bush to his
planners insisted on pretexts you know
like you had to have a you trying to
establish democracy or you know trying
to eliminate weapons of mass destruction
or whatever it might be but the Clinton
doctrine required no pretext just we
want to control markets and resources if
there's any barrier to that we have a
right to use force in fact if you read
the documents the Clinton era on the use
of nuclear weapons for example they're
just mind-blowing I think of the most
extreme ever that's Clinton we're now
back to a kind of a Clinton period more
in the center but that's what the center
is well going back to nineteen
forty-five the grand area planning laid
detailed plans to how to run it and
sophisticated plans and they're very
significant because they were in fact
implemented not surprising that was
pretty much the same people who were
running the State Department the new
National Security Council and so on
after the war so what looked at the
post-war history it pretty much
implements these plans well the basic
idea was that each region of the world
in the Grand area was assigned at what
they called its function for the global
South you know third world the function
is essentially to provide resources
markets investment opportunities a cheap
labor later other services like export
of waste and pollution which is major
factor now so that's the function of the
south at the time the United States
wasn't much interested in Africa so the
planners George Kennan was at the basic
documents they he decided that we should
give after
the Europeans to exploit that's the term
that was used for their reconstruction
from wartime damage and if you think
about historical relations between
Europe and Africa you can kind of
imagine a different relationship but
that never apparently never even crossed
anyone's mind there's no discussion of
it so will hand it over to the Europeans
to exploit Middle East oil reserves were
different we're going to take them in
fact the u.s. it already started taking
them it's a mini war going on between
Britain and the United States during the
Second World War over who was going to
control Saudi Arabian concessions that
was understood by the 1930s to be the
jewel in the crown and in fact the US
planners were worried that as they put
it politely the British are trying to
diddle us out of our concessions in
Saudi Arabia by giving the ruling you
know tyrants gifts so therefore
Roosevelt was convinced to declare Saudi
Arabia to be Newton its newly created
Saudi Arabia to be a democratic state
helping in the struggle against fascism
that made it eligible for Lindley sade
so we could buy off the royal family to
grant us the concessions the British
didn't like it but they were in a weak
position of course that was the Middle
East and there was no question about who
was going to run that back in the mid
40s it was described State Department as
a stupendous source of strategic power
that one of the greatest material prizes
in world history when Eisenhower came
along he called it the most
strategically important area in the
world one of the top planners a burly
new dealer pointed out that control over
the middle ever Middle East oil would
provide the United States with
substantial control of the world so
that's no small prize and hang on that
at least is critically important that's
basically the background of the wars
money on and
Iraq and half back even Afghanistan it
has some resources but it's in a
strategic position the edge of the
Middle East oil resources and also now
the Central Asian ones so one critical
element than the background of planning
and Afghanistan is whether the US can
finally implement a plan that's been
around for years through the Clinton
years to set up a pipeline that would go
from Turkmenistan which has a ton of
natural gas to India which means we'd
have to go through Afghanistan and
through Kandahar province or the
Canadian troops are to Pakistan and
India and the point of that is dual one
is to keep Russia from getting it most
of it goes to Russia now and there's
kind of a battle over pipeline battle
over who controls Central Asian
resources they're not comparable to the
to the Gulf but their substantial and
the other reason is just to try to to
intensify the u.s. effort to isolate
grant the natural source for India for a
fossil fuel petroleum zone as Iran and
there are plans for an Iranian Pakistani
pipeline and the US wants to block that
and it is you can if you can provide a
Turkmenistan through Afghanistan
Pakistan pipeline that will keep the
Indians away from making deals with Iran
India is playing a complicated game on
this they're not quite going along but
partially so the us-india nuclear
arrangements last year which essentially
exempted India from the
non-proliferation treaty allows the
United States to contribute to their
nuclear programs which of course means
indirectly their nuclear weapons program
it's also partly seen against that
background part of the effort to prevent
Iran ian entry into the world and this
is a pretty serious business there now
is you may know
china-based the regional alliance the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization which
includes China of course Russia all the
Central Asian states Mongolia and it has
as observers Pakistan India and Iran the
United States asked for observer status
and was turned down so it doesn't have
observer status and they've already
passed resolutions calling for ending of
all US bases in Central Asia a lot of
jockeying about that and they're also
making moves especially China towards
the Middle East you know the real
investments in Saudi Arabia and so on
and that's really threatening because
that's remember the most strategically
important part of the world mainly Saudi
Arabia and if you control that you can
control the world so there's a lot at
stake what's in the background of
Afghanistan and Iraq is not slight I'm
in Iraq itself has the probably the
second largest oil reserves in the world
well you'll hear more about that later
the that's turned quickly Latin America
in Latin America the internal documents
which have since been released I make it
make this planning extremely clear us
back around nineteen fifty though the
they identify the primary threat to us
interests in Latin America as radical
and nationalistic regimes that appeal to
the masses of the population and seek to
satisfy the popular demand for immediate
improvement in the low living standards
of the masses and development for
domestic needs I mean if if this kind of
stuff sounds like it's coming out of a
you know a Maoist pamphlet it's not
surprising the business classes are
dedicated Marxist vulgar marks it's just
the values are inverted and they always
talking about the man
and this and that and what we have to do
to control them so the redder is you
know kind of like mouse pamphlets just
different values lots of a difference
sometimes well the radical and
nationalist regimes that appeal to the
masses of the population they want
development for domestic needs those
tent and those tendencies conflict I'm
still reading National Security Council
conflict with demand for a political and
economic climate conducive to private
investment which means of course US
investment and with adequate
repatriation of profits and protection
of our raw materials that's George
Kennan again they're our raw materials
by accident happened to be somewhere
else but we've got a protectant and Ken
and in fact is considered a kind of
about the humanist fringe of planning
was very much in favor of supporting
police states violent repression to
ensure the protection of our resources
and our interests in Latin America the
this conception is just not just applied
to Latin America the United States a
global power so you find the same
thinking all over the world for example
when the u.s. to take a currently
crucial case ever had when the US and
Britain or through the parliamentary
government of Iran in 1953 and installed
brutal tyrant who reigned until 79 the
New York Times expressing the the
doctrinal wing of the power system their
editors published an editorial praising
they knew what was happening no secret
about it praising the overthrow of the
parliamentary government and saying that
it will provide an object lesson to
underdeveloped countries with rich
resources that go berserk with fanatical
nationalism now they'll see what happens
to them if they
I to take our resources they were trying
thinking of trying to nationalize our
resources there so this was a good thing
and strolling the Shah was fine they
said it's going to be more troubles like
this elsewhere but may be sensible
leaders will understand the penalty they
pay if they try to interfere with brand
re planning our economic military and
economic supremacy and access to the
resources and raw materials and markets
which are ours by right that's why you
never get any criticism of anything in
the doctor'll system their criticisms of
us power because it's costing too much I
selects a Obama is considered a you know
principle critic of the Iraq war his
criticism if he looked back was that it
was a strategic blunder it's costing too
much I got worked and so on in fact what
he's saying what he said was pretty much
what you could read in Pravda in 1985
when the Russians had invaded
Afghanistan in the press there were
condom nations of it as strategic
blunder it's going to cost too much when
I get enough it's not worth it in fact
the if we had records I'm sure he could
have heard it that in discussions of the
German General Staff after Stalingrad
when they recognized that a two-front
war was a strategic blunder should have
knocked out England then going after
Russia so there are a lot of there is
criticism of strategic blunders and
errors and failures of that kind but
that's about the limit and anywhere in
the doctrinal system young maybe way out
at the fringes something else but his
very constant Vietnam War perfect
example no time well continuing the with
another aspect of planning back in the
1940s with regard to Latin America is
that they should we must make sure that
they avoid what was called excessive
excessive industrialization
excessive means competing with the u.s.
so if they want to develop a steel
industry say in Brazil that's okay but
should be the kind of Steel we don't
want to bother producing low cost low
tech steel but not competing with us so
we gotta block excessive
industrialization policies that are
directed to improving below living
standards of the masses and so on and a
good bit of the history of us and latin
america right up till today is just that
playing out of this thinking it's kind
of it's pretty familiar back in the 17
in the 18th century adam smith who was
essentially preaching more in a more
nuanced form than today but pretty much
the same ideas that we preach to the
third world he advised the american econ
the american colonies after liberation
to follow the proper principles of
economic thinking which are still the
proper principles his advice was that
the newly liberated colonies should
follow what we now call compare
comparative advantage do what you're
good at so send us send fish and
agricultural products and fur and so on
but don't and use import a superior
British goods that's economically
efficient anything else would violate
the Holy principles of economics which
hadn't changed much he also urged the
United States not to make the mistake of
trying to monopolize its resources but
rather leave them open to the world
meaning primarily England at that time
that's economic realism the same
doctrines preached by the World Bank in
the IMF to the third world well you know
the United States didn't follow the
advice Alexander Hamilton who ran the
economy ran a state directed economy
they set up huge very high tariffs who
has had the highest tariffs in the world
during the period of its economic growth
huge economic growth keep out cheaper
British manufacturers that's how the US
was able to develop a textile industry
and everything that spun off the textile
industries first stage of
industrialization later steel industry
saying didn't use a superior British
steel what's now called piracy and
barred by the World Trade Organization
namely taking superior technology for
more advanced countries and using it and
adapting it a very extensive state
intervention in the economy I all just
went on right until the Second World War
by that time the US was far and away the
richest country in the world it was
everybody else was destroyed and it was
sort of willing to toy with some version
of free trade just figure we're going to
win so let's have free trade but it
didn't end there in fact that began the
biggest period of state intervention in
the economy in the United States which
runs right up till today and that's the
development of high-tech industry I mean
if you use the internet and computers
Blazers fly on airplanes that kind of
thing it's mostly most of the works
coming out of the state sector serious
work so the taxpayers paying for it and
ultimately if anything works it gets
privatized and the fundamental system is
that a cost and risk are socialized and
profit is privatized and we call it free
markets but the US didn't follow the
advice of the best economists and
therefore prospered there were countries
that had to follow that advice because
they had they had not freed themselves
from British force india egypt Britain
and France and others and that's
basically where the division between the
first and third world began to take off
in the 18th century Indian China were
the
most advanced sectors of the world and
industry commerce public health many
other respects well that's with regard
to that with regard to Mexico you know
the crucial part of Latin America there
was further thinking so in around
nineteen ninety there was a strategy
development workshop at the Pentagon
evaluating us-mexico relations and they
found these relations to be in their
words extraordinarily positive I mean
not troubled by stolen elections a huge
repression you know crushing to the
labor movement all that was fine so
everything was extraordinarily positive
but they did see a cloud on the horizon
the cloud was what they called a
democracy opening in Mexico which they
feared might bring into office a
government more interested in
challenging the United States on
economic and nationalist grounds okay
violating Grand area thinking and they
had a that a cure they recommended a US
and so that others a US Mexican treaty
which would lock Mexico in to the
neoliberal reforms of the 1980s and
would tie the hands of current and
future governments of Mexico because
they'd be bound by treaty to keep to
this and that would avert the threat of
a democracy opening well there's a name
for the outcome of that it's called
NAFTA that's basically what it is other
things too but that's core purpose and
that was understood and the same year
that Clinton introduced you know rammed
NAFTA through into implementation over
the opposition of the American
population incidentally but that same
year nineteen ninety-four Clinton also
began to militarize the Mexican US
border it had been an open border like
most borders it was established by force
by conquest and pretty much the same
people lived on both sides of the border
across the border to visit your
relatives and friends and so on but in
1994 Clinton initiated Davos called
Operation gatekeeper to militarize the
border and we don't have internal
documents from that period but if they
were come out I'm pretty sure what
you're going to see is that they
understood that they're going to destroy
the night Mexican economy Mexican
agriculture won't be able to compete
with highly subsidized us agribusiness
so peasants will be driven off the farms
US businesses won't be able to compete
with us-based multinationals which under
NAFTA have to have the rights of persons
of people rights of Mexicans national
treatment at school for Mexican comes to
the United States he doesn't get
national treatment if he asks for that
he'll end up in Guantanamo but if a u.s.
corporation goes to mexico they have to
get national treatment which means the
Mexican businesses won't be able to
compete and you get you know destruction
of that part of the Mexican economy and
so you it'll almost inevitably lead to a
flow of people fleeing from the wreckage
of the Mexican economy and they'll be
joined in fact already were being joined
by the people fleeing from Reagan's
terrorist wars in Central America so
we've got to do something about it so
that's the militarization of the board
which of course still going on a
complicated story well with regard to
Latin America altogether though it was
also understood our control over Latin
America was understood to be very
critical Nixon's National Security
Council declare its in secret no public
that could bet if we can't control Latin
America how are we going to control the
rest of the world you know so at least
we got to control that so I was no joke
that was at the moment when they were
planning the overthrow of the IND
government and
in Chile and the reasoning was very much
the same as what the New York Times
expressed with regard to Iran in 1953 we
have to have an object lesson two
countries that go berserk with radical
nationalism and challenge our domination
of their economies in there that don't
perform the services their proposed to
perform when we decide them their
function as Kissinger put it a chili the
Democratic if there's a Democratic
Socialist development in Chile it could
be what he called a virus that would
spread contagion elsewhere he thought it
would spread contagion all the way to
southern Europe he didn't think that
chilean army was going to land in rome
he thought that it would be a model that
the southern European Social Democrats
in those days called euro communist I
might want to follow might inspire them
to go on and therefore you got to stop
it right away that's a leading principle
of international affairs it's not
studied very much and there isn't any
name for it but it ought to be called
the Mafia principle The Godfather does
not tolerate disobedience and if some
small storekeeper doesn't pay protection
money it may be the Godfather the needed
or won't even notice it but you can't
let them get away with it no matter how
small they are because it could be a
virus that would spread contagion others
might say ok we'll do it too and if you
look over the history of the period was
since the Second World War one leading
theme is the Mafia principle it has very
striking applications time to talk about
them but happening right now well that's
in fact Iran is a case in point top US
policy in Iran or US policy towards Cuba
is overriding public opinion in the US
but that's normal public opinions not
considered relevant unless it's
organized and active and
much of a nuisance but it's not in these
cases but what's more interesting about
in Iran and Cuba is that US policy is
overriding major economic interests so
in the case of Cuba agribusiness energy
corporations pharmaceutical corporations
want to establish normal relations that
just as the large majority of the
American population do for their own
interests but that's not going to allow
and the reason is very clear was stated
back in the days of the Kennedy
administration very clearly Cuba is
engaged in what was called successful
defiance of US policy is going back to
the Monroe Doctrine and that cannot be
tolerated as Arthur Schlesinger putted
who's Kennedy's Latin American advisor
the real threat of Cuba he said is
Castro's idea of taking matters into
your own hands and working for the
interests of your own population is that
that could appeal to others and Latin
America are faced with the same problems
and therefore we better get rid of it
right there though successful defiance
can be tolerated and this savagery of
the US attack against Cuba is really
quite incredible and not just the
terrorist wars which are bad enough but
the details of the surveillance of Cuba
to make sure that if any ship stops
anywhere in the world and picks up
something that has a little bit of Cuban
nickel in it they've got to be barred
from international commerce the u.s.
expends enormous efforts on that and has
for 50 years and that makes sense you
cannot accept successful defiance it's
just too dangerous same in Iran American
energy corporations would be happy to go
in and exploit your ins resources and
they're usually influential me on stop
in a second but
they're being overridden in this case
because the Quran has also been engaged
in successful defiance since 1979 well I
was going to say something about the
situation at home but leave that for the
moment that's in brief everything's
happening exactly as you should expect
you take a look at Obama's fine
financial base it's mostly financial
industries so yes they're getting
wonderful gifts and they're very happy
about it you know business press is
gloating about months ago the business
was gloating that the insurers of one
health care battle yeah they're getting
everything they wanted the big banks
that caused the crisis are better off
than before they've been merged into
still bigger banks which means that they
get the huge government insurance policy
which is called too big to fail so you
ought to take risks make sense to take
risks because you make a lot of money
out of it and you're going to be paid
off when things go wrong as they surely
will so there's nothing unpredictable
about it oh one last comment on the gap
between public opinion and public policy
which is very significant technical
names were scolded and democratic
deficit that's evident on health care on
the bailout and foreign policy just
about everywhere you looked and pretty
well studied in fact now that's not a
law of nature then have to be that way
it's been overcome in the past by
militant organized dedicated action and
it can be again that's the only word
i'll say about hope because you people
are hope so i've talked to you about
well well see us at Odessa Tolos
afternoon first of all thank you again
dr. Chomsky for an incredibly
enlightening lecture and something to
think about for a long time my name is
David bacon I'm going to moderate the
rest of this panel here today and this
is intended to be a dialogue between dr.
Chomsky and activists or people who are
active in our local community here and
because we are concentrating on what
this the meaning is for our community
here i want to say first of all it's a
great thing that we are meeting in this
church here this was the church where
slavery was defeated in california and
thomas snark king was memorialized on
the wall there was the main reason why
california came into the United States
as a free state and why we never had
slavery implantations here right across
the street is the International
longshore and warehouse Union and it was
the general strike here in San Francisco
that made our community and the politics
of our community so much of what it is
today so this is a good place for us to
meet and to talk about all of this what
we are going to do today is we're going
to have three separate presentations
short presentations and then we're going
to ask dr. Chomsky to respond to them
and I think that by that time we're
going to have to dog this one off
because our time will run out so to
begin with I want to introduce our first
presenter Antonio juhasz Antonia and I
share an interest in Iraq and the oil in
Iraq and I think we owe her a great debt
of gratitude because we've all said all
the way along that the war in Iraq was a
war for oil but it was Antonia that
really put
that into the media and into the
national political discourse here she
wrote two books one of them about oil
itself the tyranny of oil and also the
bush agenda invading the world one
economy at a time she's an associate
fellow for the Institute for Policy
Studies and currently is the director of
the freedom from oil campaign at global
exchange here and a policy analyst with
foreign policy in focus her bio notes
that she was arrested multiple times in
fact I think all of us have been
arrested multiple times and maybe we
should announce how many times and see
who comes out the winner here in any
case I'm Tonya
arrested four times in the cause of
peace all of my arrests in the cause of
peace well this is an incredible honor
you all came here to hear professor
Chomsky professor Chomsky came here
because he wanted to be in a room of
activists and he require that there be
activists here to make sure that you all
get involved in activism so I have five
minutes not enough time to go into depth
about oil and Iraq and Afghanistan
fortunately I have several books which
are for sale outside which you can read
on these topics but I am going to spend
my time making sure that I fulfill this
promise which is making sure that you
all hear the hope that was at the end of
Professor chomsky's presentation and
while as we all know we have seen the
same agenda being pursued by US
government's decade after decade after
decade there are some pretty important
differences at the extreme and two of
those important differences are the
extent and willingness of the government
at hand to utilize the military to
advance those objectives and the other
is the extent of the government at hand
to utilize itself to intervene on behalf
of public interests in the market or
intervene on behalf of intervene with
corporate interests on behalf of the
public interest we are at probably the
most critical moment in the long
histories of the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan this week right now we have
a government that I believe is genuinely
honestly debating what it should do
right now in Afghanistan should it
increase troops by 40,000 or should it
figure out a timetable for full
withdrawal if anyone has been listening
watching the news this morning General
James Jones the National Security
Council advisor has been hitting the
airwaves saying that there is a conflict
within the administration between the
military asking for 40,000 troops and
the administration which is trying to
rethink its strategy but the other thing
that he continually emphasizes is the
regional significant
of Afghanistan it's not just Afghanistan
it's the region and as professor Chomsky
said what how Afghanistan has generally
referred to by people like General James
Jones whose previous job before he
joined the Obama administration was the
head of the Institute for 21st century
energy at the US Chamber of Commerce he
was the oil industry's main lobbying
representative with his core function
being to try and better unite us energy
and military policy General James Jones
is the head of the National Security
Council now and the way that he refers
to Afghanistan is as the energy corridor
so it's Kazakhstan azerbaijan uzbekistan
there's a lot of oil up there and has to
get out to hear some way and that's
afghanistan and pakistan however we are
at a moment where for the first time the
majority of the American public opposes
the war in Afghanistan almost sixty
percent of the american public opposes
the war almost seventy percent of
Democrats oppose the war and there is
real internal debate within the Congress
within the administration itself on what
is the right method to deal with
attempting to hold on to this oil right
so the US government has always tried
and always has used the military to get
oil but how much military there's a
reason why the Clinton administration
did not fully invade Iraq but instead
did aerial bombardment right and in the
bush administration came in and it
brought in at this point now hundreds of
thousands of troops that have occupied
the nation brought in troops in
Afghanistan that have now been occupying
the nation and on Wednesday we start the
ninth year of the invasion of
Afghanistan that's this Wednesday this
week the Congress is debating the
defense authorization bill this week the
Obama administration has said that in
this week or the next week it's
to decide on its strategy for
Afghanistan and as I keep saying there
is immense dissension within the ranks
of the Democratic Party even among
conservative Republicans even among
Republicans that the US military should
be being utilized as it is at this
moment that it isn't rather a better
idea to pull the military back and use
different devices to make sure that we
hold on to that oil I think we all are
in the column that firmly believe that
the military shouldn't being being used
eight US soldiers and to Afghanistan
police officers were killed just
yesterday in Afghanistan August was the
highest death toll for US soldiers in
afghanistan since from january to august
1,500 Afghani citizens have been killed
and I want to read you a very important
poll that just came out because this is
a pack now right and when they talk
about regional security the focus is on
Afghanistan Pakistan eighty percent of
Pakistanis just pulled said that they
are opposed to us assistance in
Pakistan's fight against terrorism
that's a twenty percent increase since
March we are creating more enemies right
for the military presence the military
needs to come home now you have a lot of
ways that you can make it happen this
week this week is when the debate is
happening this week is when the money's
being authorized or the strategy is
being set this is the week to act so on
Monday there are protests happening at
Lockheed Martin's facility in sunnyvale
targeting the military contractors
beneficiaries on Wednesday there are
vigils being held on saturday the 17
there's a rally protest that starts at
civic center but in between what you
need to do during this week is this is
the week where it really matters where
you need to call your elected officials
you need to contact the Obama
administration because believe
me the other side is so what has
happened in the shift in
administration's moving from essentially
an oil administration to essentially a
finance administration is that the oil
lobby has dramatically increased its
financial presents its lobbying presence
on Capitol Hill with Congress and with
the Obama administration it's never
spent more money on lobbying than its
spent in the just so far this year in
the years and even over believe me
they're hearing from the other guys they
need to hear from you this week you need
to make a call you need to write a
letter you need to participate in a
protest you need to stand up individual
you need to contact the all the amazing
activist organizations that are dripping
from the Bannister's in a city like San
Francisco and you need to do it this
week and we also have an amazing great
local target the chevron corporation
yeah my actual title isn't the head of
the freedom from oil campaign it's the
head of the Chevron program I stopped
writing so that I could target Chevron
there the fifth largest corporation in
the world the largest corporation in
California they have been and continue
to be one of the key drivers in trying
to gain access to a racks oil and guess
where they have great big oil operations
kazakhstan guess the only way to get the
oil out of kazakhstan through
Afghanistan this is a great key
corporate target that we can all focus
on the mobilization for climate justice
is a local network organizing actions
October 24th November 30th target lots
of targets including the chevron
corporation so come to our table at
global exchange show professor Chomsky
that activists live here and that you're
going to take action when you leave this
room thank you very much
you know another reason why this place
is important is because we're just a
couple of blocks away from auto row
what's left of auto row which is where
the civil rights movement in San
Francisco had this greatest and largest
demonstrations here on and were just a
few blocks from City Hall where the
students were washed down the steps in
1960 but in the process Delta telling
blow to the house and American
Activities Committee and helped end
McCarthyism in this country we have a
new civil rights movement in the bay
area here and the fact that we do I
think was a great deal to our next
speaker Steve Williams who is one of the
most brilliant community organizers that
we have not just here in California but
nationally as well too it's
overwhelmingly a movement of young
people on who are questioning the basic
nature of our system and that owes a lot
to Steve as well too who co-authored a
book called towards land work and power
which is really a treatise on political
economy for young organizers i'm steve
is the co-founder and executive drew
co-executive director of power people
organized to win employment rights which
is a multi lingual multi racial
membership organization for low-income
workers and families who are fighting
for economic gender and racial justice
here in San Francisco
so I've been arrested seven times mostly
in the cause of peace and justice and I
first of all just like to congratulate
professor Chomsky for an amazing act of
intellectual acrobatics sort of
connecting the crises that are taking
place all around the globe right now and
I think it's critical to sort of
remember what Antonia is pointing out
that the way that the ruling elite in
the United States has responded to these
crises is war and it's not just war
abroad but what we're seeing more and
more is that that war is happening
inside the borders of the United States
so we already know that the unemployment
rates have gone up and up right so the
unemployment rates in the United States
are almost ten percent and that's
officially right in in the country
abroad in the african-american community
it's more than fifteen percent in the
Latino community it's more than thirteen
percent those are just the official
numbers when we look at those people who
are out of the system are those people
who are just piecing together one small
part time job with another small part
time job the number grows to about 30
million people larger than the whole
population of canada right and then when
we include those 30 million people plus
the 45 46 million people without health
insurance in this country when we look
at the rates of housing foreclosures
that continue to escalate while
financial institutions get trillions of
dollars we understand more and more that
the war is happening inside the United
States in a different form with
different tools but happening in a very
aggressive way now oftentimes those of
us here in San Francisco like to think
well we march against the war we hate
most of the stuff that's happening on
Wall Street so we've created a bubble
we've created a sanctuary here in San
Fran
Cisco but it's in it's important that we
understand that San Francisco is engaged
in that war at home as well under the
leadership of Gavin Newsom san Francisco
has continued the neoliberal policies of
attacking low income and working people
in this city as the city faces tens of
billions of dollars in deficit this year
the city has made a deliberate attempt
to try to make up some of that deficit
by stealing money I said stealing money
from undocumented immigrants the San
Francisco Police Department has been
directed to stop anybody who's Latino
see whether they have a driver's license
if they don't have a driver's license to
impound their car unlike when we get our
cars impounded undocumented immigrants
aren't allowed to get their cars for at
least a week and as a consequence just
to get their cars in order to be able to
go do the work cleaning houses preparing
food raising people's kids undocumented
immigrants have to pay at least five
thousand dollars to be able to get their
car back the women of power have begun
an organizing project targeting the San
Francisco Police Department and
targeting the auto company to stop the
racial profiling that's happening in San
Francisco right now
but the attacks aren't just happening on
the Latino community over the last 10
years the population of African
Americans in the city has fallen by more
than sixty percent the bulk of black
people in San Francisco live out in
Bayview Hunters Point a neighborhood
that is under the boot of gentrification
and displacement largely by a
corporation based in Miami called lennar
lennar was granted access to developing
luxury condominiums on the site of the
old Naval Shipyard the same site where
the bombs that were dropped on Nagasaki
and Hiroshima at the end of world war
two shipped out of a land that is
riddled with toxic waste lennar was able
to attain that waterside property for
the grand total of one dollar now I'm
sure that we could raise way more than
one dollar today if we tried to collect
money to say that we're interested in
developing bayview-hunters point the
naval shipyard in a way to meet the
needs of the residents of that
neighborhood but we were never given a
choice of pursuing that interest instead
gavin newsom sold the shipyard for one
dollar to the lennar corporation and the
lennar corporation now in its haste to
build luxury condominiums is saying that
they're not going to clean up the toxic
waste but they are instead just going to
plow cement over it that is going to be
their process of cleaning up this
federally recognized Superfund site it
is critical at this particular stage
that all of us call the board of
supervisors to say that we want an end
to the racial profiling that is
targeting Latinos in this city we also
want an end to the land grab that is
taking place with the Bay View shipyard
in order to make sure that people who
live in Bayview actually have an
opportunity to design their futures and
to take back that neighborhood now
professor Chomsky reminds us that
ultimately public opinion really doesn't
mean anything unless it's organized
mobilized and so as we make those phone
calls it's critical that people get in
contact with power so that we can
continue to give you information about
what is happening in people's lives and
you can contact us at our website which
is www.hyken.com or whether we're
emerging from capitalism in crisis the
model of economic development that San
Francisco has been employing is not just
attacking working-class people of color
in this city it is attacking the quality
of life the city that all of us love it
is critical that we figure out new
models of economic development in order
to be able to create a San Francisco
that is home to the diversity and to the
people who built this city thank
well now it's my turn I was a union
organizer for about 25 years before I
started writing and taking pictures for
a living so I still sort of see the
world and kind of class working-class
terms and in terms of kind of what the
effect is on working people of the broad
issues that we're talking about here and
so that's why I want to start is looking
at how the operation of the global
system that dr. Chomsky described what
its impact is on working people on the
grass roots of people around the world
and maybe we could start by looking at
Columbia because we're going to have a
free trade agreement with Colombia in
Congress next year and we ought to
understand how people in Colombia look
at it and what the impact on them it's
going to be Colombia is already a
country that's full of refugees partly
because there's been a civil war for the
last quarter century they're partly
because paramilitaries are killing
social activists and trade unionists 100
trade unions die every year in Colombia
3,800 trade unionists have died in
Colombia on since 1986 partly because
Columbia's been under pressure for
decades from the International Monetary
Fund in the World Bank to cut its public
sector budget which in turn causes mass
terminations this January 42,000 state
agency workers alone on the money that
Colombia its government saves by cutting
social services and people's jobs then
gets turned over to foreign banks and
lending institutions in order to make
Colombia more attractive to foreign
investors the head of the human rights
department of the Colombian union
federation edgar pious says that even
Plan Colombia the so-called us drug war
in Colombia is really a pretext for
protecting transnational investors he
says this
creates a much more favorable
environment for the exploitation of our
natural resources in our labor force and
it also provides support for the
implementation of a US Colombia free
trade agreement a free trade agreement
with Colombia essentially is going to
recreate the experience of the increased
us penetration of Mexico that we saw
under NAFTA or the penetration of
Central America under CAFTA politically
economically even militarily what did we
see with NAFTA in Mexico on the
privatization of foreign corporations
the destruction of people's unions the
mass layoffs of workers Mexico used as a
dumping ground for us agricultural
products by some of the largest
corporations in the world subsidized by
our farm bill while at the same time
Mexico had to cut its subsidies for its
small farmers a 40-percent poverty rate
this is the government of Mexico that
says this no program for increasing
employment there so when you ask what is
the consequence of a free trade
agreement with Colombia going to be well
what was the consequence of CAFTA and
after before it what was the consequence
of all of these economic reforms and the
main effect at hannam working people was
it produced displaced people in fact
displacement is the most important
product of these economic policies
wherever they're implemented in the time
that NAFTA's been effect in effect from
1994 to now six million people from
Mexico have come to live here in the
United States and year before last they
sent back home 26 billion dollars which
essentially takes the place of the
social investment that the Mexican
government would ordinarily be
responsible for making in its own
country this it produces a crisis for
working people that's what the uprising
in Oaxaca was all about that there is no
alternative to people other than leaving
home and going somewhere else looking
for work and survival so these trade
agreements they don't
off the flow of migrants they produce it
and then our immigration policies and
laws regulate it in fact displacement
and migration they're not some kind of
byproduct of trade agreements or this
economic system because our economic
system here in the United States is
dependent on the labor that this
displacement produces but increasingly
that labor is now being criminalized we
saw the big raids that the Bush
administration had in meatpacking plants
in the last couple of years now we see
mass firings like the 1,800 people at
American Apparel in Los Angeles who are
losing their jobs this is the Obama
administration's immigration policy so
our Congress and the administration
aren't trying to stop migration because
nothing can it's not really about
keeping people from crossing the border
at all it's really about making workers
vulnerable and unequal because
inequality means lower wages and higher
profits for employers and if you think
I'm just blowing smoke this is the
council on foreign relations which says
that the purpose of our immigration
reforms should be to reform the legal
system so that it operates more
efficiently responds more accurately to
labor market needs and enhances us
competitiveness as a trade unionist
whenever you hear competitiveness us
competitiveness employers
competitiveness you know what that means
it means people losing their jobs it
means low wages so I want to end by
asking some questions here really on can
we really have a movement of solidarity
between the people in our country people
like you like me ourselves you're
sitting in this room with people in
Colombia or in Mexico or in central
america that doesn't tackle the basic
corporate program on trade and
displacement and investment how can we
stop the corporate effort to increase
profits and investments in Colombia or
Peru or Central America or Mexico all of
the countries where these agreements are
in effect
by attacking the standard of living
labor standards or labor law how can we
work to increase the security of workers
and farmers and to reduce displacement
and forced migration but also
recognizing that for some time to come
people are still going to be displaced
are still going to be crossing that
border looking for work how are we going
to be able to keep people from being
criminalized how are we going to be able
to defend the rights of those workers
who are being forced into migration
thanks
so I think now we're going to give
professor Chomsky a chance to respond to
the questions that were raised by our
speakers here
I'd like to exploit the opportunity but
it would be exploiting I took too long
altogether I think it would be more
constructive to turn it over to the
audience okay well there are a couple of
you know there's several themes that
were brought up which are quite accurate
and could be expand extended so Antonia
pointed out one of the things that this
is debate going on about Afghanistan and
its policies there's a kind of a debate
going on the sort of strange one one
voice is missing in the debate Afghans
they're not supposed to participate and
it's taken for granted like nobody talks
about it on it's our world we own it we
run it will decide what to do in our
entry and doesn't mean you and me it
means those who control policy and
control the economy they'll decide and
nobody else matters it doesn't matter
what American population thinks and what
the Afghans think amounts to zero I mean
at least you see some references to the
fact that the u.s. population is opposed
what about the Afghans they're not
supposed to play any part in this
decision well that's and you know it's
not that they're silent they're not
silent for example there's an Afghan
peace movement pretty significantly they
have some very eloquent spokespersons we
don't know exactly the scale of it
because you know you don't investigate
that kind of thing you try to count you
know the number of people with guns or
something like that but not the peace
movement but there is information about
it now the one of the most eloquent
spokespersons if you haven't ritter you
should as Malalai Joya who's a credible
young woman I guess not so young anymore
who lived through the Russian occupation
the warlord regime you
backwards after the Russian occupation
tour the country to shreds under the
Taliban who were actually welcomed
because the Warlord's were so monstrous
and under the current regime which is
the world lights again it's called the
Karzai regime and throughout this whole
period she's been constantly engaged in
a constructive opposition things like
trying to organize girls schools and
villages health programs and so on how
she survived as a miracle I mean she was
elected to the Parliament with plenty of
support but continued to criticize the
members of the Parliament the warlord
gangsters and she was thrown out of the
parliaments living underground heavy
protection but she has a voice and she
has a book that just came out a while
ago which is very eloquent she sometimes
speaks you may be speaking here but her
basic point is the same as that of the
Afghan peace movement which she says it
looked were perfectly happy to have an
invasion from the West an invasion of
schools hospitals development should be
she doesn't say it but we should an
invasion of reparations for the crimes
we've committed against them that's a
fine reparation invasion but we don't
want an invasion of guns and tanks
that's only going to recreate the
horrors now we live under the threat of
the top of on the Warlord's the NATO
forces and that's what we want to get
rid of we'll work things out for
ourselves from well that voice again we
don't really know how broad it is but it
seems to be significant and it's silence
it's silence because we allow it to be
silenced it shouldn't be the kind of
debate that's going on in Washington
should not be permitted to take place
doesn't matter what your view is because
it's not up to us or Washington to
decide what ought to be done in
Afghanistan invaders have no right
they only have responsibilities and that
should be understood well that's a voice
that's missing Steve said something kind
of actually David and his opening
remarks mentioned something quite
relevant which Steve and then David
later picked up he pointed out that the
church was at the forefront of
eliminating slavery in the United States
but slavery wasn't eliminated in the
United States we know that some
amendments were passed during the Second
World Civil War but they were never
implemented I mean they were briefly
there was a period of about 10 years
reconstruction when there was sort of
semi freedom limited freedom for the
black slaves it ended in 1877 I with a
compact between the parties and north in
the south and what happened after that
was criminalizing black life exactly
what both of you talked about
criminalizing the life of the poor which
meant blacks and it was done you know
and now it's done by charges of having a
joint in your pocket or something or
some other thing then it was done by
vagrancy or talking too loudly when a
white woman is around or some other
charge but effectively black life was
criminalized and once you were caught in
the criminal system you could never get
out of it because she had to be the
costs of the courts which you couldn't
pay and so it's permanent so in fact the
permanent slave labor force was formed
red tended by starting 10 years after
the Civil War and that form of slavery
was much worse than actual slavery for
very good capitalist reasons in fact
reasons that the slave owners used to
justify having slaves and nobody ever
answered their arguments their arguments
were that owning slaves is more moral
than renting people if you own to be
anachronistic if you own a car
you going to take care of if you rent a
car chances are you won't take care of
the car will be better off a couple
years later of its own and that was
their argument for slavery much more
moral than what's called free labor that
is raining people well the criminalized
system under which black life was
criminalized that created a slave labor
force where the owners the masters had
no responsibility they had no capital
investment in the workforce so they
treated them miserably if you look at
the record it's much worse than slavery
and it's not a small thing that's a
large part of the core the American
industrial revolution that took place in
the late 19th early 20th century Lauda
was based on slave labor treated much
worse than slavery that lasted until the
Second World War Second World War there
was a need for what's called free labor
he had to have labor for war industry
and so on so you know this second worst
kind of slavery kind of ended and in the
early post-war period it was a period of
substantial economic growth best in
economic history in fact went on till
the 70s and then there was a need for an
openings for labor for skilled blue
collar labor and african-americans had a
chance to move into the society and get
job in an auto plant get a pretty good
contract from UAW you know buy a house a
car and so on well that ended around the
mid 70s with the neoliberal period being
initiated that's a period of
financialization of the economy sending
productive capacity abroad because it's
more profitable for the owners and
managers setting workers around the
world in competition with one another
which of course lovers wages that's the
point of the trade agreements meanwhile
protecting professionals so they're not
in competition with each other
so they stay wealthy and do fine and of
course the owners and the managers
riches beyond the dreams of avarice as
we've seen in the last 25 years that's
the World Trade Organization that's
what's called globalization well that
ended the options for black Americans
quite significantly except for a small
sector that could kind of make it into
the you know Harvard Law School but the
end and the something you got to do
something with them these people who are
now superfluous well in Columbia they do
something with them it's called social
cleansing MPs SOC all you send out the
paramilitaries you kill them well we're
more civilized so what we do here is
throw me to jail by criminalizing the
life of the port as both of you pointed
out that pretext got have a pretext so
the pretext is drugs but nobody can take
that seriously I mean just as you can't
take seriously the drug war in Colombia
those are just pre ticks it's our form
of social cleansing and if you take a
look at african-american history from
the day that the first slave was brought
here until today that's been maybe 25
years maybe 30 years of some form of
freedom and now it's Hispanics as well
and that's the incarceration rate as you
all know has gone through the skies and
that's you know that's the history of
the poor poor in class and race are
reasonably collar ated in the correlated
in the United States so it's critically
the history of the black and now
Hispanic poor that David gave you some
of the statistics and that's showing the
one last comment on this stuff David
mentioned that in the Mexican economy
after it's been essentially destroyed
and really on purpose under the trade
agreements this what was the figure for
remittances 26b yeah 26 billion
you on year before last on remittances
well that's approximately a quarter of
the Mexican economy another roughly a
quarter is coming from profits from oil
another quarter is coming from
narco-trafficking Mexico's probably the
NARC of trafficking center of the world
there are huge areas right on the US
border so everybody's government knows
about him which have been taken over by
narco-traffickers a lot of them are
places where people were forced off the
land just for the reasons David
mentioned it can't compete with the u.s.
subsidized and agribusiness so they're
empty are they driven off to taken over
by narco-traffickers they're protected
by the military who participated in this
and put all this together it's adding
roughly the same part of the economy as
oil and remittances that's the Mexican
economy well you can't study it in
Mexico any editor or journalist will
tell you we can't write about it or it's
a death warrant if we try to write about
it we're going to kill it's worse than
Columbia in this respect but a lot of
people know about it I mentioned David
happened to be there but 10 days ago and
I was reading the press and there was a
study that came out by two well-known
and respected economists condemning the
drug war in Mexico's tolerance drug war
which were supposed to think is great
they said it's a total farce because
it's avoiding the main participants in
the drug war the government and the
corporations they said that corporations
which are in big ones involved in eighty
percent of the economy they're running
the north of trafficking and making a
lot of profit out of it Mexico doesn't
get decertified desertification is a
blow to countries in Latin America they
suffer from Obama just announced the
certification for last year guess who
was the certified
Bolivia and Venezuela and there's no
evidence that they're participating in
our culture maybe that's something going
on but my nerd nothing like Colombia and
nothing like Mexico but they're not be
certified because that's a farce like
everything else just as the
criminalization of the population here
under the drug war is just old history
that's the way you deal with superfluous
populations that either want to turn
into a labor force and the criminalized
population today is a labor force forced
labor or you just not into it well those
are things we gotta face
I'm afraid that professor Chomsky has to
catch an airplane we were told to make
sure that he is able to leave in time to
get to the airport so we don't have time
for more than this I know that we would
all like to go on for another hour to
both listening to professor Chomsky and
hearing what you all have to say and I'm
sorry we can't do that today but I would
like to give him one last San Francisco
