you mentioned just in passing teenage
girls if they have a free Saturday
afternoon they like to walk around in
the shopping mall rather than going to
the library so I found that very
thought-provoking
because I think that many people and I
would have to include myself believe
that deep deep down what we all really
want is material comfort for ourselves
that this is what we all want more than
anything else we we we may make an
effort and go to the library we may make
an effort and vote we may make an effort
and go to work or even visit a sick
friend or say a friendly word to someone
who is in trouble but what we really
would like to do is sit on a big
comfortable sofa and watch a
entertaining program on a big beautiful
television set and maybe have somebody
bring us some hot fudge sundaes or
bonbons while we're watching the program
that this is what people what I really
like what what everyone is really like
selfish and and really seeking material
comfort and that that is human nature
that is bedrock human nature and I think
a lot of our political attitudes come
from the fact that we think we can never
get away from that that's what we are
now do you share that view not Melissa
and I think the plenty of evidence
against it there is has been a massive
effort for over a hundred years to try
to convince people that that's what we
are
it's called advertising there so it's a
huge industry it's dedicated explicitly
openly to trying to you read the
business person hundred years ago and
it's taking off to try to direct people
to the superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption get them out of
our hair by getting them involved in
consumption and huge efforts go into
this
for example about 20 or 30 years ago the
advertising industry realized that
there's a sector of the population that
they're not reaching because they don't
have money known as children so then
some bright guys figured well we can get
around this the children don't have
money but their parents do so what we
have to do is direct television programs
for children and so on to try to induce
what's called nagging try to get fit
this is literally the case create
nagging propaganda by now if you look at
academic Applied Psychology departments
there is actually program studying
different kinds of nagging and how you
can induce it and if you watch
children's television I've seen this
with my grandchildren it's two year old
kids or looking at things and they're
being induced to try to get your parents
to get me this thing or also I'm going
to die you know and so on and the
parents get it and you throw it away in
five minutes but every aspect of our
life is to cook devoted to this okay my
wife and I but we're taken by a friend a
couple weeks ago to see a what do you
call it the baseball in the preparations
of pre-season baseball spring period
right and you take a look at the stadium
every inch is covered with an ad I mean
I remember first baseball game I went it
was in the 1930s there were no ads
anywhere now every inch is an ad every
taxicab you look at is not every minute
of your life is inundated with efforts
to turn you into the kind of person
you're describing
so is that human nature I don't think so
so take a look at these Trump voters
again so these working-class people and
as a rural towns which manufacturing
towns in Arkansas and take a listen to
what they're saying these are people who
men who want to work in coal mines which
is not fun rather than to take a
government handout they don't want to
sit on the couch and being given a
government handout that undermines their
sense of dignity of self-worth of doing
something significant and I think that's
what people are you go back further
plenty of evidence for it there's
there's a wonderful study of huge study
of the reading habits of the British
working class in the late 19th century
Jonathan rose very detailed said what
were British workers reading turns out
they were better educated than than the
aristocrats American say eastern
Massachusetts Boston where I live the
the an Irish blacksmith if he could make
enough money would hire a boy to read to
him while he's working I'm not going to
remember this from childhood in the
1930s most of my family were
for immigrants you know first first
generation unemployed working-class
quite educated many of them didn't go to
school you know maybe fourth grade but
they read they went to concerts they
went to Shakespeare plays they talked
about it they were interested in
politics I mean I think it's taken huge
efforts to try to drive all of this out
of people's heads I think the natural
thing for humans is to want to be
independent creative whether created I
mean maybe you work on a you know the
fixing up old cars in your garage in the
weekend instead of sitting in the
watching television whatever it may be
you want to do something that's
significant that's worth it's worthwhile
maybe even if it's a ugly horrible job
like we're going to call nine instead of
taking a government handout because
people I think want a dignity and a
sense of self-worth and a sense of
creating and doing something important
that's what we are and I think it's
taken huge effort enormous efforts a
huge part of the economy is devoted to
trying to drive these things out of
people's heads to make you think that
all you want is more commodities so you
should go shopping instead of reading
Latin so that people most people by this
account really have been unnaturally
squashed into being something much much
smaller than they could be or than he
should be and want to be and want to be
in fact it's pretty interesting to go
back to there's good studies of the
working-class press in the early
industrial revolution in the United star
inland it's earlier in the United States
it would be mid nineteenth century late
nineteenth century it was a very lively
working-class press a lot of it written
by young women
young women from the farms called
factory girls who run their own
newspapers and the material is a lot of
material on and it's pretty interesting
that what they wanted was dignity they
hated the industrial system because it
was turning that it was destroying their
rights as independent people they
attacked what sometimes they called the
idea the slogan they denounced the
slogan gain wealth forgetting all but
self in other words the kind of person
that you think we all are that we're
taught we all are that's what they were
condemning we don't just gain wealth
forgetting all but self we want
dignified independent lives they
regarded wage labor as not very
different from slavery which was a
popular idea there was a slogan of the
Republican Party literally Abraham
Lincoln's on because it takes what
you're selling yourself if you're a wage
laborer if you sell something you
created let's say you're an artisan and
you make something and you sell it
you're not selling yourself if you sell
your labor you're selling yourself
you're losing your dignity and
independence it's an attack on your
fundamental rights these are themes that
run right through the spontaneous
productions of mostly uneducated
working-class what we call uneducated
working-class people it was the same in
England before us and I think it's the
same elsewhere I just don't think people
are when you talk about human nature I
think we're talking about something
that's constructed and contrived with
enormous effort conscious effort you
look at in the television industry
there's what's called content and fill
in a program content is the ads fill is
the car chase that you pull off the
shelf to keep people watching between
the ads and if you just watch television
you can see that the
give Atia the thought the funding zone
is going into the ads not into the fill
you know in newspaper industry there's
what they call the news hole so you lay
out the newspaper first to get all the
ads that's what matters then there's
this if it were to sit in things to keep
people watching I mean this is literally
hundred millions dollars a year huge
part of the economy goes into this an
interesting aspect of this which is kind
of interestingly not studied very much
has to do with basic economics so anyone
who took an economics course or you know
reads about it knows that the market
economy is supposed to be based on
informed consumers making rational
choices that's what we're taught our
economy is turn on the television set
and take a look at the content the ads
are they trying to create informed
consumers make rational choices see I
mean if we had a market economy if there
was an ad it would be an announcement by
say Ford Motor Company here are the
characteristics of the cars I think
there's a nice here here's what consumer
review says about them that would create
informed consumers making rational
choices it's not what you see there's
huge efforts to try to create irrational
consumers uninformed consumers making
irrational choices to undermine market
economies and to turn people into people
who believe may even believe that what
they want us to sit on a couch and watch
television that's not what they want as
yeah things
