this is democracy now I'm Amy Goodman in
Boston as we sit down with Noam Chomsky
for a public conversation I asked him
about the arrest of Julian Assange
well the Assange arrest is scandalous
and several respects one of them is just
the effort of governments and it's not
just the US government the British are
cooperating Ecuador of course is now
cooperating Sweden before had cooperated
the efforts to silence a journalist who
was producing materials that people in
power didn't want the rascal multitude
to know about okay that's basically what
happened
WikiLeaks was producing things that
people ought to know about those in
power people in power don't like that so
therefore we have to silence it okay
this is the kind of thing the kind of
scandal that takes place unfortunately
over and over to take another example
right next door to Ecuador in Brazil
with the developments that have gone on
are extremely important this is the most
important country in Latin America and
one of the most important in the world
under the Lula government early in this
millennium Brazil was the most maybe the
most respected country in the world it
was the voice for the global South under
the leadership of lula da silva notice
what happened there was a coup soft coup
to eliminate the nefarious effects of
the labor party the Workers Party these
are described by the World Bank not me
the World Bank as the golden decade
in Brazil's history with radical
reduction of poverty massive extension
of inclusion of marginalized populations
large parts of the population
afro-brazilian indigenous who were
brought into the society a sense of
dignity and hope for the population that
couldn't be tolerated
after Lula's after he left office kind
of a soft food take place I won't go
through the details but the last move
last September was to take the Lula da
Silva the leading the most popular
figure in Brazil who was almost certain
to win the forthcoming election put him
in jail solitary confinement essentially
a death sentence 25 years in jail
banned from reading press or books and
crucially barred from making a public
statement on like mass murderers on
death row this in order to silence the
person who was likely to win the
election he's the most important
political political prisoner in the
world
DT here or anything about it well
Assange is a similar case we've got a
silence this voice you go back to
history some of you may recall when
Mussolini's fascist government put
Antonio Gramsci in jail they said the
prosecutor said we have to silence this
voice for 20 years can't let it be speak
that's Assange that's Lula there are
other cases that's one scandal the other
scandal is just the ex
territorial reach of the United States
which is shocking I mean why should the
United States why should any no other
state could possibly do it but why
should the United States have the power
to control what others are doing
elsewhere in the world
I mean it's outlandish situation takes
it goes on all the time we never even
notice it at least there's no comment on
it I take the trade agreements with
China okay what are the trade agreements
about there are an effort to prevent
China's economic development that's
exactly what they are the China has a
development model the the Trump
administration doesn't like it so
therefore let's undermine it ask
yourself what would happen if China did
not observe the rules that the United
States is trying to impose China for
example when Boeing or Microsoft
some other major company invest in China
China wants to have some control over
the nature of the investment they want
some degree of technology transfer they
should gain something from the
technology is there something wrong with
that that's how the United States
developed stealing technology we call
stealing technology from England so
England developed a taking technology
for more advanced countries India the
Low Countries even Ireland that's how
every developed country has reached the
stage of advanced development if Boeing
and Microsoft don't like those
arrangements they don't have to invest
in China nobody has a gun to their
if you really if anybody really believed
in capitalism they should be free to
make any arrangement they want with
China if it involves technology transfer
okay the United States wants to block
that
so China can't develop take what are
called intellectual property rights
suppose exorbitant patent rights and for
medicines for Windows for example bill
get Microsoft as a monopoly on operating
systems through the World Trade
Organization suppose China didn't
observe these who would benefit and who
would lose well the fact of the matter
is that consumers in the United States
would benefit it would mean that they
get cheaper medicines that would mean
that when you get a computer you
wouldn't be stuck with Windows you could
get a better operating system
Bill Gates would have a little less
money the pharmaceutical corporations
wouldn't be super rich as they are a
little less rich but the consumers would
benefit is there something wrong with
that is there a problem with them well
you might ask yourself what's what lies
behind all of these discussions and
negotiations that is true across the
board almost any issue you pick you can
ask yourself why is this accepted so in
this case why is it acceptable for the
United States to have the power to even
begin to protect to give even a proposal
to extradite somebody whose crime is to
expose to the public materials that
people in power don't want us don't want
them to see that's basically what's
happening
