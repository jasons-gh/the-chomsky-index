how do we start to revolution how do we
start a revolution well we go out say
power to the people I mean we have to be
serious about it a revolution that's
going to be constructive that'll lead
things forward instead of going to some
other kind of tyranny can only take
place when most of the population comes
to understand that you can't achieve
your goals through reform that the
system doesn't allow getting things that
you really ought to have by using the
methods within the system and that it's
take a look at again at history and see
how that was has that's been considered
take Karl Marx for example he wanted to
have a he was looking forward to a
communist revolution but he argued that
in the more free societies he was
thinking about England it could come
about by parliamentary means because
there were measures that could be used
if the population really got organized
and to some extent that begins to happen
here and there but other bigger powers
knock it down so I end a Chile for
example was taking parliamentary steps
towards not revolution but very
significant change and you know what
happened to be instituted a vicious
dictatorship and same in Guatemala same
elsewhere but if big powerful countries
do it like us or Marxist view England
which was at the time the major power
then you're protected from that and in
that case if these means really do fail
and if the resistance is too great
the violence of those who want to
protect their rights is too strong then
you can move into talking about
revolution but really not before that
