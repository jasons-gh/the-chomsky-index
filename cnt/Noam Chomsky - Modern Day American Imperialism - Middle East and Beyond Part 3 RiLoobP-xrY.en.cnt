what about them or we can if we want to
there were two directors of the
oil-for-food programme supposedly the
humanitarian part of the sanctions both
of them resigned because they regarded
the sanctions as genocide ille carrying
out a huge massacre of population the
clinton administration would not permit
them to transmit their information to
the Security Council which was
technically responsible and the media
agree the secretary spokesman for the
State Department changed Byrne said that
referred to hunts wats Monique the
second of them as I said this man and
Baghdad is paid to work not to talk and
the press agrees and scholarship agrees
so they're suppressed they knew more
about Iraq than any other Western are
they had hundreds of observers running
around the country sending back reports
but you can do a google search and find
out how often they were allowed to speak
in the United States and the run-up to
the war for that matter since the fun
spawning right and who's a very
distinguished international diplomatic
about it but two years ago called a
different kind of war I don't think
there's a reference to it in the United
States little on a review we do not want
to publicize our genocide all actions
but people have at least noticed and
didn't like it and that increase the
campaign of hatred among the money
Muslims our friends there don't have to
think about the others but it doesn't
matter what they think the same is true
of the invasion of Iraq Iraqis regarded
it is worse than the Mongol invasions
that's the great successes Iraq may
never recover I mean you know the great
success story of Petraeus is to
establish warlord armies which will
probably tear the country up in the
future and also to turn say Baghdad it's
true the violence in Baghdad has
declined and partly because there are
fewer people to kill you know there's
been
massive ethnic cleansing and that's been
accelerated by the Petraeus strategy of
building essentially walled communities
comment by near Rosen who's one of the
two or three journalists who actually
reports seriously from Iraq he speaks
Arabic fluently and he looks Arab so he
can get around easily travels all over
not with the armed guards and you know
Abrams tanks and so on he says talking
about Baghdad recently says looming on
the looming over the homes and the
district he's looking at our 12-foot
high walls built by the Americans to
confine people to their own neighborhood
emptied and destroyed by civil war which
the u.s. fomented walled off by the
surge the sections of the city feel more
like a desolate post-apocalyptic maze of
concrete tunnels than a living inhabited
neighborhood they're controlled by
separation walls and in fact by the
increasing use of air power but will
quieter so therefore the critics having
no principled criticism talk about it
much well what is the public think about
all these things well we know about Iraq
but what wants to get out but they're
irrelevant what about Iran the next
major crisis looming which will make
your act look like a tea party if they
go through with it there are opinions
about this there's the opinion of
American elites which you can reach they
in the New York Times or wash and Coast
liberal generals and so on they'll tell
you that Iran is defying the world by
enriching uranium well exactly who is
the world okay well we can find out
there is organization called g77 130
countries includes the vast majority of
the people of the world they vigorously
support Iran's right to all the rights
guaranteed by the non-proliferation
treaty including enriching uranium for
nuclear power so they're not part of the
world
okay what about the American population
an overwhelming majority of the American
population agrees with g77 namely that
Iran should have the right to produce
nuclear energy but not nuclear weapons
so the American population is not part
of the world so online countries are not
part of the world no American
populations not part of the world
obviously Iranians are not part of the
world so who's left well the world
consists of people who follow
Washington's orders you can't say it
includes the United States because the
overwhelming majority of Americans are
not part of the world they oppose this
just as on many other issues and that
goes on without comment you know
correctly if we're cheerleaders for the
home team and that's the framework for
discussion is there a solution to the
crisis with Iran which is extremely
serious the u.s. goes through it its
plans parent plans like I said it might
look Mickey rack look like a tea party
well there are solutions potential
solutions one of them is what I just
said that Iran should have the rights of
any sign of the non-proliferation treaty
Israel Pakistan and India also what I
have those rights if they sign the
treaty since they haven't done it they
don't have those rights but of course
they're doing it because we say it's
okay the but that's the opinion of the
large majority of Americans and the same
large majorities runs around 75 percent
I says that a nuclear weapons-free zone
should be established in the region
including Iran Israel American forces
deployed there and so on well that would
end the crisis is that possible well
it's supported by large majority of
Americans but as I mentioned they're not
part of the world it's Iran's official
policy but they're not part of the world
the US and Britain are formally
committed to it in fact more so than any
other powers for a very simple reason
which we would read about if we had a
free press when the United States and
Britain went to war with Iraq and try to
find the thin legal cover for it they
appeal to UN Security Council resolution
687
nineteen ninety-one which ordered Iraq
to get rid of its weapons of mass
destruction and as you remember written
in the united states claim the head and
lived up to it well you know you're all
literate you can read resolution 687 it
commits the United States and Britain to
work to establish a nuclear-free weapon
zone in the Middle East okay so if you
can appeal to it as a justification for
aggression you're compelled to follow
its its provisions but to point that out
would be really to break the rules and
you can again do a google search and so
you can find anyone named and near the
mainstream has ever bothered to point
this out another way to move towards a
solution would be to end the threats
against Iran the threats if anyone cares
or a violation of the UN Charter but for
outlaw states that's irrelevant again
the large majority of the American
population thinks we should end the
threats and move the normal diplomatic
relations with Iran well if these steps
were taken the crisis would essentially
be over so we can ask who's defying the
world if the world includes its people
you know including the American people
and the answer is very simple and
straightforward those who are defying
the world are the ones in power in
Washington and in London and in the
editorial offices and the university
faculties and so on they're defying the
world but not Iran not on these issues
and in fact it's a serious matter
because it could lead to total disaster
and the same is true on other issues so
the other major live issue in the Middle
East Israel Palestine well what is the
world think about this there is an
international consensus supported by
about two-thirds of the American
population supported by former
non-aligned countries supported by the
Arab world formerly at least supported
by Europe basically Latin America in
fact everyone your hand supports it
Hamas supports it it's for a two-state
settlement to state settlement on the
international borders with
being jump rejoin 67 borders with minor
modifications who opposes that well for
the last 30 years the United States has
opposed it and it continues to oppose it
and Israel of course opposes it though
it if the US would support it Israel
would necessarily go along so the
problem was right in Washington this
begins in 1976 when the u.s. veto the
first Security Council resolution
calling for a settlement in these terms
is introduced by the Arab states backed
by the PLO actually it even goes back
earlier to 1971 when president said out
of Egypt offered Israel a full peace
treaty in return for withdrawal from
occupied territories see what he cared
as withdraw beltless withdrawal from the
Sinai where Israel was kicking out
thousands of peasants and settling
Israel he didn't say anything about the
Palestinians they were not an issue at
the time Israel recognized as a genuine
peace offer decided to rejected they
made a fateful decision preferring
expansion to security peace treaty with
Israel would have ended security problem
the Egypt would have ended security
problems important question is what
would happen in the United States no The
Godfather well Kissinger managed there
was a battle in a bureaucratic internal
battle in the United States Kissinger
one he and the u.s. followed his policy
which he called stalemate meaning no
negotiations just force ok that set the
stage for the 1973 war and on to a whole
list of horror since and up till today
the United States and Israel are have
been leading the rejectionist camp by
now they are the rejectionist can not
the US population but the government's
so who's defying the world on this issue
is there a possible settlement sure
there is but resides here in fact on
issue after issue the major problems
happen to be right here which is a very
optimistic conclusion because it means
that we can do something about it
it's here we can have an influence not
elsewhere
gee time yep
contrary over Savior and the
introduction your times of course not
say that you were the most important
intellectual alive and you know that
well it was merely an outsider professor
at Stanford who said it in a review
which appeared in The New York Times
interestingly enough you use that quote
on several of your books also a
fabricated quote you've also said that
whenever that arises during an
introduction like tonight you always say
something about it and correct it and
that's of course a falsehood because you
didn't do it here tonight and that's
happened in the past also number two I
couldn't help but notice the reference
to Arthur Schlesinger apparently you're
still something sticking in your craw
about your about with him I guess it was
around nineteen seventy in which he
exposed you for fabricating some harry
truman quotes that was the exchange in
which he dubbed you an intellectual
crook so I guess that's so sticking in
your craw even now and finally asked to
this notion of steering for the home
team which obviously you don't do if
somebody else you're cheering for so I'd
like you to be very forthright like some
leftists do who say they are cheering
for our opponents in various places
around the world quite clearly do you
have the courage to tell us right now
that you are pulling against us in Iraq
and Afghanistan you're hoping we fail
that you support the terrorists or you
might call them freedom fighters hoping
they kill Americans we get the point
yeah can I go through these points on
the first one the quote it was not by
somebody interview it was by a reviewer
in the New York he wasn't it you said he
was interviewed listen uh you did but it
doesn't matter look with you it was a
book review right and it all you know
it's true that I didn't bother to
correct it tonight but I almost always
do it because it's funny it's a very
funny thing what he actually said is he
the most important intellectual in the
world how can you write such terrible
things about u.s. foreign policy I like
that quote so I invariant either I
invariably corrected you say you see it
on the backs of books if you take a look
at the publishing industry you find the
author has absolutely no control of
what appears and blurbs nothing if I had
a choice I tell them not to use it of
course and I often do but they like to
use it and then I correct it when it's
brought up that's because i think the
actual quote is quite interesting so
that's one as for Schlesinger you've got
the story backwards I criticized
Schlesinger on these points in the in a
book that appeared in 1969 which he was
furious about and in his review of that
book which was a furious review he tried
to find some error and he found an
absolutely trivial error so small that
it was corrected two months later in the
second printing but it but he's been
screaming about it he screamed about it
ever since and people like you do to the
error was that in quoting a speech by
Harry Truman okay instead of quoting his
actual speech I quoted a virtually
verbatim paraphrase of it by a leading
respected commentator James Warburg so
the words were slightly different though
the content was exactly the same as I
say it was a trivial it was corrected
two months later in the second printing
it's a rare book that doesn't have some
smaller but yes you know the the
defenders of state violence are
desperate and if they can find anything
that they can point to they'll run with
it forever so that's the truth about the
second point as for the cheering you
heard what I said and it's what I've
written I think we should pay attention
to the population okay population of the
United States population of Iraq
population of the world we should pay
attention to what they think of course
those who are you know supporters of
state violence think we shouldn't we
should pay attention to the guys in
power and the sort of cheering section
that among the intellectuals that
supports them well I don't agree with it
if I just to take the case of Iran I
think the opinion of American the
American population happens to be very
sound
and I support it and the same is true in
Iraq I think the opinion of Iraqis is
very sane last December the Pentagon
released the study of focus groups in
Iraq and reported it as good news they
give a very upbeat report they said
contrary to what people are saying in
the critics there's a lot of agreement
among Iraqis and therefore there's hope
for reconciliation okay and then if you
read now will further what was their
agreement about well there was
overwhelming agreement among Iraqis that
the United States is responsible for the
ethnic cleansing and the sectarian
violence and at the United States should
get out okay that's what there is
agreement about well yeah I think we
should pay attention to our victims and
I can go down the line if you like
everything else you said it's just a
pure fabrication and you know it
if you want if you want to write me an
email about it i'll be glad to give you
you know you haven't got the courage to
tell who you're cheerleading for hard
you haven't got the courage to tell us
who your cheerleading for you've made
your point let's go so decades ago the
u.s. instituted a policy of undercutting
foreign food markets could you raise
your hand whoever's talking Oh over
there sorry yeah good decades ago the
u.s. instituted a policy of undercutting
forward food markets by a u.s. subsidies
recently u.s. farm subsidies have
shifted to ethanol markets much to the
chagrin of almost every third world
nation and furthermore much to the
disinterest of almost every major media
network what role if any do you think
the food this food crisis will play in
u.s. expansionist policies well just to
clarify a little bit when the ethanol
craze began it was overwhelmingly
cheered by the media and commentators
and so on not by everyone I mean I wrote
an article criticizing it in fact it was
even an article in foreign affairs
criticizing it so there were critics but
it didn't take much thought to realize
that shifting of cropland to ethanol
production to fuel was going to cause an
increase in the prices of food and
shortage of food I mean you know it
tends to be a genius to figure that out
it's particularly true when it's us
ethanol it wouldn't have been so obvious
and maybe wouldn't even true if it was
Brazilian ethanol Brazilian ethanol is
made from sugar it's much more efficient
and it's much cheaper and in order to
keep the ethanol industry functioning
here the government has to first of all
provide huge subsidies to agribusiness
and also to impose a huge tariff to
prevent much cheaper and more efficient
Brazilian ethanol from getting into the
country the technical term for that is
free trade okay
but if it's a so it's a big gift to
agribusiness it takes plenty of land
away from crop production that means
that this shortage of corn but also a
lot of other things you know that if
land has shifted to corn production
inefficient corn production for ethanol
it's not being used for soy beans and
peas and so on so that gets reduced same
happening in the third world third world
countries that are say producing
soybeans may shift to using a cryptic
crops that will be brought up by the
rich for ethanol and that's happening
too so it spirals and yes it's leading
to its one of the factors leading to a
very serious food prices just how much
of a factor that is it's pretty hard to
estimate so the drought and Australia is
also a big contributory factor but you
know although that's kind of irrelevant
we can't do anything about the drought
in Australia the one factor we can do
something about is the use of cropland
for fuel and ethanol is not particularly
if you efficient from the point of view
of pollution or energy inputs and so on
and so forth so all across the board it
was I think that disaster it was
understood to be anyone who thought
about it from the beginning and it ought
to be terminated if anybody wants to use
ethanol they should break down the
protectionist barriers and subsidies to
agribusiness and youth Brazilian ethanol
it's causing an all of this is part of a
whole system of undermining third world
farmers so one of the big effects of
NAFTA is intended effects is to drive
Mexican peasants off the land Mexican
peasants cannot compete with highly
subsidized the US agribusiness it's kind
of obvious so slowly being driven off
the land and going to get worse now that
Mexico has been forced to eliminate all
tariffs and they flood into the cities
they lower wages which is very good for
us manufacturers who are exporting
production there and then they try to
flee across the border so we
the walls no I mean these things are all
interconnected same with Haiti I mean
when one of the things that America you
know American cheerleaders are supposed
to cheer the government about is that
Clinton sent the Marines to put an end
to terror in Haiti in 1995 that part is
true but there's a little more the
elected government government the rst
government first elected government in
Haiti was a populists independent
government led by a what we call a
radical priest meaning liberation
theologist concerned about the poor it
was overthrown a couple of months later
by military coup as anticipated the US
had done everything possible to try to
undercut it in those few months the US
immediately turned supporting the
military coup violating the Organization
of American States embargo that was
under Bush one under Clinton the
violations increased Clinton actually
authorized the Texaco oil company to
send arms to send oil to the military
junta and the rich a lead in violation
of his own presidential order in 1995
Clinton decided that the public
population had been tortured enough and
it was pretty miserable I was there for
a while the size figure that's enough
will let the elected government go back
put on a condition the condition was
that they accept a very harsh neoliberal
regime mean drop your tariffs drop off
work for local production and so on well
the outcome was completely predictable
I'm not saying it in retrospect I and
others wrote about at the time Haitian
rice farmers are pretty efficient but
they cannot compete with highly
subsidized us agribusiness exporters so
now Hades sort of food and you're
getting food riots yeah predictably
that's the consequence of following such
policies again it doesn't take a genius
to figure them out it's kind of like an
entry school student can figure it out
and this is happening in many places so
your point is very significant there is
a major food prices and
we're not helping hi first of all thanks
I I want to thank you a lot for all the
intellectual inspiration all these
matters are a lot more interesting out
they make sense and I've been following
the news a lot lately with Iraq and it
seems like there's some deal of
escalation going on in Iraq and like a
few weeks ago Vice President Cheney made
a major trip to the Middle East and
surely there after the Iraq government
commenced a large-scale offensive
against satyrs forces in Basra and
subsequently there was more large large
scale action against satyrs forces in
Sadr City and Baghdad and there was an
interesting phrase that was used in an
article I saw their Iraqi tanks
attacking us at our city I'm sorry I
didn't hear the list it was interesting
that they used the phrase Iraqi tanks
which are storming yeah satyr city but
um I was thinking about this and it
seems like our policy on the war in Iraq
has been almost remarkably restrained it
seems like we've been concentrating
mostly on like the green zone and the
oil infrastructure and so given these
recent escalations I was wondering if
you thought perhaps we're going to
attempt to ferment some kind of like
increased violence in blood bath and
perhaps use that as a pretext for
additional action in Iran and wondering
what your thoughts are on this well
you're right that the war in Iraq is
restrained by comparative standards
killed 100,000 people maybe over a
million may have destroyed the country
forever it's worse than the Mongol
invasions and so on yet but that's
restrained for example with nothing like
the attack on Vietnam I'm not even close
the Iraq war has never reached the scale
of Vietnam in about nineteen sixty-five
you know at that time there was no
protest but and there a couple of
reasons for that one reason is that the
American population is much more
strongly opposed to aggression than it
was in the 1960s that's part of the
civilizing effect of the night of the
Act
the 60s had a big effect on the
population on all kind of things support
for civil rights for women's rights
environmental movement you know all the
kinds of things I was quoting about the
American Indians those were standard
attitudes in the 60s not even questioned
the kind of things that kids were
reading in school texts say my own
children and late 60s you can find and
most backward crazed part of the country
today it wouldn't be permissible all of
this is a civilizing fact that's why the
60s are constantly condemned as the Time
of Troubles you know kids going crazy
and so on they committed a crime they
civilized the country and one of the
forms of civilization was opposition to
aggression so contrary to what is
commonly said protest against the Iraq
war is far beyond protest against the
Vietnam were at any comparable stage at
this stage the Vietnam where there was
no talk about withdrawal in fact the
first book on withdrawal was written by
Howard Zinn who you know and it was I
think 1967 it's a time when there was
half a million American troops their
countries have been torn to shreds
extended to thee and that could barely
be mentioned because it was so far out
actually he asked me to write a review
of it which i did in ramparts because
nobody would mention well now at a much
lower stage of aggression in Iraq every
can't everyone has to say something
about withdrawal maybe they'll mean it
but they have to say something you know
that's a big change so one reason why
there is why it's restrained by
comparative standards is there's just
way more opposition I mean after all the
Iraq war is the first war in the history
of Western imperialism that was
massively protested before it was
officially inaugurated and that's never
happened before not that I can think of
so that's one factor but there's another
more important factor a Vietnam didn't
matter much to the United States I mean
if the country was wiped off the map of
the u.s. didn't care I mean Eisenhower
tried to build up some support for his
early stage of the war
by talking about 10 and rubber and so on
but I was a joke I mean Vietnam had no
resources of significance to the United
States the concern about Vietnam was
what I mentioned the virus infection
theory there was deep concern that
successful independent development in
Vietnam might spur others to take on the
same efforts the fire the rot might
spread to Thailand maybe to Indonesia
maybe even Japan which was called the
super domino by jean de or leading in
japan historian japan might have to
accommodate to an independent Southeast
Asia that would have meant the United
States have lost the Pacific War which
they weren't prepared to do in 1950 so
there was a concern about Vietnam but
had 90 with his resources and in fact
that the concern was overcome just by
wiping the place out so the u.s.
basically won the war in the 1970s
didn't achieve its maximal objectives
but it did satisfy its basic war aims
you can't destroy a rack it's far too
value I mean Iraq has probably the
second largest energy resources in the
world they're very cheap and easily
available it's not like Alberta tar
sands you stick a pipe in the sand and
you know the oil gushes out and it's
right at the heart of the major energy
producing section of the world that's a
valuable asset not like Vietnam so yes
there's got to be a limit on the
destructiveness you can't destroy an
asset that you want to maintain and the
US does want to maintain it today it
happens that I just took a look at the
morning newspaper christian science
monitor has a front page article on the
opening of what's called the US Embassy
in Baghdad I mean the embassy
is not like any embassy in the world the
size of the Vatican has 21 buildings
it's an entirely self-contained city
inside
