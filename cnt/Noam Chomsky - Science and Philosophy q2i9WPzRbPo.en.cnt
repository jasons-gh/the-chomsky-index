you've made it clear that science plays
a primary role in philosophy and I was
curious to know what role if any does
philosophy play in science here we I
think it helps to look at the question a
little more historical depth if you had
asked Hume are you a scientist or a
philosopher he couldn't answer because
there was no distinction if he'd asked
can't
are you a philosopher or scientist he
couldn't have answered in fact until the
latter part of the nineteenth we're in
the middle of the nineteenth century
there was no really clear distinction
between science and philosophy I mean
some if you study science and Oxford and
Cambridge it's the you know it's the
Department of Natural Philosophy or
moral philosophy because philosophy was
just you know science was just one part
of philosophy weren't distinct by the
latter part of the nineteenth century
they sort became separated and after
that's really a matter of choice you
know disciplines don't exist and we
construct them so I mean you know Dean's
have to have ways of organizing
departments because it's too much
trouble to have everybody do everything
but there's no boundary to what's in
chemistry you know and there's no
boundary to what's in philosophy just
depends what philosophers what people
call themself who come out of this
tradition one a state and a lot of what
they want to study is questions and the
foundations of science or this you know
or or say the kind of things that
bossman Frost is trying to clear up
using the results of science these are
all fine questions and people tend to
call em philosophy you could call them
parts of them at least you call
thoughtful science or reflective and
moral theory or you callin anything you
want but there's a range of questions
which have come to be in the domain of
philosophy and they can extend all over
the place I mean there are people in
philosophy departments who are working
on the foundations of quantum theory and
making contributions to it
