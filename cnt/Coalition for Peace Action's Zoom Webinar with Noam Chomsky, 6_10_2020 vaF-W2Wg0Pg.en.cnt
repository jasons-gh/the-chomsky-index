and the pockets of the people I have to
take care of nothing else matters
there has been nothing like this in
human history the democracy experiment
disappearing again some of what's going
on
you can barely describe a couple of
weeks ago you noticed the purge of the
inspectors general the inspectors
general have been put in by
congressional by Republicans
incidentally to monitor the departments
about to ensure that there's no severe
corruption and malfeasance well they're
beginning to investigate the stinking
swamp that Trump has created in
Washington
so let's purge them all get rid of all
of them and in order to show that you
really are a tin-pot dictator go out of
your way to insult the person who
installed them senior Republican highly
respected Republican senator 89 year old
Charles Grassley whose life's work has
been to create these offices so tell him
to shove it he's allowed to write a
timid letter saying I don't like it not
a word of support from the Republican
Party it's not fascism it's a tin pot
dictatorship of the fine its kind that
you find in some neo colony somewhere
that's what he's turning the country
into meanwhile laboring to bring about
terminal nuclear war and destruction of
the environment so has there ever been a
moment like this in human history with a
pandemic we see demonstrations in the
streets with these things in the
backroom I don't think so
it's an unbelievable moment we have time
to overcome it not a lot group of
Australian scientists just a couple
months ago published leading the top one
publish the article in nature the top
science journal which they suggested
that of the roughly 15 tipping points
about half have already been approached
the tipping point means it's a
reversible well latest studies suggest
that in another 50 years in our present
course a lot of the habitable part of
the world will be unlivable including
all of South Asian large parts of the
Middle East and Africa you can't even
imagine what that's gonna mean but
that's where we're heading into unless
removed to stop it
there's time not a lot there are
opportunities we have to take them if we
don't not only will the human species be
gone in any organized form but the huge
number of other species that were
destroying as we race towards the six
extinction these it's not a pleasant
message but it's correct thank you very
much professor Chomsky and that is
indeed sobering and and challenging so
we thank you for being with us I just to
make this more efficient I'm just gonna
read a few questions instead of calling
on the person who wrote them
first from Dozier ham and his question
is how do we get all progressives to
vote to defeat Trump it's a very serious
problem one of the strangest things
that's happening now almost unbelievable
in my mind it's something on the Left
called the never Biden movement a lot of
people who say we didn't get Sanders I'm
going to go home and sulk I'm not gonna
vote against Trump notice that there's
no difference between not voting for
Biden and voting for Trump
you take one vote away from the
opposition too drunk put some one vote
ahead as if somebody came out of the
woodwork and voted for him and I just I
can't find the words to talk about it
I've been involved in endless debates
about it very hard to convince people
what are the things that's happening is
the collapse of a traditional Left
culture I mean there is an establishment
view about elections that says politics
consists of the quandary reial
quadrennial extravaganza pay attention
to that then go home somebody else's
business
that's the establishment view there's a
left view which has been forgotten which
almost politics is activism goes on all
the time never stops every once in a
while there's something called an
election you take off 15 minutes you see
you decide if there's a serious to a
distinction between the candidates if
there is you vote against the worst one
you rarely vote for you mostly vote
against they spend a couple of minutes
voting against the worst one then you go
back to work that understanding has
almost disappeared we didn't get what we
wanted in the election I'm going home
it's disastrous this may bring us the
worst Cataclysm in the history of the
human species literally that it's very
hard to break through another question
that kind of follows on that it's a
little out of order here from Libby
councilman in Australia voting is
mandatory could we make it mandatory
here in the US we could but it doesn't
make any difference I mean if
you can test a nothing vote if you want
if people don't want to vote there's an
easy way to do it even if it's mandatory
but there's some very interesting things
about voting in the United States hasn't
been studied very much but some there
was a study by one of the leading
academic specialists on American
politics Walter Keane councilman must
have been about thirty years ago he did
a study of the socio-economic profile of
the non voters in the United States it's
about half the population don't bother
who are they turns out that it's very
similar to the profile of people in
Europe who vote for the one of the labor
based or social democratic party's
suggests that here they just don't see
any point in the voting now why should
they vote for one or another party
that's going to work against them but in
fact if you look at what's happened in
the last 40 years you see that they have
a point we've had 40 years of the
neoliberal assault what does it led to
the real wages have stagnated or
declined
no they used to trace productivity
growth they don't productivity still
goes up not as fast as before wages stay
down who gets the money the very wealthy
it's been an enormous concentration of
wealth by now we have a society where
0.1% not 1% 0.1% of the population have
20% of the wealth that more than half
the population just barely gets by from
paycheck to paycheck that's if you have
a job there's also developed a
precarious workforce but if they miss a
boss calls you go otherwise you're out
of luck
we have a I don't have to tell you
because you all know but we have a
health system which is an international
scandal its privatized for a profit
twice the costs of other countries some
of the worst outcomes actually it's not
usually recognized but we do have
universal health care
it's called emergency rooms if you can
drag yourself to an emergency room by
the law they'll take care of you
it's the cruelest most savage most
expensive form of universal health care
that exists furthermore during the
neoliberal period it's been made much
worse because it has to be run on a
business model remember that sir and
Reagan everything has to be rude on
business models business models means no
spare capacity if you're building a car
you don't want to have a little extra on
the assembly line that wastes resources
so if you're running a private hospital
getting paid huge the celery millions of
dollars a huge stock options making a
huge amount of money you don't want to
have an extra bed because that wastes
resources so if anything goes wrong
catastrophe no extra diagnostic capacity
nothing that's the business model then
came what I described the Trump wrecking
bull cutting back every year on what
exists it's very interesting to watch
the critique of Sanders's programs the
critique from the left liberal extreme
of the mainstream some of the most
progressive colonists what do they say
about Sanders they say really good
policies I like them but the American
people are ready for them that is an
indictment of American society that is
almost indescribable the water hiss Paul
two main policies the universal health
care can you think of another country
that has universal health care in fact
when you think of one that doesn't free
higher education just about every other
country that poor countries like Mexico
right to the south rich countries like
Germany the countries that are at the
top of educational achievement like
Finland free in fact the United States
when it was a much poorer country that
was basically free in the 1950s we had
the GI Bill of Rights it gave free
higher education and living support to
huge numbers of people who had never
been able to go to college was a great
boon to them to the general Society
proved it enormous Lee it had flaws that
was racist didn't go to Black's it was
sexist didn't go to women but it was
very successful we were poor countries
much poorer country then we can't have
free higher education these are the two
major planks in his progress the fact
that those are considered out of reach
tells you how far the neoliberal plague
has destroyed the country we can't even
think of being like other countries like
being what we once were I mean there's
quite a lot of this the tens of
trillions of dollars are stolen from
Americans by stock buybacks and tax
havens go back before Reagan they were
illegal and the law was enforced Reagan
opened the spigots you gotta have
everything free for capital can't put
any constraints they want to rob the
population of tens of trillions of
dollars fine that's freedom and then of
course they come running to the nanny
state to be bailed out by the pub
every time they crash the economy just
the way they're doing right now before
our noses okay this time they didn't
crush an economy it crushed but they
want to be bailed out because they
wasted their money on stock buybacks
during the period when money was flowing
into their pocket well that's what we
have wrought for 40 years it's not that
there were problems before and they were
very serious ones but it's been turned
into a disaster by policy policy is not
driven in stone that can be changed and
that's the issue before us right now
thanks again professor Chomsky I want to
just group a couple questions from you
about young people and their role one
question is do you have any faith in the
young activists who are organizing for
the climate and now improved race
relations and then a young activist
who's with us actually asks a question
about tear gas saying that it's banned
and warfare maybe it should be banned
here in the United States domestically
that's a first let me take this with
regard to the first question yes I think
this'll what's happened it's quite
exciting
extinction rebellion the climate strikes
sunrise movement what sunrise movement
achieved is remarkable a group of young
activists finally all sorts of
activities finally occupied
congressional offices Nancy Pelosi's got
some support for from the young the
congressional representatives who swept
in on the Sanders way of because
Aleksandra CAHSEE of Cortes others they
managed to put the green new deal on the
center of the legislative agenda some
form of green New Deal is absolutely
essential for survival you can argue
about the details but some form of it
there are many significant proposals no
that was way out of the mortgage before
now it's at the center in fact
the activism of young people has shifted
the Democratic Party farther to the left
than it's been since FDR Franklin Delano
Roosevelt
you'll they take a look at Biden's
program way to the left of any prior
Democratic candidate that didn't come
from the DNC that came from the force of
activism of mostly young people so
there's plenty of hope you see it in the
streets you see it in the actions of the
last months let's go to Turkish there is
a chemical weapons treaty
it bans tear gas and combat and other
similar chemical weapons but it's
permitted domestically against your own
citizens the reason is that country that
the states would never have accepted the
treaty but unless they were allowed to
guess their own citizens
it's outlandish of course it should be
been what we been and warfare should
certainly be bend in the case of the
state's war against its own citizens
well actually the bulletin of Atomic
Scientists just had a strong article
about this a couple of weeks ago so the
questioner is absolutely right nothing
like this should be permitted states
should not be permitted to go to war
against their citizens interestingly
we're hearing this now from an
unexpected source
the two lists chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff top military officers in
the country both of them have said that
John Allen the general who was in charge
of NATO US forces in Afghanistan he came
out and said Jim mattis forced our
machine Marine general best defense
secretary he came out and said it is
pretty remarkable
what's happening on the streets
as causing is creating extraordinary
moments of opportunity for large-scale
changes and it's being helped by
President Trump who should give him
credit his actions are so obscene that
they're turning much of the country even
though I'm military grass and can bear
us against him so there's an opportunity
we should use it
thank you again professor Chomsky dr.
mark pepper is saying apparently a 22
year old activist protester in Columbus
Ohio may have been killed by tear gas I
know the virus is rapidly spreading from
that so that's just a PS but another MD
who's on with us dr. Walter chow is say
asking you are so sharp
at age nearly 90 - what is your secret
it's called the bicycle theory if you
keep writing fast you don't fool off I
have another question about extremes let
me just see if I can find that okay what
do you think we should do about
extremists on both sides which causes
nothing to get done and isolates people
who are stuck in the middle if the
reference is to Congress seem quite
right
there's extremists on one side almost
entirely the Republican Party in the
last decade or two has just drifted off
the spectrum not just my opinion so two
of the leading political analysts of the
American Enterprise Institute
conservative Institute Norman Ornstein
and Thomas Mann have written about it
they described the modern Republican
Party as a radical insurgency that has
abandoned parliamentary politics that
was before Trump
Trump has tuggin it over so completely
they're afraid to raise a finger
what don't you saw what happened with
Lisa Murkowski and Charles Grassley we
can't raise a finger we're buckling
party positions were pretty shocking
now there were denialist party no we
deny global warming that hasn't been
true forever they go back to 2008 it's
not 44 that John McCain ran for
president he had a global warming
platform wasn't very strong it was least
something the Republican Party was
considering legislation to do something
about global warming what happened the
Koch brothers huge energy conglomerate
which has been trying to shake the
Republican Party for a long time by
pouring money into me
they went into action they launched a
juggernaut to force the Republicans to
shift positions to become the nihilist
intimidated senators bribed senators
that launched a huge lobbying campaign
launched the astroturf campaigns you
know organizing people to knock on doors
the party turned became denialist you
take a look at the 2016 primary an
amazing moment here's the best
candidates they could think of every
single candidate not just drunk either
denied that what is happening is
happening or said okay it's happening
but we don't care now the one who was
most perspective by liberal opinion was
John Kasich because Governor of Ohio
because he's the one Republican
candidate who said yes global warming is
happening humans are responsible
so let's applause then comes the next
sentence but we in Ohio are gonna use
coal that we're not going to apologize
for it
it was actually the worst of them all
now that has an effect on public opinion
you look at polls about 25 percent of
Republicans think that global warming
and the urgent problem about 25 percent
think humans are responsible for it that
just often some other universe you can't
find this elsewhere in the world
exceptin and this is you you can find
the words to describe it or I can't I
mean if there's ever any future
historians there may not be and they
look back at this moment but they won't
believe what's happening whether it's
the never Biden is on the left or the
denial is son right in fact think of
something else that's astonishing
there's enormous discussion now about
the election if you look at it two
things are missing discussion of trumps
climate policies and discussion of his
policies on nuclear war almost nothing
almost nothing the two worst most severe
problems that have ever arisen in human
history both of them leading us close to
catastrophe not discuss what does this
mean what is this telling us about
ourselves yes is asking about if we he's
the head of our Pennsylvania chapter by
the way and he's saying is there any
chance that some of these so-called
moderate Republicans would become
independents abandoned the Republican
Party and help tip the Senate to a more
sensible position well there's a little
bit some of cool deliciously MIT Romney
is occasionally standing up for
something
try to find somebody else it's very hard
it's astonishing
it's they're so intimidated by the
tin-pot dictator that they're afraid to
lift their fingers I mean even things
like purposely insulting one of their
most respected senators grossly nothing
more cough ski night I didn't hear a
word of protest yes thank you I know
we're already a little over time
professor Chomsky I just want to read
you something Selim lone cent it's a
move as toward closing and Nicky if you
could get ready to put on the screen our
next program after this I Salim says I
just want to say I am astounded by
Professor Chomsky's lucidity clarity and
commitment to justice he was about 40
when a few of us talked to him in 1966
about war and peace it's now 54 years
later and he's still putting out ideas
that are awakening fresh thoughts in all
of us and I want to say amen to that and
also close with besides thanking
professor Chomsky profusely he's gone a
little bit over time already you'll see
on your screen now our next part part 2
of our two-part observance of our 40th
anniversary membership gathering will be
this Sunday afternoon at 3:00 many of
you who have already signed up for it if
you haven't I hope you will at peace
coalition org thank you all for being on
this I know we all very much appreciate
the deep analysis and insights that
you've shared with us professor Chomsky
and we apologize again for the technical
snafus at the start but I think we've
ended up in having a very very
high-quality evening thank you so much
everybody have a great rest of your
evening
a
[Music]
take care now everybody
