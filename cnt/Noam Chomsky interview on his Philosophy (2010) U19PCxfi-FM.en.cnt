you've identified from a young age as an
anarchist and during that time the
popularity of anarchism has fallen and
risen and I wonder if your core
philosophy your anarchism has evolved or
changed during the course of your life
well it's not what it was when I was 10
years old fundamentally not but that's
because the core philosophy just seems
to be like common sense I don't see how
anybody can not accept so no the core
flow the core principles as far as I
understand it that I'm the anarchism
covers a extremely wide range and all
sorts of you can you can't encapsulate
it and formulas but it seems to me there
is a sort of a thread that runs through
it and it is basically skepticism about
any form of authority or domination or
submission or whatever the idea basic
idea is that domination and hierarchy
are not self justifying they have to
justify themselves
this is burden of proof to be R and if
they can't justify themselves they
should be dismantled and that covers
everything from personal relations to
international affairs and then out of
that comes a Newark ISM depending on
what exactly you're looking for in the
future what do you what are the
alternatives to Authority and so on but
almost everything in decent and human
life is used in you fall under there so
no that hasn't changed well the part the
tendency of anarchism which I guess you
subscribe to of anarcho-syndicalism
overlaps fairly closely with council
communism around this notion of worker
councils and for the the public at large
the assumption is that an anarchist
society would be one where people ran
amok where there is chaos
what would that's the propaganda nij
anarchist view
were mostly highly organized societies
so what would that society look like a
society of worker councils a worker
councils I think it should be one
component of it so it means in any
institution it's a university or factory
or whatever it is the participants would
run it they run it through councils in
which people participate and make
decisions and she's not it's not unlike
a faculty which is about as close to
this model as you get in the narrow
world where it's you know there are
outside controls but pretty much the
faculty makes decisions about what
happens internally I see one of the
things about that makes university life
appealing much more so than higher paid
professions is that you're running your
own life to a large extent I mean there
are duties but they're technically
supposed to be shared you know and
shared by a common agreement and you may
decide to work 80 hours a week but it's
the 80 hours you pick and it's the
topics that you choose to work on the it
comes out with coming an inner need
rather than external compulsion and I
think that's the kind of model
everything should turn towards so worker
councils would be one component of a
freely organized society but they'd have
to interact with others so in
institutions a factory whatever it is is
in a community and the community should
have a comparable form of self
organization and self management and
then they have to interact and it's
complex interactions because many people
are parts of a lot of them and as an
anarchist society the kind of I think is
desirable would develop it would have to
deal with quite concrete problems about
the nature of self-government the nature
of the administration do you want to
distribute jobs so that they're fixed 13
what circulation
of responsibilities and actions and
there's no simple answer to that like
you know you want people to be trained
as surgeons let's say on the other hand
you don't want all the dirty work done
by a special category of people so that
has to be worked distribution of the job
functions and interactions between
different forms of which should be
voluntary association and there are many
other problems like what happens if
somebody doesn't want to be part of it
take on the responsibilities of a
community those are problems they exist
in any society and they would exist in a
different form in a more free society
and at this point you have lots of
different ideas so there are people who
basically anarchists to think that pay
payment you know what you earn from your
work should be proportional to effort
there are others who think that's not an
appropriate model that it should be
independent of effort toward the latter
but most of my friends did enjoyed the
farmer so but these are real questions
in there in the movement well thinking
about the road to a stateless society in
attica society you've written that you
believe that radicals should defend
those gains which have been fought for
by people that are embodied in the state
such as social security such as
progressive taxation other amicus might
argue that this holds people within the
material paternalistic grip of the state
why do you come down where you do on
this if that's what the alternatives are
I mean many anarchist just considered
the state of the fundamental form of
oppression I think that's a mistake I
meant of the various kinds of oppressive
institutions that exist the state is
among the least of them
the state at least you know to the
extent of the society is democratic you
know various degrees and types but to
the extent that it's democratic you have
some influence on what happens in the
state you have no influence on what
happens in the corporation
they're real tyrannies and as long as
society is largely dominated by private
tyrannies which is the worst form of
oppression people just need some form of
self-defense and the state provides some
form of self-defense so to say well
let's dismantle social security means
concretely let's decide that that
disabled Widow across town starve to
death in recent years there's been a
fair amount of debate about what process
of fundamental transformation of society
might take what would it look like there
are those who argue that radicals need
to change the world without taking power
and another position is that a
revolution of some kind would be
necessary what do you think with regard
to this and you see the role of
pre-existing state formations say
nationalized industries is playing some
part in such a transformation I don't
think there's a general answer it
depends a lot on circumstances so say
right now I think it would make say with
the bailout of the banks a short term
you know dedicated anarchist might say
look I'm going to talk about this there
shouldn't be any base that's like saying
I'm not going to talk about getting rid
of nuclear weapons because everyone
should live in peace I mean you know
life these things are kind of like a
chess game
there's no point coming in and saying
well I just want to make the King no you
got to say well what do you do about
that one over there
you have to get places and stages it
doesn't it's just a gift to the forces
of oppression to save all I'm going to
talk about anything except the final
state okay then fine we'll keep things
as they are so sometimes nationalization
might be a positive step say for the
government to have saved bought
Citigroup I think would have made more
sense for them to them to bail it out at
a far greater expense at once it's what
then the question becomes okay has
overrun missive rung by the community by
its participants is it sold off to some
other corporation and so on but I just
don't see how they could be a general
answer you have to ask about the
particular circumstances like I say if
you're playing chess you have to ask
about the plan that happens to be in
front one of the currents within
anarchism in the u.s. is a current which
does not see class as a central axis for
understanding society and and thinking
about a future society why do you think
that this tendency is has gotten some
traction and and why do you not agree
with it it's gotten some traction
because of the because of the decline
because the class struggle which exists
has just become one-sided I mean there's
one group of people who are basically
vulgar Marxists and who are dedicated to
class struggle constantly that's the
business place it's a highly class
conscious business class they're
fighting a bitter class conscious
struggle all the time well you know
nobody if everyone else has said you
know I'm going to worry about something
else they win and that's it's become a
an attractive position for one thing
because it it allows you to focus your
attention on things that are quite
important but aren't going to change the
class struggle like say take say gay
rights it's a good cause can be working
on gay rights but
if gays had 100% rights the
institutional structure of oppression
the core of it would remain unchanged as
you can see that didn't say take South
Africa overthrowing apartheid was a
major achievement but for the majority
of the population mean a lot okay now
they're black faces in the limousines
but the townships are is awful or worse
they are where the class structure
remained which is kind of one aspect of
it softens so now it's not straight
white black the same with and it's you
know there's less resistance from power
centers to try to write cultural and
social wrongs than there is to trying to
modify the fundamental core properties
of oppression and domination so it's
easy to drift into those and it's
something wrong it's right yes you
shouldn't deal with these things but the
class struggle is not going to go away
unless you abandon it and say okay they
win well switching gears slightly I
wanted to ask you about your Butte
science of course as interviews being
conducted in your office at MIT how do
you understand science do you think that
it's socially or politically neutral
sooner to a degree I mean of course it's
influenced by outside forces I mean like
where the science goes where the money
is has to I mean it doesn't if saying my
field didn't work with pencil and paper
but if you're in the chemistry lab you
just have to get money otherwise you
can't do anything and the money comes
from one of several sources could come
from the government it could come from a
private corporation it's about it you
know those are the basic sources of
money and which you pick and what you do
does affect the work you do it's also
what you do is affected by general
cultural attitudes so it's been argued
with some plausibility
think that they say in in the way
evolution is interpreted has been
influenced by the kind of society in
which evolutionary theories developed
it's been argued with some some degree
of plausibility on how much that the
competitive you know nature's written
tooth and claw social Darwinian approach
that evolution is affected by the fact
that it developed within a competitive
state capitalist society one very
well-known the biologist who's argued
this is lynn margulis who whose work was
on symbiogenesis you know arguing that
the species change takes place not by
competition and you know defeat of some
genes by others but by incorporating
genetic genomes essentially into organ
into other organisms bacteria so it's
kind of a cooperative mode of evolution
if you like it's possible that those
things are influenced by general social
cultural values but and the fact that
say in nuclear physics developed is not
unrelated to the fact that the military
wanted you know nuclear weapons but by
and large I think science develops from
its own internal needs I mean you can
only work on the problems that are at
the borders of understanding it's one of
the reasons why Pentagon supported
science like MIT like me that tended to
be the most free the the MIT say in the
60s was about a hundred percent Pentagon
funded I was working in a lab that was
100% funded by the three armed services
it was also one of the country's centers
as resistant and there was no real
conflict
pentagons was funding the I mean in
their view they were I presume funding
the development of the next stage of the
economy and from our view we were
working things that looked interesting
so more or less mesh there's some
influence from one on the other since
the 1970s post-modernism
has had a great deal of influence on at
least part of the left in this country
and it has been characterized by among
other things as being quite critical of
science and of the Enlightenment
tradition I wonder if you could talk
about your view of post-modernism and
whether you think that its influence is
waning I've saved a lot of postmodern
work I just don't understand so I can't
comment on that seems to me some
exercise by intellectuals who were
talking to each other and very obscure
ways and I can't follow it to know of
anybody else can postpone our views of
science by enlarge have been pre
embarrassing I think there's some
interesting work on this this a book by
two physicists genre come on Ellen so
Cal both of whom have to be political
radicals just running through it's
mostly Paris post-modernism what the
post-motor commentators have said about
science and it is really embarrassing
I mean to the extent you can understand
it I mean on the other hand there is a
point
I mean insofar as they say that
everything that people do is some kind
of social construction depends on the
historical context the cultural context
you know that part's true I don't know
if you need the whole postmodern baggage
to say those things
my feeling is not at least personally I
haven't seen anything that it doesn't
seem to me has to be said in anything
with mono Souls it looks
as far as I understand that it's pretty
straightforward and I get the feeling
that it's kind of um if there isn't a
drive among intellectuals to make things
look difficult that's a kind of
self-protection I mean if what I'm doing
can be done by you know the guy who is
repairing my furnace ok then Who am I
and then there's those physicists over
there who talk complicated things and
have to I don't understand them so I'd
like to be like them you know that drive
is clearly the air and I think it should
be resistant I'm sure we say things
simply so that people can understand I
we should post-modernism has also been
characterized by a fairly fierce attack
on the legacy of the Enlightenment I had
no idea what that means
I mean happy to be part of the legacy of
the Enlightenment well that's what I
want to ask you about in some circles
quite an unpopular stance to take but
what does that mean to you to continue
in some way the legacy of the
Enlightenment like meant like any major
movement and human life was pretty
complicated but its major features were
commitment to ideas that I think are
basically anarchist so takes a ideas
about say takes a division of labor and
let's take a typical enlightenment
figure Adam Smith what did he have to
say about division of labor here it's
worth reading I mean everyone's read the
first paragraph of wealth of nations
which butcher does his thing everybody
does their own thing everything comes
out fine so division of labor was
marvelous
I know if you read in a few hundred
pages he comes out as a figure of the
Enlightenment he says division of labor
will turn human beings into creatures
stupid and ignorant as a person can
possibly be because it will drive them
into
a repeating work on command and
therefore any civilized societies as the
government will have to move in to stop
it that's a version of a standard
enlightenment idea that you're on
intelligence and creative abilities
derive from what you do if one of the
founders of what we call classical
liberalism you know figure the
enlightenment he encapsulated it by
saying that if a craftsperson does eats
a craftsman of course if a craftsman
produces a beautiful object on command
we may admire what he does but we'll
despise what he is is a creature is a
tool and under somebody else's control
like a machine that's producing a
beautiful object if we want that person
to be a real human being they should be
doing things under their own internal
impulses and then if it creates even
maybe it's not a beautiful object
we'll still admire what the person is
well it's an Enlightenment idea grows at
a conception of human intelligence human
creativity it's a very good ideal the
same with some values like say freedom
of speech I think we should preserve
that and even the questioning of
authority and dominance that's a core
enlightenment values so I don't see
what's wrong with it well I want to ask
you about another set of ideas perhaps
as labyrinth Athena's postmodern ones
which are conspiracy theories which have
become quite popular amongst those
people who identify as progressive I
know you've been fairly critical of
those ideas why do you think that
they're popular now first of all there
are conspiracies yeah no question about
it in fact sometimes it takes a
something that big effects
like take the suburbanization of america
the huge government state that corporate
social engineering projects which were
largely dedicated to maximizing the
inefficient use of fossil fuels with
everything that goes on goes along with
it well you know I may destroy the
species so it's not insignificant but it
did start as a literal conspiracy of
General Motors Standard Oil of
California and Firestone rubber to buy
up and destroy the fairly efficient
electric transport system in Los Angeles
and other cities destroy it and turn it
into the monstrosity we have okay that
was a conspiracy they were taking a
court you know find a couple thousand
dollars but look looking for something
hidden that sort of beneath the surface
that's really running things I think
that's a sometimes it's true but usually
it's my view turns out to be a pathology
I think it comes from a sense that I
don't like the way things are and so
there must be some hidden hands
somewhere that's manipulating and
controlling it whereas when you look
closely I think you just see the normal
workings of institutional structures
that makes you of course raise questions
about the nature of the society who we
are we tolerate it and so on so for
example it's appealing to believe that
say John F Kennedy one of the main
figures in conspiracy theory what are
called conspiracy theories it would be
nice to believe he's just a
fantastically wonderful guy was gonna do
all kind of great things and they shot
him down just because he was a wonderful
in the world is going off handbasket it
was an incident it's a comforting
feeling it's less comforting to
recognize what I think the document or
director demonstrates in the historical
record and he was a kind of a hawk who
was politician you know trying to
gained power by the usual techniques is
kind of affable and friendly and smile
you've got a better people up but if you
take a look what he's doing is pretty
horrible it's one of the worst most
dangerous creatures of the 20th century
and unfortunately didn't have the blow
of the world they came pretty close to
that's a less comforting position I
happen to think it's largely true same
with Barack Obama but you can see the
appeal of trying to find so takes a
Obama there's a widespread feeling on
the left you know middle eastern
commentators and so on that he's really
dedicated doing wonderful things it's
just the dark forces are preventing so
we just have to hope that he's gonna
overcome the dark forces you know like a
hero in a fairy tale and somehow get rid
of the witches and dragons and
everything will be nice I don't think
that there's any truth to that I did
exactly what he seems to be and there
nobody's gonna ride in on a white horse
back that'll get rid of the dragons and
the witches got to do it ourselves
that's order right so would you say that
conspiracy conspiracy theories in
general are not particularly helpful for
radical politics and radical action if
they're inaccurate I mean if they're
accurate as they sometimes are sure that
helps explain the world but most of what
happens is it's kind of icky I mean you
know in a sense it's a conspiracy if the
board of directors of General Motors get
together and decide okay here's our
plans for next year it's kind of a
conspiracy but we don't call that a
conspiracy theory because it's the
normal working of institutions and
similarly when the you know fixate
during the Second World War the high
State Department planners and
comparable features figures from the
private sector like the Council on
Foreign Relations did meet and
extensively discuss the nature of the
post-war world and laid plans which were
proven well executed well has happened
to be public but is it a conspiracy
you know they got together they worked
out plans that they later implemented
them swell group of people they have
special interests not the interests of
the population but exposing that makes
perfect sense that's not what's called a
conspiracy theory because that's the way
institutions operate and that makes
sense you know on the other hand this I
don't like to use the term because there
are conspiracies it's called a
conspiracy theory if we don't like it or
something it's not the way to look at it
but you have to ask is whether the
theories of a conspiracy are accurate so
like take say the idea that the Bush
administration plotted to blow up the
World Trade Center that attracts a huge
support maybe a third of the population
believes it and very dedicated groups of
people many of them on the left are just
committed to that is it plausible
I mean suppose that the let's say
somebody can sports conspired to blow up
the World Trade Center we know what they
did they claimed a ton Saudis I mean
with the Bush administration blame it on
Saudis thereby shooting themselves in
the feet I mean if they wanted to bomb
Iraq so if they'd work in heist it they
would have blamed it on Iraqis then
they'd have no problem at all getting
congressional authorization the UN
resolution you know NATO and join and
everybody fine let's invade Iraq instead
whoever did it blamed it on sebou T's
well that absolves the Bush
administration short of outright
insanity why harm your relations with a
valued ally instead of blaming it on the
people you want to invade
so that's already a barrier to even
entertaining the possibility and the
elaborate work that goes into you know
is there nano-thermite and building
sickness seven or whatever it is it's
kind of a sad two point yeah maybe it
was maybe there wasn't unless you have a
pretty sophisticated knowledge of civil
engineering and structural architecture
you can t make a judgment as to whether
it means anything but there are obvious
clear phenomena that the the theory has
to deal with somehow and it doesn't and
if it doesn't I don't see I don't see
where you take it seriously so yes then
it becomes one of these kinds of
conspiracy theory that just mislead
misdirect and energy and so on it
wouldn't surprise me if say forty years
from now we get declassified documents
would show that the Bush administration
was very sympathetic to these theories
it was it was diverting energy from real
crimes
into things that are basically a wild
goose chase actually we have documents
like that from about the Kennedy
assassination
so there are Pentagon advisory documents
which advise the Pentagon the government
to periodically leak information about
the Kennedy assassination
basically so as to keep people out of
our hair you know let them follow those
not non-existent leads instead of asking
us questions that we really don't want
to answer
so it really conspiracy theory there and
there we have the actual documents and I
wouldn't would shock me if there are
similar things about 9/11 conspiracies
now they do have an immediate effect
they draw a lot of energy and effort
away from major crimes the crimes which
are a lot worse than blowing up the
World Trade Center
so that's convenient for the powerful
that's it's the you know the theories
seem to have just major logical problem
so that I don't see how they confront
like what I mentioned it it does seem to
me the the kind of theory that misleads
and mr. eggs and ice it's not hard to
see why it's popular I mean some
terrible things are going on this should
be some dark hand behind it we hate Bush
and Rumsfeld for good reasons so maybe
they're behind do you have time for me
to ask you one short question okay
that's just one question I really want
to ask you and it's a message structure
before thank you yeah it runs it so I
don't really have any really quickly um
it seems indisputable that we're facing
an ecological crisis and there are
obviously different currents within the
radical left in terms of addressing it
one current within anarchism known as
Anna Kournikova primitivism associated
with John's Arizona and derekjjensen
argues that the only way for the planet
to survive is if we go back to the
pre-industrial societies or even pre
agrarian societies what do you think of
that kind of view that's a factual claim
I mean if they have to be right then we
have to be in favor of mass genocide on
a scale has never even been compliment
you know contemplated okay what happens
to the six billion people around they
can't live in a Stone Age society or an
agricultural society so if that factual
claim happens to be correct we're lost
it's not a prescription for action I
mean nobody nobody's proposing a course
of action seriously that'll lead us to a
pre-industrial Society I mean you
couldn't get ten people to even listen
to you suggested that for a good reason
that means mass genocide so it's not a
prescription it's a factual claim which
I doubt is correct but if it happens to
be correct fine that we lost okay well
on that uplifting note thank you so much
for talking with me
