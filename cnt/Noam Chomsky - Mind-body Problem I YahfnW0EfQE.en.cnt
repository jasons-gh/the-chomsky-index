well mind/body is meaningless if there's
no body there's no mind-body problem and
there hasn't been any concept of bodies
in Newton
I mean Newton still thought that was
there was one but as he put it we
haven't yet discovered it meaning
they've counted for it in mechanical
terms but that's been given up certainly
by the 20th century so there is no
concept of physical the term physical is
just kind of like an honorific word kind
of like the word real when we say the
real truth it doesn't add anything it
just says this is what I you know
serious truth so to say that something
physical today just means you got to
take it seriously but there's no further
concept of physical or material or body
so there can't be a mind-body problem it
