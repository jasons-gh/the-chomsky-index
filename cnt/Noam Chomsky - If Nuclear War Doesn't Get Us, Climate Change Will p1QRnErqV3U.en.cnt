I get that question very commonly a
couple dozen letters a night what can I
do there is no formula there's two good
reasons why the species may not survive
very long so again you got some Martian
looking at what's going on here they
wouldn't put high odds on the survival
of the species one of those is nuclear
weapons I mean there could be a nuclear
war almost any time if I just kind of
like a miracle that we survived since
Nagasaki without a nuclear war it's kind
of awfully close many times more run
through the record but much too many for
any rational person to expect and it
continues so takes a Obama the other day
Obama made a nice speech about reducing
nuclear weapons okay that's good in the
same speech he said we're gonna go ahead
with the so-called missile defense
programs in Czechoslovakia and Poland or
that increases the threat of nuclear war
for obvious reasons everyone on all
sides is aware that so-called missile
defense is a first-strike weapon it's
it's the only thing that could
conceivably do if it were ever to work
it's to stop a deterrent strike and
there were some stuff a first strike so
it could conceivably stop a deterrent if
it ever worked which it doesn't now the
Russians understand that as well as the
Americans in fact they don't understand
that they can read it in American
strategic analysis journals where they
can read the detailed explanation of why
the missile defense system is a
potential threat to the Soviet deterrent
okay if there's a threat to the Soviet
deterrent what they're going to do is
build up offensive with military
capacity to get around it which is
exactly what they're doing of course
that increases the threat of nuclear war
of maybe by accident
if you have systems on high alert that
they come really close to accidents very
frequently may be stopped by human
intervention in the last two minutes or
something
so weren't consciously increasing the
threat of nuclear war and there are many
other cases now let's take a major case
but we just had the NATO summit okay
they think about NATO for a minute
there's somebody wanted some other
topics to work on take NATO
why does NATO exist okay no during the
Cold War there was a kind of a rationale
I mean you could believe it or not but
it had a rationale that wasn't total
imbecility it was supposed to be there
to protect ourselves from a Russian
attack it was there a possibility of a
Russian attack you know probably not but
at least is some kind of a credible
rationale you know after the Soviet
Union disappeared what's the rationale
there is name and take a look at what
happened I mean as the Soviet Union
collapsed gorbachev russian premier made
an astonishing concession to the united
states he allowed he agreed to allow a
unified germany to be of course
militarized and also to join a hostile
military alliance NATO he let no that's
astonishing is look at the history of
the past century I'm in Germany alone
practically destroyed Russia several
times in the century that now he's
saying militarized Germany and main
power and Europe can join a hostile
military alliance led by the United
States amazing concession but he
insisted on a quid pro quo and got it he
insisted that the Bush administration is
Bush one agree that the words they use
that NATO would not expand one inch to
the east okay that gives Russia a kind
of a buffer zone and that was agreed
upon pledge by the United
it's Gorbachev also proposed nuclear
weapons-free zone from the Arctic down
to the Mediterranean which would again
reduce the threat of accidental conflict
there's some other kind of conflict the
u.s. never even responded to that as far
as I know and it never happened
our then Clinton came in one of
clinton's first acts was to violate that
pledge and expand NATO to the east okay
that you know the Knicks the Clinton
administration people like stroked Alba
and say that it was in charge of Eastern
Europe say well we had to do that to get
the Eastern European states to join the
European Union but that's just not true
there's no connection between joining
the European Union and being a member of
NATO there's a lot of states Austria
Finland Sweden or part of the European
Union but they don't not part of NATO so
okay you want these are European states
and they and the European Union make
some sense it's got nothing to do with
NATO expanding NATO to the east is just
as seriously aggressive Act which
significantly threatens Russia so of
course they reacted by expanding
offensive military capacity then Bush
came along with this aggressive
militarism and expanded even further and
now it's expanded still further by Obama
by insisting on putting systems in
Eastern Europe which can only be
understood you know it's not even a
worst-case analysis the only rational
interpretation of them is as a threat
that's the Soviet deterrent which is
going to increase tensions well you know
it's not the only example but there's
case after case where actions are being
taken which increase the threat of
nuclear war and that's terminal no
nothing much is going to survive and
or many other examples that's one case
and the other case is environmental
destruction which is creeping along you
know it's not like imminent and total
the way a nuclear war is but it's gonna
be severe nobody knows the exact details
but everybody knows that the longer you
wait the worse it's going to be and it
could be very severe again a lot of
uncertainties but all the uncertainties
look bad and then the most of them look
pretty bad so that's two good reasons
why the species not unlikely to survive
