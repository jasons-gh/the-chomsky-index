first of all when we use the term terror
we have to recognize that like most
terms of political discourse has two
meanings there's a literal meaning and
there's the doctrinal meaning now in the
literal meaning terror is what's
described in u.s. coda laws it's the
threat or use of violence to intimidate
typically against civilians to
intimidate populations for political
ideological and other ends well nobody
can use that definition because if you
use that definition it follows instantly
that the United States is a leading
terrorist state that brick Britain's and
other leading terrorist state and so on
so the literal definition the one that's
in the u.s. code of laws is unusable the
then we go to the doctrinal definition
the one that's used in the media and
scholarship and so on that's the same as
the official definition but with a
condition it only applies to what they
do to us not what we do to them okay
that's the doctrinal meaning I'll now
use it in the doctrinal sense that
that's totally dishonest of course as to
what to do about the threat of terror in
the doctrinal sentence meaning that
there are by them against us there are a
lot of things to do one thing is to not
increase the threat that's a simple step
don't act in order to increase the
threat now the u.s. consistently and
Britain act in order to contribute in
crease the threat of terror
not because they want terror but because
it's just not a high priority so I take
the invasion of Iraq as I mentioned that
was undertaken with the expectation
since amply confirmed that it would
increase the threat of terror they
expected it it happened well one of the
ways not to increase the threat of
terror is not to take steps like that
that will increase it another and ever
just as best by unanimity on this in the
among specialists and intelligence
agencies a second step is to try to ask
what its reasons are what are the causes
of it and where the causes are
grievances that are legitimate
grievances something should be done
about those grievances quite apart from
the threat of terror it's another way to
reduce it we have a bit well--there's
let me get let me get to Canada first of
all in the case of Canada it may turn
out that the motivation for the terror
was Canadian troops in Afghanistan you
might look into that but whatever it is
if there are grievances then something
should be done beyond that terror is a
police problem so if you find a
terrorist cell of its legitimate in
Canada yeah then you should arrest the
perpetrators and they should be
subjected to trial
just as the leading terrorists should be
like the ones in the White House but of
course we're doing it on you keeping to
the doctrinal sense so it's only them
against us but there's more to do what
should the United States do about this
well actually there is advice given
recommendations in the 9/11 Commission
report there as you recall there was an
official government commission set up
over the strong objections of the Bush
administration but they finally had to
agree there was Commission set up that
made recommendations on how to decrease
the threat of terror in the United
States well one of them had to do with
Canada they concluded that the major
threat of terror in the United States is
the Canadian border it's a very long
border practically unprotected very easy
to cross and they recommended that there
be a sharp increase in border patrols on
the Canadian border that's their
recommendation will have the Bush
administration respond it responded by
reducing the growth of the Border Patrol
altogether after 9/11 increase in the
Border Patrol reduced and shifting it
from the Canadian border overwhelmingly
to the Mexican border okay so I remember
the numbers but I think it's about ten
to one by now you know per mile of
surveillance of the Mexican border in
the Canadian border well that's so
they're reducing the efforts to defend
the United States from the potential
threat of terror
Canada reducing that again another
illustration of the fact that protection
of the population from terrorists is not
a high priority okay so for the United
States something else that could be done
would be to say follow the
recommendations of the 9/11 Commission
and there's a lot more terror is not
coming from nowhere and what you want to
do is I mean it's easy to stand up on a
pedestal and scream Islamofascism and so
on and so forth maybe that makes you
feel good but if you want to deal with
the threat of terror you'll ask what its
sources are and ask how those sources
can be dealt with
I mean terribly what we call terrorists
or see themselves as kind of a vanguard
who are trying to organize a
constituency to support their long-term
demands now their long-term demands in
the case of sale jihadi style terror are
pretty clear and again there's pretty
near unanimity about this in the you
know specialist community there as they
put it their goals are to defend Muslim
lands from attack and they list specific
grievances and the grievances are real
they're trying to mobilize a
constituency to join them well the way
to deal there's two ways of dealing with
it the one is to allow yourself with
Osama bin Laden that's the way Bush
picked that's why the leading terrorist
specialists in the United States like
Michael Schorr described Bush as Osama
bin Laden's leading Ally because what
he's done as if you is to do exactly
what Osama wants to help the vanguard
mobilize the constituency in support of
terrorist act what is recommended across
the board is pay some attention to those
reasons which are real you can read that
in the defense Science Board
recommendations in academic scholarship
and intelligence reports pay attention
to the grievances and many of them are
real and they should be dealt with quite
apart from the threat of terror now that
can reduce the threat of terror and we
know that it works I'm going to take say
Northern Ireland okay for a long time
the British reaction to
in Northern Ireland which was pretty
serious practically blew up the British
cabinet all sorts of things
their reaction was just to increase the
violence okay that's the bush line you
join with the terrorists and you're
their ally it's exactly what the more
militant sectors of the IRA wanted so
you get an escalating terror and
repression cycle finally the British got
into their heads that they should pay
some attention to the grievances that
are the source of it and in fact they
began to do so because the grievances
were real the constituency was being
mobilized around real grievances when
they began to do that the threat of
terror declined Belfast is not utopia
but it's a very different place from say
when my wife and I visited in 1993 which
was a pretty scary place it's not that
anymore it's much improved and in fact
the threat of IRA terror has now been
very much marginalized by doing the
sensible thing paying attention to the
source out of which it grows
