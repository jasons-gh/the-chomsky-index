from pacifica network this is democracy
now population has been very carefully
excluded from the political arena and
the general culture the general dominant
culture that's not by accident an
enormous amount of work went into this
elites were terrified by the sixties
this is at first popular participation
democracy so and is a huge counter like
the counter campaign to drive it back
he's one of the leading dissidents and
scholars in this country he's been a
guest on Democracy Now many times over
the last eight years breaking down u.s.
foreign policy today we bring you the
personal story of Noam Chomsky an hour
interview all that and more coming up
welcome to this special edition of
democracy now democracynow.org the war
and peace report I'm Amy Goodman today
we'll spend the hour in an extended
conversation with one of the leading
dissidents in this country Noam Chomsky
professor Chomsky teaches linguistics at
the massachusetts institute of
technology known the world over for his
cutting-edge work in linguistics he's
also one of the most widely quoted
analysts on Foreign Affairs around the
globe just not here in the United States
the New York Times called him arguably
the most important intellectual alive
but they rarely quote him in their pages
Noam Chomsky's latest book is hegemony
or survival America's quest for global
dominance he's written more than a
hundred books among them 911 power and
terror Noam Chomsky has appeared on this
program many times since its inception
in 1996 challenging u.s. foreign policy
occupation war and resistance today we
wanted to bring you some of Noam
Chomsky's personal story I recently had
a chance to visit him in his MIT offices
in Cambridge Massachusetts here is an
extended excerpt of our conversation
so how did you end up here at MIT how
did I live you it's the only place I
could get a job I had no I had been for
four years at Harvard society fellows
but I was working in topics that no one
had ever heard of it didn't exist I
couldn't get anything published and had
no particular interest and no
expectation of going on to a
professional academic career it's the
only job offer a head was to teach
Brandeis 12 hours a week introductory
Hebrew courses particularly appealing
but then this kind of came along the lab
was open-minded really if something
looks like it might be interesting they
were willing to take a chance on it a
lot of it didn't pan out a lot with it
turned out very interested and we just
started here actually my wife carol had
been working here a couple years earlier
on speech analysis so what were these
topics that no one's ever heard of
before well what became modern
linguistics and a good part of cognitive
science those days where the ruling
doctrines were really dogmas were the
behavior ism the various forms of
behavior isn't scary
and in linguistics anthropology other
fields it was structuralist approaches
which were very data oriented
organization of data and the few of us
who didn't believe any of this couple of
graduate students at Harvard we were we
thought you should study language and
other cognitive capacities is basically
biological organs sort of like the
visual system or the immune system the
components of the human organism which
grow and develop ordinary ways and data
and evidence of course have an effect
what they have affect them I Paul you
are that sort of thing but the primary
course of growth and development is we
expected is I think that out to breed
was genetically determined like
everything else about the organism and
in the case of humans they're very
special capacities nobody knows exactly
where they came from but they seem to
have evolve that fairly suddenly may be
pretty recently fifty sixty thousand
years ago which is nothing evolutionary
time in a very small breeding group
which we're all descendants
and led on to for better or for worse
what distinguishes so as you watch your
children grow up and your grandchildren
do are they are you watching how they
acquire language did you learn from them
well actually my wife Carol worked on
language acquisition she was even doing
it carefully but yeah we did it as
parents didn't because we were
interested in specific aspects of the
language acquisition growth so yes we
paid attention to by now it's a rich
developed experimental field plenty of
work and we didn't see ya if it's your
children growing up it's fun to watch
but nothing happened that was
particularly surprising although the
growth development of a child's
conception of the world cognitive
capacities are pretty miraculous to
observe
how did your linguistic studies your
field what you were developing this
shattering of an old paradigm can you
relate it to what you've done in
politics and political analysis no
relation I was deeply involved political
work long before I ever heard of the
postings just provocative and continued
with it I just continued to alongside of
intellectual interests which went in
this direction but there's no connection
what got you interested as a kid in
political work yes this was the 1930s so
some of my earliest childhood memories
are people coming to the door selling
rags or drug riding in a trolley car
with my mother and seeing women strikers
being beaten up by security forces
outside a textile plant a lot of my
family was
at the New York branch of my family was
mostly working class seamstresses shop
for this is an uncle that's who stand
over understand I guess you didn't know
anything was it allowed to run it
because he had a severe disability and
under WPA programs was given an
opportunity most of them never had a
higher education or any education that I
very most grown employed in this year's
a very lively active environment too
radical politics alongside of lots of
other things to this newsstand at
seventy-second Street yeah which told
the school there so you would hang out
there I would hang out there it became a
kind of a hangout for a lot of am agrees
particularly this was the 30s people
coming to New York and my uncle is very
lively mind he collected around and a
lot of quite interesting people love
psychiatrists radicals others was fun
selling newspapers in the listening to
the discussions actually for a long time
I thought that is a fine word in English
called news an era I knew that when
people came out of the subway they would
say Ms anura and I would quickly pick up
two things and at the room notice they
read the raising forms later other than
foot it is it is
lose it matter which I guess with the
two tablets in those days to me it sound
like there's a mirror your first writing
how old were you were you five six ten
first when I remember was ten I can date
it very easily it was school it at post
editing the elementary school newspaper
excitement do you remember the title the
title that I'm a topic it was right
after the fall of Barcelona so it was in
mid-march 1939 that was about the growth
of this spread of fascism through Europe
I remember the first sentence was the
first sentence I think of something like
Austria Falls Czechoslovakia falls now
Barcelona fools what's going to come
next I mean at that time it felt as if
this black cloud of fascism was really
spreading over the world and was very
honest
so
did you talk about it with your family
did your where your parents politically
active my parents were they were
political liberals like Roosevelt knew
do liberal and but they were living in a
kind of a different world which I was
also living and essentially
first-generation immigrant Jewish
community very much involved and what
amounted to a Jewish get it was a kind
of a battle going on between the Yiddish
side of the Hebrews side and they were
on the Hebrews that so for my father ran
the Hebrew school system the city my
mother taught in it we grew up in a
Hebrew environment immersed in Hebrew
culture literature it's on tied to the
pretty state Jewish settlement the news
really was it and what is now Israel and
Palestine I very eat quickly in the
early I guess early 40s was drawn into
parts of what word I was very active in
what was then in the Zionist youth of
them so the youth leader that sort of
thing but in a wing of it that would now
be called anti-zionist venomous ions
this was the wing opposed to a jewish
state in faith as socialist radical
favored arab-jewish in class cooperation
in a socialist Palestine you looked and
felt awful and what did you want to see
especially after the war with energy was
looking for someplace to go that's what
it was same thing I kept involved in
that these are small groups but they
existed and there was one fairly large
group that a youth pastor emeritus a
year which was like about half of the
kibbutz movement and had offshoots in
the United States people being akshara
farmers preparation farms where they
were being prepared to go to Cuba team
in Israel and they were officially
binational supposed to the state until
nineteen forty-eight the issues were
became moved I could never join them
though because they were split into a
Stalinist leanna Trotskyist weakened
from of the time I be able to begin to
think for myself 12 or 13 I was very
handy Leninist I was part of the
the left lead to the left of Lenin what
the Bolsheviks called cultural leftist
anarchist left Marxist to the critics of
Bolshevism so I could never actually
join the groups but I was pretty close
to them many attitudes beliefs did your
parents speak English oh yeah at home
yeah i mean their native language was
nitish but they would never speak I'm
that was just to move so we never heard
a word but my father came over when he
was about 17 so he spoke with an accent
my mother in her illness from birth so
she spoke ordinary do you work English
they came from my father came from a
town in the Ukraine which was wiped out
by the Nazis is that my mother came from
what's now builders
what affected the Holocaust have on you
how old for you well i was born in 1928
so it was an early teenager it's kind of
surprising but in the American Jewish
community even the deeply Jewish
committed parts of it we were virtually
an immigrant ghetto I mean it was not
really grasped for quite a while and in
the shooting it what's now is Republican
Jewish community in Palestine awareness
of it was quite delayed and even in a
sense suppressed I mean by the late you
know but by the mid 40s you had to know
1943 1944 the the war itself was such an
overwhelming obsession
it really wasn't very clear until pretty
far along how the world war was going to
turn out I mean I later learned even in
high-level circles so for example the
council on foreign relations in the
State Department had planning studies
going on from 1939-1945 planning for the
post of our world the plants are really
interesting I mean they spell out and
close detail later happened which is not
surprising it's proof same people but
Peppa they assume they took for granted
that the United States would emerge from
the war is a for the first time a major
global power dominant global power had
been before and that Britain would be
sort of marginalized and the basic plan
was that the US would take over what
they called a grand area that would
include the entire western hemisphere at
which the US had laid claim that it
could never do much about it except in
the neighboring region so they take over
the whole Western Hemisphere the Far
East and the former British Empire at a
minimum that was the region that was
held to be necessary for satisfying the
needs of the US corporations of the US
economy us control strategic resources
and so on and what they called security
but they also assumed that there would
be a German world this was the
non-german world at a minimum the
Western Hemisphere the Far East than the
former British Empire
everything but they assumed there would
be a German world in Eurasia which would
be the other for Samoa and that went up
to about nineteen forty three or so that
was a prevailing conception by 1942 was
pretty clear the Japanese would be
defeated so the US would take over the
Far East and keep everyone else out so
the Allies Britain France and the others
weren't even allowed into the post
Porter discussions about he's treated
for Japan and how to organize the Far
East and so on but Eurasia was not so
clear like it really wasn't until the
huge tank battles and mid nineteen forty
four where the Russians smashed up but
most of the remained of the major German
armies it wasn't clear until it I've
been that the Germans were going to be
defeated that's about the time that the
US Britain landed in Normandy really the
tail end of the European battle and just
you know from check check from a child's
one of you it certainly wasn't obvious I
mean of course I didn't know any of this
stuff at the time you just see what was
happening and the Holocaust definitely
in the background you can see terrible
horror story was going on but the real
dimensions didn't sink in
when did it I guess well by the end of
the war was there was just no question
anymore by the time the I'm invited
towards the end of the war was pretty
clear and by the end that was never any
question I'm as well people were still
dying in DP camps for a couple years
after the it was over another story
which I didn't know much about the time
and it's pretty ugly noam chomsky
speaking in his MIT offices and
Cambridge Massachusetts just before the
2004 election this is democracy now back
with professor Chomsky in a minute this
is democracy now democracynow.org the
war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman as
we continue our conversation with
professor Noam Chomsky in his offices at
MIT we had this conversation just before
the 2004 election I'm the obvious
question about the remnants of the
Holocaust is why aren't they here if you
were at survived extermination camp and
all under Germany in 1945 where would
you want to go first of all probably
half the population of Europe would have
come to earth had a chance and I don't
think that's very much doubt that the
survivors of this hideous experience if
they had a chance I would have come to
the one country in the world one of the
few countries in the world at the time I
escaped the war but was enriched by
virtue of the war on the US ended the
war with industrial production roughly
tripled
learning half the world's wealth the
only major country that was untouched by
wherever else was seriously harmed
you're devastated this was paradise so
where would you if room a very few came
here and I think it's not because they
didn't want it we're two forces kept
them out the one is the United States
and 1 i'm in the American Jewish
community so there were immigration
proposals legislation in the late 40s
but the only part of the Jewish
community that lobbied for them where
the anti-zionist groups the American
Council for Judaism the general
community didn't honor because
several reasons for one thing it
anti-semitism was not it wasn't like the
Germany but it wasn't a joke either
anti-semitism was serious phenomena and
I can remember very well from childhood
when my father got old enough that we
finally got enough money to buy a
second-hand car in the late 30s if we
would drive up to the nearby mountains
for a weekend you'd have to check the
motels to see if they said restricted
that's restricted meant no Jews I
haven't got live in a neighborhood of
Philadelphia which was to a large extent
to german and irish american very handy
submitting a quite foreign policy in
fact up until Pearl Harbor and you know
where kids on boys on the streets you
run into what you can expect never
talked to my parents about it they never
knew I thought my brother and I until
the day their deaths never told them but
it wasn't like your life wasn't in
danger it's not like urban society today
but it wasn't a lot of fun you know
taking her has he could take I get me
not the sort of thing it was right below
the surface and for a lot of the
American Jewish community that was true
look you know when I got to Harvard was
around the nineteen fifty the
anti-semitism was a fake differently cut
it with a knife
however you know sort of distinguished
quiet people to make any Spivak remarks
in your face but there's no Jewish
virtually no Jewish faculty tiny
spattering there were sort of it was
kind of clubbish atmosphere but she was
just born in it you know probably
weren't very many Jewish students
actually one of the reasons MIT became a
great university lots of very
distinguished scientists who couldn't
get jobs at Harvard came over here to
the engineering school down the street
which didn't have the class attitudes
and so on i paid like Norbert Wiener for
clinical and that quite a few others
came to the engineering school down the
street was Harvard one example so the
point is that was a general there was an
undertone of anti-semitism which was I'm
bringing over these you know very
skeletons from over there just wasn't
appealing the other factor was there was
a lot of pressure to compel him to go to
what was in Palestine from later his
room turns out the
I should be sort of half a new this
being inside designs new movements but
nothing like what has since come out in
the archival record the Zionist partners
movement in the issue of the Jewish
community essentially took over the
camps and ran and controlled food
resources and others and it wanted that
there was a fixed an official policy of
getting able-bodied people men and women
I think it was age of 17 to 35 and
getting them sent off to Palestine
essentially to be cannon fodder the
others the children the older people
didn't care much about but they really
did they did make effort not to have
them sent to Britain or France to the
limited extent that they would accept
them preferred for them to be a kind of
psychological weapon against the British
in favor of immigration to Palestine
which was the only place that really not
welcomed with trying every way to get
them to come
the first study of this that just came
out couple years ago in Hebrew friend of
mine using krasinski actually an English
version of it is just a very common
courage presses publishing it I don't
know what the English title as the
Hebrew title translates as good human
material meaning the good human material
we want to get over to how was that and
if there had been an objective
investigation which there wasn't I think
it's hard to believe that that would
have been the first choice of many
people probably most people coming out
of the concentration camps if they had
out of their choices but they didn't
after World War two I mean you talked
about watching from a young age
believing fascism was going to take over
Austria fell who said Spain do you think
the lesson learned was that fascism must
be fought well I thought Penley 1938 on
by the time I was sort of conscious
politically say late 30s I mean my
feeling was the US should get into the
war in fact it wasn't any word that it
should be involved in stopping the
spread of fascism and fashion and meant
to you italy germany japan was already
he was clear there kind of horrible
massacres and the terms means
you know by now it's just used as a term
of abuse but in the sense in the 1930s
it was used as a descriptive term for a
particular form of social organization
which involved a powerful state linked
to corporate systems organized society
in corporate structures state over
overwhelming ruled by state power but
private enterprise given tremendous
advantages and freedom a working-class
crush the parliamentary systems crushed
sometimes the use of violence to control
the population sometimes not in fact the
New Deal was called fascist in those
days by many people without without any
particular program it was just one of
the versions of this form of social and
economic organization that was spreading
over the world with some hideous parts
like Hitler and some parts like Italy
which were actually approved I mean
Mussolini was quite popular in the
United States over broad spectrum
including labor from the Roosevelt
called him that admirable Italian gentle
government as late as 1939 was saying
that fascism and Italy it was an
experiment that was worthwhile and had
to be carried out distorted later by its
association with Hitler and in fact the
US the US business community loved I'm
investment in Italy just shot up after
him sweetie talk took over same after
Hitler took over
in fact if you look back at the records
which are now available it was really
never what's now called appeasement is
very misleading term I mean it was
support it fashion Hitler was described
by the State Department at the late 30s
1937 as kind of a moderate standing
between extremes of left and right for
this mini client who was protecting the
West against the terrible threat of the
working class and the Bolsheviks and a
possible revolution which might overturn
the core of civilization meaning
capitalist civilization so appeasement
is very strange I man after Munich 938
Roosevelt's closest associates under
will reported back that is a tremendous
achievement this is what destroyed
checks Olivia turned it over to hit for
everyone great achievement and now we
have a chance for the Peace of the world
under the moderate Nazis who have
programs that we can work with it gets
worse I remember and if he's flatly
wrong but the george canon who was one
of the leading postal planners and very
much on the humanist liberals he was
American Consul in Berlin I think it to
mid nineteen forty one was sending back
pretty favorable report
that you shouldn't be too extreme in
condemning the Nazis and the Italian
certainly not I mean in the early 30s a
member of Fortune magazine the main
business magazine had an issue with the
cover saying something like the wops are
unlocking themselves these backward
dirty Italians are finally learning that
they're somehow to do something right
this was it was not I mean I thought I
didn't know most of this but the new
enough to see that there was no serious
opposition to fascism in it was for the
for me and people like me it was a
scandal the businesses that were
benefiting that remained investing in
Hitler's companies in the unit IBM and
now the discussion of the George budget
companies fathered Prescott again for ya
I mean they didn't see a lot wrong with
it it was giving them enormous
advantages great investment
opportunities crushing the labor
movement they didn't care of the
parliamentary system not the function of
significantly and through various
mechanisms it's not only sustained
context even during the war wasn't the
same with Japanese Imperial in Japan I'm
not till practically up to a pearl
harbor the u.s. position in negotiations
with the Japanese
the fish official position was that the
US would be willing to accept Japan's
actions in Asia which were utterly
monsters if US business opportunities
were protected us wasn't cut out of the
china market say was allowed to
participate freely this is after the
rape of King terrible atrocities all
over and you know actually if you look
at what the Japanese were doing the way
Americans look at themselves today there
wasn't much to complain about I mean in
fact even Pearl Harbor you know by the
standards that the u.s. now accepts the
bombing Pearl Harbor was a pretty
acceptable action it falls very strictly
within official US doctrine and even
less contentious than the invasion of
Iraq much less contentious but I mean in
the 1930s the US press open incident in
particular secret and the Japanese were
certainly reading the general popular
press literature was talking about how
we have to exterminate the Japanese by
massive bombing of their cities which
are made out of wood so we can have huge
fire storms which will exterminate the
whole terrible race than VLO devils and
all we need is long distance bombers to
do it and was discussed and at that time
they were coming out of the boleyn
assembly line the b-17 Flying Fortresses
we're beginning to roll out of the
assembly lines in the late 30s they were
supposed to go to military bases in
Pearl Harbor and
from which they would be able to wipe
out Japan that's a pretty serious threat
far worse than any threat the US a
zipper face and two in under those
conditions to bomb to military targets
which is what happened military bases in
Pearl Harbor and vanilla and there were
some civilian casualties but
overwhelmingly military not by the US
standards we ought to be celebrating
every December seven it is your birthday
which happens to be my birthday which
was Pearl Harbor Day just to make it a
little more ominous I so my apartment to
the day so after world war two four
years after this three years after the
State of Israel is established what was
your reaction at the time well that was
a tragedy I thought was a terrible
mistake having a Jewish state is a very
bad mistake and the older people who
were in the groups that I was sort of a
younger part of did treated as a tragedy
I mean that was kind of mixed because
there was also no joy and happiness that
the Palestinian issue Jewish community
would get some kind of was hope
stability but
fundamental a thought I was in here
because because a Jewish state is a
should shouldn't be a state that
privilege one sector of the population
for the same reason I'm opposed to
Pakistan being an Islamic state or if
the United States turned into a
Christian of state let's say in which
non-christians were second-class
citizens that deprived of all sorts of
Rights it was more than symbolic opposed
to that too and since i haven't be very
deeply kind of even emotion and often
this one the mistake cut deeper but i
have to say it was mixed because it was
also a feeling of joy something happened
especially it was a place for her
holocaust victims could be assimilated
it was almost nowhere else where they
could noam chomsky sitting in his new
offices at the massachusetts institute
of technology we'll come back to this
conversation just after our break here
on democracy now democracynow.org this
is democracy now democracynow.org the
war and peace report as we return to our
conversation with noam chomsky in his
offices at MIT in cambridge
massachusetts and what was your
understanding of what happened to the
Palestinians there the time well I
didn't know then what we know now but it
was pretty clear there was no doubt
it was a pretty violent expulsion I mean
now even the major Israeli historian
flick same anymore since the main
historian of this simply calls it the
phrase it uses is translated as ethnic
cleansing is but the literal meaning is
ethnic purification and that's part of
the Zionist ideal its purification of
land redemption of the land purification
of land and to do that you had to get
rid of this alien entity effect Benny
Morris it's done more than anyone else
is recording the horrible detail that
praises it says it didn't go far enough
it's the only way George state could
have been established
at that point at that time most of those
details weren't known although I must
say I saw some of some of it enough to
have a sense right at the time and later
when I was living I was living in Israel
a little bit later for a while what 53
in a kibbutz hasharon secure key boots a
very left-wing cute it was near 50 but
everything is near reporter so not that
far from the words but I remember going
out on guard duty with older friends
some evenings and someone refused to
take guns we talk and ask why have you
taken guns there were they weren't then
called terrorists in fact the word
Hebrew word for terrorists hadn't even
been made up yet they were called
infiltrators and but then I had to drive
him out and I had I remember asking some
of these guys why don't you take guns
and they said look these are the people
used to live here I'm from their point
of view we're harvesting their land so
I'm going to shoot I mean I want to meet
her you know tears they got to go away
and did you understand they were Arab oh
yeah everybody knew who they were they
were the Palestinians who lived there
I'm at once i was working in a field
with again and older man from ski boots
and we carrying irrigation pipes around
or something like that and i noticed the
pilot rocks up on a hill when i asked
what that was he's going to change the
subject talk about it but later he took
me aside a couple days later and said
look and that was an Arab village it was
a friendly village but when the fighting
came close we felt we couldn't accept
their being there so we drove him out
and destroyed the villa this is q away
at the left dovish by nationalist end
actually they were bhuva rights mostly
it came from Germany but you know who
was technically at least in favor of my
national state but they were at the
extreme but they didn't like it but it
happened says no secret that it happened
when you were 25 or so you lived in
Israel and come in about 25 for how long
why did you go well we went to my wife
and I went because so we thought I might
stay I just she went back for longer
period than we thought plants day we
might if we assumed we both might we'll
stay I could find gotten the job at MIT
I might well have gone life is full of
accident actually I don't know how long
it would last and I like the life very
much but even in a place like that the
racism was very visible and also at that
time this is the early 50s it was
extremely first honest and rigid and
ideologically rigid remember what was
happening in those years in 1953 was the
last outburst of Stalinist car
atrocities at being anti-semitic driving
in russia it's called the doctors plot
which had extreme and he submitted that
can call over those it was anti-semitic
that's one of the centerpieces of the
whole college conspiracy was a
representative the Israeli kibbutz
movement
and in Warren who was a emissary in
Czechoslovakia he was picked up and I
claimed he was a spy and he was working
for the Americans on this that the other
thing that was one of the centerpieces
of the trials now these people all knew
it and if Cupid's what if it's a
close-knit fairly intimate community
they knew he wasn't a spy but they
supported and when we talked about it
and argued about it I get answers like
well you know he did stupid things and
that was pretty hard to take along with
media just ideological rigidity everyone
read the same newspaper pretty much the
same thoughts so although I had mixed
feelings I very much like the
environment than the interactions so
long but their love aspect of it that
hard to accept so then you came back
here you went to MIT and you're watching
that situation and then Vietnam starts
to vote well the late 50s were pretty
quiescent period you know in fact those
are the days when there's a lot of
curling about the end of history the end
of ideology everything is solved all we
need is a few technocratic take her a
little bit around the edges but we know
how to run the society perfectly a
little bit like what you heard around
here in the early 90s
and it was very little activism sort of
they were there wasn't much to do except
sign petitions against nuclear weapons
and things like that and then the by
around nineteen sixty things were
changing firstly first the civil rights
movement then Cuba then by 1962 when the
Vietnam War was on in full force that
there was no protest I mean practice is
virtually zero it's very different from
today but it took years before her
festival an avid give talks and I
remember giving talks of Lexi at church
for people the minister the organizer
something drunk walked in off the
streets some guy who wanted to kill me
these are pretty mild talks only the
first time we tried there was it in the
October 1965 enough purposed it
developed so there was an F there was an
international day of protest first
international day of practice and Boston
liberal city we had a March and to the
boston common which is the standard
place for public dogs that I was
supposed to be one of the speakers if I
can get a word I mean the only reason we
weren't killed was there were a couple
hundred state cops around and most of
these people were students marching over
from universities
the liberal press was bitterly condemned
the terrible actions of these people
criticizing the United States and what
we were but we were what people were
saying was embarrassingly mile we were
embarrassed we were criticizing mostly
the bombing of North Vietnam because
that was at least an issue that's
nothing to listen through but that was a
sight I mean the worst attack was
against South Vietnam and in fact until
the end of the war Easter only you know
people were real activists knew that I
mean scholars the CIA but it was not
part of a popular conscience as you can
see it today today it's very clear you
there's a lot of talk now about how the
Vietnam obsession which is coming up for
the election actually I saw something on
CNN or somewhere where I was in a hotel
once where Howard Kurtz the I think he's
the media commentator the post or
something had a panel of what's called
across the spectrum and it was called
America's Vietnam obsession and it was
about the Vietnam obsession in the
campaign Swift but that kind of stuff I
think Vietnam doesn't arise in the
campaign I haven't seen anybody ask what
was john kerry doing deep in the Mekong
Delta in 1969 seven years after Kennedy
had started bombing it had been
demolished and subjected chemical
warfare I mean right of the period of
the peak of us atrocities after seven
years award what was he doing there deep
in the South not north vietnamese within
hundreds of miles if somebody believes
they don't have a right to
Vietnam has anybody ever does that come
up it's not even a question I mean the
most people will talk about his meal I
which was like a foot I mean I was asked
when meal I was exposed by the New York
Review which I've been writing for to
write an article about it and I said I
would do it only if I mentioned it
marginally which ID that I mentioned it
marginally and I talked about the main
atrocities that were going I mean meal I
was part of it at that time it was part
of one of the big mass murderer
operations classification campaigns they
were cool which were just horrendous I
mean it Herman and I went through a lot
of them in a book wrote that we used
notes that were given to me by Kevin
Buckley who was the news week ahead of
the news we call office in Saigon who
did a very detailed investigation of one
of these campaigns of which we live was
part Newsweek when publish it to be
giving the note published but the meal i
was literally foot the reason it became
you can talk about it is he can blame it
on people who aren't like us when you
can blame me lie on half-educated the 4g
is out of the field and not knowing
who's going to shoot at him next and
knowing where they are sonya ok they
committed a massacre so we can talk
about how awful they are but we can't
talk about is the guys sitting in the
air-conditioned offices who were
plotting b-52 raids on villages and
sending them out to carry these
massacres because those are nice folks
like us so that part isn't discussed
this is pretty typical actually algo
grave is not so different it was
horrible but look what they're going
after people people who are part of it
what amounts to a mercenary army the
disadvantaged yeah they were sent out
there they brainwashed into thinking
they're getting revenge for 911 or
something and they did some pretty
horrible things but the people who are
organizing and carrying out the
atrocities they're immune and there are
principles here there was a Nuremberg
Tribunal which established very
explicitly that the supreme crime is
aggression and that crime includes all
of the evil that is contained in it as a
consequence no matter who it's done by
that was what the Nazis were on were
sentenced for my am hanged in November
with a very clear statement yeah this
covers everybody and it couldn't be a
clear example of aggression than this
and yes it contains all of the evil that
follows John Kerry has said when he left
Yale and went to to Vietnam he already
had serious questions about it but felt
that if the US was going to fight there
that he should do it have you heard the
speech he gave in 71 there's speech
about atrocities and what do you think
about those he was quite right I mean I
was working pretty closely with Vietnam
veterans at the time he was in the group
but in
him and he wasn't aiming tactic oh they
all knew it how many investigations that
went on at a time the Winter Soldier
another war crimes investigations quite
a number of which I attended gave
detailed information almost all of which
has been independently verified of major
atrocities and they weren't discussing
the worst comes the worst ones are
things like the mass bombing you know
saturation bombing that make unbuilt
which were public like it wasn't secret
you don't have to expose they just
didn't matter this is saturation bombing
of a densely populated area where the US
had simply lost control because the
population was all with the resistance
very few North Vietnamese troops
whatever you think about North Vietnam
right to be there after we found North
Vietnam their country after all putting
that aside that North Vietnamese troops
were around the periphery of the country
in fact there were more South Korean in
the time mercenaries up to about 1968
and their word North Vietnamese and they
were not at the periphery of the country
they were accounting out massacres right
in the center of the country do you
think that's putting aside that half a
million American troops and the the
bombing and the chemical were chemical
warfare was going on from 1961 till
nineteen sixty-nine was finally called
off there are plenty of people still
dying from the effects of chemical
warfare probably hundreds of thousands
of victims we don't count kill or cure
thank you yeah I visited you know which
is a lethal chemical contains that they
were using very heavy concentrations
of chemicals including dioxin is one of
the worst cars of the gyms none there's
a lot of talk correctly about the
American soldiers who were affected
plenty of them what about the Vietnamese
we're getting soaked by this I mean
there are pretty careful studies now but
some by American US public health
specialists son by Canadian
investigating organization which done
very detailed work and it's found this
you'd expect that the dosages were
hundreds of times as high as anything
that's marginally tolerated here right
around and say air bases do you think
part of what's going on now aside from
trying to rework boundaries and borders
is rewrite Maps is rewriting history is
for the hostility toward what John Kerry
was saying at that time though he
doesn't stand up for what he said in
1971 is to obliterate any reference to
when the u.s. did I mean I wish I could
say that but since there was no writing
of history in the first place he can't
really rewrite I mean among the educated
sectors of the population the liberal
media and so on and so forth and in fact
a good part of scholarship almost this
is just unrecognized
it affects rather striking I mean by
1969 about seventy percent of the
american population was saying that the
war is the words were fundamentally
wrong and immoral not a mistake and
those figures are pretty stable up to
the present and there are amazing
figures because one with nobody who says
that has ever heard it you don't read it
anywhere I'm what you read way at the
critical side is the war was a mistake
we went in with benign intentions to do
good we didn't understand the Vietnamese
culture we didn't think it through ended
up being a disaster which cost us too
much for some trustees like those
carried out by those horrible uneducated
GIS to the meal I but it was basically
benign attentions gone awry I'm this you
heard from the left Anthony Lewis
junking fairbank others so there's a
criminal history to rewrite professor
Noam Chomsky sitting in his new offices
at MIT the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Noam Chomsky professor of
linguistics author of scores of books on
