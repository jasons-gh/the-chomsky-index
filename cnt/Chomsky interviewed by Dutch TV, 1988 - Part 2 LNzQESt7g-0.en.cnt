it's in the a Reagan could have eating
peach before he left
but the press more or less exit very
restrained for it as in the case of
Nixon but why don't why don't you and
you your colleagues who come out for
Burundi and for Timor come out for
things that are so close not only at
home but at heart and in the middle of
the monthly rich things well the the way
a corrupt government is acting I mean
with a minister like means and I spend
half my life on that topic but did you
spend especially I have a book about it
I have a book specifically largely about
the encounter scandals came out 1988 and
is because I'm you know two or three
days a week somewhere giving talks about
it or on the radio or something else so
it's still possible to around cultures
get a little let's cover up I mean just
like Watergate had to cover up I mean
there there came a point when it was
impossible to conceal what was going I
mean take the iran-contra stuff it's
only I don't agree with you about
Watergate but let's not go under that on
the event let's take the iran-contra
scandal
everything that came out of the
iran-contra scandal except the details I
mean the general things that came out
were perfectly well known before I mean
I have a book in 1985 which describes
Oliver North's role in organizing
illegal arms sales to the Contras oh no
that's not because I have any special
knowledge because it's because it was
public knowledge I've booked 1983 that's
years before the iran-contra scandal
which describes us arms sales to Iran
via Israel based on public information
there was nothing secret about the only
fundamental thing that came out of the
iran-contra scandal was that these two
things were somehow connected possibly
which is a minor point why did it ever
breakthrough well it broke through
because in October 1986 a plane was shot
down carrying an American mercenary
at that point it was impossible to
conceal that half of it anymore
the other thing that happened is the
Lebanese and then the Iranian the
Iranians released the fact that the
National Security Adviser was running
around Tehran giving out Bibles and
chocolate kills well at this point you
can't
talking about it anymore okay so in fact
something broke through which was
unconceivable at that point exactly as
in the case of Watergate begins the
cover-up operation
the purpose is to narrow it to narrow
the issue so that it only deals with
personalities not with institutions see
there's a there's after take a look at
the things that were not looked at in
the iran-contra scandal it's extremely
interesting for example take the Iran
side an obvious that again their
investigation from 1985 well an obvious
question is what was the United States
doing with regard to Iran for 1985
answer it was sending arms to Iran via
Israel but if you look at that matter
then of course the wrong answers come up
it must be that there was some long-term
planning involved and of course there
was and you don't want that to be
understood what you want to the
population to believe is that there's
sort of one overzealous Patriot who got
out of control and the point is even
those magnificent systems Patriot I'm
sorry you had to come you can't have it
both ways you can't say only on the one
hand it certainly came to light because
well because the what the press did on
the other hand and you say it was
personalized in the shape of mr. North
and some I can certainly say that
because it's true you considered at the
same time as you say that apparently
there were other things hidden before it
came to light they still do you're still
going look the the information the
formation on the the us sale of arms to
Iran Israel was public in the early
1980s it's just that nothing was done
with it it was public and if people
wanted to really dig they could find it
out like I found it out and in fact
wrote about it well I've been running
very hard in fact he could do it rather
easily but it was nevertheless
suppressed in the sense that it was not
part of public consciousness it was just
a little tidbits here and there from
what you could put together the cool
happening as far as the sale of the
illegal supply of arms in violation of
the Congressional legislation there was
enough information around but put
together that that was happening and
even to identify it as being organized
by Colonel North out of the White House
well fact as I say 1985 nevertheless
although there's a level at which the
facts were there there's a much more
important level in which the
consciousness wasn't there because these
were bits and you can't expect people to
deal with the world in the manner of
researchers trying to penetrate the
deceit of a propaganda system no doubt
you can do it if you really put your
mind to it
but it's not there unless you see it in
a headline so how could they cope with
it by people like you by reading people
like exactly the thing is how many oh
they're people like you what do you
think's together not some and the ones
who were there are fantastic demand so
how do the American people stay without
people like you seems that they're dumb
you know there's nothing dumb I love
words I mean there are many people who
are very well informed
much better informed than the press for
example if you read letters to the
editors columns in newspapers around the
country you quite typically find more
informed commentary about Central
America than you'll find in
the real columns and the opinion columns
and in the founded themselves from
ordinary people but you said that the
information was easy to begin it was the
press get the information without easy
is there any word for it you know it's
if you're willing to relieve like for
example I found out about the arms lift
I ran by reading transcripts of the BBC
and by reading an interview somewhere
with an Israeli ambassador in one city
and reading something else in the
Israeli press no ok the information it's
there but it's there to fanatic you know
somebody who wants to spend a
substantial part of their time and
energy exploring it and comparing
today's lies with yesterday's leaks and
so on that's a researcher and it's you
know it just simply doesn't make any
sense to ask the general population to
dedicate themselves to this task on
every issue
so the information was there and since
but it was hidden in a much more
important sense now in October 1986 when
the plane was shot down and a mercenary
was captured then it's impossible to
keep it quiet so something came out in
the real sense meaning headlines you
know something that people could see
well at that point begins you could
predict begins the cover-up operation
the cover-up operation is an effort to
narrow the scope of the inquiry so that
it does not reach issues of
institutional structure so that people
don't really understand what's happening
what you want to do is demonstrate that
there's one that there's an individual
who's at fault maybe because he's a
crook or maybe because he's overzealous
or too much of a patriot or whatever it
may be just let's focus it on is the
basics to the CIA wouldn't be let's
focus it all right sometimes you say
well if the CIA is out of control but
anything except saying that what's true
that these are long-term plans which
being carried out for reasons so for
example throughout the entire
iran-contra hearings the popular I mean
if you could think about it you could
figure it out but no one ever said
a very obvious thing why did the Reagan
administration why was it forced to such
extraordinary clandestine terror
operations the United the United States
in the 1980s set up an international
terror network of a novel kind it's
important to understand the other
countries hire terrorists the United
States hired terrorist States if you
look at what came out in the iran-contra
hearings there was a network of
mercenary states Taiwan South Korea
Israel Saudi Arabia is a funder and so
on well integrated in a complicated way
to carry out a terrorist attack against
Nicaragua that's something new in
history why did something new in history
in the annals of international terrorism
develop in the 1980's well there's
several reasons one crucial reason is
because the population was so dissident
that the government was driven
underground and it was driven
underground it was therefore had to
carry out the activities in a secret
from the public of course known to
Congress and the media well that's a
very important insight for the American
people to understand important for them
to understand that their government
regards them as an intern and that if
they're too dissident their government
is going to go underground and carry out
clandestine terror operations on a
massive scale
but you know as I say think it through
you can see these things but to ask
people think it through is difficult but
at the risk of being rebuked by you for
personalizing two things too much I mean
there was a president who happened to be
a person as priority was a president of
the United States one of the things that
was important at a time was whether he
was informed a lot and and although you
say that there was so much information
flowing round and around one thing
wasn't made clear at all that was the
position of the President and debt was
rather important for an American I think
now I think that again as a host
sometimes it does you see there's a kind
of an open secret that most American
citizens understand but the educated
classes try to conceal
and the open secret is that Ronald
Reagan was a formal executive the United
States effectively didn't have an
executive for the last eight years and
the population would analyze did it they
voted for him well a minority of them
about twenty-eight thirty percent of the
electorate voted for him twice if you
look closely you'll discover that of the
people who vote let's take the 1984
election where he won he got about a
little over 30% of the vote of the
people who voted for him by about three
to two they were they hoped that his
program would not be inactive I think I
think it's not the wrong reasons I think
the population recognized what the
educated classes refused to concede what
they're electing a symbolic figure it's
of no interest whether the symbol in
England let's say it's of no particular
interest whether the Queen of England
knows what government policies are the
same thing yes but you see leading a
party we like to be able to accept I
think the important thing to understand
is that there was a sort of an
innovation in democratic theory that
took place in the 1980s in the United
States
namely a symbolic figure was elected to
the executive office that's a
magnificent way to marginalize the
population every day the New York Times
when your printer named Reagan remember
this is the president you vote for fund
I mean it says run it because we didn't
have a chart which would disclose fun
it's not fun I mean it's it's very
serious one of the way one of the ways
of marginalizing the population is by
depriving the formal mechanisms of
substance no you have to pretend that
their substance therefore there was a
great deal of focus on exactly the issue
you raised did the president know
or did he remember that there had been
such and such a problem most of the
population didn't care because I knew it
didn't matter whether the president was
informed I mean the president they
understand that the president is someone
who looks at the teleprompter and
reaches lines and incidentally in
retrospect the media admit this notice
what happened to Ronald Reagan after he
had done his job namely reading his
lines and smiling and throwing a few
jokes for eight years he disappeared so
for example at the recent North trial it
was revealed that he would be reelected
to show for years it was revealed at the
North Laurel that Reagan had the words
that came out of his mouth who had been
false nobody even cared because his role
was finished he played a symbolic role
it's now over he can enjoy himself in
California that's exactly what I mean he
was a he should have been taken
seriously what he was in order to know
what was going on I mean high officials
that he picked administered his cabinet
that he paid they could be easily
changed follow people's except that we
see we haven't good deal of information
about what people knew by now a lot of
information has come out at the trials
and so on and that George Shultz and
Caspar Weinberger and William Casey and
Elliott Abrams and many others knew very
well what they were doing occasionally
they would inform Ronald Reagan and
sometimes he would sit in on a meeting
and so on but there's no believe that he
played any decision-making role in this
of any significance that's part of the
mythology he was there in order to
marginalize the population and much of
the population is well aware of this and
by now it's even pretty well conceded I
don't I don't get you really let me put
it this way there is a President of the
United States voted in by a minority of
the Ronald Reagan accepted a certain
role yeah
his role was to read the lines that were
written for him by the rich voice that's
what he's done all the excuse I'm not
giving anybody Thanks
there's no excuse there's a description
let's give an accurate description the
accurate description is
he had only the dimmest understanding
and knowledge of what policy were he
delegated he was he was playing a role
that he was assigned to play but the
Queen of England opens Parliament by
reading a political program there's a
costume movie that's just something
different a system yeah let's see what's
interesting about the 1980s is that the
United States moved a step towards a
constitutional manner that didn't
declare themselves it yeah and that's
and therefore what you want to do is
help people understand what is happening
whatever the words may be whatever the
words may be certain things are
happening and one of the things that's
happening is there was a distancing of
the formal act of signing annex every
four years from the actual decision
making now that there's always been a
distance but the distance moved a step
further in the 1980s and that's
important to understand I should say
that much of the population understood
it quite well did you allow yourself
usually I mean I you know voting is a
matter of yes sometimes because expect
something from the American president
well I think there's marginal you know
there's sort of 10 30 differences
between the parties I mean in effect
you've got two factions of the business
party I mean to see how exactly what
this means look at the take a look at
the programs of the two parties in let's
take the 1984 the 1988 election there
were no issues everyone agrees so let's
take the 1984 election where there were
some issues what were the issues well
the Republicans were essentially the
party of Keynesian growth they said
let's keep up the big government
spending the growth of big government
massive intervention in the economy and
a law workout the Democrats were the
party of fiscal conservatism they said
look we're getting into real problems
too much of a budget deficit too much of
if you pick the issue and aside from
some statistical blips now and then the
population was strongly opposed to the
Reagan policies and for various
historical and other reasons where the
population I mean the majority
for example take care enough I mean well
you know care how do you there's no
measure of care but pick the issue so
let's take say military versus social
spending the population preferred social
spending to military spending by large
margins in fact the majority of the
population was even willing to accept
higher taxes which is unusual
if they're used for welfare education
the environment and so on
now while this was true of the majority
of the population margins were rather
large incidentally the Democrats and
Republicans combined on dismantling much
of the welfare state and turning the
funding to armaments which is basically
a subsidy to high technology industry
that was countered to the popular will
and there was a marginal process in my
view there was a slight there was a
likelihood and small likelihood that the
Democrats in 1984 because of their
fiscal conservatism might be more
responsive to the popular mood than the
Republicans on let's take say the Contra
issue which is a major issue actually on
the Contra issue by 1986 about 80
percent of what are called leaders and
polls which includes business executives
and political figures and so on about
80% of them were opposed to the Contras
the Republican administration Reagan but
the Republican administration was way
off virtually off the spectrum I mean
they were pursuing a policy which most
of the business a lead to continue it
for two years so they were able to
continue it but most good bit of the
elite was really opposed in fact the
majority was opposed to it because they
wrote it is not cost so there is no
elite worthwhile cooling in you know
there's look within any a leak there's
always going to be differences of
opinion and we happen to have a slightly
anomalous situation in 86 87 where one
segment that happened to be sitting in
power wanted to pursue a policy which
was kind of at the extreme of the
legitimate spectrum now that part that's
why you had the conflict
with Congress and so on that's why you
had the client estimate operations most
of the powerful groups in the country
wanted to carry out more cost-effective
means to destroy Nicaragua they
understood that economic warfare and
ideological warfare and so on should be
sufficient to prevent the tiny dependent
country from surviving it's a mistake to
insist upon terror it just arouses
disturbances among the population boom
you know that image and too costly and
so on no I thought it was important to
shift to the less murderous means of
trying to destroy Nicaragua I don't
think they ever do it at all but I think
there's a marginal difference between
sending terrorists and trying to force
people to starve through embargo there's
a marginal difference there and I think
that you know the small differences in
American policy translating to very
large differences for the victims
it's a powerful kind of and that's those
are the kind of situations in which
political engagement makes sense that's
not because you you can say that
debuggers dildo the power light no their
power
I mean their power in fact that a
rational assessment of their own power
now let's come back to your book for a
moment if you were an urban spook and
what do you really want to achieve you
want to achieve a better information of
people no because you said it's not a
question of information they know enough
you want to do you want to have them
able to put things into perspective on
the basis of the information again how
do you get it when when there is a
corrupt power I mean the people are
corrupt they're trying to to hide
information and at least trying to to
hide their plans as long as possible
this was what you Mahler say and when
the press doesn't have mood and
information at least not the power to
combine things
cross-purposes I think because I don't
agree with a lot of the assumptions you
made for example its viewers well I
don't know maybe we're not not getting
properly but when I say that the
information is there I don't mean a
population has the information for
example information was there about the
u.s. sale of Iran of arms to you you
were saying that it was printed
but let me stress again what I said
before information can be printed and
not be available to people see the
information that's presented is
available to assiduously searchers who
spend a substantial part of their lives
and energy to try to put it together and
see what it means for most of the
population information basically isn't
there so for example when I read
military if you're really an assiduous
researcher you will know that the
Pentagon secretary McNamara
took credit afterwards he was asked by
Congress what was the point of sending
arms to Indonesia that had paid
dividends he said yes it paid dividends
you'll know that there was a House
committee investigation which pointed
out that the connections that the United
States established with Indonesian
military in those years this is how do
the American people get as informed and
capable of putting things together as
you are at his privilege such as
somebody has to do it because you see
look what I've just sketched in order to
understand what was going on in the
iran-contra hearings you have to know
things like what happened in Chile what
happened in Asia
what are the classic policies for
dealing with the government trying to
overthrow what was the Israeli
ambassador saying what was a David Kim
key and Yakov named rody saying you have
to be able to sort of see all of that
and see it put the information together
and say how high this fits into exactly
the classic pattern when you've done
that it all falls together but you
cannot expect ordinary people to do that
work so you asked what our book was
about where our book is about helping
not not really explaining particular
cases but trying to help people
understand
way the system distorts effects so that
they can then compensate for the
distortion in whatever new cases come
along did that understand this it's a
Louisville work but it's a very lonely
work and you don't go out from the
assumption to everybody will read it I
mean I'm not I'm not mocking adultery
but but how in general I mean now we're
personalizing you I mean it's it's your
book okay but this one book maybe there
are three others and on the iran-contra
affairs maybe ten dollars but is that
enough and it's not it's not an
institutional answer I mean how do you
American people in general which have to
do with this situation that you
described array like you said roughly
from the second world war
how do they cope with with the power
their own power that's getting more
powerful and powerful every day is
having it's different so first of all I
think there are competing you know a
society is a complex place and they're
quite competing things developing the
United States as sort of formal in terms
of formal politics there's a narrowing
of the system in terms of informal
politics there's a diversification and
spreading of the system so for example
the country is much more dissident than
it was in the 1960s so the time when I
asked myself the question that you're
asking me now who was in 1963 I was
asking myself what's the twenty six
years behind
well I frankly asked myself at that
point what is the point of my spending
day after day talking to some group of
people in the living room where they
invite to hospital neighbors to listen
to me talk about Vietnam where's the
point of my going to a church where
there are eight people three of them
drunks and two of them the organizers
and one or two other reminds Christ I'd
like that well I mean the point is lots
and lots of people were doing it and
over the years the country changed but
the United States changed in many many
ways it's a very different country from
what it was twenty five thirty years ago
now when I give talks i can assume an
audience first of all a very substantial
audience like it's thousands it's not
two or three people and also a toad
a different level of understanding I
mean the kind I can now talk to
audiences and it's not just me its crew
of others too I can talk to audiences
who understand the world at a level of
sophistication far beyond what was true
in 60s furthermore it's penetrated the
many aspects of life there have been
quite all across the board let me take
an example to remote from this just to
indicate now the United States has gone
200 years since it was founded without
facing the question what happened to the
native population up until the 1960s the
relation of the United States to its
native population was Calvin Indians I
mean there were the Indians out there
you gotta shoot that's the way I grew up
children play we do so okay now in in
fact there was a denial even in the
scholarly profession that the native
population was there it was pretended
even in the scotum anthropological
literature that the Native Americans
were hunter-gatherers basically no
civilization that's convenient belief
because then under English common law
they had no right to their land in the
1970s under the impact of the changes
that had taken place in the population
for the first time in 200 years it
became possible to face these issues now
the issues aren't solved you know but
that's a kind of if you want a sort of a
massive cultural change it's possible to
face events of our own past and our own
nature that's quite important the same
is true say of feminist issues it's
probably nothing that has changed the
cultural landscape so much as the
feminist move very significant in all
sorts of ways well you know that
happened in the 1970s and it was a
result of the opening of Mines and the
questioning and the freshness and so on
that developed in the 60s out of the
civil rights movement in the peace
movement now this has happened in many
many areas as a result and and there is
a lot of dissenting politics in fact
that is let's compare Reagan and Kennedy
I use Reagan in a symbolic sense I don't
mean the individual I mean the
administration take Reagan and Kennedy
now they faced as they came into office
they faced somewhat comparable
situations
Kennedy in Vietnam Reagan in Central
America Kennedy in Vietnam what had
happened at that time was that the
United States had instituted a classic
Latin American style terror stayed in
South Vietnam in 1954 to try to disrupt
the Geneva agreements by 1959 it had
elicited resistance its terror had
elicited resistance by that time seventy
or eighty thousand people had been
killed in South Vietnam small thing it
elicited resistance and the government
which had no basis began to collapse and
then Kennedy came into office now notice
that something similar was happening in
Central America when the Reagan
administration came in the effort to
control El Salvador and Guatemala by
force was beginning to erode it elicits
a lot of resistance things look very
problematic the main base of us power in
Nicaragua had collapsed the National
Guard was driven out despite the efforts
of the Carter Administration to keep it
there didn't look as if that was going
to be control now how did Kennedy react
and how did Reagan react well Kennedy
reacted or simply he attacked South
Vietnam in 1981 creased the number of
American soldiers secondly in 1962 61
and 62 he simply sent the American Air
Force not mercenaries the American Air
Force to start bombing South Vietnamese
villages in an effort to drive actually
they were attempting to drive seven or
eight million people into concentration
camps called strategic Hamlet's to
separate them from the guerrillas when
that didn't work they turned to trying
to establish some government would
invite us in and finally just invaded
outright now what did the Reagan
administration administration came in
the first thing they did in February but
when three weeks after they came into
office they leaked a white paper
official white paper which was a
duplicate of the 1960's white paper it
was an announcement that they were going
to intervene in Central America directly
unusual stories I mean you know the
Russians and that's because of the
popular movements of these periods which
contrary to what stated expanded in the
1970s and expanded even more in the
1980s and function but through informal
politics well and what you see now
compatible with the fact that so many
people don't even bother to vote I mean
what we learn here from a distance is a
total lack of interest a sometimes
complete form of cynicism which is which
one runs the country to what you were
just saying I mean I share your hopes
are you idealist maybe your optimism but
it's based on facts I mean what you say
best effects but this is the impact
based on sense I mean I told you some
crucial facts I think that's right see
it's true the people the voting goes
down not on this voting go down there's
even more significant fact I don't know
how well it's known the rate of
reelection of incumbents who has gone
way up so if you look at Congress for
example the many people run uncontested
there's no contest but in fact I think
I've got the exact figure but I think
was over 95 percent we even higher than
that of incumbents people already in
office won in the last election I think
somebody pointed out that the rate of
change in the political is now faster
than in Congress not see that indicates
what I was describing there's a decline
in the significance of formal politics
at the same time there's an increase in
the significance and scale of informal
policy
I mean people couldn't care less who is
illusion it's not that they couldn't
care less it's a it's a more marginal
sector that much of the population is
just not engaged that's certainly true
but larger and larger parts are engaged
active dissident revolution and they do
things they and you can see the effects
the effects for example are that the
Reagan administration could not do what
the Kennedy administration did and
that's quite significant in case of each
team work here's a major massacre and
nobody
about it because it was totally
suppressed I mean this is a case where
it was literally totally suppressed
reporting actually declined from a
fairly high level as the aggression
continued the reporters we were she was
by division government that was not the
point though you didn't have to be to
get into the country to read the
Australian press or to read the human
rights reports or to in fact look I went
let me tell you the extent to which this
proceeded I actually went to the point
since American reporters would not
interview temari's refugees in Lisbon
and Australia they simply wouldn't do it
because there's no gain in that I
actually went to the point of bringing
refugees on my own paying for them to
come to the United States including you
know Catholic priests and the recent
parentheses and so on hoping that if I
could get them into an editorial office
somebody would listen to them I mean
that's the extent to which it reached
well it finally got to the point where
the thing began to break through it
began to break through into peace
movement circles in two sectors of
Congress it's the only conservative
sectors of Congress there's nothing to
do with liberal conservative here
conservative sectors of Congress general
parts of the population
parts of the press which became a pole
then when people learn what's happening
they become a pole who that's the reason
why these things are secretly enough
happened so that it became there was
enough pressure put on the US government
so they at least let the Red Cross in
now that probably saved tens of
thousands of lives that's not an
insignificant fact and and this is
because of the possibilities of informal
politics even when there's a total press
blackout now there are lots of things
like that and you know you can say it's
not enough well I agree it's not enough
but it's a lot more than is useful not
trying or for
I think there are very few things that I
can think of in my lifetime or anyone's
lifetime that correspond to the having
participated in saving tens of thousands
of lives I you know as I say I'm very
self-critical in fact harshly self
clearly written about this for getting
involved so late but once you can get
involved you can make a difference and I
think there's much more general I say I
think the real if I understand you
correctly what you're driving to is a
more long-term issue well I agree with
that I mean I think that in the long
term there should be attempts to bring
together informal and formal politics
I'd like to see substance in the
democratic system requires institutional
change because you surmises a still many
parts of the world where the Americas
could do harm I mean what we're doing is
putting we're putting band-aids on
cancer so that's sometimes you want to
put a band-aid in the cancer but you'd
like to get to the source - yeah and I
think there are lots of options in a
country like the United States for for
further I think look the meteor better
than they were 25 years ago to ask
exactly this probe to question whether
you consider yourself also as a product
of the media because well all the things
that you said which different of
currying all the time you know learning
all the time about things that you
misunderstood it's not just a product of
the media I mean as for example as
secret government documents are
Declassified
usually three point over year yeah you
begin to learn things you can see how
could I have not understood that the
media make you - do they make me yes as
a person as personality you know they
certainly helped shape me I mean I'm
part of my culture and civilization you
try to develop a critical and a critical
eye but you know I mean just as in
science you know you sort of do the best
you can you know you're always being
misled even just as in science you can
always do better so you work harder and
you with some other people and so on
sure that's like I would like if you
don't want to at the end of the
interview to come shortly back to two
points that
well made you in the middle of storm
sometimes there's the Forrestal question
and the Israel question let's not go
into details please because do happen to
be important yes but I have only one
question before we saw question did if I
explained correctly for it's almost a
professor in Lyon in France he wrote
Buchan are the thesis that concentration
camps hadn't existed and he had a very
different concept of the Second World
War and he failed Jews from most other
historians you came in he was ousted and
you came in with others and came up for
this right to be a professor there and
of course right to speak out they apart
from that you had a preface in his book
which was used and your defense was that
you try to retract that preface but it
was too late that's what I suspect all
right since we have true I mean to the
facts matter or don't they matter of
course let me tell you what the facts
are the facts are that the for example
was a professor of French literature of
Lyon French literature at the University
he published a few private pamphlets to
doing the existence of gas chambers he
was then suspended from teaching on the
grounds that he could not be protected
from violence
he was then at that point a he was then
brought to trial for a falsification of
history the book that you're referring
to is entitled memoir in defense against
those who accuse me of falsification of
history on a matter of gas chambers it
was in fact submit I didn't know if its
existence but it was submitted to the
tribunal basically the court for which
he was tried for the falsification of
history and layer condemned how did I
get involved in this well some stage
along the line I was asked to sign a
civil rights petition as I do thousands
of times as I do for Salman Rushdie
which no doubt enrages the Ayatollah
Khomeini one question it's not it was
the price was always had by
there's case where price wasn't put on
his head was actually punished there's
lots of differences the in my view see
like in in my I do believe in freedom
speech I realized that's not a popular
position around here but I believe in if
CI just as I defended people like say
Henry Kissinger and what Rasta when they
came back although I despise what they
stand for who when they came back when
Walt Rostow one of the plant what a real
worker in the one my view when he came
back to try to get a position back at
MIT in 1969 I was in fact the spokesman
for a group of students rat at the
students they said that if he is being
denied this position on political
grounds we're going to protest me
demonstrate about it because we think
this work room and all has a right to
teach which will have it which will have
quit right if he had been turned down on
political grounds I might have because I
don't see I don't believe that people
who would be turned down on political
grounds but my point is that's a really
controversial position incidentally the
war was going on we were talking about a
man who was a war criminal and was going
to continue research which has been
using know his rights to the very first
was a very clear academic freedom issue
very clear well a man is prevented from
teaching French literature because he
wrote a pamphlet about gas chambers that
is outrageous it couldn't happen in the
United States I should say he was then
brought to trial for falsification
history which even more outrageous who
he would actually condemn which is even
worse
I signed a petition calling on the
tribunal to defend his civil rights I
was one of five hundred summers at that
point the French press which apparently
has no conception of freedom of speech
concluded that since I had called for
his civil rights I was there for
defending his theses I was net which is
absurd of course anyone who knows
anything about civil rights knows that
you're defending freedom of speech for
views you detest there's no other point
yes you could continue with effects for
hours but but there are perfect that
okay let's get to the so called preface
I was then asked by the person who
organized the petition there to write a
statement on freedom of speech yeah just
but now kind of is about freedom of
speech pointing out the difference
between the defending a person's right
to express his views and defending the
views expressed so I did that I wrote a
rather banal statement called some
elementary remarks on freedom of
expression and I told him do what you
like with it at that point first I was
writing his memoir in defence unknown to
me and my statement was added as a a
navi as an opinion it was attached to
this statement in which he defended
himself from you before no but in fact
see I can't I told him do what you like
with it I mean I I didn't know that look
but actually I think it's completely
like for example Henry Kissinger was
brought to trial for freedom of for
falsification of history I would have no
objection to having something I wrote on
freedom of speech attached to a memoir
in which he defends himself in the
charge speech issues your important
crucial thing you know some of the most
crucial issues yeah so when I learned
those are the facts no I'm you know in
my view but now there's one simple
question didn't you ask yourself
afterwards whether it was very wise of
you on your part to act at least like
you were defending him and I never
instead of the right of free speech
because I never acted that way no and
you never defended him as a person I
don't even know that's true you say
people who've done and I realized as
soon as I signed the petition that this
is going to be interpreted by people who
have not yet reached the Enlightenment
we're still in the Middle Ages it's
going to be interpreted as a defensive
of course I realized that I understand
the world but freedom speech issues are
important and I'm perfectly willing but
why did you try at the last moment to
get it back from that's the one thing
I'm sorry about but there's no real
that's about it's nothing it's noise
people joke I tried very depressing in
with that you said it was some role of
Nigel see in fact take a look at what I
wrote a letter which we can publish
stars in which I said look things have
reached the point where the French
intellectual community simply is
incapable of understanding the issues at
this point it's just going to confuse
matters even more if my comments on
freedom of speech happen to be attached
to this book which I don't didn't know
existed so just to clarify things a
better separate them know done that well
I should have just said fine then let it
appear because they ought to appear but
that's apart from that I regard this is
not only trivial but as compared with
other positions I've taken on freedom of
speech invisible this doesn't begin to
compare with defending the rights of
American war criminals to do their work
while that work is being used murder and
destroy when it doesn't begin to compare
with doesn't another case when you mean
on this subject when you still like to
stick to facts which I itself find find
very realistic why didn't it occur to
you that maybe his facts were wrong to
put any other petition that you would
write but understand this question free
speech reviews you disapprove then you
believe in the principle yeah that's
nice I agree but but still I don't
understand your question
when you say why didn't occur to me the
babies views are wrong of course it
occurs like I knew it you know if you
want to read what I said that was the
reason that you finally try to reason I
retracted it was quite different it was
that I realized at some point the French
intellectuals cannot make the
distinction okay between who cares what
I agree and that's why I say I shouldn't
have even retracted everything that's
the one thing that I regret that but I
regret you regret well I regret the fact
that I tried to accommodate to the pre
to the middle to the mean evil character
or intellectually and I should have done
that simply said look if you can't
understand it that's your problem
oh no that's a very difficult position
to make in Europe I should say that an
issue like this is almost inconceivable
in the United States in fact they're
examples very similar to first on
there's a professor of engineering at
Northwestern University major University
who writes books denying that the
Holocaust took place I mean if he were
deprived of the right to teach and
brought the trial for the Walsall
occasion of history that country over
the country because there's a commitment
to freedom of speech and that means
freedom of speech for views that you
detest that's the only time when the
issue arises now a person can fail to
distinguish between defending rights and
defending the theses expressed they have
to go back to the Middle Ages and start
all over again one question or Israel
only one and well I mean not the history
of Israel you even this interview called
the terrorist States you're in the
connection with terrorists you said
interstates like Hong Kong Korea
sorry it is I agree okay so but that's
not the question the question is when
the majority of the Americans with would
regard Israel like it and the majority
of the people who who have a say in
government what would you think would be
the future of Israel so I think Israel
should be defended in fact I've written
about this very clearly well if I find
one most attractive societies in the
world that's right as I've written
despite the things that I've described
the world is a complicated place
a country can be a terrorist State well
it takes it say the United States
the United States is a terrorist State
it also has the highest libertarian
standards in the world
well that's so Israel is a small I think
the United States is doing great damage
to Israel lien for 20 years the United
States has effectively blocked the
diplomatic settlement in the Middle East
by doing so it has contributed to
placing Israel in a position of
continued military confrontation which I
predicted 20 years ago and I now agree I
think more strongly which is going to
lead it to moral degeneration and
ultimate destruction I'm not in favor of
that I actually have an emotional tie
apart from an interest I'd like to see
the society preserved and improved not
destroyed and I think with the
insistence on military confrontation
within the framework of maintaining a
strategic asset and Israel is very wrong
that's why for 20 years I've been saying
the United States should permit the
diplomatic process which it has
repeatedly blocked I could give you the
detail if you like but that's been
happening I would like it a built in
this problem a very last question
we began this interview with the state
of intellectuals intellectually as we US
state of intellectualism aren't you ever
getting tired of being intellectual
wouldn't you prefer to be something else
like professor or something I don't I
mean I don't call myself an intellectual
I have things that I think I can do when
I think of worth that's what I devote
myself to if people want to describe it
the way they do their deepest sense I
think if I would be able to to convey
something like that to would it be very
nice not to be an intellectual with all
the responsibilities that go with it
would it be nice to be a human being
without the responsibilities of being a
human being
well I can imagine that for example if
you're human being and you're a citizen
of a relatively free society and you're
relatively privileged you have
responsibilities moral responsibilities
are basically measured by what you are
able to do
but I don't have any responsibility for
things that happen in the sixteenth
century because I can't do anything
about them
I do have responsibility for things that
I can influence you know in a
totalitarian society where you've got
the you know there's much you can do in
a free society there's a lot you can do
for people like me who are relatively
privileged anymore you can do
so that assigns you a responsibility
that you cannot escape you can say I
don't care you know that but you but but
you you can't say I don't have the
responsibility you can say I refuse to
execute the responsibility that's a
choice and in some ways it's easier in
some ways it's harder don't forget you
have to look yourself in the mirror
every day - and people make the choices
nobody's a saint I'm not I don't spend
24 hours a day trying to help people I
do other things but I adjust my life in
some fashion so that I spend a fair
amount time in fact a lot of time doing
things that I think contribute to
meeting a very substantial moral
responsibility and I think many other
people do also and that's what you know
that's what's led to human progress
otherwise we'd be still you know living
in slave stage I think it's important do
recall - the biggest mistake moral
judgment goes to everybody hi the
biggest mistake in moral judgment I ever
made was waiting so long and getting
involved in protest against the Vietnam
War I should have started it in 1908
1950s that's a still way Leo very much I
mean look at the effect on Indochina
which was virtually destroyed I don't
know if I could have made a bit of try
okay thank you very much
Oh Georgie ourselves letters that you
crave it
and what made a passionate speech
freedom school you know just done
no France had just closed down on the
ground
funny gonna help out good
no expect I need to buy a few beta clamp
tapes
you
