hello everyone this is Michael cross
with unlocked the door radio and tonight
we have an incredibly special guest with
us that being the very famous very
famous professor a very MIT that being
Noam Chomsky and I'm sure most of you
have heard of him and I'm just gonna let
him take over the show because he's he's
certainly more of an expert than I am on
this and hello mr. Chomsky all right
hurry up very good very good thanks I
was just wondering I was listening to a
while numerous number of your videos and
I've shared those with my students in my
regular job and I was particularly taken
with one in which you were talking about
the idea that America always seems to be
on the right side when it comes to
promoting democracy around the world and
you know I guess that's same here with
situations in Egypt and Syria and so
forth and the media always seems to kind
of jump in and you know support this
idea that America is always right Roy's
ones with the white hats were the
exception ones could you elaborate on
that because I just thought that was so
profound it's true there's even a name
for it it's called American
exceptionalism and it's adopt it's a
doctrine which is adopted
pretty much across the spectrum there is
a debate going on about foreign policy
so a lively debate about to say what's
called sometimes the Obama doctrine
every president has to have a doctrine
ever since Nixon so what's the Obama
doctrine well there's a debate as to
whether Obama is going to hold aloft the
the banner of
American exceptionalism the way his
predecessors have done proudly
maintaining that the u.s. is exceptional
or is he going to veer towards what's
called isolationism which is a strange
notion and so isolationism means we
should obey the international law and
accepted practice and and not act like a
rogue state that throws that uses force
violence and thread that will
that's called isolationism but both
between these extremes the debate rages
of both extremes except the fundamental
principle of what's called American
exceptionalism namely what you describe
that the United States is dedicated to
freedom equality democracy human rights
of all good things they agreed of course
that we sometimes make mistakes and our
innocence or naivete or their blunders
but nothing can be fundamentally immoral
or improper that's American
exceptionalism that's accepted on all
sides a couple of comments to make about
this for one thing that there's nothing
particularly American about it every
great power takes the same stand so a
Stalinist Russia prided itself on its
advancing the cause of human
civilization promoting democracy people
froz defending the world against the
fascist forces led by the United States
Imperial Japan and it's right in the
midst of its worst or endless atrocities
you will read its internal documents
they were discussing with each other how
they're going to bring in earthly
paradise to the people of China now
they're gonna in Manchuria the ones they
were
they're going to protect them from the
Chinese bandits who were trying to
disrupt the peace and harmony than
development that they're bringing and so
on the same with Hitler Hitler was going
to and he took over Czechoslovakia was
and ethnic cleansing bring lead
conflicted people of the country under
the cover of Germany with his advanced
culture and advanced technology and help
them develop of Britain of course was so
magnificent that only those who were
really backward the impute ugly motives
to but even the leading figures like
John Stuart Mill advocated this position
France had its civilizing mission I go
back anywhere you like you find the same
thing so it's not American exceptional
it is not exceptional another aspect of
it is that the doctrine is immune the
fact it doesn't matter what the facts
are actually that's even been pointed
out by some of the most well-known and
respected advocates of American
exceptionalism so take for example
Kant's Morgenthau fine scholar one of
the founders of the dominant field of
the dominant school of international
relations
it's called realism hard-headed most
sentimental realism Morgenthau was one
of the founders and he wrote a book
called the purpose of America in which
he presented the thesis that the United
States is unlike all other countries
past and present in that it has a
purpose a transcendent purpose the
purpose is to bring equality and freedom
and democracy and other good things
everywhere but he was a serious scholar
so he looked through the record and he
went he
nice that the United States has
consistently acted in ways which violate
its purpose and then he adds an
interesting comment which is to the
point although not the way he intended
he says to criticize the notion of
American exceptionalism of us
fundamental u.s. idealism to criticize
it on these grounds is like the error of
atheism which criticizes God the gods
munificence on grounds that evil exists
and I said we can't fall into the error
of atheism that means that the doctrine
holds whatever the facts immune to fact
so it's a religious doctrine and it
should be regarded that way it's a
secular religion one commonly
constructed by power systems to justify
themselves to justify their own crimes
and atrocities which are at most as
obama said about the invasion of iraq a
blunder a strategic blunder he was
greatly praised by for that by liberals
to say it's a strategic blunder so they
didn't bother pointing out you could
read the same thing in Pravda in the
early 1980s where commentators who had
their own form of exceptionalism Russian
exceptionalism complained that the
invasion of Afghanistan was a blunder it
strategic blunder should have done it or
for that matter the German generals
after Stalingrad they recognized that
Hitler's two-front war was a strategic
blunder shouldn't have done it should
have knocked off Britain first well we
don't admire them for these stands in
fact we regard them as morally grotesque
but the same stand on our own part is
regarded as highly moral and extremely
admirable so Obama is honored for taking
this position and that follows from the
Exceptionalist
doctrine that whatever we do is
motivated even though we can make
mistakes we were innocent we were naive
we didn't think this through so we got
something wrong I mean even the most
saintly that person or powers has been
making states now that's a with regard
to democracy with you which brought up
it's an interesting case and it occurred
very well with Morgenthau's thesis
inadvertent thesis that the doctrines
are religion so for example there have
been it it's consistently the case that
the United States opposes democracy you
mentioned the Middle East consistently
the United States has opposed democracy
in the Middle East and this has been
recognized internal so for example you
go back to 1958 President Eisenhower who
raised the question with his staff why
there is what he called a campaign of
hatred against us
in the Arab world and not by the
governments which more or less support
us but by the people and the National
Security Council the main planning
agency in fact came out with a an
analysis that documents all been
Declassified in which they explained the
campaign of hatred they said there's a
perception in the region among the
people that the United States supports
and harsh and brutal dictatorships and
blocks democracy and development and
that we do it because we have the goal
of controlling their energy resources
and it went on to say that this is
pretty accurate and furthermore that's
what we should be doing but nevertheless
we support democracy and it goes on
until the present so for example in
recent years there has been exactly one
free and democratic election in the Arab
world it was in Palestine in January
2006 carefully monitored well observed
pronounced free and fair how did the
u.s. react
well it reacted by immediately turning
to harsh punishment of the population
siege support for other brutal measures
for coercive measures sanctions Europe
went long Israel of course was in the
forefront why because they elected the
wrong people they voted the wrong way in
a free election so they have to be
punished there's nothing unusual about
that case we ran it's over and over
again that's what's done in the real
world but to bring that up is just the
error of atheism as Morgenthau put it
you have to believe the doctrine no
matter what the facts go ahead the one
thing that I remember during the
presidential primaries is when Ron Paul
brought up the coup that the United
States backed well actually created in
Iran to overthrow the government that
was elected there and he had be on for
of course his supporters were applauding
but this packed audience just started
laughing as if he had just said
something about space aliens and it
seems that the public and even these
people who serve been better informed
and actually at least have known some of
the history in that region since the
debate was on foreign policy they don't
know and how does the media play into
this creating the situation that it's
always you know this American
exceptionalism and we're always the ones
who are right whether that's again as in
Hamas in in in Israel or in Syria or any
number of other places where we are
actually funding groups that are doing
some really nasty things well it's the
media but also we should recognize that
it's also the broader intellectual
community including much of scholarship
much of international relations and
scholarship and political analysis
not all so there is fringe of scholarly
work and actually a fringe of media
commentary that does bring out the truth
of the matter but it's a fringe and to
that to those who bring out the truth
the response is essentially Morgan tells
that's the error of atheism the truth
doesn't matter so let's take why did
people laugh when Paul stated an obvious
and uncontroversial fact that the US had
carried out a military coup in Iran in
1953
which overthrew the parliamentary
government and installed the reign of a
brutal tyrant the shop probably because
if they knew anything about this
what they thought they knew was the
propaganda of the period and since
namely that of course unpleasant to
throw out a government but we had to do
it to defend the world against the
communist menace against the Soviet
Union and so well you know it's
unfortunate but there was a cold war
going on and we had to defend the world
against communism same with Hitler's
argument incidentally he had to defend
the world against both of us and the
Germans believe that that Americans
believe actually if you look at the
actual facts quite different just it was
the best scholarly study of this has
just appeared a year ago by aravinda
Brahimi on Columbia University the
Iranian scholar of Iran very good book
uses internal documents Iranian an
American and by far it's the gold
standard field it's called the coup so
it's probably then mentioned here and
what it points out is that the Russian
threat was fabricated at the courses is
always almost always pays and that the
reason for the coup was simply pretty
much with the National Security Council
mentioned a couple years later purpose
the coup was to gain control
asure Western control over Iranian oil
supplies that one part of the coup was
contributed to the long-term US policy
of displacing Britain in the region
never Britain had been by far the most
the dominant force in the Middle East
region as throughout most of the world
that changed with the Second World War
and slowly over time that Britain was
reduced the status of what the British
Foreign Office called the junior partner
in the case of Iran the oil resources
had been 100% in the hands of a British
company and anglo-iranian oil in known
the conflict began when the elected
Prime Minister with overwhelming popular
and parliamentary support that decided
to try to nationalize the oil industry
to take over the resources for the
benefit of renting's that was
intolerable and the US Britain first and
the u.s. carried out the military coup
its consequences reverberate to the
present moment
the in order to ensure Western control
but one on one consequence was that
American companies that took 40% of the
British concession this kind of an
interesting story they're on the go into
but that was one outcome and part of the
gradual displacement of Britain in the
favor of us power throughout the region
in fact the world but to know that
requires going beyond the headlines the
you know the op-eds the general books of
the articles and journals and so on have
to really look at the fact and people
don't do that and if they do those who
do would probably react the way Morgan's
out well you know it's just the error of
atheism to point this out in fact if you
look at it around today there's a lot of
its front page topic today the u.s. and
Iran but take a look at it I don't know
about Sweden but here almost all the
coverage takes the assumption that of
course the United States is in the right
and this conflict and we have to
determine whether Iran is honorably
going to submit to us demands which are
of course right so can we trust the
Iranians to really do what we want them
to do now of course what is claimed is
that it's what the international
community wants them to do so the claim
is well look the international community
wants them to eliminate their nuclear
programs
the phrase international community here
means the United States and anybody who
happens to be going along with it
absolute exclude most of the world so
most of the world the non-aligned
countries that vigorously supports
Iran's reference to nuclear to
developing a nuclear program not weapons
of course they said they're not doing
that US intelligence more or less agrees
but to develop a uranium enrichment
that's their right as part of the
non-proliferation treaty and that's
supported by most of the world take say
the Arab countries what you read in the
press is that the Arabs support the
United States and demand that Iran give
up these programs
well the reference is to the Arab
dictators the dictators of Saudi Arabia
and the Gulf Emirates and it's true that
the dictators go along with us but not
the populations populations don't like
you ran fact Iran is very much disliked
in the Arab world but it's not regarded
as a threat very small number regarded
as a threat what they regard as a threat
over well
is the United States and Israel not Iran
however it's considered natural in the
West to refer to the dictators as being
the errors now what do we care about the
populations it's a good indication of
the depth of the hatred of democracy on
the part of the Western democracies that
shows up in many other ways now but this
is a striking one right today so it's
not the international community it's the
US and a couple of its allied the
furthermore if you look at the record
there's time to run through it I've
written about it there have been
numerous possibilities to mitigate
whatever threat anyone thinks Iran poses
or to eliminated fact there wasn't
definite agreement between Turkey Brazil
and Iran just a couple of years ago
which actually Obama had proposed then
when it was actually implemented the US
bitterly condemned it and undermined it
just last December there was a planned
meeting in Helsinki in order under the
auspices of the non-proliferation treaty
essentially the United Nations to carry
forward the proposal for a nuclear
weapons free zone in the region weapons
of mass destruction free zone in the
region well if that were implemented it
would mitigate maybe end that whatever
threat the United States and its allies
think they perceive what happened to it
it didn't take place what happened is
that Israel announced that it would not
attend next thing was what would Iran do
Iran announced that it would attend with
no conditions a couple of days later
President Obama canceled the meeting
giving various pretexts that's so this
strong support worried around the world
almost everywhere but the u.s. is not
going to permit it nor will its allies
as long as it covers Israel which of
course has hundreds of nuclear weapons
and chemical weapons and so on that they
have to be excluded they're a US client
so therefore this very promising attempt
to approach the alleged threat in a very
comprehensive way disappeared well how
did the media handle that well can tell
you about the United States because it's
investigated they handled it by not
mentioning it literally all of this
passed without a mention do the database
search yourself and see that's
subordination to power of a pretty
remarkable kind and it's unfortunately
not that unusual I know your honor I
know you're on a really tight schedule
in the final couple minutes
what would your suggestion be to
listeners who want to know the truth
what's the best strategy to use if you
have this like monolithic media that's
controlled by six mega corporations what
can people really do to find out what's
going on now well people who are
isolated alone they really can't do much
that's how some can but it's part the
first thing to do is to become parts of
organized communities that are
interested in seeking the truth about
these matters and they exist peace
groups others the second thing is to
explore sources that are easily
available to us we're lucky to live in
very free countries so we don't get
tossed into the gulag for writing
articles about these things or talking
about them as we're doing now we can do
it the sources are there the documents
are available and that we can look into
them by now with the internet it's not
even that difficult including
alternative media fringe media in which
these things are discussed about them
read that you can read the professional
arms control journals which do report
the basic fact
pick some research take some work but it
can be done it's even possible to do it
alone but of course much more efficient
to do it in collaboration with others
and out of that can come an activist
program which will overcome the
distortion suppression and misleading
the picture given by the propaganda
system work but it's certainly possible
done in many cases great I'm gonna have
to leave I've got another ok ok ok well
thank you very much and keep up the good
work mr. Chomsky thanks a lot bye now
