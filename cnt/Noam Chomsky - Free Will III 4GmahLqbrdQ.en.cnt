there's big debates about freedom of
will it's kind of striking that everyone
who participates in these debates
including the people who write learning
tomes showing there's no freedom of will
believe in freedom of will otherwise
they wouldn't write to learning tomes I
mean if we're all just thermostats of
some complicated time then what you do
is determined and how people react as
determined so it's the point of the
effort you know no so everyone kind of
intuitively believes it I mean we all
believe that I can either pick this up
for it across the room or not do
anything with it but what is it well it
lies beyond I think you can speculate
about what the core of the problem is
they take a look at human science there
are two concepts that are very well
understood but one of them is
determinacy something determined
something else you know
the other one is randomness if things
happen without anything determining them
and that's about it I think those are
the basic concepts that we comprehend
and it Freeman will just doesn't fit in
that set of concepts well it could be
that this is just another mystery for
humans we don't have the right concept
if some Martian might be looking at us
and thinking how stupid we are why do we
keep the deterministic and random this
one there's obviously that thing out
there that I can't point to because I'm
a human could be and many other things
that seem impossible and might turn out
to be like this I mean once we recognize
that we're not angels we are just
biological organisms and as such we must
have limits but just point of logic you
could not have any capacities at all if
you didn't have limits because the
capacities determined the limits and
then the question comes well what's
beyond the limit
