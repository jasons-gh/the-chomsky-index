for decades the US has maintained an
economic blockade on Cuba now the
blockade is loosening and the small
island nation is reopening its embassy
in Washington DC do these changes
signify an end the Cold War the policy
toward Latin America or is the shitty US
foreign policy a shift toward new
strategy only advancing the same old
regional goal I ask these questions to
internationally acclaimed public
intellectual and linguist Chomsky I met
Noam in his office at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Boston when
we spoke about economic war in Latin
America here's our discussion I know
welcome to the program so on this
discussion of economic war in Latin
America I'm wondering if you can talk
about the historic US interests in the
region many people are familiar with the
examples of Chile and the over the
overthrow of a democratically elected
President Salvador Allende
in 1973 many people are also familiar
with the u.s. role in El Salvador
Nicaragua etc and one if you could talk
about what the historic u.s. goals in
the region have been well the historic
goals go back to the founding of the
American Republic the founding fathers
were quite frank about their imperial
ambitions including the most enlightened
of them like Thomas Jefferson they felt
in the racist terms common in the time
that the superior race of anglo-saxons
as they described themselves had every
right to people the Hemisphere and
remove the inferior of people elsewhere
that goes on right through American
history so the great progressive poet
Walt Whitman wrote ugly racist comments
as poems and statements about
what have poor miserable Mexicans to do
with the future of the human race we
should take over and so on so it goes
way back it's the beginning the first
major foreign policy goal beyond the
conquest of with what we now call the
national territory which was of course
imperialism the first one was Cuba but
the US could not conquer Cuba because
there was a deterrent of the British
they were the beginning me in the
nineteenth century they were the
powerful force that dominated the world
and John Quincy Adams the intellectual
author of manifest destiny and at the
great grand strategist he explained that
we can't conquer Cuba now but over time
he said the Cuba will fall into our laps
by the laws of political gravitation
just as an Apple falls from the tree a
meaning over time will become more
powerful Britain will become weaker and
will just take over Cuba and in fact
that's what happened through the 19th
century u.s. power increased British
power declined 1898 the u.s. invaded
Cuba to prevent its liberation from
Spain
that's called here the liberation of
Cuba and in fact Cuba remained
essentially a colony until 1959 and
within months after its independence the
US began to attack Cuba with a bombing
invasion a massive terrorist war run by
the Kennedy administration which is kind
of quietly disappeared from history
economic embargo and so on so that goes
back right to the beginning 1823 is the
Monroe Doctrine again John Quincy Adams
was basically the intellectual author
it declares that that the u.s. in effect
it declares that the US should dominate
the hemisphere of course the couldn't do
it at the time the US was much too weak
Britain even France were much too strong
but the goal was established by the late
19th century begins to be implemented
the first US invasion of Nicaragua was
in 1854 two Marines Navy burned down a
town to avenge an insult to a Commodore
Vanderbilt rich American who they said
was insulted and so on then it just goes
on from there
invasion after invasion the intervention
after intervention this is the backyard
they do what we want it was stated very
clearly at the end of the Second World
War when the US was really in a position
to dominate the world and understood
that and planners were very clear and
explicit about it and they laid plans
for all of the world and they had plans
were Latin America other was a
hemispheric conference called
and of course everybody had to come in
Mexico in February 1945 in which the
u.s. imposed what was called an economic
charter for the Americas and the
economic Charter banned economic
nationalism in all its forms the State
Department explained that there's a
subversive ideas circulating in Latin
America called the philosophy of the new
nationalism which believes that the
resources of a country should be used
for the benefit its own people we have
to knock that down that's them now all
at the implicit messages the resources
of countless countries belong to
American investors and some made that
pretty clear so George Kennan was one of
the leading planners and considered a
kind of a moderate
simply described the resources of Latin
America as our resources as if our
resources are threatened by
irresponsible Latin Americans then
police repression and is a better
alternative than freedom and democracy
and so on at the end of the Second World
War the US wanted to break break down
other Imperial systems the US was in a
position of whelming dominance and just
like Britain a century earlier when it
was in a position of substantial
dominance it decided that's a good idea
to have what's called free trade if you
know you're going to win you're in favor
of free trade of course always with
reservations in 1945 the US was in that
position so it wanted to open other
regions the way it's put very
altruistically everything should be open
for everyone and what it means in
practice is everything should be open to
us so regional systems imperial system
should be slowly dismantled so the US
could have free entry into them but with
an exception Henry Stimson Secretary of
War said that will exclude what he
called our little region over here which
has never bothered anyone so there we
can have a regional arrangement so we'll
just keep our little region over here in
Latin America and it goes on from there
I mean but if you ask about the history
yes correct to the beginning and with
it's well known to scholarship that and
they post-stall into your us-run
atrocities in our little region over
here greatly exceed anything that
happened in Eastern Europe and fast
forwarding to today the u.s. is is
thawing seemingly its cold war-era
diplomatic relations this seemingly are
thawing the blockade of Cuba the
economic blockade
and I'm wondering what you can say about
this change is this a change in goals or
or the goals the same and it's a change
in strategy it's much more significant
than that for the first time in five
hundred years Latin America has begun to
free itself from external imperial
domination that's something that happens
in the last roughly ten to fifteen years
and it's a very significant development
the typical Latin American country known
as variation the typical Latin American
country has been governed by a tiny
European eyes mostly white elite which
has no responsibility for the population
these are potentially quite rich
countries but there's enormous misery
and suffering and inequality the elite
was oriented towards their external
masters so your capital float abroad
luxury imports come in the sand your
kids to school and you know France or
the United States or wherever that that
was that a typical structure very
differently from East Asia one of the
reasons East Asia developed and Latin
America didn't though it had many more
advantages that that's begun to change
in the last roughly decade or two of the
Latin American countries have first of
all begun to integrate which is a
prerequisite for independence they've
begun to separate themselves from
imperial domination that means the US
and the last century or so and even
begun to face some of they're quite
desperate internal problems with some
degree of success there's regression
failures but some success one result is
the u.s. is no longer in a position to
run Latin America you can see it very
clearly in hemispheric conferences I
mentioned the February 1945 conference
Latin Americans just did what they were
told that wasn't any question about it
2012 there was a hemispheric conference
in Cartagena Colombia which is the one
remaining more or less us-ally it could
not reach any decisions the reason was
the US and Canada were totally isolated
on all issues there were three major
issues one was admission of Cuba into
the hemispheric system the US and Canada
refused everyone else wanted it
the the second was a decriminalization
of drugs the u.s. run drug war is as a
devastating effect in Latin America the
demand the problems in the United States
not there the demand is here even the
supply of guns is here so if I go to
Mexico with the monstrosity majority of
the guns that are collected come from
the US border states where you can walk
into a store and buy an assault rifle
and hand it to your favorite cartel
narco cartels gangster and and it really
is having a horrible effect in Latin
America so they want to cut it back in
various ways and the u.s. refuses Canada
refused
there was actually a third issue though
less salient the hemispheric countries
other than what the United States and
Canada agreed to support our gene
Argentina's position on the Malvinas
Falklands War the u.s. agenda refused so
it just broke down
now the next hemisphere come to the
contrast to February 45 is pretty
dramatic and it reflects the changes
that have taken place the u.s.
recognized that they've got to do
something there was a hemispheric
conference when Panama summit and it was
realized that before that the US had to
make some kind of gesture that would
enable it not to be just thrown out of
the
so Obama made what the left liberal
press calls a noble gesture of bringing
helping Cuba come back from its
isolation so long in fact it's the u.s.
that is isolated and it had to make some
kind of a gesture to keep from being
thrown out of the hemisphere altogether
so we put aside the standard self
glorifying rhetoric here Obama agreed
finally to take some steps towards
normalizing relations with Cuba some
steps of the embargo remains bans remain
Cuban scholars cannot go to Harvard when
they're invited because they're banned
by the US government and so on so it's
still pretty harsh but something had to
be done and that's reported here as a
you know grand step forward the way
Obama put it was kind of interesting he
said for 50 years we've been trying to
bring freedom and democracy to Cuba but
their methods have failed so far so we
have to find some other way to achieve
error by definition noble objectives
actually the means that were used were
terror substantial terror much worse
than gets reported economic blockade
condemned by the entire world the
hostility of a kind that's ridiculed in
most of the world and strongly opposed
in Latin America and now we'll try to
find some other ways to achieve the same
goals which are absolutely nothing to do
with freedom and democracy anybody with
eyes open can see that just look at the
government's US support I mean this is
not even a joke but that's those are
very important changes and the u.s. is
no longer in a position to control the
affairs of Latin America of course it's
still very powerful to can't just
control them there's still arc whose
it's not over so it's just did this
millennium there was a an attempted coup
in Venezuela in 2002 which was beaten
back the u.s. strongly supported it for
the few days of the coup that was a
successful coup in Haiti weakest country
in the hemisphere in 2004 the United
States and France the traditional
torturers of Haiti
along with Canada that simply basically
invaded kidnapped the president that
sent him off to Central Africa refused
to allow his political party to
participate the elections that's
standard procedure
2009 there was a military coup in
Honduras throughout the president who's
had some moderately progressive
proposals he was thrown out practically
nobody supported it except Obama who
refused to call it a military coup which
would have meant ending military aid and
gave a kind of an aura of legitimacy to
the elections under the coup regime by
the very few countries did that and
Honduras quickly became one of the worst
horror stores in the hemisphere there's
now much concern about immigration from
Honduras you know why are people fleeing
on Duras well some reasons the so that
still continues is also Powerglide but
it's not like it was the u.s. just can't
move in and overthrow the government and
it's switching to other means economic
means one of the means is what are
called free trade agreements when a
government and its intellectual class
describes something in a uniform way the
alarm bells ought to go off the free
trade agreements are not have nothing
they're not agreements at least if
people are part of their countries
because most people are opposed then
they're not about free trade in fact
they're not even about trade at all if
you look at the North American Free
Trade Agreement
after that the only accurate words are
North American the agreements has very
high protectionist elements in the
interests of pharmaceutical corporations
media corporations and so on
incredible patent rules the kind would
have prevented the USA from developing
if they'd ever been instituted much of
it has to doesn't even have to do with
trade at all it has to do with investor
rights so the rights of a corporation
let's say to sue the country because
it's taking away future profits things
like that and in fact even what's called
trade is pretty much a joke so if you
take a look at economists I'll tell you
trade has increased between the US and
Mexico
if you mean by that things are moving
across borders yes but when GM produces
parts in Indiana and sends them to
Mexico to be assembled and sells the
cars in Los Angeles the things do move
across borders but that's interactions
within a command economy it's like in
the old Soviet Union if that parts were
constructed somewhere in the Urals and
sent to Poland for assembly and sold and
Leningrad that we didn't call it trade
it isn't and that's since corporations
are tyrannies they don't allow you to
know what they're doing the government
could find out that they prefer not to
there's only estimates but the estimates
are that maybe 40 or 50 percent of the
cross-border interactions are internal
to command economies so it's not trade
it's not free trade it's not it has very
little to do with trade altogether it's
mostly investor rights and it's not
agreements because people don't agree
with it and the effect is pretty harmful
the NAFTA for example is one of those
rare trade pacts
it's succeeded in harming the
populations in all three participating
countries the general populations are
not corporations they don't find the
Mexico for example has had the slope
practically the slowest growth rate in
Latin America since NAFTA was was
established which I read in the
newspapers it's an enormous success you
know but if you look at the figures it's
quite different the US efforts to impose
a free trade agreement for the Americas
have so far failed free trade of course
in quotes there are now massive efforts
underway to globalize this the
trans-pacific partnership transatlantic
partnership we can't really talk about
the details because these things are
kept secret from the populations and of
course not secret from the hundreds of
corporate lobbyists and lawyers who are
writing in the details but they have to
be kept secret from the populations and
for good reasons that was done with
NAFTA too if people find out what's
being done they're not gonna like it so
you have to have what's called
fast-track that's the big debate no we
have to have Stalin's style political
decisions that the government does
nothing in secret then it tells the
Parliament you can say yes or no and of
course you have to say yes and then we
say look we are a Democratic Society now
that's the debate that's going on right
now both with the Pacific and the
Atlantic again it has almost nothing to
do with trade in any classical sense the
tariffs are already quite low lowering
them a little more would have almost no
effect but it the bits that have leaked
out look like the standard arrangements
the which are basically investor rights
agreements of populations are kind of
incidental they may gain something they
mean
that's the current method of trying to
regain as much control as possible over
Latin America but it's going to be hard
for one thing a lot of their I should
say to the detriment of Latin America
that much of their interactions are with
China that's harmful what it means is
that Brazil say is or Argentina are
oriented towards producing primary
resources for China and accepting
Chinese manufactured goods which
undermine their own manufacturing
industries so they are not moving
towards developing sustainable economies
but towards a kind of quasi colonial
relationship which in the long term is
quite harmful the Venezuela is an
extreme case at least they've not made
any move towards extricate themselves
from the oil-based primary product based
economy I think it gets son maybe ninety
five percent of their income though and
that's in the long-term disasters so
there's plenty of problems in Latin
America but there's also great progress
the fact that they have extricated
themselves substantially from imperial
domination for the first time literally
in five hundred years
that's of major significance with all
the problems that remain one major
obstacle is the economic powerhouse
Brazil and Dilma Rousseff was elected
into a new term last year I'm wondering
what you make of these changes and
Brazil as a as a continuing obstacle to
us goals in Latin America well Brazil
for a century has been described as the
the phrase that's used is the Colossus
of the South which would be a
counterpart to the Colossus of the North
the United States that has yet to
materialize but potential
the Brazil that could be a major factor
in world affairs and to some extent it
is under Lula Rousseff Brazil has begun
to play a significant role or tempted to
play a significant role in international
affairs and the u.s. doesn't like it
sometimes it's dramatic so for example a
couple of years ago I think 2010 of
Brazil and Turkey that made a deal with
Iran which would have settled any
questions about Iranian nuclear
ambitions whatever you think of those
charges on the data side but whatever
you think about them this would have
settled it it was an arrangement for
Iran to send its low enriched uranium
abroad to Turkey and in return the
Western powers would provide radioactive
isotopes for Iran's medical reactors
that's basically the terms as soon as
that was reached it was bitter
denunciation from Washington and
reflexively from the media which parrot
the party line how can they dare do this
they're undermining our diplomacy on and
on actually the Brazilian foreign
minister a very serious person so I my
ring was irritated enough by this so
that he released a letter a private
letter from President Obama to president
Lula da Silva
in which Obama had actually recommended
this presumably because he thought here
and would never accept and they get a
propaganda point that kind of you know
passed without very much comment but
this is the kind of intervention in
world affairs that the u.s. definitely
doesn't want they're concerned about now
the BRICS
which brazil is a significant a being
one of the significant members and it is
part of a kind of a diffusion of power
in the world limited diffusion of power
which is referred to in international
foreign affairs discourse as the
American decline that's considered a big
problem you get the journal of Foreign
Affairs his America disappearing the
American decline yacht's true the United
States has been declining since 1945 it
reached its peak of power in 1945
there's been a steady decline since then
in the recent years that decline
continues and presumably will continue
but the u.s. still remains
overwhelmingly the most powerful state
in the world there's no other country
that can dream of having a thousand
military bases all over the world or
spend almost as much on the militaries
the rest of the world combined the
carrying out aggression and terror all
over the place
we have conflicts with China a lot of
concern about that but it's off the
coast of China not off the coast of the
United States the United States is a
victim of self-inflicted wounds which
are significantly harming the economy
and the society in many ways
self-inflicted but with all that that's
since Reagan that's the neoliberal
policies comparable to Europe but even
with that the US remains in in in
realistic terms the richest country in
the world and has enormous advantages
huge space internal resources
homogeneous society no threatening
enemies so on so it's still a position
of overwhelming power but not what it
was and particularly with regard to
Latin America
what are you hopeful about in Latin
America moving forward I think there
have been quite hopeful developments in
the last 10 or 15 years
indigenous communities have begun to
find a voice for the first time in the
countries with large indigenous
populations like Bolivia and secondarily
Ecuador they've had a substantial role
in Bolivia they elected our own
president there are plenty of conflicts
between indigenous people and their the
governments that they initially
supported not so clearly no but that's
an important step for and that's in fact
that's a tremendous step forward for the
entire world it's a kind of incredible
irony that all over the world the
leading forces in trying to prevent a
race to disaster are the indigenous
communities I mean anyone who's not
living under a rock knows that we're
facing potential environmental
catastrophe and not in the very in the
distant future
all over the world that's the indigenous
communities that are trying to hold it
back the First Nations in Canada
indigenous people in Bolivia and
Aborigines in Australia tribal people in
India it's phenomena all over the world
that those who we call primitive are
trying to save those of us who we call
enlightened from total disaster and it
is incredible I mean just for example
every day has new evidence a couple days
ago the IMF came out with a study on
subsidies to fossil fuel industries they
estimate that about over five trillion
dollars a year are given by taxpayers to
the industries that are dedicated to
destroying human existence it's pretty
remarkable on the other hand indigenous
communities are trying to stop this
suicidal race so their increase in power
is of global significance and the
extrication from imperial domination
and beginnings of integration they do
offer hope for steps for thank you very
much for speaking with me now glad to
have the change that's it for this
episode thanks for watching I'm your
