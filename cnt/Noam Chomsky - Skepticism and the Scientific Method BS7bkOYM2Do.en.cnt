if we are so fundamentally limited as
you claimed we are how can we have any
confidence in the evidence this
providing the fact that we are limited a
pure skeptic you can give no answers -
which means that they're not asking
sensible questions we're only interested
in sensible questions the kind to which
you can even imagine an answer maybe a
wrong answer but if you can't even
imagine an answer it may have the form
of a question but it's not a question
like for example if you were to ask why
two things happen okay that happens have
the structure of an interrogative
sentence but it has no answers no no
even imaginable answers so therefore
it's not a question just as the
structure of an interrogative the pure
skeptic if one can be imagined as posing
things that look like questions but
aren't really as to how you can have
confidence well first of all you never
have complete confidence if it's if it's
an empirical issue in fact you know even
even arithmetic you can't have complete
conscience that means no you know you
can have non-standard models of
arithmetic which satisfy the axioms but
are different and so on so if they're in
empirical questions you develop
confident confidence from experienced
intuition experiment and so on what's
called the scientific method but that's
a funny term because there really is
nothing that's the scientific method
like when you take say a psychology
course a program you take a course in
methodology but when you study physics
you don't pick a course in methodology
there's no method other than being
reasonable you know and learning from
what has been done and seeing if you
carry it forward and so on in fact the
courses in methodology that you take say
in psychology or sociology or are mostly
courses in statistics and think
techniques you can use but scientific
method is you know just whatever way we
have of dealing with the world
rationally reasonably can we have
confidence in it
maybe it's misleading us just as rats
are consistently being misled about
mazes we can understand it for them but
if that's true
all we can do is try to see if we can
use the same rational approaches to see
if we can figure out what the limits of
error intellectual capacities are and we
have some examples in which way I think
can have fair confidence
I like the collapse of the intuitive
intuitively obvious fact that
interaction requires contact
