good afternoon thank you for accepting
this conversation professor chomsky
very pleased to be with you hey i would
like to begin
by asking you what tendencies did you
observe in the world
before the pandemic and how the
coronavirus can change
things as we move along
the pandemic is very serious it'll have
a terrible cost
we will ultimately escape from it
probably not completely but enough for
life to go on we're not going to recover
from the fact that
as we speak the polar ice caps are
melting uh numerous other
harsh consequences are developing
which threat do literally threaten life
on earth
and many other species that we're
destroying
the recent scientific article
it was the first one to explore
uh human habitats over the last
tens of thousands of years turns out
humans have
we sort of know this but it spelled it
out carefully humans have managed
to survive in a a pretty narrow
range of the earth's surface
that part of the earth's surface is
heating
inexorably they predict in
their detailed analysis that if current
tendencies persist
the most of it will be uninhabitable in
50 years
that's huge territories all south asia
much of the middle east large parts of
africa
plenty of other areas including the
united states
latin america that's where we're heading
if we continue in our prison course now
at least there's some discussion of this
there's another development which is
equally ominous
which is not discussed at all it's very
hard to break through
the growing threat of nuclear war
and it's it's been serious for most of
my life
75 years but it's uh
no extremely serious because the trump
administration has
thrown its wrecking goal at the
arms control system the arms control
regime which has
offered some security from the
extreme threat that there could be a
terminal nuclear war oh it's
just dismantled the international the
inf treaty
last august it's uh right now on the
chopping bl that was reagan gorbachev
uh it's no aiming at the open skies
treaty which goes back to eisenhower
probably destroy that the
class rebating treaty is the new start
treaty
up for ratification in a couple of
months
after the shortly after the election the
russians have been
pleading for negotiations and
renewal of the treaty the trump
administration says it's not interesting
if that goes that's the end of any
restrictions on
developing nuclear weapons it's an
enormous threat to the united states
and to the rest of the world but the
trump administration
it's important to recognize i don't want
to miss words
that president trump himself is a
sociopathic megalomaniac cares about
nothing except himself so if he do
something to
improve his say electoral prospect
and if it happens to kill huge numbers
of people
he won't give it a second thought that's
not a speculation
we know it so trump is
flailing around desperately right now to
try to find
some scapegoat to cover up the
vast crimes he's committed against the
american people
with his mishandling of this pandemic
so he's searching for someone else to
blame uh
one of his targets is the world health
organization
so he eliminated funding for it
and he and his psychophant
mike pompeo have announced that
they want to destroy it so what happens
if you destroy the
world health organization well there's a
place called yemen
which is the worst humanitarian crisis
in the world
now there are people being saved from
disease and destruction namely w.h.o
doctors medical assistants and others
so we'll kill the people in yemen africa
much of africa is in the grips of many
different diseases
people are being saved by the world
health organization
so let's kill them because it gives me a
way to
appeal to my constituency
who say anybody outside our borders is
awful so let's
get rid of them and i'll improve my
electoral prospect
is the word sociopathic megalomaniac
too strong i don't think so
nor is it too strong for somebody who's
in the
service of the fossil fuel industries
other major
corporate industries he's their servant
they're his constituency so fine let's
destroy the prospects for human life you
want to see this
enacted dramatically
take a look at the president's budget
not many people have done that
very worthwhile so on february 10th
the government released its annual
budget proposal for the next year
the pandemic is raging trump is claiming
it's only a cold don't worry about it
but the pandemic is raging killing
thousands of americans many others
here comes the budget proposal let's
defund the center for disease control
something which trump has been doing
every year in his term
let's defund it further let's defund
health-related components of the
government let's
increase subsidies to the fossil fuel
industries
to help them destroy the world
down a couple of generations hence
what's the right word for that i can't
find one
so i think nothing we could say is too
strong
that's the administration of the most
powerful country in the world
it's causing enormous damage everywhere
including to the united states
it's benefiting some corporate profits
are
going through the roof the richer
happier than ever
when president trump gave his
keynote address at the davos
switzerland meeting last january as you
know every
january the the ones who were called the
masters of mankind
ceos of major corporations major media
and so on they go to a
ski resort in switzerland davos they
go skiing half parties and
congratulating one another
um how wonderful they are and so on
that's an annual meeting
so they opened with actually two keynote
addresses
they're very interesting they should be
played
in every school in every public meeting
on every television station they tell us
a great deal about the world
the first speech was of course donald
trump
the chief master of the universe now the
people at davos don't like
him he's vulgar uh he's uh
pretentious he's megalomaniac he
he disturbs their image that they
try to construct about themselves as
being
gentlemen and ladies you know nice
people
civilized and so on so they don't like
it but they gave him
rousing applause after a rant about
how great he is and how terrible
everyone else is an embarrassing grant
why because they understand something
that matters
they know that donald trump can
rant and brave and do whatever he likes
but he understands the main
point pour dollars into the
pockets of the rich and powerful and as
long as he understands that
they'll tolerate his antics that was
trump
then came the second talk greta thunder
17 year old girl quiet simple
talk factual accurate
ending up by looking at the crowd and
saying
you're betraying us you've stolen our
childhood
that's the world in which we live that
epitomizes
two forces one
not an extreme but
nevertheless symbolic
sure how do you think
trump's handling of the pandemic will
hurt him in the november elections and
particularly this attack
on the on the international corporation
you have referred to the world health
organization
but he is also attacking china and
other regions of the world in his effort
to minimize
the the impact in the united states
he's whatever you think of him he's a
clever politician
very clever clever confidence man one of
the best
he has two constituencies
his prime constituency his wealth
and corporate power he knows he has to
serve them
otherwise he's out so he does look at
his entire legislative proposal as that
but he also has to have voters you have
to
accumulate voters somehow so he's
organized a voting base uh which he
understands
uh one of the xenophobic
uh one of the things they they think
everybody out there in the world is
just cheating us out to get us we don't
like international institutions
we're the greatest and so on how do you
how do you approach them by alienating
the rest of the world
okay so let's take europe
europe doesn't like what he does but
they're much too cowardly to raise a
finger to stop it
so take his iran sanctions those are
greatly increasing the risk of war in
the middle east
very dangerous no basis for them
whatsoever
except it's another effort to appeal to
his voting base
europe doesn't like it they don't like
the sanctions
they observe the sanctions because they
may
dislike the united states but they fear
it
it's a frightening country they know
that if they don't observe the
sanctions the united states will throw
them out of the international financial
system
they could act to overcome this
but they're not going to step on the
foot of the master
uh same elsewhere people may not like
what he's doing
but not many are willing to stand up to
the
violence and threat of the global
mafia dawn he understands that so yes
uh actually american corporations don't
like his
uh addicts with china harms them but
they're not gonna
get rid of them just for that as long as
he keeps
enriching them and empowering them
beyond
the dreams of havers they'll let him get
away with it
he understands that very well so he's
damaging the united states
harming it seriously but that doesn't
matter
i mean if you're willing to uh slaughter
unknown people in africa in order to get
elected
you're willing to destroy the prospects
for human life in order to
enrich your primary constituency then
why should he
care about this the constituency he is
worried about
is the elderly he's his
handling of the pandemic is seriously
threatening
elderly people that's part of his
constituency
elderly conservative traditional
you know christian and so on that's a
large part of his constituency they're
getting upset
and he's worried about that and probably
trying to
do it so do something but most of the
can just take a look at the voting
constituency
the core element is christian
evangelicals
it's a huge part of the society in the
united states
probably a quarter of the population
they're solidly
behind him and what he does doesn't make
any difference
because jesus is coming in a couple of
years so what does it matter
well so all he has to do is make sure
that
they get everything they want the
right-wing judges
the right of pastors to preach politics
on the pulpit
whatever they want so they're in his
pocket
white racists who are afraid that they
are coming to get us
we have to protect ourselves they can be
internal foreign that's why the
insistence on this lunatic border wall
one of the things in the budget is
increase the funding for the border wall
does nothing but torture and kill
miserable refugees
trying to flee from the destruction that
the u.s caused in their countries
but let's call them rapists and
murderers and this and that
will defend ourselves against them okay
you run through the list it's the same
so he's got his
constituency under control and
if it happens to destroy devastate the
country
and sooner or later destroy civilization
that's not a not a serious issue
if i may professor chomsky
talk a little bit about the region in
america
peru as well as other countries in latin
america
went with the washington consensus in
the 90s
this generated economic policies that
benefited
and took people out of poverty initially
but we have been seeing lately that
there are
many demands chile a few months ago
and in other parts of the region there
have also been demands for changes
and we have very fragile democratic
institutions
and during the last 10 years the region
has been um exposed to much corruption
uh in in a good extent from from brazil
brazilian corporations
entering into other countries and
developing private construction projects
so what i would like is to ask you how
can the region
um attend these demands without
compromising democracy well
by trying to empower democracy
which is very much under threat you're
correct uh but it can be
reconstituted uh take say brazil
which was a center of corruption brazil
of course had a
terrible military dictatorship that's
not alone in that
uh finally was overthrown a few
democratic elections
uh the world bank a couple of years ago
had a study of recent brazilian
economic policy it identified what it
called
a golden decade the best decade in
brazil's history
basically the first 10 years of this
millennium
the lula da silva years when
there was enormous reduction of poverty
expansion of inclusiveness
much more participation plenty of
corruption
uh in a few years after
lula turned over his
presidency to dilma rousseff a
right-wing coup began uh literally
it uh don't have to go through all the
details but
it was an impeachment of rusev and
the risery grounds and people who
impeached there were ten times as
corrupt as anything they
charged to her the joke uh
moved back to the neoliberal programs
the
washington census programs that have
severely harmed the region
then came the election october 2018
uh my wife valeria who's brazilian
she and i happened to be in brazil that
month
it was very interesting to see the right
wing
the candidate who was almost certainly
going to win the election was
lula again so they had to do something
with him
so he was thrown into jail on very weak
charges now you know they're even weaker
than it looked at the time
not only that but he was silenced he was
not allowed to speak
couldn't make a statement unlike a mass
murderer
who happens to be in jail he could
actually visit him in jail
occasionally people get to see him so he
had to be silenced
then came a incredible campaign
on the social media which most
brazilians
use as the source of their acquaintance
with the world what's up
particularly incredible campaign i don't
know if you looked at
it with the most ridiculous lunatic
attacks on the workers party you know
i don't have to go through them
disgraceful
reach a lot of people people we spoke to
people who benefited from
lulu's policies and they say we've got
to get rid of this
so they managed to put into power
actually a clone of president trump uh
one of the worst in the world who is now
dismantling brazilian democracy
i mean he's now threatening maybe he
could do it to
lead crowds to brasilia to attack the
parliament and the courts because he
wants to get rid of them
because they're blocking what he wants
to do so yes we could go back
and he openly supports the dictatorship
and
he does criticize the dictatorship he
says it didn't go far enough
it should have the military should have
duplicated what argentina did
kill 30 000 people and we'd be better
off so let's go back to that
so there's an attack on democracy you
can find similar things
elsewhere in latin america you know
better than i i don't have to run
through it
but there also are democratic forces
question is which ones will win
you look at the media that's a very
mixed story
you have mentioned throughout your your
experience and in
articles that ideally a market is based
on informed consumers making rational
choices is can this be a ideal be
achieved
well there is a theory of the market
held by
economists they don't consider it an
ideal they're describing they think
they're describing what exists
uh the market is based on informed
consumers making rational choices
that's economic theory okay
uh leave your room
turn on a television set take a look at
the ads
are they trying to form informed
consumers
who make rational choices well
if you bother leaving the study you
discover
that there's a huge industry spending
hundreds of billions of dollars a year
to try to create
uninformed consumers who will make
irrational choices
in fact that's a core part of the
neoliberal system
a huge industry trying to make sure that
you don't make
rational choices because you're
completely uninformed
we all know this it's all around us all
the time
now somehow it doesn't penetrate
our talk about the wonderful market
suppose if you had a market system
a real one what would you see on
television
so suppose fiat wants to
advertise its cars what you would see
is a brief announcement saying here are
the characteristics of the cars we have
it would be combined with a comment by
one of the commuter
consumer advocacy groups maybe consumer
reports
saying here's what we discovered about
this car when we looked at it
that would help create informed
consumers and make rational choices
now it's unthinkable totally unthinkable
it's not the world in which we live we
live in a world of
incredible illusions some of them so
lunatic that you can puncture them as
soon as you open your eyes
okay if you want to talk about the world
in which we do live
first of all it's just it's nothing like
markets
the market system for example includes
highly the world trade organization
system
its core element is highly
protectionist elements very much
anti-market elements of a kind which
have never existed before
which are designed to ensure huge
profits
for companies like the drug companies
those are what's called trips internet
they're called
intellectual property rights it sounds
nice what it is is
extraor extraordinary patent
arrangements
which mean that they can charge a
thousand times as much as it costs
to produce a desperately needed drug
okay
which they do that's why people can't
get the drugs they need
it's worse in the united states than
elsewhere because
the us tends to be more business
oriented than
other societies i mean this is a big
thing in pandemic case
if the main companies are
demanding that if they if you use any of
their drugs
you've got to pay them some
extraordinary profits and observe their
patent rights
it's kind of interesting that the u.s
government
since reagan which has been leading the
way on this
is violating u.s law u.s law
demands that the government ensure
that drugs be available at reasonable
prices if the government has done
taken any part in their development well
the government takes a huge
part the overwhelming part in the
development of everything that's called
free market
the government refuses to do that they
violate the laws
in order to ensure that drugs will be
priced way out of sight that's also part
of the world in which we live in
uh do you see the economic profession
talking about it or the media or
anywhere else
it's right in front of us you can look
it up
it's uh by gold act of 1980
uh which uh there's much more
um if we want to look at the real world
we stop
believing in the nonsense about markets
yes they're there there's an element of
markets around
but this huge government intervention in
the
in the interests of the people who
basically dominate the government
not surprising say take the world 12
trade organization it wasn't designed by
the public
was designed by investors and major
corporations
is it surprising that it's designed in
their interest
i mean if he's pretty naive to be
surprised at that
that's one of the elements of this
what you call the washington consensus
the neoliberal system
from the 80s actually is the
extraordinary
rise in financial institutions enormous
increase
well do they survive on the market
every time there's a crash which they
cause
they run to the nanny state and say
taxpayer please bail us out their bill
down
and that's a fraction of it there was a
study by the
international monetary fund a couple
years ago of the
six biggest banks in the united states
asking just where their profits come
from turns out that almost all their
profits
come from an implicit government subsidy
namely the guarantee that if they get
into trouble
the taxpayer will bail them out now that
goes way beyond the bailouts
means they get inflated credit ratings
they can get cheap money
they can make risky investments goldman
sachs wants to make a risky investment
which will be profitable if it works
they can do it without concern
because if it crashes and the whole
economy starts to crash the public will
bail them out
a huge subsidy that's how they survive
that's the washington consensus that's
the market
the victim suffered uh latin america
suffered severely from the washington
census
went through two decades of no
development
deterioration it's gradually starting to
pull itself out take chile which you
mentioned that's a very
interesting case everyone should look at
it carefully
that was the first experiment with the
washington consensus
1973 pinochet dictatorship came
in overthrew the parliamentary
government
uh the leading figures of
neoliberalism raced in milton friedman
friedrich hayek all there to celebrate
the chance
to carry out a perfect neoliberal
experiment
conditions were perfect nobody could
object
because you objected you went to the
torture chambers to violate grimaldi
that's the end of the objection so
everybody's quiet
uh money poured in under allende
the international financial institutions
the u.s government were trying to
destroy it
so they wouldn't send in a penny nothing
as soon as the dictatorship came in all
the spigots were open
money pours in uh they were smart enough
not to follow their principles uh the
chilean
economy depend on the government in
resort in
funding depended very heavily on kodalka
the world's major copper mine which
is nationalized and very efficient
so they didn't change that that would be
pretty stupid
in fact they had every possible
condition
to succeed in their neoliberal
experiment
it took them five years to totally
destroy the chilean economy
by 1982 it collapsed
the economy was handed back to the
government to
try to salvage the more the government
was in the
hands of the more the economy was in the
hands of the government than
under pinochet than under allende it
didn't change anything
so the main experiment collapsed under
perfect conditions now let's go ahead
and do the same thing
then you get off on the trying to impose
the same rules on the whole world
it's been a disaster all the way through
i don't have to run through it
let's take chile what are the
what are the concept but what are they
demonstrating about
that's very good conditions you know
copper prices have been high it's a
complementary
to the us economy and fruits and fish
and
vegetables export a lot of conditions
for
economic success and to some extent it's
happened but
they happen to be stuck with the
pinochet dictatorship rules
the pension systems have collapsed the
education
systems collapsing except for the rich
health systems collapsing you know
that's the washington consensus they're
stuck with it
uh hard to get rid of it because the
army
under pinochet was very careful to
exempt themselves
from the neoliberal rules okay for you
guys
but we're not going to suffer from that
so we'll get
pensions and health care and everything
else and what the army will do with
popular uprisings well you got plenty of
experience with that in peru i don't
have to talk about it
but the fact is that we do have choices
and none of this is natural law
can all be changed you have been a lucid
observer of
many events world events since
the spanish civil war how do you
maintain optimism over despair
particularly with a media overload we
are constantly exposed to
well let's take this matter civil war
it's one of the experiences of my
childhood yes i can
well remember the uh
franco general who
close companion of franco who announced
in 1936 that our slogan is
down with intelligence forward with
death
okay not a bad slogan for the trump
administration
but it didn't it was horrible
the post franco euro was horrible it did
end
i was there not many years after the
fall of franco happened to be attending
a
conference international conference in
madrid having the
cover mate it fell on may day on may day
i had two choices of which demonstration
to take part in huge demonstrations
the cnt had two demonstrations
major ones well unfortunately that
democratic uprising has declined
but it's still there the world's
improved quite a lot since my childhood
my childhood remembers the early 30s
i was born in 1928 the
germany at the time it was regarded as
the most civilized country in the world
uh
leading democracy you know the peak of
western civilization
and the arts sciences philosophy
the nazi party got three percent of the
vote
1928. the next free election
was 1932. nazi party was the dominant
party
uh then it goes on we don't have to talk
about it
germany went from being the most
civilized country in the world to being
the most
vicious hideous country in human history
then it changed ten years later it's
back not
perfect but you know respectable country
in many ways
uh the united states at the time was in
a deep depression
the labor movement had been crushed
there was no opposition
depression was 1929 nothing was done
i remember as a child going with my
father to a bank where he was trying to
get a
couple of dollars to get by they weren't
giving any he couldn't get anything
my family was first generation
immigrants
unemployed working people looked pretty
grim
by the mid-30s it had changed the cio
began to organize
carrying out the labor movement
reconstructed had been crushed in the
20s
went on there was a supportive
administration it went on to
develop social democratic policies
uh made a big difference they lasted
pretty much until reagan
then they've been slowly dismantled
because the reaction
but overall the country's much more
civilized than it was
and that's true around the world it's
true of europe
true of latin america many things that
were considered
normal when i was a child are considered
unspeakable today
those were the depths of human history
in many ways
but there was recovery not because
not for gifts they weren't gifts from
anybody they were the results of
tough struggle and popular struggle
which succeeded and the same is going on
right in front of our eyes
now let's take the democratic party it's
nothing much i spent most of my life
criticizing it
but it's shifting to the left you take a
look at its
official program read the program
farther to the left than any program
since roseville
it's not because that's what joe biden
wants it's not because that's what the
democratic national committee
wants it's because of the people banging
on their doors
there's been a lot of activism and
pressure
a lot of it under the kind of mantle of
the sanders campaign
but a lot more and the government has to
respond
okay that can go on all of those things
are reasons for optimism
very good professor i i do not want to
take more of your time i really
appreciate
would you like to say a few words to the
young people in latin america that have
will probably listen to this with very
much interest
well i think you should have a sense of
history
it's easier when you're older but you
can do it when you're younger too
there have been very harsh times
terrible times
uh the times of the latin american
dictatorships were
hideous times but it was possible to
overcome them
to make a better world a popular
struggle
mostly led by young people you take a
look at
the overthrow of the dictatorships young
people were in the forefront
working people also uh you can do it
again
and the important thing for young people
to face today
is that they are a unique generation in
human
history they have to make a decision
whether human organized human society is
going to survive
within a few generations it's not
remote it's their decision they have an
incredible challenge
that no generation has ever faced and a
challenge is threatening but also
exciting
means the future of the world's in your
hands what you do
or don't do will decide what happens
for the rest of human life exciting
opportunity
well thank you very much it's been a
pleasure this conversation with you
thank you thank you
