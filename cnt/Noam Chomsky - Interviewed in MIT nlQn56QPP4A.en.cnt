I don't think these of today is all that
different from the youth of earlier
years there are some illusions which is
worth than 80 there's a conception that
the youth of the 60s the rage was very
active involved engaged demonstrations
protests and so on and it's not false
but it was true for a very short period
it wasn't sixties it was roughly 60 70
71 n diseases and left it begin before
that young people very passive the
apathetic American 50s is very quiet
very 60s things people the civil rights
movement the civil rights movement was
something down there racist Alabama
sheriff's things like that
this sewer is extremely important move
pretty narrowly focus and when the civil
rights movement moved from the focus on
extreme races and south up to the north
that got to see them Martin Luther King
did when King is celebrated just listen
to the speeches they talk about is I had
a green hoodie rights in south so on his
very cool said about Martin Luther King
from about 1965 on at that time came
turn to the north and concurrent with
broader issues class issues he was when
he was assassinated he was organizing
the poor people's demonstration in
Washington in fact he was assassinated a
sanitation workers strike in Memphis
move those returned strongly against the
war in Vietnam that part of the slices
mostly excise because it's getting too
close to home the student movement young
people's would
did pick up at that point the foot sign
Vietnam and it was very significant on
the country but I think the major
activist movements came later so the
women's movement for example probably
had more effect on the country than any
other that's mostly product the
seventies the Happy Hooker of the
eighties the some of us hope the global
justice movement it's called an
equalization global justice movement
which is a Croat substantial that said
West 10-15 years and in fact if you
count the number of the activist young
activist probably more now than the
words so the idea that it says are
apathetic passive generation just
doesn't see it all through an embassy
people whether it's integration
Palestinian rights are the uprisings and
at least worker shorts here I'm sorry
so and the different there are
difficulties now that there weren't at
that time and they're not accidental
lydia activism late sixties didn't frame
elite elements so did something that's
not too well known liberalism with the
Nixon administration Nixon was the last
liberal president and his administration
of legislation was enacted it should
carry forward the New Deal Great Society
measures and the really frightened the
business world regulation must work for
operation legislation sporting workers
rights were people too so on all of this
together with the activism the sixties
literally backwards there's a major
effort than that why not to try to
reintroduce discipline at the society
return people that say that was pretty
avert you can read it published books
and articles and part of the concern
with students if you check back you'll
find that that's the time when to
rise by now tuitions of colleges are
astronomical the most states by now the
public assistance station is getting
more funding from tuition Dismas state
governments it's essentially a policy of
killing public education and privatizing
same things happening on the lower
schools major effort to try to destroy
the public school system and privatize
it well you know a lot of reasons
because for one thing that tends to
restrict it to more privileged people
which is beneficial to the wealthy and
for another it's a disciplinary figure
if you go through college you come out
with the fifty thousand dollars and dead
have a lot of constraints on what we
could do in the 60s was quite different
that was a period of the post-war period
40s 56 news for a period of economic
expansion as a vibrant society economy
was growing this growth gear
was pretty gal teri growth suppose went
out there about as well as the upper
quintile there were welfare state
measures funny and stupid a student and
Savior age in city mid-sixties could
decide ok I'm going to take off an
upward years and get involved in this
direction something better now come back
on continue my career you can't assume
unless you're disciplined and obedient
you cut out and it's all posted this one
are measured solutions just one and it
doesn't impose constraints also the job
market overdue that was a growing
economy if you have the chance to go
ahead and decent job choice
so students are facing harder
constraints imposed in order to
institute is over there and to the new
lesson in business IC created to have
any more broad safe back in two thousand
eight and I was watching an interview or
someone asked you what the function of
human being is and you responded that
defining defining the functional person
a human on system but taking it to a
broader scale how do you feel that
society defines the function of students
defines the function of young place
where they want the MP become who you
mean by society if you go to corporate
boardrooms they want young people to be
quiet obedient discipline well dressed
the software make a lot of money and
don't care about anybody else that's
what they want the decimal society that
may be the most common ones with our
they want you to become a happy person
living a satisfying fulfilling life
doing something
please does immediate portray out of
lessons they're responsible out of
control responsible
especially any cameras rolling
is this considered has to be portrays
for crazy sometimes it's funny to watch
remember during period of big
demonstrations and watch a lot of people
showing buses sit on foster dad I
remember once watching the television
description of the fenestration life and
in Boston the local station focused on
one particular girl who had our share
sure enough the Washington television
when they reported on the buses come
again they'd immediately focused on her
that's the idea trying to show that
there's
the atmosphere is
have concerns try to be mean the
concerns of marginalized and make it
look as if kids playing that first
that's the one who would this Lydia
participants the authorities over sleepy
do you think that there's a
collaboration between like the media and
big corporations or do you think that
there's possibly a collaboration between
Mia and big corporations to kind of
demean young people's political
ideologies yes the media are ya champ so
depend to some extent before they're
part of the same Wars do corporate
culture but you know it's not that
different to be academic culture not if
you read back now at work on students
that circle is simply the part of the
same
educated elite privileged cultures but
it's
strong tendency and the media too
exaggerated because they are part of the
corporate culture well we know that
history is kind of showing that the top
from the top 1% kind of one thing fears
is an uprising the base you've seen this
even in America that with the Jim Crow
the homeless and segregation in the
south how is this evident in classrooms
also tying into the subject discovered
the United States is dramatic the last
for 30 years gradient economic
concentration concentration economic
power that's just Skylar we all know
that this wasn't quality that you look
at detail of inequality it's mostly
coming from the top 1% for the top even
one-tenth of one percent that's where
wealth has radical concentrated in
since Reagan and the nuts not perhaps
that's not because of globalization it's
not because of Technology is because of
specific decisions the goat account
power carries with it political path and
if it's ready yesterday they're
predicting with the next election
campaigns nothing's going to get two
billion dollars that means if you want
to be part of political system you have
to genuflect before concentrated private
power nor the way to get two billion
dollars and that's a crossword so with
economic concentration comes political
power and political power means
decisions in government and the
decisions on things like state taxes
corporate governance regulation a lot of
policies have been designed to enrich
and empower a tiny percentage of the
population and marginalize around that
is going on right
bipartisan 6a that there was a
counterweight to distant past the labor
who the labor movement was the main on
our way to concentrate a private power
if where people don't have a lot
themselves but when they bend together
the substantial force so it has been a
major effort to destroy the labor
movement the private sector it's been
pretty much destroyed so private sector
unionization efforts about seven percent
and it's not because workers moment of
the ending eyes in fact that the United
States is I think unique in the best in
the world with huge number of certain
people who want to because we can also
design in situated they have not been
able to store no one is illegal so for
example Reagan who hated they basically
it formed the business world government
somewhat related words and the number of
illegal firings or organizations shop
way
so they haven't been able to touch the
public image yet the public unions were
protected other labels and now this
right now is a major attack on public
unions try to destroy this last remnant
of popular power of some sort of it's a
counter force with concentration it's
coming right in front of us there's a
huge campaign to try to blame the fiscal
crisis and the economic crisis and not
on golden sacks and Citigroup and taping
work of Jason and their collaborators
and government the ones that actually
did it blame it on teachers and I'm
firefighters and police with their high
salaries and tremendous pensions and
kind of health plans and
that the amount of lying is live in
press calm but it's a lie often enough
in a peasant okay and it's happening
right before our eyes so the things that
are going on but what am i that can
record it but not in a way which makes
sense that it so for example what takes
a the lame duck session of Congress as
Obama was greatly praised for his
bipartisanship I push through
legislation operation from both parties
or technically passed through the
maintain was a tax cut there's one issue
in the tax but one home a tax cut for
the very wealthy and that's very well
like I'm pretty well off but I was lower
develop the sort of the tax cut for the
very wealthy that's the only issue
populations would welcome Leah posted
Obama is gay away didn't even try to
maintain to try to use our deposition at
the st. when I was reported that same
times announced that he instituted a tax
increase for federal workers that in
Kuala tax increase they go their fries
which is do the arithmetic
you freeze salaries of people in the
public sector that's equivalent to
raising their taxes take a look the
physical consequences identical to
essentially raised taxes on the public
sector and cut support for that in a
period of tax cut frenzy because they
were being blamed for the ills of the
base pea that early unions which are
getting decent working conditions but
offerings of opposition corporate
takeover I was having a bread this
minute in state of Wisconsin that's
pretty traumatic of the year the same
day that the newspaper 12th here comes
big head on it from page mubarak falls
you know public activism in Egypt go
through a dictator discussions same day
on an inside page the reports what's
going on the state of Wisconsin the
gutter descansen has announced scott
walker booking governor now that he's
going to would the cut hey goat freezin
but he's cut a paid for people in the
public sector that means teachers
whoever cut pay for them end collective
restrict collective bargaining which
means they can't get grades and if
there's any trouble call out the
National Guard okay that's instituting a
dictatorship with a very wealthy that's
an inside page right here not nature or
actually there is participants tons and
spas before purchase some straight
across the country oh it's happening
every day well that's these are policies
designed to meanwhile threaten and
middle ball is literally while all this
is going on the CEO of Goldman Sachs one
of the major Roberts of criminals he
just got itself another 12 and a half
million dollar bonus plus it near more
than tripling of his base our that's
what we're blaming the teachers for
bringing about the economic crisis and
it's good one for other things like the
attacker no public schools try it if you
want to privatize some system as a
standard way of doing it you want to
privatize some system
he funded if you'd be funded it will
stop working properly naturally and then
people be annoying and say oh we got a
crowd of the Dozen candidate powder this
was happening to the public school
system it defunded don't pay the teacher
decent salaries have too many people in
a classroom dump to the obvious things
though a proven system it will start
being dysfunctional then you know that
propaganda about how we have to have
charter schools ascension privatization
except paid for by the public
privatization paid for by the public and
take a look at it records where they
bear my compared with public schools
with a comfortable
but you have a lot of presuming legal
services that just laid the system
higher public education being
systematically destroyed and there's one
of the jewels of us sorry we had first
and but for the best a higher public
education system in normal being
systematically dismantled they claim its
economic reasons without can be true we
go across the border from Mexico it's a
poor country they have our public
education system is down there beating
talks at the National University couple
months ago very good university high
quality for good facilities and salaries
aren't like the United States but the so
lively place with good we're good record
next we have free inversion from staff
students the United States Vania
that's not for economic purposes sort of
disciplinary vs well that's going on
before ours and it's happening across
the board or other means to so you read
that paper suppose we have said about
the Texas good question what you should
be upset about the deficit let's say we
are we're stencil half the deficit
approximately comes from military
spending which is about the same as the
rest of the world combined that's not
for our protection partly pharmacist
that's half the new question is going
out the other half comes from the health
system we have a highly dysfunctional
health system it costs about twice as
much per capita as a comparable
countries and it doesn't lead to good
outcomes Don Zimmer with words of the
industrial Cummings drug price is about
choices
all of that costs is that the pistol is
the deficit is that he kept other
budgets in the Republican budgets
untouchable if we had the same kind of
health system that tropical country said
we had a surplus on the dentist touch
that and it's interesting with the way
the corporate media describing it don't
read the New York Times Washington Post
and so on they criticize Obama's budget
because he didn't go after entitlements
is he got to go after entitlements
that's really not the military budget
not the dysfunction of Elsie's
entitlements or what our entitlements
Social Security Medicare and Medicaid on
Social Security it is one hundred
percent line Social Security doesn't add
one anything develops literal Social
Security's paid out of payroll taxes
important person pays taxes lols life
and when you get to retirement supposed
to get something back that's Social
Security nothing to the deficit expect a
list that puts a major effort looking
Obama to destroy Social Security what
about Medicare and Medicaid and they're
causing problem but there are causing it
because they're inefficient and
expensive in fact
generals far more efficient private
insurance fraction administrative costs
they're expensive Pacific worth of the
privatized health care system that you
can touch the insurers in the campus and
financial institutions so therefore we
go after Medicare Medicaid we've got
that said where people
medical help that's kind of like blaming
the economic crisis on teachers but if
you have effective propaganda and is
this
it's just overwhelming and it's kind of
in its effect on public attitudes you
can see it better than suppose it's very
dangerous that this is going on here
what it announced it is undercutting and
reducing the limited democracy look at
at the same time under much harsher
conditions departure that people
throughout the Arab were over there
fighting for Team others as a pretty
dramatic commentaries
since most kids spend nearly six hours
in school every read since most kids
spend about six hours every day pop days
out of the week for 180 days of the year
how much influence is the nature of
school would have on children Eve you
can answer that
you can have a positive influence on my
experiences majority run experiences
wait for me one effect projections he
has seen in recent years is the the
school curriculum itself is being
designed to discipline not to encourage
learning so if you have to study I'm
sure and through this oughta set if you
have to study to pass an exam and you're
motivated you'll study art essence in
okay two weeks later your credibility I
mean if its enforcement from the outside
of the state on the other hand if you
get interested in some subject and
pursue it on your own that you may not
fit whatever it examines about that
you'll remember and in a good school
that's what's done
that the weather it's kindergarten or
graduate school at MIT like a graduate
school here we're really trying to try
and beat them you want people to be
productive creative fingers scientists
absorbed you don't do it with tasks we
don't have tests may be given to just
monitor progress out of that but you
don't study for the test of what you did
in fact the students respected to
challenge expect to get obviously that's
wrong do this you're supposed to go to
your own direction and that's the way it
oughta been kinder and Ken but studying
for tests is the most maybe's training
for the Marine Corps would certainly not
to turn get educated person than in
Syria Saudi state's education system now
kind of is going more toward a demerit
system for students actually graces I
mean first of all know that person who
could pass the most get the best marks
and the fastest not there's no
reasonably that that person's going to
be the most
creative scientist or artist I think
we're creative it's emphasized why
should we have emergencies in fact you
should be the opposite most resources
should go to people who need help I'm
like when I was kid happened to go
through it do we go progressive school
until about 83 and I remember everything
with no tests no grunting no i didn't
know as because i know it's hip but
nobody paying attention to the locator
sauce to the collects the only thing
when i got the high school I went to the
city that I was in a head to academic
press was wonderful
boys epidemic right the students at the
high school were kids who were planning
to go to college and I once studied
learned so so the teachers which kind of
sit back and watch this senators
I don't remember thing from high school
i estimate down the marks scholarship
but it's like a blanket which doing
around remember was forced on you from
the outside is like pouring water into
remember setting one said I want the
advanced placement exam at the College
in German what a gym so I took over
month
okay best news in senseless thing those
that are fun I'm sure
it's the normal experience of force
education from the outside and I can see
that this nine grandchildren and this
dead teachers are starting to teaching
the other day is done sixth grade
teachers telling me that something
something came up in class and some of
you are interested desk decoration
she had to tell them they can't do it
because you have to study the bestest
antenna
the teacher has to do that on the
teachers crystal students attitudes
themselves the teacher's salary depends
on depends on grading the teachers but
progress than others a teacher
encourages student to do something kids
interested in and we'll learn something
from teachers people that's the system
was being imposed and it's getting worse
how should be performed on Tasha today
at four digit turn into a free education
system where people were kids pursue
their own interests that are accursed
there's watches grant but the teachers
role is just to actually affect the 18th
century was discussed beginnings of the
modern education system and during the
Enlightenment the imagery was we don't
want education
to be like pouring water into a vessel
we want it to be like laying down string
along which the student will pursue that
students own course so sort of give it a
kind of a general guideline here's
something and do it yourself and you'll
learn to stay with it doesn't matter
effectively here is a famous physicist
famous businesses one teaches special
courses here he's not famous because an
impression first freshman class students
asked what we're going to cover this
semester he says it doesn't matter what
we covered it matters what you
discovered okay so there's no fixed
amount that you have to cover difference
you discover something that'll be at
work for yourself
there are several debates of yours being
the subject of the education policy in
the United States and you say this is
one of your quotes and you said in
alternation of be on how has this moded
older generations and that's an
interesting phrase actions on my first
that phrase comes from an important book
crisis of democracy book written read
the sixties it's not written by
reactionary it's written by liberal
liberal internationalists like these are
the people who staff car terminal from
Europe the United States and Japan three
the society and that they were concerned
that there's too much democracy the 60s
were frightening because there was
democratic awakening a lot of people
became active people are usually passive
and apathetic became active involved
that's a danger so we have to beat them
back into obedience and passivity and
one thing they were concerned about was
young people which departed and they
criticized with the coal according that
might raise the failure of the
institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the arm that's the
schools universities the churches
they're failing to indoctrinate the
young properly that's why you see them
on the streets talking about civil
rights ending the war
drugs and so on so we've got a doctor
actor better and that's what you've been
seeing for the last 34 years efforts to
indoctrinate the unfetter and piece of a
liberal prescriptions go over to the
right wing side it's my charger that's
what you see if that's no job but beyond
let's tuition rises all of the stuff
with celebrities and I I guess assistant
is called Tom honest that it's been a
wonderful conversation we've had last
thing I'm basically wanting to ask you
is for this documentary we've talked to
people that have been crying because
they don't feel that they their
accountability counted out students that
they've just given up what can you do
look what can we do what can we show in
this out there e where should we get up
take a look at Congress with Kyra the
conditioner comparably harsher first or
take a look at our own history I mean
say
but take a walk down the halls of MIT
what you'll see is half minute third
minorities informally dressed in formal
relations that's MIT today took a walk
down the halls in 1963 there's a direct
out here white males will dressed
differential doing the work that's many
questions have that happen and it didn't
happen just here a couple or the country
what happened was the young people
decided they did a much more civilized
society
