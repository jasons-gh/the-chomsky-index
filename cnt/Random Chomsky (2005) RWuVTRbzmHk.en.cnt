Lexington Massachusetts februari 7th
2005
well I want to talk to you about
democracy and education and John Dewey
one of the leading thinkers of the 20th
century and you've said of him that he
was someone who's thought was a strong
influence on you and your your formative
years and I know your your parents sent
you to a a dewy I'd school in
Philadelphia what does I mean a dewy
aight school not only that but i was i
taught children and my father ran the
hebrew school system in philadelphia
where I lived and I was run on dewy-eyed
lines and I thought there and we studied
it and so on this is what's called
progressive education it meant trying to
focus on individual creativity joint
activities stimulating projects there's
a kind of a caricature of it which has
nothing much to do that it covered all
the regular materials but with an
emphasis on the child's concerns
commitments creative engagement very
little in fact no competition I didn't
even know that I was a so-called good
student until i got the left it and went
high school and discovered never goes
gets ranked you find out where you were
but it's just a never an issue before
did you have asked your parents what
motivated them to send you to the school
well partly it was they worked I mean
they worked in the afternoons so I had
to be at school all day and this was
actually started there at about 18
months and went to through eighth grade
but the nature of the school just seemed
you know I can never questioned it was
the obvious place to be wouldn't have
wanted to be anywhere else tell me a
little bit about your father what was
your relationship with him and of course
he was you're not only your first
teacher it sounds like your first
employer also well
he was a Hebrew scholar we had a warm
personal relationship but it was a lot
of it was by the time I was old enough
to read fairly serious material he we
would spend every Friday night reading
Hebrew usually traditional Hebrew
literature modern Hebrew literature most
of my daytime activities were kind of
not in the home you know just either
school or streets or something we took
long summer vacations even they were the
work teachers didn't work over the
summer and I know he was there working
during the day came out in the late
afternoon we all went swimming together
and that sort of thing so it was a warm
happy relationship not a huge amount of
time but the time that it was was
significant and meaningful by the time I
was about I guess 11 or 12 I started
getting interested in his scholarly work
and he was just about finished shooting
up a PhD dissertation either shortly
before then are at that time which I on
medieval here uber Marion which I
remember reading also his articles talk
about them and do you think that helped
kind of train your mind in some odd way
and in terms of mastering a complex
language with a pretty dense grammar
things are pretty hard to say it did get
me interested in Semitic linguistics and
I pursued it in fact for suit in college
and probably had some indirect influence
on my getting into the field but can't
really trace it
in a book we did called propaganda in
the public mind just to go back to your
school days you said that my
intellectual achievement was retarded
when I went to high school I sort of
sank into a black hole that's pretty
accurate I getting into high school is a
bit of a shock I hadn't been used to it
was an academic high school you know
kids the the one school where everybody
the boys school of course who went who
were going to go on to college a very
rigorous discipline the disliked almost
every aspect of it i guess but aside
from friends and so on but it's true i
remember very little of it and i
remember elementary school and not
through to high school very vividly
couldn't wait to get out i went to the
local college there was no thought of
doing anything else except living at
home and working and commuting to school
and was very much looking forward to it
the catalog look citing and interesting
but i was disabused of that within a
year or so found everything to be just a
boring continuation of high school and
was pretty close to dropping out in fact
never really went back and had a formal
either undergraduate or graduate
education but at some point you wind up
at the University of Pennsylvania and
you meet was elegant oh this was the
University of Pennsylvania and you meet
Zoellick Harris I met him through
political contacts I guess when I was
about 17 a sophomore just toying with
the idea of dropping out and in fact
spending very little time at in academic
work I think it was probably majoring in
hand ball by that time but we met
through a political contacts partly
mostly my interest which happened in the
by nationalists anti-state wing of the
Zionist movement which I was very much
involved in it turned out he was a
leading figure in those areas
which I didn't know and also in he
happened to be a very charismatic and
excitement electorally quite exciting
person who's other interests were things
that I was also personally trying to
explore on my own anarchist thought that
a Bolshevik left and so on so I was very
much taken with that I suspect in
retrospect that he was trying to get me
back into college but didn't say it
would suggest that I take some of his
graduate courses and started taking them
got interested in it went on with mostly
other graduate courses in a scattering
of fields a pen was a pretty funny place
in those it's not like it what is today
it was a really an overgrown high school
but there was a scattering of extremely
good faculty in different fields you
know one of mathematics one in
philosophy one somewhere else and by
picking and choosing you could get a
pretty exciting education without any
much formal structure and it was loose
enough so it didn't matter and did you
ever actually get a piece of paper a
graduate degree I ended up getting all
the degrees formally but without having
fulfilled usual requirements the
Linguistics Department was a pretty
unstructured Harris essentially ran it
and it was you know his students took
his courses and in a way it was
advantageous to me that the school was
not a very academically prestigious
place so they didn't have heavy
requirements and supervision and so on
you could kind of do what you wanted
least I could so including the your
early years when you were helping your
dad and teaching hebrew you've been a
pedagogue if I could use that term for a
let's say more than six decades what
qualities do you look for you've had
thousands of students what do you look
for in a student what constitutes a good
student
independence of mind enthusiasm
dedication to the field willingness to
challenge and question and explore new
directions and there are plenty of
people like that in fact school tends to
discourage those characteristics but I
think plenty of people have them and did
you ever experience because it's not
overstating that you know you're very
well-known you have a big reputation and
all of that you know students coming
with a certain amount of reverence and
all for you and reluctant maybe to
challenge some some of your assertions
well I'm you know occasionally I mean
it's sometimes true of students who've
come through traditional education zin
asian countries for example you just
don't question a challenge but at a
place like MIT that's relatively rare I
mean students are it's a science-based
University so students are in fact
encouraged to pursue research to
challenge to question and it's pretty
informal relations but much more so than
it used to be used to be a much more
disciplined place my god there as your
career developed starting Lee and
brilliantly in linguistics you also were
getting very involved politically what
did your mother and father think of that
first of all it wasn't exactly getting
involved because they'd been very much
involved from childhood as I mentioned I
kind of drifted into linguistics through
that connection they were well by the
1960s they had to be worried because I
was facing jail and you know getting
arrested and so on and so forth when the
issue of Israel the Palestinians became
central especially after 67 and then
that was just a huge flood of
vilification you know hatred slander
denunciation and so on they tend they
were pretty supportive of my views but
it was difficult for them they lived
in almost a jewish ghetto you know that
was their lives and they were pretty
upset at the hysterical Flanders and
denunciations fact my father even wrote
responses and then he he repressed as
some of the charges and denunciations as
it wasn't easy for them I fact I
probably Sammy consciously cut some
corners as long as they were alive just
to spare them they affect sometimes
you're described as anarcho-syndicalist
and I've even heard you describe
yourself as a kind of old-fashioned
conservative how do you feel about those
terms well do you want to be free from
any kind of labeling well I don't use
labeling much but on I do feel that I
grew out of the anarcho-syndicalist
tradition some of the earliest material
that I read back in the fact even in the
late 1930s and later and I have I feel
that that's a sensible approach to the
general problems of human society I mean
you can't take doctrines and
mechanically apply them but the belief
and workers control of Industry
community of popular control of
communities and interaction among the
economic units productive commercial and
others self-managed self-owned and other
integral communities like neighborhoods
and so on that's sensible basis for a
complex society like ours in that sense
I think anarcho-syndicalist ideas are
quite reasonable old-fashioned
conservative yeah by that I mean I
partly it's personal taste you know
music literature and so on which is my
own business but partly it in this
domain it's a belief that classical
liberal doctrines had a lot of made a
lot of sense again they're not
applicable to the modern world in the
mode in which they were formulated but
the enlightenment ideals that we were
talking about
I think one has to have a good deal of
respect for and should try to amplify
modify adapt them to the modern society
there's been some comment since the
November second election and even before
then that Enlightenment ideas are under
attack particularly in education where
abstinence is being taught but not other
forms of protective sex Darwin's
theories being ignored creationism is is
being taught in some schools textbooks
of being censored is this something
worrying have you been tracking this
well this is a very worrisome feature of
general American culture which is
awfully in our national spectrum on this
in this respect I should say so there's
no other industrial country where
there's anything like the extremist
religious beliefs and their rational
commitments that are pretty common in
the United States I'm the idea that you
have to avoid teaching evolution or
pretend you're not teaching it that's in
the industrial world that's unique to
the United States and the statistics are
mind-boggling I don't remember them
exactly but roughly half the population
thinks the world was created a couple of
thousand years ago a huge percentage
maybe a third or a quarter so say
they've had a born-again experience
there's that again the numbers but
there's a substantial commitment to
what's called rapture large majorities
are convinced of miracles the existence
of the devil on and on and that's these
are strange that go pretty far back in
American history and have not been in
recent years have come to affect general
social uneven political life to an
extent that was not true in the past so
for example up till actually Carter I
suppose
no American president had to pretend to
be a religious fanatic but since then
everyone does it's a part of a
development of my view undermining
democracy that's been going on since the
1970s one method Carter probably
inadvertently I don't think this was
intention but taught the lesson that you
can mobilize large constituency by
presenting yourself honestly or not does
Bible fearing quasi evangelical
Christian or other deep religious
commitment up until that point and these
were people's personal concerns not
necessary not converted by public
relations system into a necessary way of
presenting oneself as a political figure
there has been a pretty conscious
takeover of the electoral system by
essentially by the public relations
industry which is given the task of
selling candidates pretty much the way
they sell local commodities you know and
that's projecting imagery just like on
advertisements and the image of a
god-fearing believing person of deep
faith who's going to protect you from
the crimes of the modern world and so on
has been one that you can still but
there's also this tendency in American
culture toward libertarianism toward
toward more freedom and now is seeing
this juxtaposed with this surge in
puritanism let me just tell you a couple
of things cultural things since I work
in radio we cannot play Allen Ginsberg's
howl arguably one of the great poems of
the 20th century because it has a
forbidden word we can't play Bruce
Coburn song called call it democracy
because he has a very unflattering thing
to say about the IMF or Bob Dylan song
hurricane where he talks about
the unfair imprisonment of hurricane
Carter or famous boxer undoubtedly
happening there are over for one thing
there's a big assault on not just on
freedom of speech and so on in radio but
on universities schools etc this over I
think over 20 state legislatures are now
considering legislation which I suppose
some of them will pass to try to control
what teachers and professors say in
classrooms to make sure they don't know
what they call in doctrine eight
students the sponsors of the legislation
explain what they mean what they mean is
that as one of them put it a tee percent
of the faculty are commies leftists
brainwashing students and their radical
ideologies and anti-americanism and so
on I mean this is part of a kind of an
old nativist strain that has existed
which is now being converted into a
weapon against whatever institutions are
not completely bought and controlled the
university is a pretty right wing but
they're not wholly owned subsidiaries of
the corporate sector and that's a danger
that has to be overcome I want you to go
back a little bit in your memory to 1945
this year marks the 60th anniversary of
the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki and it was just announced that
the United States is developing a new
generation of nuclear weapons better
sturdier more reliable etc you're around
16 at the time of the of the attacks and
tell me about that and then the effect
it had on you the signatories of the
non-proliferation treaty the nuclear
states have an obligation under the
treaty which every single one of them is
valid to undertake good faith efforts to
eliminate nuclear weapons that's part of
the
bargain by which other countries agreed
not to develop nuclear weapons and the
steps that have been taken recently
particularly by the Bush administration
and this is another one are going beyond
non adherence to the non-proliferation
treaty which unfortunately is true of
all the nuclear States but to really
dismantling and it's noteworthy that
this is proceeding side by side with
concern that other countries that are
non-nuclear might be beginning to move
towards nuclear weapons yeah we
certainly don't want that to happen but
for the nuclear States to violate
treaties far more serious and dangerous
and in fact it's brought the world
pretty close to destruction a number of
times and is very likely to do so again
these new steps are quite threatening
I'm there being put in a sort of a
anodyne fashion we're just going to
improve the nature the weapons and make
them more secure and so on but it's very
likely a step towards resuming a nuclear
testing to developing more destructive
weapons and more flexible weapons which
can be used to threaten and destroy and
we should remember that it is official
US policy actually was even under
Clinton more extremely so under Bush to
use nuclear weapons if necessary in a
first strike even against non-nuclear
powers that observe the
non-proliferation treaty those are very
dangerous development going back to 45 I
was I guess it was a junior counselor
and a hebrew-speaking summer camp at the
time I was I guess 16 yeah somewhere to
put you near Philadelphia where we lived
and we just heard the news nobody was
reading newspapers there but you heard
the news about the atom bomb and I
remember very vividly being so EE
shattered by it first of all by the news
and secondly by the fact that nobody
care and which struck me is amazingly
unbelievable but I just cook
often walked off into the woods and
spent a couple hours sitting there by my
self thinking about it well was it
because perhaps no one could
conceptualize what it meant it was just
another big bomb I don't think so and
it's not an unfamiliar phenomenon is it
surprising that kids in a summer camp
didn't pay much attention to the fact
that there had been a atomic bombing in
fact let's go back a couple months
before that in March 1945 there was an
air raid in Tokyo which was worse than
the atom bombs I mean the Tokyo was a
wooden City I was targeted because they
knew that they could create a firestorm
kill everybody and then nobody knows how
many maybe hundred thousand people were
killed in a fire storm you know burned
to death destroyed memory discussion of
that in fact I remember the 40th
anniversary of that past with 50th
anniversary in which a knife reefa 40th
anniversary I yes past with scarcely a
mansion there was big big 4290 I 50th
anniversary the 50th anniversary of
Pearl Harbor came along three years
later 50th anniversary of this huge the
fuss about Pearl Harbor scarcely a word
about this well one final question in in
this session you know as you look back
over your many years of teaching and
activism what have you been trying to do
well the teaching and the activism have
different goals for thing the teaching
is really research so teaching and
researcher inseparable the same activity
and in that the goal is to Troy Michael
at least is to try to understand
something about the nature of the human
mind how it works particularly
interested in language but as a kind of
a window into the nature of cognitive
system systems of thought interpretation
and planning and see what we can
discover about that i have my own
special interest so one of them is to
try to
a topic that has been very hard to study
until very recently and that is to try
to show to what extent biological
systems and I take systems of thought
and planning and language and so on to
be such to what extent their
characteristics can be determined by
very general properties of physical law
mathematical principle and so on and by
now there's beginning to be insights
into how that might be the case pretty
exciting work for me at least in the
last few years in the other domains I'm
is just kind of elementary there's an
enormous amount of human suffering and
misery which can be alleviated and
overcome there's oppression that
shouldn't exist there's a need for a
struggle for freedom all the time there
are very serious dangers I mean the
species may be heading towards
extinction the only I can't see how
anybody failed to have an interest in
trying to help people become more
engaged in thinking about these problems
and doing something about them so I
spend all my time
Lexington Massachusetts februari a 2005
well what accounts for the surgeon
religious fundamentalism in in the
United States for one thing it's not
entirely a surge this has been a deeply
religious I hate these the word but
what's called a religious country for a
long time actually part of the reason I
don't like the word is that now you can
make an argument that one of the most
sacrilegious activities and
organizations that exist is organized
religion I mean it's based on very
strange conceptions about the deity if
if there if there were one they wouldn't
like it but but let's call it religious
but it's been a very religious country
since its origins I mean think where we
now are in England New England was
settled by extremist religious
fundamentalist who regarded themselves
from England who regarded themselves as
the children of Israel waving the holy
book following the orders of the war god
who they worshiped and it is the war gun
as they cleanse the land of the
Amalekites and non you read the
descriptions of some of the real hideous
massacres like the Pequot massacre and
they are just like chapters out of the
most genocide all parts of the Bible
which in fact they were quoting and as
the country was settled a lot of it
moving off to the west was also under
the drive of a kind of religious
fundamentalism with sort of pseudo
biblical origins the Spanish areas were
conquered to under a banner of you know
destroying pape ISM the heresy of paper
ism and it just goes on to the present I
mean if you look but I'm in those days
there weren't cross-cultural studies
done by social scientists but as soon as
they got started it was pretty quickly
discovered that religious belief in the
United States
just unrelated to other industrial
societies typically there's a
correlation between extremist religious
beliefs and industrialization that is
the more modernization industrialization
increases the less commitment there is
to one or another form of you know
religious it's hard to find the value
free word but a kind of religious
extremism and the United States just off
the chart I mean it's like an
underdeveloped society in this respect
and pretty extreme and this has been
true for a long time I mean there's I
don't know how far back it I think it
goes back as long as there have been
studies why this is the case you could
argue and partly it's its origins and
partly it may be that it's an unusual
country so for its unusually homogeneous
for one thing we all talk more or less
the same language the changes in the
recent years I think I don't think it's
so much a change in the level of
religious commitment as the way in which
it's been brought into the political
system so until carter president did not
particularly posture as religious since
then everyone does and i think maybe
we've talked about this i think that's
part of the process of d politicization
and marginalization that's going on to
try to counter the as a reaction against
the democratic thrust of the 1960s which
has led to a huge backlash many things
and one of them is bringing religion
into public life and it is quite extreme
I'm by now the well as you know the
teaching of evolution which is just
normal in every other country is
extremely difficult e'er anna has been
for a long time I remember when my wife
was in college back late 1940s she
techno sociology course and remember
telling me that the instructor said well
the next section is going to be on
evolution and I said you don't have to
believe this but you just ought to know
what some people think I mean I doubt if
that happens in any other industrial
country and this was not the deep south
this was you know the University of
Pennsylvania so exactly what the origins
of it are you can sort of debate but it
is a an element of American
exceptionalism one of many I mean
another one that may or may not be
related to it is that this has always
been a very frightened country that also
goes way back there's also a strange
sense of security here it shows up in
strategic analysis and thinking I'm the
US by far the most powerful insecure
country in the world but it's the one
that feels most insecure so there's a
you know constant sense that we're just
about to be destroyed and this goes way
back there's this interesting book by
historian and well-known historian John
Lewis gatos who did the first fairly
serious analysis of the bush national
security strategy which he approves
everything's good idea sympathetic
account and he traces it back to early
American history approvingly the trace
it traces it back 22 John Quincy Adams
who's his ideal sort of brand strategist
who laid out the major plans for he
doesn't put it this way for conquest of
the continent as would it amounted to
and he uses his centerpiece and the
model for Bush's strategy famous state
paper that Adams wrote in 1818
justifying Andrew Jackson's conquest of
Florida in the what's called the first
seminole war and goddesses
interpretation of this is that this is
this was just to protect American
security
because the Florida area was as he uses
the phrase failed state he said it's
like what we would now call a failed
state a kind of a power vacuum which
threatened the United States and he
cites the right historical sources he
doesn't say what they report but if you
add what the actual scholarship it's
quite interesting he certainly knows it
the main books that he cites which are
serious scholarly work point out that
Andrew Jackson's invasion of Florida had
absolutely nothing to do with security I
mean it was a matter of expansion to
take over the Spanish settlements and
the only security was against what they
called the runaway slaves and lawless
the runaway Negroes and lawless Indians
well the Indians were lawless because
they're being driven out of their homes
and murder and the slaves were flying
away because they want to be slaves but
that was the threat there was this
mixture of runaway Negroes and lawless
Indians the Seminoles called in Florida
and they were threatening us and in fact
there were even some cases where they
carried out attacks on American
settlements with turns out they were in
retaliation
