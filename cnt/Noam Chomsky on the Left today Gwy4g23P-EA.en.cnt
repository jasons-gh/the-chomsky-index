I think they're very great prospects aim
in Europe so when the Unisphere focuses
group in twenty five was just initiated
a transnational list in Europe run
elections which is dedicated to opposing
and defying the brussels autocratic rule
in europe policy in europe is said in a
highly undemocratic way it's very
substantially determined by the troika
by unelected groups that IMF group in
Central Bank and the European Commission
which is unelected they said general
policy in Europe others adapt to it
that's natural and the policies
themselves have been highly aggressive
in many ways Greece has been the worst
victim but others as well and there's a
groundswell of opposition to this which
shows up in all kind of ways as some of
them very dangerous and offensive like
the right-wing neo-fascist group some of
them pretty open progressive the
transnational list is a and all an
opening to try to combat this in a
popular level in a way which will take
what has been good and progressive in
the European Union and a void which has
been harsh and destructive and to
develop something highly constructive
and before we're looking from it well
that's a possible step for I think the
answer to everything but anything but it
is an opening that's available very much
as first campaign is in the United
States
