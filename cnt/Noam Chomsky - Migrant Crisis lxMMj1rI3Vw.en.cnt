how should developed countries respond
to the mass migrations caused by war and
climate change
well certainly not the way they're doing
it
in fact what's called the refugee crisis
is in fact a moral crisis in the west
i mean there are there are countries
where it there are cases in history of
refugee
of migrant crises that are severe in
fact we're
living in such a case the migrant
crisis from europe
eliminated or destroyed the indigenous
population
that's a pretty serious crisis
that's the extreme case of migrant
crisis
today there are countries that are
absorbing
huge numbers of refugees lebanon
poor country as about 40
immigrant migrants refugees lebanon had
nothing to do with engendering the
crisis
but it's taking the consequences jordan
has a huge number of refugees so does
turkey
the united states has practically none
europe has a very limited number
very small compared with its not only
with its wealth but also with its role
in creating the crises
our role in recent years is even greater
so on the one hand you have rich
powerful countries which have played a
major role in creating the crises
and are now groaning because maybe
they'll have to accept a tiny bit of the
consequences
and have poor countries which had
nothing to do with the crisis
which were absorbing the refugees so
that's a moral crisis
it's we have in the united states the
same crisis
with regard to central america that
people fleeing from central america
are for the most part fleeing from
crimes that we committed
and then we tell mexico to
send them back and not let them come
near our border
pretty much as europe does in the case
of turkey
this is not only true of the migrants
from
uh east from uh iraq uh
syria and uh that the levant region
but also from africa uh one effect of
the
uh the destruction of libya
actually initiated by france and
england with the us leading from behind
as obama put it
has been not only to destroy libya but
to uh
and vastly increase the level of uh
human the human disaster catastrophe
killings in libya
but it also opened a funnel for people
fleeing from africa
well europe has a certain relation to
africa over the past
couple of centuries don't have to review
it
now europe again groaning
under the impact of the flight of
people from regions it has devastated
and this is not ancient history it's
recent current history so take the
richest country in africa
potentially the richest country which
could have led
africa to become the flourishing region
congo enormous wealth
it was a belgian colony
the treatment of the congo by the
belgians was
horrendous even by the standards of
european imperialism which was horrible
enough was one of the worst cases
in 1960 the congo did
achieve liberation
they had a political leader young
political leader
very promising very popular
patrice lumumba what happened
the cia instantly targeted him for
assassination
but they didn't make it the belgians
managed to assassinate him first
through proxies and they didn't take any
chances
so his body was cut up in pieces and
dissolved in sulfuric acid that took
care of lumumba
and the congo hoped for independence
then
the united states and its allies
supported a
murderous kleptomaniac mobutu
as long as they could won't go through
the
wreck what's left of the country right
now the last couple of years
the worst atrocities in the world are
carrying out in the congo
in eastern congo millions of people have
been slaughtered in the last couple of
years
one reason for it is your cell phones
multinationals are hovering over the
warring meniscus to get the
minerals that are needed for high-tech
equipment like
cell phones in the west that's the congo
it's not ancient history that extends
over
much of the region so yes there's a
migrant
crisis in europe a moral crisis
and one of extreme danger to the world i
mean i'm
old enough to remember what it means
when
austria and germany have political
parties that are
effectively neo-nazi i can remember
hitler's speeches in 1936-37 and it's
not a nice memory
and that's what's happening uh in
reaction to what's called the refugee
crisis
we have our own variant of it which is
severe and vicious and again of course
coming up in the presidential campaign
