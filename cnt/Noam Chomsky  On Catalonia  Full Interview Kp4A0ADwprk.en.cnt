well done thank you so much for
welcoming us here later to have a chance
to talk to you thanks work here as on
behalf of the some progressive
University of Catalonia as I mentioned
to you he's intent of recovering the
history of Catalonia when workers and
academics got together during the summer
to be able to discuss things as they
that was of course forbidden during the
dictatorship and then when in hunt in
2003 their left-wing parties recovered
government they renew again this
commitment and we wanted to have you
there you could not make it but we still
hope that you'll be able to make it
someday
so I wouldn't which had about you and
also about United States because you are
indeed the best-known intellectual
abroad sometimes people outside the
United States are not fully aware what
it means that there's known intellectual
the United States abroad there's not
appear very frequently in the media
media so when we watch the TV CBS NBC
and mailchannels you are not there and
that many people do not realize that
because the United States is frequently
idolized as extreme it and I make active
democracy and they not fully realize how
this accumulated the life is within the
right state how do you respond to that
how do you explain that well I should
say the place where I am most feared and
despised is a probably left liberal
intellectual circles actually if you
want to see a graphic indication of this
you can take a photograph of where my
favorite
newspaper journal covers which is framed
and posted right outside the door
it's the Journal of smallest the
Official Journal of left liberal
intellectuals American Prospect and the
cover depicts the terrible circumstances
in which they try to survive the
enormous forces that are virtually
destroying them feel like the picture
there are two figures depicted two faces
sneering angry on one side is Dick
Cheney and the Pentagon on the other
side is me you know they're caught
between these two huge forces that's
indicative of the paranoia and the
concern that there might be some small
break in orthodoxy the liberal
intellectuals typically are the it's not
just in the United States the kind of
guardians of the gates you go this far
but not one millimeter farther and it's
terrifying to think that somebody might
do a millimeter farther and that extends
over the major media - so yes it's a
very free country in fact it's the
freest country in the world
I don't think freedom of speech for
example is protected anywhere in the
world as much as it is here but it's a
very managed society it's a business or
in society carefully managed strict
doctrinal requirements Oh deviation from
them and tolerated it's too dangerous
one of the reasons it's too dangerous is
that the political establishment both
political parties the political class on
many major issues they're well to the
right of the population health care for
example which you've written about for
decades the population is to the left of
the establishment has been forever and
the same is true and many other issues
so permitting issues to be discussed is
threatening and permitting a deviation
from kind of a party line is dangerous
has to be carefully controlled so yes a
very free country at the same time I'm
very rigid ideology or anything because
from
outside the impressing that many our
European colleagues in academia see
United States has a very server stable
political system and in that respect
there is one thing that with such a
powerful dominant class equal to four
and hey more critical voices in the
media ask you be afraid of
therefore this terrible fear that
photograph indicates it and the fear is
slight deviation may lead the disaster
it's a typical totalitarian mentality
you have to control everything if
anything is out of control it's a
disaster and in fact the stability the
society is not so obvious so for example
a few and if that requires a lot of
suppression so if they say that the
pentagon papers are quite interesting in
this respect these Pentagon Papers are
not declassified documents it's like
stealing the ark conquering a country
and stealing its archives it wasn't
intended for the public and there are a
few interesting things in it which are
suppressed the most interesting is what
happens that the account at the very end
of the Pentagon Papers that furia they
cover ends in mid-1968
right after the Tet Offensive 19 in
January 1968 which convinced the
business classes that the worst to
costly it's not worth pursuing
but those next few months there was an
attempt by the government to send an
extra two hundred thousand troops to
Vietnam should have raised it to
correctly three-quarters of a million
and there was debate and it's discussed
there and they decided not to do it and
the reason is that they feared that they
if they did they would need the troops
for civil disorder control in the United
States because there would be an
uprising of unprecedented proportions
among young people women minorities the
poor and so on they barely had it under
control and any move
related to the uprising and it continues
you just cannot let the population out
of control they have to be tightly
disciplined one of the reasons for the
extraordinary pressure of consumerism
goes back to the 1920s is the
recognition by the business world that
unless they atomized people unless they
drive them to what they called the
superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption the population
may turn on them I mean right now for
example about 80% of the population
believes that the country and their
words is run by a few big interests
looking out for themselves not for the
benefit of the population about 95% of
the population thinks that the
government ought to pay attention to
public opinion the degree of alienation
from institutions is enormous but as
long as people are atomized worried
about maxing out the credit cards
separated from one another don't here
syrupy serious critical discussion
wealth of ideas they can be construed
another thing that happens is an
idealization of the American system now
with the primaries that they are in
shown as a sign of vitality of this
democracy and here you have or the Obama
phenomena that in some way the masses
are mobilized and putting him forward
that is so country to that reality but
how do you explain these organization of
the American political scene that is so
common in Europe people have the
illusions you have to ask what's the
source of their illusions but it's clear
what's happening and the establishment
understands it very well so for example
there's one day it's called Super
Tuesday February 5th there's a couple of
dozen primaries so big excitement take a
look at the Wall Street Journal
it's a front-page story on Super Tuesday
big headline over the front page is
issues received in 2008 election voters
prefer character issues didn't actually
receive because they were never there
they're carefully kept out of sight by
the party managers but it's true that
they're in the background and it's not
the devoted prefer character voters
would be perfectly happy to vote for the
national healthcare system that they
wanted for decades it's just that those
things aren't options the party managers
were basically the public relations
industry that sells commodities on
television they market candidates the
same way they market commodities you see
an ad on television you don't expect to
learn anything from it if we had a
free-market General Motors would post on
television the characteristics of the
cars they're selling they don't do that
what they do is try to create illusions
complicated graphics famous actress
driving up to heaven or something like
that the point is to delude and
marginalize the public when you market
candidates it's the same thing keep away
from issues too dangerous public doesn't
agree with you in issues so what you
have is the character trivialities
personal issues that is pastors say
something Clinton make a mistake when
she taught for about Bosnia you know
anything but the issues I said the
population just didn't know what the
issues are and this is quite literally
popular opinion in the United States is
a very well study mainly because the
business classes who run the country
want to have their finger on the public
pulse if you're going to control and
propaganda if you control people's
attitudes and opinions if they know a
lot about them so we know a lot about
public opinion and say in the last
election 2004 I think about 10 percent
of Bush voters even newest positions on
anything
not because they're stupid or
uninterested but because the elections
are a marketing system there it's a
business run Society you market
commodities you market candidates the
public are the victims and they know it
that's why 80 percent think more or less
accurately that the country is run by a
few big interests looking out for
themselves so they're not deluded they
just don't really see any choices now
the Obama phenomenon is an interesting
reaction to this Obama's handlers you
know the campaign managers have created
an image which is essentially a blank
slate the Obama campaign is the words
our hope changed the unity kind of
totally vacuous slogans said by a nice
person books for the Fox noise and if
you can write anything you like on that
flag sleep a lot of people are writing
on it their hopes for regressive change
of a basis for it in the campaign as The
Wall Street Journal correctly said
issues receive character that's upfront
but yes it is a popular phenomenon and I
think it reflects the alienation of the
population from the institution's
they're grasping at a straw here's a
possibility that maybe somebody will
stand up for what we want even though
he's not saying so he looks like the
kind of person who might do it actually
it's quite interesting to look at the
comparisons that are made he's compared
to Kennedy and to Reagan I mean Kennedy
and Reagan were media constructions
Reagan particularly he probably didn't
even know what policies were but he was
a creation of the media it wasn't
particularly popular incidentally but
they created the image of this wonderful
cowboy who saves us and so on and so
forth at the Kennedy Kennedy
administration that were more in control
but they understood it they were the
first ruling group to understand the
power of television and they created a
kind of charisma
through good public relations so an
image of Camelot this marvelous place
wonderful things happening the great
president you look at the actual actions
that was for tasks it's the president
who invaded South Vietnam he launched a
major terrorist war against Cuba go on
and I thought he was responsible for the
his administration it was responsible
for the establishment of the Brazilian
neo Nazi dictatorship who took place
right after the assassination but the
ground was prepared by the Kennedys that
led a horrible plate of repression over
Latin America and on and on but the
images there and imagery is very
important when you're trying to control
what dissident population you know it's
not a fascist country that's a bad
analogy but the similarity to fascist
propaganda techniques is quite striking
and it's not accidental
the Nazis explicitly consciously openly
took over the techniques of American
commercial advertising instead so the
you know fuse a few simple ideas stress
them over and over or make them with
glamorous that was American commercial
advertising in the 1920s and it was the
model that the Nazis explicitly adopted
and it's the model of business
propaganda today so yes that the Obama
phenomenon I think reflects the same
alienation of the population that you
find in polls which say every large
eighty percent say the country is run by
a few big interests well Obama says
we're going to change that there's no
indication what the change is going to
be in fact the financial institutions
which are his major contributors think
he's fine so indication of any change
but if you say change people will grasp
you say change and hope people will
grasp and say okay maybe this is the
savior who will bring
we want even though there's no evidence
for sure I think the Obama phenomenon
and the alienation and in him would you
say to be friends let's say between the
McCain administration McCain is another
example of the very effective propaganda
and creation of imagery I mean if a
suppose there was some Russian pilot who
was bombing civilian targets in
Afghanistan I was shot down and tortured
by the American run Islamic fanatic
terrorists there would we say he's a war
hero would we say he has his an expert
and in strategic and security issues
because it was a bomb or bombing
civilian targets wouldn't but that's the
image that's been created of McCain his
heroism and his expertise and strategy
comes from the fact that he was bombing
people from 30,000 feet and shot down
not nice that he was tortured too bad
shouldn't happen crime and so on but it
doesn't make you a war hero or a or a
specialist and the foreign policy that's
all the public relations creation I mean
this the public relations industry is a
huge industry very sophisticated I mean
probably something like a sixth of first
domestic product goes into marketing
advertising marketing techniques and so
on and that's a core element of the
society that's the way you keep people
separated from one another subdued the
focused on something else and explicit
as I say it's all discussed and public
relations propaganda would you see any
difference in terms of foreign policy I
think McCain has made me worse than bush
he's doesn't say much because you're not
supposed to say much about issues but a
few things his head said pretty
frightening yeah that may explain the
sympathy the judo class worse
obama as a way of service talking well i
think you're actually the American
establishment itself was afraid of Bush
bush came under unprecedented criticism
from right in the mainstream for example
when his national security strategy was
announced in September 2002 calling for
Fredette of war virtually announcing a
war in Iraq immediately within weeks it
was a major article in foreign affairs
the main establishment journal
condemning what they called the new
imperial grand strategy and not on
principal grounds just it would be
harmful to the United States and right
through there's been a lot of criticism
and the Bush administration it was a
very narrow spectrum of policy but their
way at the extreme if not off the
extreme of the radical nationalism
extremist radical nationalism and the
McCain is probably in the same territory
Obama very likely would move back to the
center right about where the Clinton
administration was it's called the
Democratic Leadership Council sort of a
center-right grouping not extreme more
pragmatic and its dealings with people
the Bush Doctrine itself is an
interesting example the so-called Bush
Doctrine of preventive war you know of
reason and contempt for even allies and
so on the doctrine itself was not new
I think Clinton's doctrine it was even
worse taken literally
the Clintons doctrine officially was
that the United States has the right to
use force to protect access to markets
and resources I mean it's more extreme
than bush but they presented it politely
quietly not in a way that would alienate
even allies so the Europeans could
pretend they didn't hear it you know of
course they knew it in fact probably
approved of it the European leaders but
the Bush document Bush the arrogance and
brazenness and extremism and
ultra-nationalism of the Bush
administration that did offend
the scent the center the mainstream
center and the Europe so yes they'd like
to see someone more polite following the
same policies no do you see a room for
the left in United States at some point
that would kind of I think this country
would all be able to organizers paradise
I mean if you look at public opinion
which is very well studied it's
remarkable
so I mean on these we you've done the
main work Health Program I talked about
if we had functioning democracy the
United States would have had a national
health care system decades ago public's
always wanted it it seems to run foreign
policy I mean take say you ran you know
the next big issue coming along the
public has a very sever e presidential
candidate including Obama says we must
maintain the threat of force against
Iran keep the options open it happens to
be in violation of the UN Charter but
this is an outlaw State so nobody
comments on that but not the public a
large majority the public says we should
not have threats we should enter it in
through diplomacy public holds that
large majority like seventy five percent
that Iran has the rights of any signer
of the non-proliferation treaty the
right to enrich uranium for nuclear
power but not nuclear weapons and
strikingly a very large majority of the
public thinks that we should support a
nuclear weapons free zone in the region
including Iran Israel and American
forces deployed there and so on that
happens to be around in official policy
and in fact the United States is
committed to it if you formally avoided
sign but no candidate could even mention
this possibility if if the United States
were a functioning democracy in which
public opinion influence policy this
issue would probably be settled many
others too it takes a qubit
I mean for 45 years the United States
has been dedicated to punish Cubans we
have the internal documents from Kennedy
and so on
you got to punish the Cuban people
because they because of what they
their success the successful defiance of
US policies going back to the Monroe
Doctrine 1823 from honor dr. an
established the u.s. right to read in
the hemisphere the Cubans are
successfully defying that therefore the
population must be punished by a very
substantial war of a terrorist war when
concealed Arthur Schlesinger the
official biographer virtually of Robert
Kennedy from describes Kennedy and it
was a Kennedy advisor himself says that
Robert Kennedy was put in charge of
bringing the terrors of the earth to
Cuba now this is prime responsibility
they were fanatic about it and an
important onyx triangulation and or
they'll punish the population for this
misdeed and so there's the public thing
I'm opposed haven't taken since the
1970s about two-thirds of the public
says we should enter into normal
diplomatic relations with Cuba it's just
the way the rest of the world does
but the extremists fanaticism of the
establishment that includes the whole
spectrum here Kennedy is the one that
started won't hear of it no political
candidate will ever mention it and the
same is true on a host of issues so as I
say it should be unorganized as paradise
I think the possibilities for the left
are extraordinary and that's one of the
reasons for the clamping down on opinion
on expression of attitudes and so on and
in fact it is a pretty activist
population so if you there are more
people involved in activism on one
another or serious issue today than in
the 1960s it's just kind of subdued and
there are many popular movements now
which never existed in the past and it
takes a to solidarity movements with the
third world that's something totally new
in the history of European imperialism
and it came from mainstream America in
the 1980s there were rural churches
the evangelicals right from the
mainstream thousands of people were
going to Central America to live with
the victims of Reagan's terrorist Wars
to help them to try to protect them
maybe a white face will protect them and
so on and there's just thousands or tens
of thousands of people actually one of
my daughter's is still there but this
never happened in history of imperialism
I mean nobody from France went to live
in an Algerian village to help protect
them from you know French atrocities it
was it wasn't even an option that we
considered but in the 1980s it developed
spontaneously not in the elite centers
so you didn't find it in Boston but you
did find it in rural Kansas in Arizona
and it's now spread all over the world
so you have Christian feast keepers and
have run in other words or the global
justice movement that developed here was
called ridiculously anti-globalization
these the propaganda says that it began
in Seattle it didn't begin in Seattle it
began in a third world but if hundreds
of thousands of Indian peasants a storm
live far love it that's not a fact if
some people do something in a northern
city that's a fact
so the massive popular movements in
Brazil and India and so on they didn't
exist until a northern city became
involved but it did become involved and
it's now spread over much of the north
as well as all over the zone
I'm speaking about these intent of the
anti-globalization movement has been a
splendid movement at the same time
there's a feeling that maybe it's a
stack and in that respect what do you
think about the idea of establishing a
fifth international or some form of
organization that could come up with an
alternative to when I've taught that at
the meetings of the world Social Forum
which are always in the south and I've
mentioned that I said it seems to me
that this might be the seeds of a real
international and in my view the first
international I mean what was called the
first international was important but it
was very localized
it was parts of Europe and it was
essentially destroyed by Marx when he
couldn't control it the second
international collapsed before the
Second World War the third international
was taken over as a propaganda
institution by the Soviet Union and the
fourth international was marginal
Trotskyite that this is the first
authentic international or at least the
scenes of it not just the world Social
Forum but I think say the Via Campesina
the last time I went to Porto Alegre
Brazil two of the world Social Forum the
first place I went was to the
international meeting of the Via
Campesina the international presence
organization very lively very exciting
this represents most of the population
of the world and it was really exciting
to be the the world Social Forum as well
I mean this is authentic globalization
these are people from all over the world
all you know parts of life interacting
discussing and going back and trying to
implement ideas about social change I
think it will fail it's too early but
its failure will raise the level of
action for the next try so I think it
makes sense what you say that it is
maybe the seeds of the first authentic
international
constituted of popular classes from all
over and trying to overcome the
extraordinary alienation that's felt
everywhere right in the United States
and elsewhere the feeling that the
institutions don't work for us they work
for someone else for themselves
perception which is accurate and if that
can be can coalesce and be organized and
move use the freedom that we do enjoy
that's a very significant prospect well
I think that in Europe is very worrisome
is the Americanization of the European
politics which I assume that is
happening everywhere and even the left
has lost its language for example even
leaders do not to speak about working
class destroyed completely disappear so
there is a war in development where the
American language is now appearing in
Europe and that customers are with the
enormous weakness of the way that
Americanization seems to be paradoxical
because at the same time United States
influence is going down here here you
see Europe that is becoming more and
more American in terms of the politics
political parties have lost its potency
and value rather than political parties
particularly green parties became server
personalities with media networks and
politics became a show a theoretical
show as you said the very beginning
slogans came up without any meaning how
do you explain that at a time that
America is declining United States is
declining the country and political
values and meaning of the United States
establishment is becoming very Dom
that's a large topic but just to sort of
pick a few elements of it if you look
over a longer historical sweep Europe
was the most savage and brutal
region of the world for centuries
establishing the nation-state system in
Europe it was a program of mass murder
and destruction
I mean 17th century probably 40% of the
population of Germany was wiped out in a
war in the course of this savagery and
brutality Europe created a kind of a
culture of savagery and even a
technology of savagery we should able to
conquer the world I mean like England is
a little island off the coast of Europe
but it dominated the world and the rest
of Europe didn't have exactly nice
policies a small country like Belgium it
was able to kill probably 10 million
people in the Congo well this dependence
of course was associated with racist
arrogance as the most extreme kind I
mean it finally culminated in the two
world wars the second world war since
the Second World War II Europe has been
at peace and not because Europeans
became pacifists because they understood
they got it there was a realization that
the next time they play the traditional
game of slaughtering each other they'll
wipe out the world they've created such
a culture of savagery and a technology
of destruction that that game is over
well since that in the second world war
also was a sharp shift of global power
the United States had been the most
power powerful economy in the world for
a long time far more than Europe but it
was not a major player in world affairs
it dominated the Western Hemisphere
there were some forays into the Pacific
but it was second to England and even
France Second World War changed all of
it the United States ended the weapon
the rest of the world was seriously
harmed or destroyed the United States
profited an enormous Lee from the war
the war ended the Depression may feel
didn't industrial production practically
quadrupled the United States ended the
war with literally half the wealth of
the
in comparable security and military
force and planners knew it they planned
for global domination in which exercises
sovereignty by others would not be
tolerated
plans are interesting and they were
implemented Europe at the end of the war
there was a wave of real wave of radical
democracy
anti-fascism you know the resistance
workers control someone was quite
insignificant and the first task of the
United States and Britain and the
conquerors was to crush it so in country
after country Japan as well the first
task of the liberator so-called was to
crush the resistance to fascism and to
restore the traditional order maybe not
undo this even with many of the same
leaders in fact and it was a battle
didn't happen overnight so for example
in Italy Italy was probably the main
target of CIA subversion at least into
the 1970s when the record runs dry to
try to prevent Italian democracy because
it would be a big role for the labor
movement which has been tolerant it
gradually sank in European elites
accepted a position in which the United
States would take over their traditional
role of running the world savagery and
barbarism and they would accept the
gains that come from global domination
and there was some it's not that the
radical Democrats lost
I mean Europe did gain they did gain
measure of social democracy in fact your
Europeans live better than Americans and
many respects they're healthier that are
taller they have more leisure that the
United States has the especially since
the 1970s has the highest work hours in
the industrial world about the lowest
wages the worst benefits of the worst
health outcomes even just height if an
American visiting Europe first thing
that strikes you that Paul everybody is
and it's literally true
so Europe has had many games from this
subordinate position let the United
States take the lead and the invading
destroying mastering and so on and a
kind of a complacency has set in in
which it's almost a sigh of relief after
centuries of savagery and barbarism will
relax and follow somebody else let them
do it and we'll just enjoy them and this
has in a political classes you know
business classes and so on they don't
have an objection to this with what you
call Americanization is really the
spirit of business control so yes
business classes are quite happy they're
closely integrated with a there's some
conflict but really closely integrated
with u.s. industry I mean if you look at
the conflicts that are interesting so so
we're supposed to have a elite ideology
says we have free market in fact we have
state state based economic systems the
dynamism of the high-tech economy comes
from the state sector places like where
we're sitting right now and then it's
handed over to private capital to
exploit and sometimes it becomes almost
comical so maybe the leading expert or
one of the leading experts of civilian
aircraft civilian aircraft is now
dominated by two companies Airbus and
Boeing and they're constantly having
battles in the World Trade Organization
as to which one gets greater state
subsidies and in fact they're both
they're both offshoots of state power in
the United States and also to the air
for air force an aerospace wouldn't
exist without it in Europe its massive
state subsidies and when they finally
recently there was a great horror and
the United States expressed their with
the fact that Airbus won a contract to
refuel air from air force to refuel
planes to refuel for the US Air Force
okay take a look at the contract its
integrated it's a US company working
together with Airbus that's what we call
a free market state based industries
which are integrated with one another
but for the European business classes in
the American business classes this is a
reputable arrangement and since they
largely dominate the societies okay
that's what the propaganda and the
doctrine says - I suspect that right
underneath the surface a class struggle
still exists and is understood and is
ready to burst out at any moment
it's true you're not supposed to talk
about it yeah so one of my daughter's
teachers in a state college that's
relatively for students whose
aspirations are to be a nurse or
policemen or something like that for the
most part in her first class she asks
them to identify themselves their class
background in classified word must have
never heard it but they first was to use
that word but the answers that she gets
are either under class or middle class
if your father has a job as a janitor
somewhere your middle class if your
father's in jail you're under glass
those are the two classes well you know
that's an ideological triumph the idea
that class has something to do with who
gives the orders and who follows them
that's been driven out of consciousness
at least on the surface it's there right
below and as soon as you talk to
working-class people they know it
perfectly well I had promised not to
abuse you thank you question one and I
really mean it a lot of people in the
world thank you so much for all you do
but where do you get your strength how
do you move on because you are here in
the center of the Empire speaking quite
clearly to that powerful four
and in that mistake the in Thailand baby
to be marginalized and meanwhile all
over the world people free to you and
Mario find your work extremely helpful
see I don't I don't feel marginalized in
the United States when I go home tonight
I'll spend five hours answering email
and probably several dozen letters will
be invitations I mean by the I don't
care about our story I mean that's not
very live you know if I wasn't their
enemy I think something's wrong so what
that's why I have that picture of the
magazine cover prominently displayed on
the gate I'm doing the right thing so
it's partly that but it's partly yeah
things that are illustrated by some of
those photographs over there that one
over there is the worst labor massacre
probably in history in Chile a century
ago it was any Quique the mine owners
are mostly pretty permit these are
miners who have been there working the
mines are indescribable that they
marched about thirty kilometers to the
town to ask for a slight increase in
wages the mine owners welcomed and they
brought them into a schoolyard allowed
them to have their meeting and then
brought in the soldiers and machine
general nobody knows how many were
killed you don't count the number of
people you were killed but maybe
thousands it's a century before there
was any commemoration of this that's a
small monument which I saw last year
that was put up by people young people
we're just beginning to break out of the
iron grip of the dictatorship and it's
not just Pinochet so it has a bitter
history of state violence and repression
but now they're breaking out so yes the
atrocity took place and now we begin to
pay attention to it that whenever
there's given you know if it is of
course it's a painting given to me by a
Jesuit priest Archbishop Romero was
assassinated in 1980
six leading intellectuals Jesuit priests
said their brains blown out the us-run
