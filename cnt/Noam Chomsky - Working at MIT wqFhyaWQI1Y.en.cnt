I've an additional one small additional
question or moral remark to you that is
that you wish you were very courageous
attitude towards the war in Vietnam how
can you survive in an institution like
MIT which is known here as one of the
great war contractors and intellectual
makers of this war there are two aspects
to that one is the question how on how
MIT tolerates me and the other question
is how I tolerate MIT well as to how I
might be tolerates me here again I think
one shouldn't be overly schematic it's
true that MIT is a major institution of
war research but it's also true that it
embodies very important libertarian
values which are I think quite deeply
embedded in American society fortunately
for the world they're not deeply
embedded enough to save the Vietnamese
but they're deeply enough embedded to
prevent far worse worse disasters and
here I think one has to be a bit
qualified that is there is imperial
terror and aggression there is
exploitation there is racism lots of
things like that but there's also a real
concern coexisting with it for
individual rights of a sort which for
example are embodied in the Bill of
Rights which is by no means simply an
expression of class oppression it is
also an expression of the necessity to
defend the in the individual against
state power now these things coexist you
know it's not that simple it's not just
all bad or all good and it's because
it's the particular balance in which
they coexist that makes it that makes an
institute that produces weapons of war
be willing to tolerate in fact you know
in many ways even courage to be quite
honest a person who's involved in civil
disobedience against the war now as to
how I tolerate MIT that raises another
question there are people who argue and
I've never understood the logic of this
that a radical ought to dissociate
himself from all oppressive institutions
that is the logic of that argument is
that
Karl Marx shouldn't have studied in the
British Museum which if anything was the
symbol of you know the most vicious
imperialism in the world the place where
all the treasures of empire were
gathered you know the rape of the
colonies was all ported in there and so
on and so forth but I think Karl Marx
was quite right in studying in the
British Museum he was right in using the
resources and in fact the liberal values
of the civilization that he was trying
to overcome against it and I think the
same applies in this case but aren't you
afraid that your presence at MIT gives
them a clean conscience I don't see how
really I mean I think my presence at MIT
serves marginally to I hope a lot I
don't know how much to increase student
activism against a lot of the things
that MIT stands for for example
