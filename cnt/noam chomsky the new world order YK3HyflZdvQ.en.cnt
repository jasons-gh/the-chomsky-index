and talks about the role academics and
journalists play in shaping our opinion
on it
Noam Chomsky in his autobiography
Bertrand Russell identified three
passions that had informed his life the
longing for love the search for
knowledge and the unbearable pity for
the suffering of mankind and it seems to
me that I know nothing about gnomes
longing for love but it seems to me that
there are analogs in the other two
domains certainly a search for
understanding in domains of study of the
mind and a kind of articulate anger at
the institutions which calls the
suffering of mankind
he's worked essentially on well to use
his own terms
Plato's problem and Orwell's problem and
in his work on a mind essentially
plato's problem and again to invoke
Bertrand Russell the way Russell stated
it was Plato's problem was how comes it
that human beings whose contacts in the
world are briefed and personal and
limited and nonetheless able to know as
much as they do and this afternoon we
heard gnome
addressed that issue in the context of
studies of the mind on the other hand
Orwell's problem is sort of the flip
side of that and we can see or well as
seeking to explain why we know and
understand so little even though the
available evidence is so impressive in
certain domains and what Orwell was
concerned with was the ability of
totalitarian systems to instill beliefs
that are widely and firmly held although
there are at variance with obvious facts
and much of gnomes political work has
been addressing Orwell's problem and
examining the kinds of justifications
that are given for American foreign
policy and many other political
dimensions
and the solution that he has advocated
throughout his work is that one seeks to
discover the factors that that block
insight and understanding and to ask why
those factors are so effective many
people have asked what the relationship
is between his work on Plato's problem
and Orwell's problem and there's some to
my mind silly speculation on this the
fact is these are different domains but
the style of argumentation of course is
similar in the style of argumentation
was unfamiliar in in the domains of
linguistics and psychology and he
brought what you might call the Galilean
style of argumentation to this domain
using abstraction and idealization as
major sort of analytical tools and
there's something analogous analogous to
that in his work on politics where the
nature of the discussion his work is
very different from one from what is
familiar in those domains and he seeks
there to help us all I think to develop
some sort of intellectual self defense
against the the power of these
totalitarian systems and the propaganda
systems that were exposed to every day
and he emphasizes this is something that
what has to do with other people just as
in science we progress through
cooperation and interaction with others
so this evening he will be talking about
his work on Orwell's problem let me
point out that outside the hall there
are booths the IWW has has a booth the
University Bookstore has a booth with a
selection of gnomes books on both
linguistics and psychology and on
politics books I think are quite
accessible accounts of his work and this
evening he will talk about
the New World Order changing visions
Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
I was asked to announce a couple of
things that are coming up oh I'm very
obedient
especially when I agree these are events
concerning Mumia abu-jamal first is a
December 9th March and demonstration
from the FBI building the Supreme Court
presume that means Washington December
12th conference in Philadelphia and
April 24th event which I hope won't be
necessary called a million for whom he
had demonstration in Philadelphia this
is about as you don't know a case that's
a clear case of judicial execution that
and a notorious one
well since David or will I might mention
that in his defense that he didn't only
write about foot control in totalitarian
societies it's perfectly true that that
was the you know
well thrust main thrust of his work and
it's certainly what he's known for but
he did write an interesting essay called
literary censorship in England and it
was about foot control and free
societies
Victini one does the example because he
was there and the point that he made is
that it really wasn't all that different
from the talat area in Soviet Union it
was just done in different ways but he
said that the in fact one of the ways he
mentioned is a good education you'll be
happy to know so if you have a good
education I presume he meant you know
Oxford and Cambridge in those places you
just have it instilled in you that there
are certain things it just wouldn't do
to say or even to think if the system is
working properly and he also talked
about private ownership of the press and
other factors that as he puts it to end
up with the result that unpopular ideas
are an entry called inconvenient facts
are silenced with surprising
effectiveness
well that's not very well known and
there's a reason for it it was intended
as the introduction to his famous animal
form which made him a household word
satire on the Soviet Union but as if to
prove his point it was silenced with a
surprising effectiveness it didn't
appear for unknown reasons
just biographers don't go into though
they must know and it was discovered
about 25 years later long after his
death and his unpublished papers so it's
true that Orwell is known for his attack
on the other guy but he generalized the
point and the more important points the
ones that have to do with us which are
always the most important those have
been as he put it kept dark and silenced
with surprising effectiveness still
unknown for the most part except real
Orwell aficionados well that message is
worth bearing in mind he was writing
about England but lies to us as well and
more importantly because of American
power it was American power in fact that
established the current world order
there aren't only occasional moments in
human affairs when you can sensibly when
there are changes that are dramatic and
significant enough so that makes sense
to talk about a world order one of them
probably the most dramatic and the most
easily times surely was in 1945 at the
end of the most devastating single
catastrophe in human history which left
much of the industrial world either
seriously damaged or in ruins except for
the United States which was unscathed
and in fact had benefited enormous Lee
from the war industrial production more
than tripled that ended the depression
which had not been affected very much by
the New Deal and didn't set the stage
for the next phase of history the United
States at that time had about half the
total wealth and unparalleled military
power and security of a meta-level that
had no precedent and perfectly naturally
dominant forces in the state corporate
system planned to use that power to
organize in the world and accord with
their own perceived self-interest
that's what's technically called the
national interest in academic writing
and the media and so on inside these
truisms which is what kind of a
curiosity about the intellectual culture
is that these truisms which is what they
are are commonly described as a Marxist
view which is odd since first person I
ever who I know of who articulated them
clearly was Adam Smith and perhaps the
person who most lucidly articulated them
was Winston Churchill and it shouldn't
strain the intelligence of a eight year
old to figure out that that's the way
the world works anyway it does if you
have a good education
that's an inconvenient fact but well how
do you organize the world the there were
conflicting visions you know us elites
had their picture of how it ought to be
organized but it was certainly not
uniform by any means and opposing forces
had to be dealt with somehow borrow some
cold war rhetoric they had to be
contained or possibly rolled back if
that could be done and that was done
with varying degrees of success the
basic conflicts of course persist and
they persist for quite simple reasons
they're about fundamental values about
justice and freedom and human rights and
these values are constantly an arena of
conflict between the more powerful
between centres of power and most of the
rest
that's a good deal of history in the
last half century is no exception to
that well at the onset of the current
year the end of the Second World War
there were very the framers of the New
World Order they had to face these
challenges everywhere first they had to
face them at home I mean domestically in
the United States what had to be
contained or rolled back was the fact
that a large majority the population had
rather strong commitments to more or
less social democratic ideals sometimes
a lot more far-reaching than that
positions that the business world quite
rightly regarded as a threat to its
traditional domination of US society as
they put it in their own internal
publications
it was the hazard facing industrialists
in the rising political power of the
masses which had to be contained and
suppressed and
that's that was then you that's a
constant theme that runs so we came up
again in the wake of the turmoil of the
1960s which led to concerns among elites
in this case liberal elites about what
they called the crisis of democracy the
fact that large parts of the population
that are usually apathetic and passive
and obedient were trying to enter the
political arena to press their own
demands it's a crisis of democracy which
had to be overcome
they incidentally expressed particular
concern about what they called the
institution's responsible for the
indoctrination of the young the ones who
make sure that you don't have that the
wrong thoughts don't come to mind and
the period since the early 1970s has
been one of a doctrinal assault against
the effort the rather successful in many
ways Liberatore elements of the 1960's
that's the modern theories but going
back to the early period the early
the mid-1940s these were major problems
and it's interesting to look at how they
were dealt with but can't go into it now
well there were similar problems right
throughout the industrial world
there they were enhanced by the fact
that the anti-fascist resistance had
quite considerable prestige and appeal
at the end of the war and often it had a
sort of radical Democratic thrust to it
also traditional conservative the
traditional conservative order had been
discredited because of its association
with fascism well the first first task
of the United States and Britain after
the war was to restore that traditional
order in its essentials and that was a
major it was done all over the world and
one or another form sometimes blood aliy
sometimes in other ways mostly ways that
should be chapter one of post Second
World War history well as in the United
States that project continues it's taken
new forms in the last couple of decades
under under the guise of what's
sometimes called neoliberalism or
economic rationalism or the free market
and other terms that are permeated with
a good deal of fraud and hypocrisy I'll
come back to that in the third world
there were similar problems in the 40s
and there they were compounded by
pressures to dismantle the Imperial
systems and the legacy that they had
left the legacy of subordination and
dependency and throughout the third
world rather similar policies were
imposed but you can really see them in
their starkest clarity in Latin America
and the reason is because they're the
United States really reigned supreme I
mean there were essentially no
challenges so you can see the policies
formulated you read them in internal
documents sometimes public ones and
executed with pretty dramatic clarity
the when I say there were no challenges
that sound quite true
there was ones major challenge and that
was the domestic population in Latin
America there there was a threat and it
was recognized right away the State
Department records from the mid 40s
early mid 40s talk about the concern
their concern with what they called the
philosophy of new nationalism that was
sweeping all over Latin America I'm now
quoting it was embracing policies
designed to bring about broader
distribution of wealth and to raise the
standard of living of the masses on the
principle that the first beneficiaries
of a country's resources should be the
people of that country the name for that
evil doctrine is radical nationalism or
economic nationalism that's what's
called an official state papers and of
course it's unacceptable
the first beneficiaries of a country's
resources should be US investors they're
in our parts elsewhere and the local
associates that's taken for granted we
have to protect their resources as the
chair of the State Department's policy
planning staff put it in George Kennan
famous humanist our resources happen to
be somewhere else but they're ours and
we have to protect them and make sure
that we're the first beneficiaries there
was a conflict over this and in February
1945 at a hemispheric conference a u.s.
power naturally prevailed and the United
States imposed what was called the
economic charter of the Americas which
called for an end economic nationalism
in all its forms so none of this
nonsense well there followed a cruel and
bloody half-century still going on and
these were central themes throughout and
they remain so now they're very much
alive today although here too they take
the form of they've changed somewhat in
style and form now there in the
framework of a certain kind of
globalization in a very special form
which is crafted primarily to serve the
interests of those with power perfectly
naturally transnational corporations
financial institutions that state a
leets and so on well the most critical
part of the third world then and now as
well was the Middle East and there's a
simple reason for that it was the locus
of the world's major energy supplies and
remained so State Department didn't
mince words about it it was called the
greatest material prize in world history
and the strategically most important
part of the world uh stupendous source
of strategic power and so on that's the
Middle East and it was clear who had to
be the first beneficiaries of those
resources they had to be under effective
US control there to be accessible on
terms that are acceptable to us power US
leadership and the main concern was the
huge profits that they generate they had
the flow primarily to the United States
and secondarily to its junior partner as
the British Foreign Office ruefully
described itself in the mid-nineteen for
1945 internal documents recently
released the profits have to be recycled
by local managers who are supposed to be
the plinth dependent on the global
rulers the British and their day and the
Sun had a nice name for them and
internal documents they call them the
Arab facade behind which the British
would exercise actual rule they're still
around there's still the Arab facade so
that's the structure basic structure of
the system naturally it engenders
continual conflict the people of the
region don't understand why they
shouldn't be the beneficiaries of the
resources of that region
and a backward way they and that causes
problems in internal documents the
problems which have been going on since
the Second World War and in fact long
before they're called the problem of
radical nationalism economic nationalism
and so on for the general public for
people like us there are different terms
used for them they're called
international terrorism of really big
intellectual the crisis the clash of
civilizations or some other fancy term
but it's good old-fashioned radical
nationalism the strange idea that the
first beneficiaries of a country's
resources should be the people of that
country and that there should be efforts
to construct policies designed to bring
about a broader distribution of wealth
and to raise the standard of living of
the masses and State Department
terminology well that goes on and it's
likely that it'll become worse at least
if the consensus of geologists is
anywhere near accurate that is that the
current oil glut and extremely low
prices I mean at the pump in the United
States they're lower than they've been
since the Second World War in real terms
it's generally assumed that that's a
temporary phenomenon and that there is a
an oil shortage coming probably not too
far the reason for that belief is that
the rate of discovery has declined which
went up from about 1850 until the mid
1960s kept going up it's been declining
since the mid 60s despite much more
elaborate technology and deep drilling
and so on keeps going down and the
available oil which is some rough
estimate of it is being used up very
fast in fact close to half of the known
exploitable capacity has been used since
the oil crisis of the early 70s and it's
accelerating alright so that you know
but about furthermore about half of the
known exploitable capacities in the
Middle East which means that that region
of the world will become you know it'll
be looming larger and larger in the
effort to control the whole world and
those are you know not certain but
reasonable prospects less there's
something radically new discovered that
looks as if that's what's coming there's
a general prediction that about half of
total known capacity will have been used
up by within a decade or maybe two
decades anyway not very distant future
and after that as far as anybody knows
there'll be a decline and I shift to
Middle East sources as the major center
there's a lot of hype about the Caspian
Sea and so on but that's apparently
mostly fake according to oil companies
sources they claim it's being hyped by
the United States government for
political reasons as part of their ante
their their effort to develop an
alliance with Europe against Iran
virtually so far haven't been able to do
so they're kind of talking about Caspian
Sea but the estimates are that that's
maybe on the order of North Sea oil not
very large a couple of years use it most
the and most of it isn't in that region
it's in Kazakhstan
alright well anyhow those are prospects
that are expected which means the Middle
East will be be a major center of
conflict and turmoil very probably there
are new alignments taking shape there
which if you want to you should keep
your eyes on them it's not yet and part
of it's already there a part of its
taking shape a kind of an alignment
between which is this one's very visible
Turkey Israel and the Palestinian
administration which is supposed to keep
the Palestinians under control they're
supposed to play the role basically that
the black leadership of the banther
stands played and
under the apartheid regime it's why
agreement was about and so those three
are sort of on one side the turkey
Israel relation is now very visible and
frightening people on the other side you
can see a kind of and this must be
wearing people in the State Department
no end and the planning centers there's
the beginnings of interactions
rapprochement between Saudi Arabia Iran
Egypt Syria in part frightened by the
turkey israel relationship that's being
established under US power with the
junior partner following loyally behind
as always and it's this is a recipe for
a lot of trouble in the future well
there's a lot to say about all these
matters but and plenty of aspects of the
post-war post-world War two world and
global system that haven't even
mentioned but let's drop that on if
you're interested glad to talk about it
later and turn to something different
namely the institutional framework that
was designed for world order in the in
the mid 40s that's 50 years ago asked
how it's fared and where it stands today
that institutional framework had three
basic pillars there was an international
political order there was a human rights
order and an economic order the
political order is articulated in the
United Nations Charter the say a little
about each the first the political order
that's essentially the UN Charter the
Charter has some simple as long document
but it has it's based on a very simple
principle namely it bars the threat or
use of force in international affairs
threat or use of force and they're only
two exceptions to that which are clearly
specified and more or less irrelevant to
the real world
one is if the Security Council of the
United Nations unanimously authorizes
the use of force or the threat of force
after having determined that peaceful
means
have failed the second exception is
famous article 51 which permits
self-defense against armed attack until
the Security Council acts armed attacks
pretty narrowly defined concept in
international law that means a sudden
overwhelming attack so for example if
Cuba were to land troops and Washington
the way the United States is supposed to
respond is to inform the Security
Council and ask them to do something
about it
and until the Security Council act the
United States is permitted to use force
and self-defense against the Cuban
invasion that example may be
hypothetical I'm not sure the Cubans
kept a couple of months ago the Cuban
threat was officially downgraded by the
Pentagon that elicited a lot of anger on
Capitol Hill and there was rejected by
the White House at the same time the
European Union was bringing charges
against the United States and the World
Trade Organization US embargo against
Cuba for violating international law as
has already been determined by every
relevant international body and the u.s.
refused to accept World Trade
Organization jurisdiction claiming a
national security exception meaning that
the Cuban threat is still live so you
better make sure you got your gas masks
and E and your desks to hide under and
so on
well anyway that's the sole exception
these are the sole exceptions there's of
course no enforcement mechanism apart
from the great powers and decisively
that means the United States but the
problem is that the great powers as far
as I know universally reject the
principles of the Charter and the small
powers would too if they were big enough
to get away with it
they reject them in practice and also in
the case of the United States explicitly
in doctrine as well very clearly so in
fact the doctrine has been stated
repeatedly maybe stated most clearly by
Dean Acheson leading statesmen at the
time he was a senior advisor
Kennedy administration he was justifying
the blame the illegal blockade of Cuba
in 1962 before a meeting of the American
Society of international law and he
pointed at he stated that quote a
situation in which our country's power
position and prestige are involved
cannot be treated as a legal issue okay
so if US power position and prestige are
involved forget about international law
the Charter or anything else that's
pretty plain and accurate
there's no need and no time to go
through the practice of the past
half-century one recent example is the
bombing of the pharmaceutical plant in
Sudan it's quite trivial in historical
context though of course a war crime and
didn't arouse much concern here but I
suppose that if there was a terrorist
attack that had destroyed half of US
pharmaceutical supplies I might have
maybe made it to the back pages of the
newspapers anyhow that's a minor example
of the utin case the use of force and
radical violation of international law
without leaving a plea to of any cover
but it's quite standard you read it in
the front pages every time there's any
talk about say bombing Iraq obviously
that's not done with Security Council
support the u.s. of course knows it
can't get the Security Council to agree
to that
so therefore it's just blatant violation
of the central principles of
international law even the threat this
is independent of what you may happen to
think about the regime or anything else
we're talking about here about the
international political order what's
kind of interesting about the past 15
years or so the since Reagan is that
it's all become very open and public so
that's the one real innovation of the
recent period so the United States
during the Reagan administration
claimed officially that article 51
self-defense against armed attack that
that includes I'm quoting self-defense
against future attack that was that was
that was a justification for the bombing
of Libya or it permits the United States
quoting to defend its interests that was
the justification for the invasion of
Panama and the it's even gotten more
ludicrous in the Clinton years but the
basic point is we'll do what we feel
like and now that's open and
unchallenged accepted by the
intellectual community except maybe the
question a ton pragmatic grounds us at
the end of the UN Charter that's the end
official end it's always it's never been
effective but it's by now officially
dead about the practice should don't go
into it but the this has been amply
demonstrated in action in shocking ways
and again always with the acquiescence
and the just the support of the
intellectual classes the educated
classes those who've got a good
education and though which things are
inconvenient fact so there are no such
facts as say the American invasion of
South Vietnam in the early 1960s or the
US war against the church and other
miscreants and Central America in the
1980s and on and on those didn't happen
in official history or of course they
happened in real history in a free
society in a free institution of higher
learning these would be central
components of the curriculum and in fact
it's a kind of a reasonable measure of
the freedom of the University to ask
exactly how much attention is given to
these central events of modern history
and the doctrine that lies behind them
leave that as an exercise for those who
might be interested you know what the
answer is going to be well let's turn to
the second pillar of World Order the
human rights regime that's of course the
universal declaration of human rights in
a couple of days and December 10th that
will be the 50th anniversary of its
signing unanimous signing and will
probably be regaled with condemnations
of the horrendous human rights
violations of somebody else particularly
official enemies and those charges will
probably be accurate or reasonably
accurate but partially you can be pretty
confident that the inconvenient facts
might be mentioned a vastly more
important topic will be ignored namely
human rights violations and the often
terrible atrocities which can be charged
in whole or in part to our account easy
to think of examples many of them
ongoing well these are whatever their
skip the scale happens to be huge but
even if their scale was slight they
would be far more important than enemy
atrocities or other atrocities for quite
elementary moral reasons moral truisms
namely these are the example cases that
we can act to mitigate or to terminate
so on the most elementary principles
those are the most important the
comparative treatment of enemy
atrocities in our own is very
instructive and again I'll put it aside
there's plenty in print about it
unfortunately I don't know of any
analysis of Stalinist propaganda but I
assume it was sort of a mirror image of
ours it would be interesting to discover
that in fact the interesting to discover
if it sinks to the depths of moral
cowardice of our treatment of Western
treatment American treatment of the
atrocities chargeable home that's
another good topic for somebody to look
at if you want you can get a certain
insight into the real understanding of
human rights by looking at a doctrine
that's well known to international
lawyers but not much beyond it's called
the whole formula that's attributed
US Secretary of State Cordell Hull of
the Roosevelt administration this
formula defines what it calls the
international minimum standard of
civilization
well that standard doesn't involve
genocide or torture and other such
marginal issues rather it is in quoting
the right to adequate effective and
prompt compensation for expropriated
property where full compensation is to
be at fair market value as determined by
the former owners that's the
International minimum standard of
civilization and it's a formula that
applies in rather intricate ways for
example it's the basis for the US
economic embargo and terrorists war
against Cuba for 40 years that's been
carried out because of Cuba's failure to
meet this minimum standard of
civilization that as it failed to offer
what Washington unilaterally decided was
fair compensation for nationalized
property so the formula applies there on
the other hand it doesn't apply for some
odd reason to US investors in the US
government who stole the Cuban
properties at the turn of the century
when Cuba was under US military
occupation and consented to this robbery
by force but that expropriation was okay
doesn't fall under this principle the
principle also doesn't hold for the US
government and private powers who stole
Spanish and British possessions in Cuba
and the Philippines at the same time
after the bloody conquest of the
Philippines killed a couple hundred
thousand people the United States
throughout the Spanish concession for
the for example for the Spanish on
Manila railway company on the grounds
that in quoting it had been inspired by
Spanish imperialistic motives unlike the
US possessions that Cuba nationalized so
it's a rather subtle doctrine it also
doesn't apply to the founding of the
United States that was based on
expropriation of British properties
positions and also the possessions of
British supporters who were about as
numerous as the rebels in the civil war
that was part of the global war going on
at the time it's called here the
American Revolution actually a civil war
with two sides supported by different
great powers and more or less equally
balanced at home New York State alone
gained close to four million dollars
which was a huge sum in those days by
taking the property of loyalists but
that's okay that doesn't fall into the
formula well goes on you have to have a
kind of subtle mind and good education
to comprehend all of this and to
understand what counts as an
international minimum standard of
civilization and against that kind of
background you can understand more
accurately the significance of the
Universal Declaration in the real world
I say one final comment on that and I'll
go on the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights the the central thesis of it is
universality of course that means all of
the rights enumerated are of equal
status and you're pretty sure here talk
in the next couple of days about you
know the relativists various bad guys
plead Asian values and things like that
again the charges will be mostly
accurate again partial you're unlikely
to read editorials about the fact that
the United States is a leader of the
relativist can't quite officially one
whole category of rights enumerated in
the Universal Declaration is simply
dismissed a namely the socio-economic
provisions according to the US
government they have no status ginger
Patrick Kirkpatrick Reagan's ambassador
to the UN
she described them as a letter to Santa
Claus the US ambassador Morris Abram the
ambassador of the UN Commission on Human
Rights described them as preposterous
dangerous incitement actually he was
talking about the declaration of the
right to development that the UN was
considering which closely paraphrases
the universal
declaration in which the u.s. proceeded
to veto thereby vetoing central parts of
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights
well maybe I'll be surprised and they'll
be an editorial about this but I'm not
holding my breath again there's a lot
more to say if you read those provisions
you'll see why they have no status so
let's put that aside and turn to the
international economic order which is
actually all over the front pages today
the reason that it's all over the front
pages is that the crisis the last 20 or
25 years has finally become begun to hit
rich people so now it's a crisis up
until now it didn't exist but now you
can read it in the headlines and by now
what's been happening is reasonably well
known for exactly that reason nothing
new just different victims our potential
victims the international economics
order was also established in the mid
40s 1944 the Bretton Woods system
it's the Bretton Woods system designed
by the United States and England was
essentially I mean theoretically not but
effectively then it had two basic
principles one principle was that it
called for freeing up trade so
liberalizing trade they wanted to get
back to something like the period before
World War one which were only just about
approaching in terms of scale of
international economic transactions
relative to the economy and so on scale
it's not all that novel so they want to
ending it between the two wars is
declined a lot so they wanted to
liberalize trade its principal one of
the second principle was to regulate a
capital flow and keep exchange rates
fixed that's actually still you can
still find that in the IMF rules the
reason for the second principle was in
part a belief which is probably correct
least reasonable that capital flight
short-term speculative
flows particularly an exchange rate
fluctuations which go along with them
they're going to undermine trade trade
an investment and in fact recent
experience tends to be consistent with
that assumption the more important
reason however was again a kind of
truism which wasn't controversial and it
isn't controversial now and that is that
free flow of capital undermines
democracy and undermines the welfare
state they were far too popular to
ignore in the mid twentieth century
actually and if you go back to an
earlier period say during the period of
British domination of the world before
World War one nowhere near as strong as
US domination but substantial during
that period as I just mentioned the
level of globalization in gross terms
was not very different from today
actually higher in some respects capital
flow was roughly at today's levels
relative to the economy but in those
days economic policy state economic
policy could be designed without very
much concern for the rabb because they
didn't have a voice it was just you know
voting was restricted and in the
industrial societies kind of very weak
imitation of democracy therefore a
national economic policies could be set
and exchange rates could be fixed and so
on even though there was rapid capital
flow and in fact a major part of current
economic policy is to try to get things
back to those happy days when you could
sort of disregard the population and
just leave decisions in the hands of the
right people you know financial capital
and so on that's a large part of the
history the last 20 or so years now the
truism about free capital flow
undermining democracy in the welfare
state that was emphasized quite
explicitly by the negotiators the US and
British negotiators at Bretton Woods and
the reasoning is straight forward
capital controls that is restrictions on
free movement of capital across borders
they enable governments to carry out
fiscal policies like monetary and tax
policy
that are from the point of view of
investors irrational that is they only
help people not profits so they sustain
employment or sustain incomes and social
programs and so on and such policies can
be introduced without fear of capital
flight if it's constrained on the other
end if there is free flow of capital you
get what some international economists
have called a virtual Senate of
financial capital it can impose its own
social policies simply by the threat of
capital flight you know sending the
capital out of the country which leads
to higher interest rates and economic
slowdown budget cuts for health and
education and so on and recession or
maybe collapse basically the IMF
principles if prescriptions if you look
at them well as I say all of this was
articulated very clearly at the time by
the US written ago she ators and it's
not particularly controversial then or
now if you have free flight and free
flow of capital you're going to get a
virtual cent a Senate and democracy and
you know the welfare the social contract
will be undermined very it's important
to keep these really pretty elementary
observations in mind when you look at
the current period
well the Bretton Woods system as
originally established was pretty much
in place in for about 20 20 25 years or
so that's what's often called the Golden
Age of post-war state capitalism had by
historical standards high good economic
performance so high growth high rates of
growth both of the economy and of
production expansion of the social
contract and so on its was dismantled
the system was dismantled from the early
1970s one major move was when Nixon
simply unilaterally abrogated some of
the basic principles the other major
financial centers joined in by the 1980s
capital controls were mostly gone in the
rich countries completely gone the
smaller economies held up held onto them
South Korea for example
which is a significant economy kept them
through the 80s it was compelled to drop
them in the early 90s that's widely
regarded as a major factor in the recent
collapse along with radical failures in
the private sector throughout East and
Southeast Asia big topic I should sit I
won't go into it but I ought to say that
serious analysts at least consider the
East Asia East and Southeast Asia quite
different but the East Asian economic
miracle is considered quite real so
chief economist of the World Bank Joseph
Stiglitz highly regarded economist he's
in the after the crisis he's emphasized
that the East Asian economic miracle as
he calls it was his words an amazing
achievement historically without
precedent he also points out that it was
based on quite significant departures
from official doctrines and that it
ought to be sustainable unless it's
destroyed by financial markets he only
quote him he points out that in the East
Asian countries South Korea and Taiwan
government as in Japan a government took
major responsibility for promotion of
economic growth abandoning what he calls
the religion that markets know best in
intervening to enhance technology
transfer relative equality education
health along he doesn't say this but
along with industrial policy
coordination and strict capital controls
he also mentions that the rich countries
hadn't followed somewhat similar paths
as the World Bank has also acknowledged
but nowhere near accurately in fact
that's the basis for economic
development historically and in every
case that we know well what happened
after the Bretton Woods system collapsed
in early 70s essentially the Golden Age
ended since then it's been a period of
much for economic performance again you
can argue about causal effects but the
facts are not controversial there's been
a slowdown especially in the industrial
world I mean let's keep to the
industrial world the Western industrial
world you know a little variation from
place to place but essentially there's
been a slowdown of growth both of the
economy and the productivity that's
noticeable also trade if you look more
closely it's a lot of claims about an
explosion of trade and there's a few
instances where it's correct but overall
it's not trade seems to be going up
relative to the general economy but
that's because the economy has been
going down faster than the rate of
growth of trade has been going down so
the ratio is higher the that's one major
effect poor economic performance
secondly particularly in the United
States and England but to some extent in
the general industrial world incomes
have stagnated or declined for the great
majority of population in the United
States working conditions have gotten a
lot worse
social services as you know have
deteriorated infrastructures collapsed
there's huge debt the welfare state is
kind of in tatters sort of what would be
expected from the decisions of the
virtual Senate in the United States and
in England inequality has which was
declining from during the Golden Age
it's rapidly increased it's now back
through roughly what it was in the 1920s
that all of these effects leave a kind
of superfluous population who aren't
very contribute much to profit formation
in third world dependencies you carry
out things like what's called social
cleansing in Colombia like you kill them
or something like that but this is a
civilized society so we treat them
differently we throw them in jail and
the rate of incarceration has been going
up very rapidly right along with these
policies it's sort of made easier by
race class Carla
Asians and so on but the basic
phenomenon is not much to do with them
so throw him in jail around 1989 to with
crime rates incidentally u.s. crime
rates are sort of toward the high end of
the rich countries but not off the
spectrum there was one exception namely
killing with guns but that has to do
with the gun culture and the gun was not
crime rates the and as he'd expect in
around 1980 the United States was within
the spectrum sort of toward the high end
in incarceration of the population that
tripled during the 1980s it's still
going up very fast it's now five to ten
times as high as any other industrial
society and it's long been a world
record among any societies that have
meaningful statistics the and it's not
insubstantial so for example the numbers
in prison numbers of working-age people
in prison would if you counted them that
would add about two percent to the
unemployment rate which is no small
amount there's also a big prison
industry developing and you know
becoming a major private boondoggle even
for big military industry and so on a
lot of money involved
well that's these are other changes
another change is that particularly in
the 1990s profits went through the roof
the business press has been just
ecstatic through the 90s actually this
is up until the middle of this year
things changed around August but up
until then the business press was
absolutely ecstatic
you know stupendous dazzlingly couldn't
find words for it a major change around
1970 early 70s was an astronomical
increase in capital flows that came from
the deregulation and mostly short-term
very short-term like around 80% of it is
a week or less you know I mean it comes
back to where it started within a week
often days or hours the amounts are now
huge nobody
knows but it's estimated about a
trillion and a half dollars a day or
something of that sort it's virtually
unrelated to the real economy probably
harmful to it back in 1970 when the
total was far smaller about 90% of
foreign exchanges were estimated to be
concerned with the real economy meaning
like investment and trade 10%
speculative buy now general guesses are
around maybe 5% related to the real
economy the rest speculative and very
short term with the effects you'd expect
if there's well not those of you it's
well known in the economics literature
that there's basically no theory for
financial markets there govern standard
terminology is by panics manias and
crashes there's a lot of irrational herd
behavior as what's called technical
trading or noise trading you know not
related the economic fundamentals but
just like you know guesses as to how to
make money in three seconds and so on it
leads them there has been much more
volatility of markets since the early
1970s a lot of panics manias and crashes
unpredictable and never predicted and
bigger and bigger every time they come
around nobody knows what's going on and
they the honest people admit it
recently the the Bank for International
Settlements which is I guess ranks as
the most conservative institution around
it's the central bank of central bankers
they recently came out with their latest
report in which they said look we don't
know what's going on and they urged
humility in the face of the turmoil in
the world as I said it's now becoming a
crisis because rich people are getting
worried instead of the usual victims the
IMF did a study of banking crises from
1980 to 1995 at 15 year period and they
found that about a fifth of the country
that's almost every country in the world
around 180 countries 1/5 of them had
serious banking crises and another
another 60% had significant problems
often recurrent problems a lot of them
bailouts and you know again very
volatile and irrational markets and
rapid fluttering fluctuations of
exchange rates and response to the
speculative flows all of that means
everything's out of hand
and now as I say it's worrying rich
people the another feature of this
period since around 1970 has been an
attack on free markets that's not what
you read but that's what's been
happening the words of just the head of
economic current have got a head of
economic research of the World Trade
Organization did a technical monograph
on this a couple years ago he described
this period as one of what he called
sustained assault on free markets led by
the Reagan administration he estimated
the Reaganite protectionist measures
which were extreme at about three times
those of other industrial countries in
their effects these are often not
tariffs or what are called non-tariff
barriers just various other devices
which essentially block trade and are
intended to do that during the Reagan
years which was exciting period is
called conservative but what that's
supposed to mean it was an extreme
radical statist administration the ratio
of state expenditures the gross national
product shot up the debt shot up and
protectionism also increased it
approximately doubled during the Reagan
years broke post-war records public
subsidies increase enormously that were
bailouts transfer transfers to the
public sector in effect there was
reasons for it the reason was go back to
around 1980 you'll notice there was a
lot of concern about the industrial
decline about the decline of the
American economy
and there were calls for what was called
reindustrialization of America and in
order to carry out the
reindustrialization of America the
Reagan administration turned to the
classic device government spending in
particular Pentagon spending
which since the Second World War has
been the absolute foundation of the
economy every dynamic sector of the
economy sort of virtually every one
flows off it there's some extreme
examples like a current example is the
internet but computers electronics you
pick it that largely initiated and
subsidized through by the public then
hand it over to private capital and the
Pentagon has been a favorite device for
doing this one reason why the Pentagon
budget stays high independently of any
conflict and why it's strongly supported
in fact increased by people like
Gingrich and Lotte and others and parade
as conservatives can in other words all
this market discipline is fine for poor
people but not for rich folk they have
to keep the cycle of dependency going
well in 1980 it was a big problem and
they had to reindustrialize America they
turned to the Pentagon as there was a
huge increase in the Pentagon budget
it was pretty explicit what it was about
and so for example the Pentagon picked
up divided developed a program
manufacturing technology program manTech
it was called which was going to
overcome the failures of American
management American management had
failed to keep up with modern management
techniques that had been pioneered
largely by the Japanese leaning
production and all this kind of stuff so
they had to give you giving a shot in
the arm the Pentagon devised this
program to design what they called the
factory of the future with automation
and flexible production lean production
and all this kind of stuff and the
purpose was straightforward it was in
their words to boost the market share an
industrial leadership of American
industry which had fallen way behind
because of management incompetence the
same is true of the National
Laboratories so the do-e labs the
apartment of energy labs
their explicit goal is to their words
the move federally developed
technologies
into private in industry and academia
academia is just one of the funnels by
which public funds go into private
pockets my job to it I shouldn't
complain too much MIT is a large part of
this but that's the purpose of the end
of the government labs and the
reindustrialization worked the the idea
was to overcome management failures to
save central components of economy the
whole industrial system from mainly
Japanese competition and also to put
them in a position to dominate the
emerging technologies and markets of the
future again as I say the internet is
and information technology generally are
good examples the internet for example
was designed for about 30 years mostly
in the public sector first by the
Pentagon and the National Science
Foundation it was finally commercialized
over the opposition of about two-thirds
of the population alright but that was
just a few years ago 1995 in fact to the
extent that there had been some private
involvement but if you check it back
it's usually federally funded initiative
came out of the information processing
technology office of the Pentagon for
the most support the since the sixties
but that's only one example well all
that's continuing under Clinton
including radical interference with free
trade when it's convenient and that runs
across the spectrum of choices so the
Clinton administration has in one way or
another barred everything from things
ranging from Mexican tomatoes openly
because US consumers preferred them to
Florida grown ones they said so that's
at one end the other end Japanese super
computers which were blocked by
prohibitive tariffs pretty recently for
the open purpose of protecting us
manufacturers like Cray enterprise which
is main had been the main u.s.
manufacturer of supercomputers called
private enterprise but
only because the profits are private the
markets are government under by America
programs and things like that much of
the technology and the funding has been
public but the privates are in the
profits are indeed in private and when
they couldn't manage just slammed high
tariffs on so that goes on and that's an
old story that's the history good part
of the history of industrial development
from 94 Britain as well before us
because the United States goes back to
the early 1820s well in the recent years
mid-90s there's been a lot of euphoria
in the United States again up till about
August of this year it's a switch point
but up till then there's been a great
deal of euphoria about you know what's
called a fairytale economy so you could
read in front-page headlines in the New
York Times about saying that Americans
were smug and prosperous and the happy
glow of the American boom and a fat and
happy America is enjoying one of the
greatest booms in American history and
on and on if you read through these
euphoric accounts they always give one
example that's the stock market and it's
true the stock market has been an
absolute fairy tale especially for the
top 1% of American households who owned
close to half the stock and other assets
and top 10% who owned most of the rest
what happens when you go down to the
next 10% you know the next decile from
80 to 90% of income well it turns out
that their net worth has declined in the
1990s meaning their debts increased
faster than their assets and as you go
down below the next 10% down to the
bottom and so the story just gets worse
and worse
80% approximately if families are
working a lot more hours under worse
conditions just to keep from losing more
ground the they haven't yet recovered
the level of the of 1989 according to
the latest statistic
little on early 1970s when the great
economic boom began to take off all of
this is without precedent in American
history this is a recovery from
recession and it's the report first
recovery in which most of the population
was basically left out trying to get
back to where they were before the as
for growth economic growth and so on
this greatest boom in American history
is in fact one of the worst it's the
worst in the post-war period it's the
slowest it's below economic growth is
below even the quite anemic 70s in the
80s
way below the fifties and the sixties
it's it's great it's a fairy tale for
some people undoubtedly and those happen
to be the ones who are writing the
articles about it and the ones they meet
and elegant restaurants and right
parties and so on and so forth so yeah
for them it's a fairy tale economy you
do get fake there's studies of consumer
you know of consumer optimism that sort
of thing they've been running pretty
high but you look a little more closely
and you'll discover that the main reason
is that people as the researchers point
out have lowered their expectations so
now if you can get by that's enough you
know then you're happy you don't expect
your children to do much better maybe
worse that's a change it's a new change
in American history well that's the
fairytale economy and the reasons for
the fairy tale are also pretty frankly
explained and we should listen to the
explanations so maybe the most powerful
and most respected the person in the
United States is the Fed chair Alan
Greenspan and he's explained he's very
proud of the economy that he presided
over and he explained how it works to
Congress and his congressional testimony
he attributed the fairy tale to what he
called greater worker insecurity meaning
workers are intimidated you know they're
afraid to ask for
wage for raises and wages because they
can just be fired or their jobs can be
transferred to Mexico or something like
that the Clinton administration agreed
economic report of the president
attributed the economy with fairytale
economy again they're very proud of it
to what they called significant wage
restraint yeah that's the same thing a
greater worker insecurity workers are
too intimidated to ask for a share in
the good times the that's reported in
the business press so Businessweek had a
study a couple months ago showing that
about 90 percent of working people are
insecure and that's good for the health
of the economy any of you who study
economics know that there's a phenomenon
called health of the economy which is
actually nothing to do with health of
the population I mean even in the
technical sense and the health of the
economy is improved if people are scared
and wages are down and you don't have to
waste money on irrational things like
what's good for the general population
keeps inflation low enough to please
financial institutions and concentrates
wealth where it ought to be top few
percent well there are a lot of reasons
for that threat of job transfers is one
that's one of the main purposes of the
local trade agreements and there's many
others I will skip further discussion
about this because I'm going on too long
for a while it looked as if this whole
story was going to work there were it
looked as if this fairy tale for the top
few would work out and that it would be
possible to maintain the fraud about the
markets knowing best and so on and so
forth while calling on plenty of massive
state intervention to ensure that the
rich don't have to face market
discipline that was all moving along
rather nicely until about less
when again a threat started to reach the
people who matter since then it's been
there's been a remarkable change in
economic orthodoxy it does change very
quickly very fast if you look over the
years sois flipping up and back it's a
very flexible science it turns out now
the orthodoxy has changed there are
calls for capital controls from pretty
surprising places like the Bank for
International Settlements business press
World Bank in one form or another
there's debates about it even inside the
IMF the last bastion there's concern
about it now and also some of the most
passionate academic advocates of free
trade one of them well-known Columbia
University professor jug Watty has been
writing angry articles all over the
place is one of the most prominent free
trade and advocates in the profession
enough in foreign affairs and so on
condemning what he calls the wall street
treasury complex which is destroying the
International economy by imposing
policies that free financial markets and
quoting him through the IMF and so on
that's that's change and I think the
change can be dated at least and may be
attributed we possibly attributed to the
change and the victims up until now it's
been mostly poor people the majority of
the population in countries like the
United States the third world has been
completely devastated by this but
sectors have been left out the people
who count and now they're worried
they're worried that the whole system
will lead to a kind of global meltdown
well how - there's a reason why they're
calling for humility they don't know how
to tame the destructive forces that have
been unleashed there have been some
proposals they look reasonable they've
been advanced by leading economists for
20 years or so they're now sort of
coming out of it you know they're now
sort of moving into public discussion
they might work they might not they've
been kept
the agenda of the powerful because they
liked the way things were going
they liked those outcomes no maybe not
well is this so-called globalized
economy really out of control that's
they call for humility is a good idea
but still given what we know it's pretty
hard to believe as I mentioned in gross
terms it's not all that new and there
are novelties but by gross measures it's
kind of like pre-world War one and most
of the interactions most of the
interchanges are within the major
industrial societies but sometimes
called the Triad you know your your
European Union you know North America
and Japan well those are all countries
where you can Institute with public in
fact could act to institute economic
policy changes these are countries where
you can have public policy decisions
there aren't going to be any military
coups for example it's not like
third-world country
it's that means and even within the
framework of existing institutions there
are plenty of things you can think of
that could well be enacted to restore
sort of you know what's called Golden
Age type structures and there's no
reason to stop there I mean the
institutions are not self legitimizing
never have been in history there's still
not I they have to they have to be
challenged justified if they can't be
justified which I think they can they
can be changed
that's all subject to popular will with
very few constraints in the rich
industrial countries of course it's
completely natural for all the doctrinal
institutions to try to make you feel
hopeless to you know the divert public
attention away from the crucial issues
and try to bring about a mood of sort of
hopelessness and despair and you know
turn people to individual survival
strategies and so on and if you were
working for a PR agency nobody would
have to tell you that that's what you
have to do is
obvious that that's what you have to do
it's been going on for centuries it's
understandable
and as always understanding can liberate
people it can liberate them to design
and follow a very different paths and
these could go quite far they could go
to the dismantling of oppressive
legitimate institutions new democratic
more democratic institutional
arrangements you can right through the
economy sort of obvious where to look
but there are plenty of others and in
fact it may we ought to be thinking
about somehow trying to make it possible
should be within our reach to address in
some serious way the needless suffering
and injustice that are that really
define contemporary society and to
demonstrate that the human species is
not some kind of lethal mutation which
is destined to destroy itself and good
deal more in what amounts to the flick
of an eye from an evolutionary point of
view that's actually not an unlikely
prospect if things continue on the and
the present the prevailing conditions of
social life okay I'll stop there
[Applause]
okay could we have some lights and we
will have that light and we have two
mics down the front sir okay very good
so come down and put your questions keep
keep your questions short and bear in
mind please that your questions and
comments bear in mind that we have
interpreters here so keep them clear and
just about see the mics somebody over
there yeah go ahead yeah working in your
opinion what is the year 2000 computer
crisis and what effect will this have on
the world order as you've described it
I'm no big specialist on this and you
know I'm sure there are people here who
can give them more competent answers
than I can but there's no doubt that
it's pretty serious so for example the
US security officials are very concerned
about it for one reason because they're
afraid that the air defense systems will
collapse and the Soviet Union and China
where they haven't even started to
address these questions yet and the way
what are called air defense systems work
they can shoot off missiles you know
with very little kind of air trigger in
fact the US has actually offered China
and Russia new air defense systems to
try to make sure that they don't you
know by accident happen to destroy the
world and that's one problem but there
are plenty of others I mean the I mean I
imagine that the you know the big banks
and so on of probably made sure their
interests are cared for but
a lot of other problems around that
nobody really knows surprise I can tell
nobody basically knows it could be the
main advice people are getting is stay
in your homes for the first week or two
of the year 2000 don't take any trips
you know store up on food beforehand and
see how things kind of even out I don't
know I mean and I've never haven't read
anything that seems to know is that one
working hello yeah yeah I wanted you to
comment briefly on the you talked a lot
about the institutional economic order
and I was interested in your feelings on
the currently ongoing high level
discussions on the multilateral
agreement on investment in the obvious
lack of public discourse mm-hmm okay
I've written a lot about that if you're
interested so it's in print I actually
did a review that the multilateral
agreement on investments which you get
which is always for the moment did the
it was this is a well sort of the nature
of it was captured rather nicely in a
Businessweek headline last February
called it the the explosive trade deal
you've never heard of both parts of
which were true it's an explosive deal
not really a trade deal it's an
explosive investor rights agreement
which gives investors extraordinary
rights like nothing you know the most
extreme that have ever been imagined
with no obligations I mean all the huge
treaty on our 50 pages all the
obligations are on what they call States
which means people you know the state is
is sometimes the state's dictatorship
sometimes it's marginally you're more or
less democratic but the obligations are
all on people and they're in public
institutions and the rights are all for
private power unaccountable private
power and the rights are pretty
extraordinary
I mean corporations had been given the
rights of persons which is outlandish
early in this century something would
scandalize classical liberals they
should say but that has already happened
although it could be and I think should
be rescinded because it's outlandish but
this treaty like parts of NAFTA actually
gives them the rights of states which is
something novel Minh to it anyhow it's
been going on it was initially
originally they tried to they thought
they'd put it through the World Trade
Organization but that didn't work
because there was a lot of objection
from third world countries India and
Malaysia so it shifted over to the OECD
the rich countries twenty-nine richest
countries that's more controlled and it
went on for about three years and
negotiations with virtually no public
comment I did a almost complete review
in the United States and England and
Australia and until the one until early
this year that's after close to three
years there was a like statistical error
you know occasional or mention here and
there it's not that it was unknown it
was perfectly well known so the business
press the business world knew all about
it they're lobbying groups were involved
in it from the beginning the you know it
must have known but it was kept it's one
of those inconvenient facts that was
kept dark to borrow more wealth phrase
the one partial exception was Canada in
Canada in early 1997 it sort of broke
through because of popular activism
alright and that led to a lot of
pressure and a lot of publicity you know
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and so
on in the rest of the industrial world
it's sort of en to break through mostly
from public activism early this year and
the signing date was supposed to be last
April but they backed off in near panic
the OECD there were some quite comical
articles about it the London Financial
Times which is you know the premier
business daily in the world
I had an article called hordes of
vigilantes and it was about the hordes
of vigilantes who over
the OECD and the corporations and the
you know the rich countries and the
transnational and the international
financial institutions this gorgeou
vigilantes which a lot of activists just
overwhelmed them and frightened them and
they had to back off from trying to do
it and they quoted people who warned
that it may not be as easy as it has
been in the past to arrange
international agreements in secret and
then have them rubber stamped by
Parliament's that's the way it's been
working until now but now we may be in
trouble because all those vigilantes are
around the trade unionists
environmentalists you know grassroots
activists and so on it's other crisis of
democracy and in fact a pretty stunning
victory for the vigilantes if you look
at the forces that were arrayed against
each other well they tried to put it off
until October and last October but it
collapsed I mean by that time a couple
of major countries it pulled out France
pulled out Australia pulled out the
United States kind of mixed and for the
moment at least it's on the Shelf which
means they're gonna sneak it in some
other way
the major effort of the United States
has been to try to push it through the
IMF rules by revising the IMF articles
to include conditionalities that include
a lot of the multilateral agreement the
my EMF is properly secret you know so it
never gets reported and in fact operates
in secret so that's a better forum but
people are interested or to keep their
eyes on it do you think the recent
failure in Paris could be at all
attributed to look to the what you
talked about going on in the stock
market marl beast yeah partly I mean
partly just the power centers are scared
but partly and I think we shouldn't
under look underestimate this this horde
of vigilantes really made a difference I
the same happened last fall with a year
ago that is with fast track up until as
the Clinton administration argued
correctly fast track had been standard
legislation it's only this fast-track
issue doesn't really have anything to do
with free trade I mean even if you put
aside the fact that the
so-called trade agreements aren't free
trade by inez in any meaningful sense
the fast-track issue has to do with
democracy
so even most passionate advocate of free
trade would be in favor of would be
against fast-track if they also believed
in democracy I mean fast track is just
an arrangement which allows exactly what
I quoted it allows deals to be made
behind closed doors and rubber-stamp by
Parliament's that's fast-track this has
got nothing to do with free trade but in
fact it had always been accepted I think
for about 20 years yeah but last fall
when the Clinton administration tried to
push it through with like a hundred
percent media support as far as I know
enormous corporate backing they had to
back off a mainly by constituent
pressure so no people were banging on
the doors of their congressional
representatives and they backed off even
if they were in favor of it never came
up well those are all indications of how
much can be done even by extremely
disorganized groups with no unity and
you know very little interaction and you
know scattered all over the place I just
imagine what could be done by really
organized popular movements that's one
of the reasons why the end of the
doctrinal system has to you know the
institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young the
trilateral commission they got to work
overtime to do their job make sure that
people don't have these you know bad
thoughts and worry about inconvenient
facts but these are victories that
should be recognized I mean they're kind
of defensive victories they didn't you
know they prevented something but
they're a signal that you can go on to
more substantial ones what do you think
of direct democracy well it depends what
you mean by it
I mean if you mean by for example that
say as contrasted with representative
democracy depends I mean any complicated
society it's gonna have to have some
kind of representation I think
I think that's undoubted the question is
how it works I you you you were my rock
syndicated you're dissatisfied with the
way power is acquired and wielded in
this country and that has nothing to do
with thee you ended by suggesting that
perhaps it's time for some new ideas but
that doesn't mean do it I mean one of
them everybody votes more or less
irrelevant and it's irrelevant because
that's one of the ways in which the
doctrinal system diverts your attention
from what really matters what really
matters is the fact that the major
institutions in the society are
understood talat Aryan control after all
what's a corporation a corporation is
just a tyrannical system one of the most
tyrannical systems that humans have ever
devised they've been given extraordinary
rights by the courts not by legislation
early in this century
they're like the multilateral agreement
would give them actually the rights of
states they're basically unaccountable
to the public when they've been given
the rights of persons that means for
example they have the right to
propagandize so like they've been given
the rights of free speech which is
insane you know these are collectivist
institutions they've been given the
right to advertise in fact that your
expense so you get the tax free so you
get you pay for the privilege of having
your minds destroyed and there they own
the information and they control the
information system that what are the
media you know huge corporations parts
of bigger corporations that sets the
framework of discussion discussion it
the major decisions that affect what
happens in the economy and social life
are made behind closed doors very little
public accountability they have the
right freedom from search and seizure
you know Fourth Amendment rights means
you can't know anything about what
they're doing you know and and they have
enormous power furthermore
you know I mean that's described this
free trade it's ridiculous I mean these
about maybe nobody's our secret
institutions so all figures have to be
taken with a big grain of salt because
nobody really knows but the guesses are
that by international economists that
maybe 40% or so of US trade is actually
internal to corporations meaning it's
not trade at all you know it's just
moving something across a border it's no
more trade than moving from Indiana to
Illinois or something like that happens
across a border you know it get cheaper
labor to avoid environmental
restrictions and so on well you know 40
percent is not a small number and that's
a vast underestimate because there are
also complicated strategic alliances
among alleged competitors so IBM and
Toshiba and Siemens and so on are
working together you know they're
working together on design on marketing
and so on and in fact in fact it's
gotten to the point where some
international economists call it a new
system what they call alliance
capitalism
you know big networks of tyrannical
institutions basically running the world
I mean in comparison with this the
difference between you know everybody
voting and everybody not voting is
pretty trivial these are the major
questions so you think the public
opinion polls are a sham
no they're not at all a sham in fact
they're extremely interesting and you
should pay attention to them the the
United States is very public of painful
czar different from votes incidentally
totally different in fact public
opinions and the results of votes often
turn out to be radically different and
some of the reasons are given by the
fate of referendum so for example take
where I live Massachusetts for years you
know every year there was a referendum
on the progressive income tax for the
state
now that would benefit you know an
overwhelming benefit for the general
population you take a look at the public
opinion polls at the beginning very
strong support for it and then it slowly
declines by Election Day it's a minority
why'd it decline well huge propaganda
campaign
warning people that if you do this all
the business is going to flee out of
Massachusetts you won't have a job your
children will starve and so on yeah
that's just what the guys are willing
the information system want you to
believe
so public opinion look at public opinion
polls for the same reason that they are
taken well why do we have so many public
opinion polls in the United States and
they're mostly business or initiated the
propaganda institutions like the PR
industry they want to keep their finger
on the public pulse they've got to know
how to design the propaganda so they
want to know what people are thinking so
in fact if you want to find out you can
find out too and you can find out how
these opinions are changed sometimes
sometimes they're very resilient
strikingly resilient so say take the
Vietnam War there was huge propaganda
justifying the war I mean among
articulate people there was virtually no
opposition to it contrary to what you're
told
there was pragmatic opposition you know
it's not working or something like that
but you know there's that kind of
opposition and Hitler's General Staff
after Stalingrad the principled
opposition was almost non-existent this
has been studied incidentally literally
almost non-existent on the other hand if
you look at public opinion polls they're
quite different so public opinion
studies were taken regularly by the
Gallup poll is one of the questions
every you know regular questions and the
Gallup polls from around 1970 to the
early 90s last one I saw was what do you
think of the war in Vietnam given an
open set of choices you know like 10
options where you usually get low
numbers but it was a steady 70 percent
roughly you know plus or minus a little
that chose fundamentally wrong and
immoral not a mistake
there's nobody in educated opinion
ticular opinion whoever said that I mean
everybody who answered the question that
way was making it up for themselves uh
well you know that's it's striking
indication of the divergence between
public opinion and policy actually
another one is the multilateral
agreement on investments which is just
mentioned as soon as it became public
you know the whole thing collapsed
because for exactly the reason that the
negotiator said
it looks like an end to an era when we
can make deals behind closed doors and
have them rubber stamped by Parliament
there's rebels getting involved in
things those are some of the major
reasons were for the kind of thing that
Orwell was talking about for you know
flood controlled and free societies in
fact the more you you know the less
force as people win more freedom as we
people have you know meaning that the
power to coerce by violence has declined
the importance of propaganda has
increased and that's well understood I
mean you can you know you read it in
manuals of the public relations industry
and the productions of academic
intellectuals you know the founders of
modern political science public
intellectuals and so on you have to
control the public mind because we can't
control people in any other way well
under those conditions public opinion
polls are important and interesting
public intellectuals and so on you have
to control the public mind because we
can't control people in any other way
well under those conditions if public
opinion polls are important and
interesting but voting is something
different because people are giving
highly structured choices structured by
an information system which is dedicated
to maintaining the power of those who
own and run it and that power is
enormous I'm in the corporate control of
the media's like a small part of it
corporate control of the economy and
social life is a far stronger part the
virtual Senate that I mentioned is
another part I mean unless we think
about those institutions worrying I mean
you know concern about things like
proportional representation or you know
voting by computer and so on may be of
some interest but it's like 10 third or
effect Nome you mentioned how geologists
have their findings are having an impact
on the long-term geostrategic impact or
interests in the Middle East I was
wondering if you could comment on
on a different type of scientists impact
on the same resource in particular that
of climate scientists who are now
estimating that over the next hundred
years we can safely use maybe 40 years
of current usage of fossil fuels without
having some serious impacts both on on
the ecology but also on a number of
human social structures and what that
will what potential that has for
altering the geostrategic balance and
also for being an issue around which
people can confront these sources of
power that you talk about and so just to
be clear I'm not suggesting that
policymakers or advisors are paying much
attention to any of this the reason is
that they think an extremely short term
in a short term framework and
furthermore a lot of them are account
professional economists so if you look
at the OECD you know the rich countries
they don't apparently don't even have a
major study group on this I and the ones
that they have are mostly staffed by
professional economists who just like
the head of the World Bank said they
have a religion and the religion says it
can't happen no it can't happen because
markets are perfect you know so as soon
as the price starts to go up some
miracle will happen and people will find
an alternative fuel well maybe you know
maybe maybe not nobody knows but if you
believe in the religion you don't have
to worry about it like most religions
there's an answer you know you got it in
graduate school but as far as I know
there is no serious planning going on
about this and the professional articles
about it say they can't discover any
serious planning it should be a serious
issue and what u.s. planners are surely
concerned about are the visible steps
towards realignments in the Middle East
region that they're concerned about and
they certainly are concerned about
controlling it and they are concerned
about the training in the United States
about trying to there's a conflict
between the United States and Europe
over Iran right now
I mean the Europeans mostly want to
reintegrated into the world system the
United States for its own reasons wants
to keep it out and punish it all right
and
that's apparently a good bit of the sort
of background for all this talk about
where the pipeline ought to go and you
know how much oil there is around the
Caspian Sea and so on so that kind of
short-term stuff yeah people are
thinking about but not there's no reason
to believe that they're thinking about
the long term questions I think we ought
to be thinking about them but doesn't
mean planners or on the climatologist
yeah right I mean there's just a
overwhelming consensus that there are
big problems coming nobody knows what
they are you know like one of the
consequences the critics there's like
about six scientists in the world or
something who are pick up about half the
newsprint who are regularly trotted out
to say which is true that the models
aren't very good and there are a lot of
things you don't understand and so on so
there's a lot of uncertainties but of
course a point about uncertainty is that
you know the guesses could be off in
either direction that's one of the
Elementary properties of uncertainty so
the predictions could be overstating
which is the only thing you ever hear or
they could be understating but you don't
hear you know and again for reasons of
short-term gain and profit in fact until
the ozone layer started breaking up in
the North you didn't hear anything about
that either you know as long as it was
just people down down there alternatives
but it really hit the Wall Street
Journal and so on when people who count
we're starting to get affected and right
now people who count or not are doing
pretty well with oil stocks the big
mergers that are coming along like Exxon
and Mobil those guys are probably
thinking about it you know but that
doesn't mean but that doesn't mean that
planners are on the climate issues the
ecological issues are there that's sort
of what I had in mind in my last
statement it could well turn out that
humans will simply quickly be any a
lethal mutation that could happen and in
fact as to the consequences of global
warning you can find prediction
all over the place I mean some of them
are that you know the sea level rise
meters and meters which may happen but
another fairly widely held view is that
the Europe will move into an ice age
because the Gulf Stream will be
redirected farther south which would
make Europe something like you know
Greenland or something like that
and the effects of that on the global
global society are incalculable another
prediction is reasonably widely held is
that the Midwest US will become a Dust
Bowl which would have a terrific effect
on global food supplies for bad reasons
because so much of it has been
concentrated there so you know there are
all kinds of serious dangers people
ought to be worrying about these things
I wanted to ask you about the
possibility of a solution as you
mentioned in Latin America the basic
other force was the masses and that's
also true about the whole world
considering that now what the situation
is that basically the workers union in
the United States have been demolished
for all practical purposes and that's
kind of happening in Europe to them
today and what's happening in the third
world
there is no OPEC anymore and the Allied
nations don't exist basically most of
the progressive forces have been
attacked and we can how do you see that
because from where you are I'm sure you
have a better idea that now I have at
least now we're all guessing but my
guesses are a little different that do
you see that the movements the little
movements here and there somehow will
come together and create a mass movement
that can connect internationally because
that's basically what we need and being
a left person and some of the left ways
of doing things have been discredit
I still I'm discredited by whom by their
powers to get my powers
did they ever credit them no they tell
you they're discredited but that's
because they want you to feel okay first
just to back up a little I mean I think
you ought to be cautious about
describing OPEC as a progressive force
yeah but you know just take a look at
the US and Britain and their reaction to
the rising oil price they didn't mind in
fact the US and Britain kind of
suppressed I mean Britain that's kind of
like the little puppy dog they do what
they're told but the United States in
fact you know you can read professional
literature which says refer to the US
Treasury and then has a footnote saying
that's shorthand for the US UK Treasury
but they they were not so much opposed
to the oil price rise and the reason is
they sort of benefited from the visa vie
their main competitors the other
industrial countries and in fact you
know the US was actually running a
positive trade balance with Saudi Arabia
after the price went up because they
figured out ways of getting the Arab
facade to recycle the profits that's why
there was such a huge armaments flowed
to the oil-producing countries mostly
comes back here and also don't forget
that the end construction projects and
all sorts of things
that's where Bechtel got you know rich
from from and don't forget that when the
oil price goes up at the pump the
profits go up too and the profits are
mostly us British companies so they're
perfectly happy to have the price go up
another effect of the early seventies
price rise was that it enabled the oil
majors to bring online production fields
they knew about but we're not using
because they weren't profitable enough
when the price went up high enough
you could start using North Sea oil
which is what saved the Thatcher
government from totally destroying
England and you could bring along Alaska
oil which are you know wasting resources
they're not big but they're around for
20 years or so and that was there
because of the price rise so the oil
companies were not unhappy about it
and in fact it was a meeting and I think
around February 1974 so were Kissinger
and you know the White House called in
rich countries other and kind of told
them you know laid down the line on this
not to make a fuss about the oil price
rise and if in fact the US and Britain
led the way out of the you know
short-term global recession then because
they weren't being harmed by it and if
they had been harmed that our Arab
facade would not have stayed in business
very long you can be sure that they
would have no they did their job or else
they're out the so I mean you know there
are big problems with energy but not
that I don't I wouldn't quite say that
the American unions have been destroyed
they certainly have been damaged they
were damaged seriously by the trade
agreements they were damaged even more
by just criminal acts authorized by the
government so the Reagan administration
effectively told corporations that they
were not going to that they were not
going to enforce the laws against
illegal firing of union organizers and
so on this is pretty open actually it
was reviewed in the business press brief
frankly they simply said and the Clinton
administration is continuing effete so
the number of firing firings of workers
for attempting to organize started
shooting way up it's all illegal but
doesn't matter if nobody's enforcing the
law if you have a criminal state you
know crime pays you know very well and
one of the effects of that and threats
of transfer and so on that's certainly
weakened the labor movement along with
other you know bigger development but
it's leveled off and there's a recovery
and it's not a big change in terms of
number
but it's quite a change in terms of
consciousness so you know talks like say
this you can give to labor audiences ten
years ago you can now easily you know
and in fact they're not militant enough
these talks because they want to see
more you know these things oscillate in
fact for the first time I mean the
International you're right about
stressing the importance of
international solidarity that's very
important and there's not much of it but
just take a look at American labor you
know up until quite recently US labor
internationally it was like an adjunct
of the CIA you know they were working
hard to undermine unions and undermine
democratic regimes and so on that's no
big secret that's changed the people in
the international office now are people
who are very much attuned to problem say
of Latin American labor and in fact
there are some beginnings you know
they're not huge but there are some
beginnings of cross-border solidarity
any sweatshop agitation you know pushing
you know this very limited wording and
NAFTA which was put into silence public
opinion about labor rights but that's
being pushed sometimes constructively by
American unions sometimes by Mexican
workers and things and those are good
signs a Europe is a big problem in
Europe interaction among the labor
unions is apparently I don't know a lot
about this but from what I understand is
very slight you know different languages
and so on and so forth and that's got to
become a more significant factor
especially with the European Union but I
doesn't seem to be in any ways a lost
cause and all the talk you read about
discrediting the left that's ridiculous
I mean these these views that they say
are discredited or ones they've been
screaming and denouncing for all their
lives you know all through history
nothing discredited about them like mild
social democratic policies that were
quite
well you know within limits because they
leave private power essentially
unassailed but it's the collapse of
these policies that's been devastating
policies weren't discredited the and
they're by no means the limit they're
the beginning I think there's and things
like what we're talking about before say
they popular really quite spontaneous
popular reaction to things like the MA I
that's rather striking that's done with
no organization and by now you know
there are structures forming they can
interact and they can grow so it doesn't
seem to me a terribly depressing
prospect you can worry about the pace
maybe it's not adequate probably isn't
but you know the right kinds of things
are happening yeah well you know there
are things you can be you know I mean
optimism and pessimism are kind of like
personal you know that belongs to that's
what you worried when you're sitting
alone somewhere that's what you think
about otherwise you just stay optimistic
that's the only way anything will ever
happen dr. Tomsky just to let you know
ahead of time this is a critical comment
it sounds as if your work draws a lot on
CW males marks and Emanuel Wallace teens
thinking and I'm wondering what's new
and exciting about Chomsky in theory so
for us students are the social sciences
in the room what can we take away from
this lecture yeah well certainly not I
mean especially first well there's no
theory in fact I don't know of any
theories in the social sciences I mean I
don't think the term theory should be
applied to fields as intellectually thin
as the social sciences
so there's no theory oh there's just
some common-sense observations I started
off with you remember by saying that
views of this kind are commonly
described as Marxist which is kind of
ironic because the clearest articulation
is people like Adam Smith and Winston
Churchill and so on which is true the
and I think that most of this is kind of
common sense so what's the point
oh the theory is very different from
understanding most of our lives we live
our lives often pretty successfully
without any theories about other people
we don't have any theories about other
people but you know we get along and
manage our interactions and so on
there's very few areas of human life
where there's anything you might call a
theory so some areas of it like even in
biology you know it would be but when
you get very far beyond big molecules I
mean starts to become pretty descriptive
sure there's an in this in the world of
human affairs I don't think there's much
in the way of theory I think the message
you go to take is use your use your
sense look at history you know think of
obvious things you know break through
the propaganda images remember that the
institutions are trying to indoctrinate
you keep that in mind
compensate for it and if you do these
things I think you can get as good a
sense of the world as anybody has thank
you you mentioned the ongoing artificial
threat of Cuba to the United States and
I wonder if you could address radio
program called Marty that we beam as a
propaganda and maybe on a larger level
the whole apparatus of the International
propaganda broadcasting of the US mm-hmm
well the u.s. like other countries has a
state propaganda system US Information
Agency and others and it's not
particularly huge I mean this is you
know by comparative standards I don't
think it's considering the size and
scale of the United States it's not
relatively a huge program I mean I don't
think States ought to have the right to
carry out propaganda but even more
important
I don't think private entities or to
have the right to carry out propaganda I
mean maybe the individual the
individuals in them can but not as
entities private entities like the New
York Times or or General Electric or
Jorge Moscone OSA he's a person he
should have rights people should have
rights I think independent of what their
views are but whether organic entities
should have rights that's another
question as I mentioned when organic
entities were given the rights of
persons early in this century that
scandalized conservatives and what are
called classical liberals for perfectly
obvious reasons classical liberal
doctrine would school conservatism held
that rights in here and human beings
persons that means people of flesh and
blood you know not collectivist entities
legal fictions you know there were
constituted and created and given the
rights of persons by courts I think
those are things that we ought to
question why should they have the rights
to freedom from search and seizure for
example so that you don't know what
they're doing I mean I think an
individual should have it like I don't
think that cops should have the right to
go into your living room and find out
what you're up to but what about a an
organic entity should that have those
right I mean should Nazi Germany if it
have those rights for example their
Bolshevik Russia I don't think so
so why General Electric
I was very disappointed on you expose
first part in who's his world power you
did the measure you mentioned the cutter
but you read you emphasize few seconds
ago about history I mentioned you didn't
measure at all about Yugoslavia left
Yugoslavia 40 years ago I didn't extend
West that time while the heavy brows
detour you go south with Yalta with the
heron etc I'm Serbian by native citizen
United States I came in United States in
College Park I've won my political
freedom in New York but I lost my Jewish
wife from New York my personal freedom
we have daughter here who got graduated
diploma last summer
intercultural nation she cannot
understand Jewish mother always right or
wrong father Serbian so we polarized our
family of three members and a half
question my question is if organization
of European states 37 countries signed
about quarter century ago unknown
violation of board there are so many
states and former secretary Baker said
in June I do believe 21st June in
Belgrade I was not for forty years over
there then border of Yugoslavia
unviolated yet now my adopted country
side with former colonies country France
Great Britain Portugal Spain
breaking one country two pieces same
people same language two different
alphabets what about your victim to
people on third parties expose for
economic point of view for second part
about your human rights we are always
with horse with with kangaroo tails
demos Saturn my Serbian people there
know you can mushroom how you can
explain but you're there how can I
explain well first of all every case has
to be explained on its own
you're quite right i didn't mention
Yugoslavia but you know I didn't mention
99% of the world like it for example I
didn't mention so
in Africa where at the very same time as
all the as the Bosnian war was going on
ever even more people being killed in
Angola and in fact if you go back to the
Reagan years under the rubric of what
was called constructive engagement US
and British backed South African forces
killed maybe a million and a half people
and caused say sixty billion dollars of
damage I didn't mention that either I
was a lot of things I didn't mention you
know but Yugoslavia yeah we could look
at it and we sort of you know I kind of
know what happened the country was first
of all was under a dictatorship since
the 40s and that dictatorship had many
negative aspects like dictatorships do
was pretty brutal on the other hand it
did dampen lots of internal hostilities
kept him down you know the dictatorship
collapsed part of the reason why it
collapsed in fact was IMF rules so
during the 1980s it's not just the IMF I
mean during the 1980s he was likely did
go through a kind of structural
adjustment program which had the usual
effects that it's had in the third world
one of the effects that it had was kind
of breaking apart the social fabric that
happened alongside the breakdown of the
dictatorship when Slovenia and Croatia
pulled out and we don't really know all
the details but as far as is known it
looks as though there was significant
German pressure within the European
Union to let him breakaway and
facilitate their breakaway which led as
everyone predicted to conflict between
Serbia and Croatia then came you know
the Bosnian atrocities and ended up with
the u.s. moving in I after most of the
dirty work was done an imposing part in
effect partition that's you know that's
more or less what happened
now the struggle was moved on the Kosovo
which is a very complicated issue but
just to mention one aspect of it when I
said before that the Western powers and
Western opinion don't even
you know give minimal commits had no
minimal commitment to the basic
principles of international order
I mentioned Iraq but I could have just
as well mentioned Kosovo NATO which just
means the United States has no authority
to threaten or use force is independent
of what you think about what's going on
there you can think whatever you like
but there is no authorization for the
threat of use of force by the United
States or anyone else there's can I mean
you're right when you say that the whole
international order broke down in
Yugoslavia but it did everywhere else -
I mean didn't it break down when the
United States invaded South Vietnam and
then the rest of Indochina and ended up
killing dozen different languages in
Europe and breaking one small country to
pieces you watch the terror get from
broken glass you don't drink anymore
I'm sorry axis this is just one of the
innumerable problems of international
affairs every one of which has to be
looked at on its own although you find
many of the same factors behind a lot of
them - more okay plus there's two more
questions one on each side Chomsky my
thinking is more from the point of view
of India but you can answer any more
general sense I'd like you to comment
from the point of view of the so called
third world countries in the face of the
globalization for example if you take
democracy democracy seems to be closely
linked with freedom of choice but safe
to take a silly example if you take say
20 cities in India and you expose them
to Pepsi or coke for say of one month
and then take a perfectly democratic
referendum you would find that all of
them would support I mean that Pepsi
should come into India so it seems so
vulnerable to the onslaught of the
multinational corporations of
globalization well in fact when India
was sort of pressured and Indian elites
agreed remember and nene leakes agreed
and with the Western pressure to what's
called liberalize I think the first
thing
the first sector of Indian the Indian
economy that was targeted was
advertising so the first thing that
happened is big mostly New York public
relations firms and London public
relations firms went in there and just
like you described you know carried out
huge pressure to try to modify tastes
but that shouldn't really surprise you I
mean the West has been subjected to that
for hundreds of years it's I mean that's
why we have a huge public relations
industry
it's an enormous industry which is
designed to turn people I mean you know
they're not very secret about what
they're up to they want to turn
everybody into an atomized consumer who
recognizes that life is essentially
worthless you can't control your
productive life you can't control your
work life the only thing you can't talk
to anybody else because you have to be
isolated and atomized and you get your
gratification by consuming more
commodities that you don't want I mean
that's what the television is about
that's what radio is about that's what
nine-tenths of the newspapers are about
and it's been going on quite consciously
you know my gun for a hundred years okay
now it's hitting India you know my
concern is what about the solutions the
solution is I think to oh that you
strike at the heart of private power I
mean as long as as private power has
this as long as you have this
extraordinary concentration of
decision-making power in essentially
unaccountable private organic
institutions you're gonna have problems
just like you have problems if you have
the Bolshevik state I mean India is very
striking I was there you know before and
after and it was pretty striking I mean
the last time I was there was first time
I was there it was all you know Indian
food and I said the other thing last
time I was there was December January
1996 I think I was there for about a
week traveling around the country
getting talks and it happened happened
to hit a huge snowstorm so I the flight
took around 48 hours and I had turned
out I had
give the first talk at the Delhi School
of Economics right like two hours after
I land
you know after not having slept for a
couple of days so I asked for some food
you know something to eat you know what
they brought Kentucky Fried Chicken
I mean mind-boggling introduction to the
new India I mean for example the Indian
media which are not you know great
exemplars of democracy you know they're
privately owned rich people and so on
but they defended themselves against
public takeover
I mean murdoch and others want to take
them over and they just resisted India
has somewhat resisted the international
patent regime it's kind of it that's an
interesting story the United States
claims to be in favor of free trade but
really isn't
nobody is nobody powerful is at least
except for somebody else but one of if
you if you look at the World Trade
Organization one of the founding
doctrines of it is radically
protectionist that's what's called
intellectual property rights they
extended intellectual property rights
like patents for drugs you know to an
absolutely unprecedented extent and also
extended them from processes to products
products were never patented before just
processes that's not only an attack on
free trade it's also an attack against
innovation it means that some smart guy
in India can't figure out a smarter way
to produce some drug the purpose of this
is a major assault on free trade and on
innovation and growth in order to ensure
the profits of things like merck
pharmaceutical well you know India
resisted so the way you know better than
I do so fill me and if I don't have the
details right but the India there was so
much public opposition that the Indian
Parliament couldn't ratify it I think
the government went over there
if I recall correctly and ratified in
Islington yeah and by now it's kind of
interesting but the pharmaceutical India
had very cheap relatively cheap drugs
because they had their own
pharmaceutical industry looks like it's
compared to Pakistan which had
international companies the Indian
prices were much lower and of course the
purpose of all of this stuff is to make
the prices go up
at first the Indian pharmaceutical firms
objected but I noticed that now they're
not objecting which suggests maybe you
know the answer but suggests to me that
there probably linking up with the
Western pharmaceutical firms so they can
just exploit the Indians more
efficiently all of them together I guess
I mean I don't know that for a fact but
yeah these are but the point of all of
this is that India can raise is so for
example India
maintain some kind of capital controls
in fact it's kind of striking if you
look at Asia there's an Asian crisis but
there are few islands which haven't been
much affected India's one China's and
other Taiwan as another they all have
some degree of capital controls and it's
been noted in the professional
literature so India was able to resist
that kind of liberalisation and you know
when you talk about India it's kind of
misleading because there are sectors in
India the wealthy sectors the
professionals and so on who like the
globalization but look there were
sectors in India who loved the Raj you
know they enriched themselves they were
the counterpart to the Arab facade you
know you go to any third world country
you want you know the poorest one in
central Africa you'll find a sector of
very wealthy people very privileged very
wealthy people who are kind of linked up
mostly with Western power like the
people who ran India for the British and
the British didn't run it they ran it
through an Indian civil service and in
fact Indian troops and about 90 percent
of the British Army was the Indian
troops well you know those guys do fine
and they now are in favor of this kind
of liberalisation the population may
suffer but that's a different story
thank you
I read this interview with you and I
think someone I think it was Marty
parrots said that you were outside the
pail of intellectual responsibility I
was was the context of that and also how
do you respond same way everybody else
is respond I mean as he defines
intellectual responsibility that's
absolutely right for example I don't
have a slavish Stalinist like loyalty to
his holy state you know okay that puts
me out of the pail of responsibility
right off okay and then also I met this
guy who said that your last name is Tom
ski because your dad's got it with a
head is that true that's what the guys
at Ellis Island Immigration decided yeah
I mean actually as you know and from
East there Eastern European immigrants
they didn't have last names so my father
was tell you if you like but it was so
and so son of so-and-so and somewhere
along the line probably at Ellis Island
they got this name which my father did
pronounce with a cup in fact I went
through early years of schooling that
way until I finally realized that you
know I'm being put with the h's or the
something and so I just changed the
pronunciation just for convenience all
right
