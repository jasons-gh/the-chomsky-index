you have always preferred alternative
media in India everything is mainstream
even those are alternate and mostly the
garbage of the main trying to negotiate
his space and the main do you think as
an alternative anything at all and exist
I prefer the term independent media to
what kind of alternative or a basic
question it assumes that something as
the norm these other things are kind of
on the side now if you look at the
history of media in the freest countries
in the world England in the United
States very different elsewhere but here
did well studied it's quite interesting
and he was going through the same
process other was a period in the 19th
century went both in England of the
United States there was a remarkably
free breast in fact those of the periods
of the freest press in both England
States there was a very large number of
newspapers they were independent they
represented or independently represented
different groups different groups would
publish their own their own newspapers
so that would be labor dude workers and
staplers I think newspapers political
newspaper instead of a very large
variety they reach large part of the
public there was intense interest in
them people participated they wrote for
them read them carefully and so on there
was an attempt first first in England
which was more advanced in those days to
try to stop this because visits working
like it of course at first they dried
censorship and various kinds of
regulations and nothing worked but what
finally worked was just concentration
capital at advertising relies on
advertising that increased through the
late 19th century and gradually the
parts of the press that had substantial
capital or the contract advertising
revenue the group grew and developed the
point where and it's a newspapers of
published body working people in the
mills that's they couldn't repeat and
that did in fact leads to concentration
of media sandy captain in the United
States
it's probably more than a century since
you could start a newspaper in the
United States you just need too much
happen advertising revenue of person
eats you reflect the interests of
business I mean working people in a
textile plant on guys but manufacturer
does so gradually did the concentration
of media could have been England it was
really until the 1960s that ended up
with almost entirely a business person
so as late as the early 1960s to the
deal apparel which is kind of a social
democratic popular based newspaper had
more readers then the maintenance
workers put together but it did not have
a concentrated capital capital one it
could pick up paradise revenues or
decline the tabloids in England they
would sow our ultra right-wing graphics
work later or in newspapers in the 1960s
by now
is essentially nothing I mean consumers
or what they are they're innovative
press corps in the United States it was
the same little earlier this is a much
more business friend so happened earlier
and this had but even as late as the
1950s we were about 800 labor newspapers
in the United States which reached any
30 million readers from 1952 now it's
severe so now we only talk about
alternative me radio television are
quite interesting and reflect a bit of
the way business from society works the
United States is much more free than
most countries also more business or
when radio came around 1920s in most
countries it just became a national
asset and of course the airwaves are
young in the United States there was a
struggle between groups that wanted to
privatize it that groups that wanted to
keep it public anywhere else on the
public side where labor unions churches
education institution with spider groups
others on the business idols of course
business this was the New Deal period
period and greatest
influence but it was all private as the
private sector one and they want on an
interesting principal term much like I
said on the principle of freedom of
speech so in other words if you have
radio concentrated in the hands of
corporate sector and then you have
freedom but if you have the public
system national system which I know why
participation that's not freedom it's
kind of like Oh horrible freedom is
slavery but when it got to be too
television from 1950 again in the rest
of the world tourism went public the
United States wouldn't even discussion
which is the medium privatized so the
whole of television years corporate
television affect the median united
states are major corporations muslim
parts of beer conglomerates naivete and
reduce this is a regular study by the
university of california
that gave you a comedian monopoly on the
first edition of that came out i think
around nineteen eighty and we had 50
different centers of media the latest
addition I he was down to eight that's
and it's a natural process just what
happens in the business world generally
so I I tech industry for example this
it's not a free markets and such system
it's of oligopoly based on state sector
sometimes it reaches absurdity like
commercial aircraft or one of these two
experts it's now in the hands of two
corporations or a few small ones but
it's basically Airbus and Boeing and
they're constantly in litigation of the
world trade organization but which one
gets larger government subsidies viterbo
the who ll make these state based
institutions but that's competition
high-tech industries for much the same
and the media is saying other interlock
they're not identical but they come from
a narrow sector business world and never
less there plenty of opportunities and
in fact they're not used enough for
about India but here when the when cable
television came in early seventies the
comers remember every time the media the
radio television are privatized that's a
gift from the public public homes the
spectrum and it gives away to CBS or fox
or somebody is gift present for you
here's trillion-dollar present word from
the public pocket well when tape
television hand and there was enough
public pressure so that Congress passed
legislation that which allow particular
corporation to get the rights to cable
at a particular region but it required
to establish a public facility so
cambridge a few blocks from where we are
other is a public television station
which is it's not CES but by world
standards it's pretty well equipped and
that's available in it and their unused
there's a lot of media critique era
media activism but they're overlooking
real opportunities these exist in every
community
country and if you wanted you could
initiate programs there with your point
of view and it's a it's a failure of
activism and organization not to make
use of opportunities that are available
never lost quite a lot is done there are
any community radio stations there's
internet sites which may need to people
access every day which have a range of
information so there are opportunities
but the what's called mainstream is
pretty pretty much like the political
system pretty narrow framework you can't
depart from on critical issues you can't
depart from literal also XA the invasion
of Iraq is impossible in the United
States to take the same as a principal
position that we took when the Russians
invaded Afghanistan or when set up and
st. invaded Kuwait then we took a
principal position said aggression is
wrong even if you get away with it it's
still wrong the Russian atrocities in
Chechnya are condemned even though the
Chechnya by comparison of the rack is at
blooming society
rubble rusty is now rebuilt to be live
electricity and so on I mean if General
Petraeus could achieve in Iraq anything
approaching what Putin did chechnya they
probably crown him king or something but
we can't take that principal position
with regard to Iran atrocities the
invasion of Indochina Vietnam president
of China which is this day of them was
never collaboration it was committed
just like today they take the Democratic
candidates today yeah pro bono when they
can say as a strategic Iraqi this
strategic blunder we're entering into a
civil war der we cannot win clit nobody
said that the Russian vision of the
Afghanistan so many anybody else's of
trousers but when it's our own crimes
unnatural and unthinkable the same with
terror we can talk about to somebody
else's terror now but you can't talk
about to say rated starers words in
Central America which probably like that
four fetchers I'm waiting on a terribly
dirty mouth
it's just this is not single actually
George or will letter said that everyone
has read at home for at that almost note
he's ready introduction animal form the
reason is what published but in the
introduction he says when I says Animal
Farm is a satire of this it is developed
area at state but he said in free Ingram
it's not that different he said in free
unpopular ideas can be expressed without
the use of force because I'm the
discusses a very elaborate theory about
it about ten sentences he says one
reason is the press is owned by wealthy
men who every reason not the one
certified used to be expressed and
another reason it's just a good
education if you've you know if you sort
of immersed and upon the best schools
and you're part of the bathing culture
it's just instilled into you that there
are certain things you would do sit and
yeah that's pretty general
pre accurate the concentration of media
in the hands of conglomerate businessman
governs is one aspect but just
subordination to the prevailing Cochran
system which is part alien culture
schools universities and so on so no
requirement is very effective you can't
think these things you cannot think the
thought that the United States oppose
democracy throughout the world you know
it's true you kind of think the thought
that the u.s. invaded Iraq and by the
standards of Nuremberg good should be
hanged I can't think those thoughts even
though they're all true that obviously
and you can't think the thought that the
United States is not a functioning
democracy even when you see things like
the fact that some kind of national
health care was politically impossible
in 2004 that has become politically
possible in 2008 when the only variable
that has changed is big business for you
can't think what that entails that
research you'll never find it weird
about it quotes preacher bad and the
same quote some almost any other topic
you look at I'm going to take a looming
international crisis which could be very
serious a threat work and strap your ass
well every candidate every newspaper has
a uniform position on this you read the
New York Times that Iran is defining the
world because it's enriching uranium in
fact the matter is that world opinion is
overwhelmingly in favor but so the
non-aligned countries g77 so-called
large majority world they vigorous is
court hearings right to enrich uranium
like any sign or not
tree they're not part of the world the
world means we rich powerful people so
therefore your abs denying the world
it's not accepting our words us opinion
has been carefully studied attitude
starts these issues and the results are
quite interesting very large majority
American snake agree with an online
countries that I think that you ran like
other signers of a non-proliferation
treaty has a right to development clear
power but none of their weapons st.
large majority art favor of establishing
a nuclear weapons-free zone in the
entire Middle East which would include
Iran and Israel and any US versus
they're very large majority what's up
mention again very large majority are
posed two threats but about three two
one Americans are posted threats against
you read in favor of good ones every
single candidate
traver friend the effect if you ran the
United States were functioning
democracies were both in it matter Lisa
conflicts would probably be resolved
support mitigated
it's true / no but and part of the way
the one crucial means for chromatic
functioning democracy is the
concentration and control of information
I mean sometimes it's it becomes was
surreal like takes a the notion enemy
combatant what was an enemy combatant
will identity confident that somebody
was defending his own country when you
attack it so if we invade another
country and somebody say a 15 year old
kids birthstone America sole reason an
incumbent said very interesting concept
in fact it's not being used by others
what's the for example the government of
the Fellaini who recently issued an
arrest warrant for an enemy combatant
who's the enemy cometh well it turns out
to be a hero of the partisans who
struggled against the with many go keep
under the Nazis with latest recruit not
see it was a partisan leader managed to
survive isn't Jewish he went to israel
became a general of these really are me
it was the head of the Holocaust
visiting for 20 years and now when he
wants to arrest and as an enemy comment
because a partisan inglaterra burst was
fighting the Nazi reliant regime
the 1940s what they're basically right I
mean if somebody in Afghanistan Athersys
talented American soldier in his own
country is an enemy competent then
surely the remaining in its own country
to somebody's resisting its own
government in its own country but means
they'll call terror must be any code now
I mean this is so outlandish that the
press can't even purported but that's
exactly what would happen if people
elsewhere accepted parent principles and
these are not questionable account
question you cannot discuss them you
cannot think about them if you're
properly educated person the course is a
very wise dagger
you
