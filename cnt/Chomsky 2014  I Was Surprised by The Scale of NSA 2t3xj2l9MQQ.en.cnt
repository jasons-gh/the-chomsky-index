I guess crudely the Snowden stuff a
surprise and I mean by that I surprised
it quite how extraordinary it was or not
a surprise at all I think the scale was
at least to me very surprising it is in
fact phenomenal after there's a new book
by glenn greenwald i know if it's come
out here which surveys a lot of it
brings it together and it's really a
colossal campaign I was very clear that
they want to pick up everything
everything that anyone says who they
meet who they see anything you can think
of it's a hundred percent the goal is a
hundred percent collection of all
information about all of the enemies of
the state and what this reveals pretty
dramatically is something we all ought
to know that four states one of their
main enemies is a domestic population
they have to be kept under control
they're dangerous if you look at policy
decisions it's pretty consistent that
you have to control this dangerous enemy
this isn't this carries it way beyond
anything that's been done before of
course there's been plenty before I mean
I was during the 1960's I was very much
involved in resistance activities
against the war in Vietnam and we
understood that you can't talk on the
telephone and if there's anything
serious something that would involve the
particular human beings let's say a
deserter or something you couldn't even
talk in a group of friends because
there's probably a government informer
there well so everything had to be done
with affinity groups so this is well
understood and goes way back but nothing
like this scale has ever happened and
Britain agrees as you probably saw the
British government requested the NSA
provide a detailed extensive information
on cell phones social media other forms
of interaction for British citizens who
are an enemy of this state in the United
States it's it's kind of dramatic
because of the Fourth Amendment of the
Constitution the Fourth Amendment to the
Constitution part of the Bill of Rights
it guarantees the security of citizens
in their persons homes papers and
effects and bars what are called
unreasonable search and seizures as a
reason for that has to do with England
the British rulers demanded before
demanded the right to break into homes
to search them and there were pretty
bitter confrontations read in boston
where i live in fact the citizens
organizing to bar the entry of the
british officers under what were called
writs of assistance that they could just
enter wherever they like this was one of
the things that sparked the american
revolution and shortly afterwards when
the Bill of Rights was introduced in the
Constitution they made sure to put a
barrier against any such practices on
the part of the state well now the
practice the Fourth Amendment is being
violated in a way which is so dramatic
that it takes your colleagues in the
legal profession to try to figure out
how to make them consistent but then
they can always find professor who can
do the other work the role of lawyers
wait wait is that what I wouldn't I
wouldn't I wouldn't go that far but
they'll find a way to say that knowing
everything that you do is a reasonable
search search and seizure when you
