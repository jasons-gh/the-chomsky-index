good night everyone and everyone, sorry for the delay 
I would like to thank the presence of each one in each one here at the baron and that the 
teacher was 11 who had a setback 
that's why we ended up being a little late and our idea is to follow the 
following dynamic is we give him about 30 minutes to do a one 
presentation of the political picture of how he is seeing the situation is there will be 
a subsequent translation that the juliana that is here 
wanted to thank and help us with the translation is we are transmitting to 
alive who can share the networks of the baron also the transmission and the idea 
so he would do the 30 minutes and then we open for a round of 
questions and we have to finish here by 19 15 at most 
because it is not so late to enter is to thank and etes applied to have 
rio a professor chance that and have to femina to the top heavy fans 
journalist see blogger is another the picture was made 
[Music] today I wanted to say a few words 
about two extremes is given with the press 
first about the so-called free world press right the vanguard of the world 
free that would be the press in england and the united states and then on 
the Latin American press that is known for having an orientation 
quite right-wing and with little room for any divergent opinion was 
put on blue 
Jorge or theft according to the form of 
[Music] 
run away is to start I wanted to talk about the 
English press and wanted to quote a passage from a book that we all read 
that belongs to Jorge, the animal goes beyond the animals, he says that he is 
making a satire is from the totalitarian world but that england does not 
must be very full of himself considering that in england it is 
divergent opinions are usually suppressed without the use of violence 
two years ago the hotel hasn't talked much about how these divergent ideas are 
suppressed but he speaks at least two ways as 
happen one is that the press is is the means of de 
communication are held by wealthy men and the second is that people who have had 
access to a privileged education that went to oxy went to cambridge 
they simply know that there are certain things that are better left unsaid is this 
introduction in which the dio speak these things was suppressed and only appeared in 
in his papers after 30 years that had already been published 
we get to the media from Western countries, we will realize that 
these two points that the geologist raised has a lot of subsidy in this one 
press 
observed regional project joao hermann madeiro 
we get works from a mall 
we observe the structure of how the press works in these countries 
Westerners we will see that they are large corporations that belong to 
even bigger corporations that sell their product 
advertisers who are actually the real customers of these corporations 
so we have a business where the producers of their clients' news 
who are advertisers and advertising companies have the same interests 
and it is these interests that guide how this news will be modeled and how 
and what will be interesting to be printed 
[Music] 
a sixth album how to lose being in a beautiful goal per game 
will be the second question that I believe the actor said that the question that the good 
education that makes you know is what should or shouldn't be said is you realize 
that this is also working a lot because people who have 
access to an elite education have been indoctrinated and trained to do so 
very well to discern what should not be said and not to say what we can 
a step beyond what was said and realize that this has already been 
internalized so there are certain things that you not only don't say but you've already 
you know you shouldn't even let them go through your head 
and it is something that the great thing is called common sense in common gemonio 
internalized 
with 115 or 6 to 0 solutions options 
just walk in tokyo 
is the first step then is to understand how the media works how the media is put 
these instruments in operation and by that time we already have thousands of 
pages literally written about how these structures work in the 
practice and the result is exactly what we can expect simply with the 
that we can suppose by making her charge for shares is without study is not but the 
studies that prove these things although it has already been is more than 
effects are they obviously have no interest in publicizing them 
and that's what you're going to talk about now 
in his pocket are two examples of this are the big and big big 
invasion conflicts in which the United States has been involved since the 
second world war one of them was the invasion of indochina 
vietnam and another was the invasion of iraq both with abominable consequences 
creating love did not understand the movie the rocks is war 
Vietnam ended in 1975 and since then you have many opinions about it 
but basically they are divided between two fields one of the fields thinks that the states 
united could have won the war had it had a strategy is better and and 
that this would have served a noble cause 
is the opinion of liberals is usually more interesting because although they 
a little more is the law is to the left but not even an inch away 
more than what is established and one of the most important opinions 
most interesting comments was that of anthony from the new york times 
google launched the morning or da blog 
bolton rosa boss coast is the opinion of this journalist is basically that the 
war started as an incredible but noko effort to do what was right and the 
people know it is to do what was right simply because the states 
united they were doing so by definition it would be doing what is right is 
innocuous simply because they lost their 
war and from the 70's when it became very clear that that war was 
invincible what was clear in fact is that the united states was not going to get 
fail to achieve democracy and freedom in that country at a cost that 
was acceptable to the united states 
the bus arrived is mall 
is is most of the American press is about 70% of the press 
American is does not consider the war to be simply a mistake but something 
morally reprehensible is every time they did opinion polls to 
the population's response was that war was not a mistake it was one thing 
morally reprehensible and each one of those people who came to that conclusion of 
that the war was morally reprehensible had to come to that conclusion alone 
because the opinions that were divulged were that the war was an effort 
it's wonderful but noko is never those opinions that it could be something 
morally reprehensible were aired 
in today's shows dare u2 fan egg 
but when it came time to kick west de everton santos the forum was my new mall 
mixtape in the field is how political scientists finally started to 
asking why people were answering that is that the war was 
it was morally wrong is they came up with the explanation that they 
they are responding here because the united states shouldn't and shouldn't have 
enjoyed so much money and so many American lives any conflict against 
another nerdy option because it would be morally wrong is I thought I wouldn't talk 
in it or is it a death so i would be easy to get answer from 
people themselves if you do an open poll asking for a poll 
qualitative questioning why they thought war was morally 
unacceptable but that was not considered viable chopstick nobody wanted to 
this answer was true and the other answer option was only given by 
people who were very much outside the margin of mainstream media like himself 
professor phelps golden chance 
the retreat the students by aspects he died in london obama in the beginning was 
completely supported by the elite things started to go wrong this 
support began to receive but the heaviest criticism that wants war has heard yet 
so was that of president obama who considered the war over 
the strategy is your opinion about the strategic error is not an opinion 
obama's original was an opinion that some people had 
one of the German generals had in relation to the Nazi defeat to russia 
for example it is and we condemn these generals but the agent at the same time 
allows liberals to have that opinion about strategic error iraq without 
biggest consequences 
was there on the water street in boy andre is and nicaragua in the 80s is an issue 
of a lack of freedom of expression is with several vehicles being 
closed the draft and professor jonas who was invited by a friend to think 
that to give a lecture there 
is it is by a friend of his who was actually original from guatemala and not from 
nicaragua and wii is in 1989 he spent a week in nicaragua invitation is this 
friend to study a specific newspaper called there thinks about and the rangel in 
luanda the first of object action problems before who 
the owner of the urban car the favor of god for the course was one of the causes of 
gorilla digit clerk five laps 
is this newspaper la prensa he was supporting is the war while the war 
something was happening that would not happen is in most countries 
western countries and and yet the united states not only 
attentive to it as they would never discuss it was not within the field of 
things we could talk about sex I had the deadly monsters again 
in relation to venezuela is heard about the keys is venezuela was hard 
condemned by england united states and other western countries 
simply because a rts tv channel was switched to a 
smaller channel generates 
[Music] 
john scott charney and distant yet godless is he with him agrees with a 
freezing of that of england and the united states that it was a mistake of the 
he Chavez government contains in this action in relation to the 
tv channel does not agree with the second part that this would never happen in the 
united states in england this would not happen in the united states in 
england because that television channel simply wouldn't exist 
more and the editors would be shot in public square is unimaginable you have a 
coup and in the united states for example where the team is publicly 
supporting this coup and I always ask and continued is circulating in the country while 
is supporting the coup that what the country is experiencing year there was the mark of 
luxury they can have in their proposal to walk says the color itself - the pomegranate 
return of sandro roche for the attack of monte novo show and spectrum is the governments 
of left and center left here that have passed to latin america 
in the last few decades is generally had an open posture in relation to the 
press so the press continues to operate freely even though the 
press were practically universally against these governments and 
make very harsh criticisms of governments and countries in those countries 
free in central countries england united states etc 
it would never happen if I would never have a press that would be 
universally uniformly beating governments like Latin companies 
American have been were authorized by the left governments is in the middle of 
of the Chavez government the power is he was naked in chile and was 
quite shocked to know that liberals use the chile people with whom 
he talked to that he had access to were very critical of venezuela and 
thought the xavi was implementing an autocracy a dictatorship called him 
murderer and was surprised to start reading the Chilean newspapers and were 
all completely against Venezuela and only criticized and only showed the 
things that venezuela was doing and stayed away from the media for 
the years of the chavez government is a a great opinion polling agency 
Chilean did several researches is in Venezuela and trust and is one of 
Venezuelans in democracy and the legitimacy of that of their government were 
among the largest in the Latin American continent along with Uruguay and 
net discrepancy that he can from these surveys with the opinions that they 
had was something that was never much the inter na lisa don't want much discussed 
by those same intellectuals who had negative opinions about the 
Venezuela 
I think that landing is another example and asking you a question that 
know the answer is is the world's largest polling agency getting 
united states is galloping and in 2013 she did a survey asking what is 
the country that wants to makes more threats to the world more threatening to the rest of 
world there are no flowers yet 
away from the love that you felt today rui pousa do jo 
is that year is that the guys who asked this question the answer in the states 
united was always iran russia korea and the rest of the world the answer was 
basically united states and this research was never published in the states 
united and after that the agency decided to stop asking this question 
obama and michelle this is all happened during usa the thud was theoretically 
progressive government so you can imagine what the outcome of that 
research today, but then we learned that certain things are not asked 
they say is this presentation was brief but I think you can cover a little bit of 
than the current press situation in the so-called free countries and in the 
latin america which is known for being a right-wing media monopoly 
top it is tempting to continue because the examples abound 
but we will stop here and open the questions 
thank you teacher have a chance teacher that is juliana I give you to you 
folks let's do this is a water process actions is by evans and tito and 
winning the team is paulo henrique pedro de see here in front of paulo favor that we 
sorry we're not seeing rita so 3 
then you write it down and then to him paulo henrique pedro then you there to 
we pass it on to answer to open three more teachers we are who I am 
a journalist for a long time and today I dedicate myself especially to the work of is 
do political coverage on the internet 
my question is how do you explain that president squid has not 
faced the globe television network 
(Laughter) 
[Music] 
they are making us also put us into effect without the bandana for years or her or me 
I think this is what happened in Brazil was not an exception was the rule is the 
left that was in power in latin america was incredibly open surpasses 
surprisingly even open to letting the press work the way it does 
wanted is the same thing happened in nicaragua and 
in venezuela for example where the government was also heavily attacked by 
press and let it result in fighting directly and without fighting back 
directly to the press was criticizing him something that would never happen in the countries 
is where if something like that reproduces itself 
spa is immediately stopped and the newspaper editors yesterday a sound that if they were 
just prisoners stressed the judge gaucho and it is he said that these issues cannot 
be discussed in the united states i mean can he can speak these things 
by a group just like ours but cannot be discussed in the press and 
even in universities and in spaces where it should have discussed the 
good night chance teacher is the question I have here is to protect the center of 
world is you say in several articles and in different texts and not only do you 
but many people from the media, including the global one, that Brazil might be 
become a colossus we didn't get there because of 
operations against corruption such as car wash is operations of corruptions that are 
aligned to the united states this is what i wanted to know 
rio a diary from the center of the world and chisa left website is a quest brazil is up 
now to the pia home is and famous couple and stayed there for chan in a jeu de car wash 
the globe squid globe is good he said that this actually became reality that 
during the squid and dilma years brazil became a country 
the most respected country in the world during those years and achieving the 
organize the South American bloc in a way that has never been seen before and that 
it can happen again 
Rita on the line I come from a council of a public communication project was 
disassembled here in Brazil and also like several people here sodom from one 
movement and two free meters in the next more democratic but neither the 
question was a disrespect to the international society that seeks a channel like 
sack of potatoes above the economy society and brazil manifest 
Brazilian solidarity in an effective way and particularly through the 
january stories i will ask my question but you want to 
translate before the touch touch in the continuum is not shown in the direction of the 
project to witness this pressure of reality here where people 
accompanied those money only a large exposure in the reserve because the 
guys here and ask her if anything here is critical of the treatment of states - 
is finally being what to say something about torture and to think that the healer 
of the exhibition said he doesn't want it was not rap sabratha on the drive would lose 
he already understands the universe of unity and humanity and parking lots and 
this is what thinking the denial of information speech that rains train jack mills 
at home on the international scene 
damn people's heads that it was just understanding a page in that attempt 
to see from a distance I'm sorry the question was too long and fields went public 
communicate blackmail your deforesting your chances well in 2011 doing do action did 
well in lem obama's joe dante the beast there wife and in ed 
the ruler 
the girl that dante is that the sky is that of the draw and they land this way the one more 
thing about the long end of 2007 in the middle of adilson on about what i am bin 
everything falls good the engineer to the walking tse and the english and in the country and night and the end 
to keep going the end of the question if the end of the line does not stop a little new 
generation sul ect brasil 
in both trying to beat the year without them 
no instant by moment dark it is interesting to talk about the issue of torture 
in iraq because it is so far we don't even know it's a crime because it's the 
united states never signed the convention against torture and even with 
the united states is like that not these international conventions they usually 
put what he called reserves and and those reserves generally say that 
that doesn't apply to the united states so it's him 
they signed on to the issue of torture but excluding all practices that the 
cia is the torture practices that pt 
in iraq according to sources said in the silly hand 
when checking the site is today called the problem is to have a city in the matter of 
torture in iraq because unlike what happens in most other 
cases in guantanamo in the Latin American dictatorships of what happened in Brazil 
where the united states generally supervises and trains torturers 
but they don't torture themselves it's in iraq it was the soldiers themselves 
Americans who did the torture and this was considered in some way 
troubled boy falls the funk sound and informed along with jordan and 
jorgito and jorge weasley cute 
when they invaded iraq they needed some justification 
one of the justifications was that iraq would have weapons of mass destruction and 
another justification was that saddam hussein was bothered by al qaeda 
although the two justifications were completely false they needed 
collecting data and testimonials support these statements and for that they 
did they needed is it is it is it brings torture it is waves to get 
the information that at last so that your mind are being tortured and 
says untrue information 
opposes roni the new money but I went was Camboriu 
both in the breasts in the field in camboriu the final question of this is always the 
impunity is not because no one no one has been tried no one has been punished for 
torture perhaps more people some soldiers of short stature but 
there is no one is from the army elite an example of this is the r15 gr is that in 
1971 in cambodia is to release an order so that if you basically shot at it, 
with with an air strike on anything anything anything that had 
movement generated and uol andre reminded the trucker at the nightclub 
this phrase is actually even published in the new york times 
in the context where nixon's tapes were leaked and published by 
newspaper but no longer concentrated our weak alone who spoke badly 
of who than in that phrase that called cluj on the site, right 
good is just for us to get organized here there are many questions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 
people I think it will not be possible to talk all 
world is so i will try to be very quick and by trying to read the names of 
people who signed up to see if I got everyone okay, I had 
enrolled in a certain inacio the group apologized vinicius vinicius 
vanessa iran mariana you find out your name 
so mariana so ready adriano you here your name 
julia and at the watermill someone already asked that i won't have so let's try us 
is never going to be able to speak everybody my question is you said it is 
the communication issues the communication problems are not discussed by the 
big media I wanted him to comment a little on what in the 
his opinion changed with the emergence of the internet and the great 
social media platforms if he thinks this has made a contribution and 
face a little common sense or if that tact producing common sense ship 
and a new monopoly space is communication 
fine 
in that sense is this framework is conceptual and functioning from the mainstream media to media 
can be changed modified is mainly because the 
new technologies or these new technologies this new way 
this great structure of functioning of the mind will also be purchased with 
she will or cannot 
the next one does not approve the idea and today on the left thigh paulo silva that the question 
it is much more for people like you than for him and it is something that 
the question of the neutrality of 
networks and how it works is this issue that the 
internet as well as various technologies was developed by people and and 
so it's basically being taken over by big corporations and that companies like 
google for example tend to privilege the interests of others 
large corporations and leaving ordinary people other people behind and 
who and policy in this regard has now been implemented the government has taken and what 
this will probably continue in that direction if people don't 
get organized to change something 
sense square we didn't have the telesur would ask 30 question but i will try to pass 
We have data about the lawyers who studied in the states 
united are now working in the legal war in brazil children if they have 
also data from the narrative of the construction of corruption as a regional narrative 
also in the united states and also some movement in the united states to try and 
implement this feature nationwide with 12 quickly is what is the 
evaluation of the role of oa a in new military interventions in 
militarism in the region 
the first thing that the repercussion in the united states of the commission's narrative 
of Brazilian jurists who studied in the Brazilians who are currently working in the 
legal wars and we also find here in brazil a single one 
union between that between the media and the one that exists today we have a 
justice system wanted to know if the central 
interest morning alliance among your readers and if that simply 
acquisition from the quick start but who hinted that the scenario is dark 
on the floor and if the tie is completely restored when hearing the 
question is whether in the near future it could perhaps elect a socialist government if 
the establishment of American policy would allow and what impact this could 
Tue 
at night at 10 pm until the states 
unidos is not going to the show on the day in the store in vila sao jose 19 
kostiw in the mud and obama in 2008 
this to think you have to think first about what a government means 
socialist is in the united states today what has been what has been 
called socialism for example the godless bath that which claims to 
socialist is actually a social democracy 
very mild and and that this space starts he can see the chance of a 
of the government in these we have to be elected is but this is no no no it would not be surprising 
so there are ideas are also new 
the ad government is much more difficult, although it does not think it is 
an impossible thing to happen one day in the united states 
for him what we need to do at this moment is to build these 
future prospects in the present and finally implanting seeds in the na 
reality that we already have 
the cruise am not the harry economy called majorca account of us far 
of history scored a goal and played for the goal and put josue depends on what 
exactly people are studying the united states is 
a known case is that of Latin Americans who went to study economics 
of the united states in chicago mainly and became known as 
the boys from chicago who will return to their countries and remembered for 
example those who voted for pro chile did and during the pinochet government 
and succeeded in a few years with advice from economists of 
chicago is to distribute that country's economy and that is a relevant thing if 
think now if we stop to think that the economist behind the employee 
is one of those kids from chicago too so looking at this history you 
can imagine what he is intending to do here in valencia and will already sells 
made us try to close in time 
good night professor emilson vanessa martina silva magazine editor 
southern dialogues I would like to know from you is if the 
Brazil based on this non-compliance with the UN decision regarding 
of the candidacy of the ex-president of Lula Lula Brazil then becomes the state 
scoundrel and in view of this situation is this positioning of Brazil currently 
we must fear for real intervention by the united states in 
venezuela since the protagonism that the country 
Brazil exercised that in the region there was a void no longer has this leadership 
the teacher my name is to see you are journalist from the forum magazine is mine 
question is whether you think the era of reconciliation between democracy and 
neoliberalism if it is being executed if there is no more possibility 
neoliberal governments to be democratic since in Brazil for 
example the neoliberal agenda is being imposed through a coup and 
that this has also been observed in other countries in latin america 
thank you the attendant the ons the inss came in venezuela will give 
[Music] 
the factor paulo and uol 
did not understand the question is not whether the united states does not interfere in the 
venezuela because they are already interfering 
but perhaps the united states no longer has the same capacity to impose things 
latin america that they had in the last 10 or 15 years 
the countries of latin america managed to get rid of one of one of a subjugate 
so straight from the united states is not like at the time of the dictatorships 
Latin American countries that they all had not only support but specific direction 
coming from washington on hi little fan 
[Music] 
fashion rocks product top team work is in 1962 kennedy changed the guidelines of 
Latin American security armies is from the hemisphere to security 
national which is the same thing that you will take off the army collar and 
that army against its own population and that was what generated a series 
of regimes is a regime plague is across the continent is of 
dictatorial regimes he thinks the united states no longer 
have that same power over Latin American countries but that is an issue 
again that is not even discussed in the united states 
good night my angel is in heaven the door to door is was the commission of rights 
human rights of the UN that made this recommendation so that President Lula could be 
candidate in the elections but it has to see that the un and this commission are not 
respected by the united states for example we cannot think of the na 
un as an independent entity because its action is limited by what 
the most powerful nations personally united states whether or not they allow it 
give me a compliment 
the Tagus River is an example of how it operates during the Vietnam War 
the attacks by the united states on indochina have never been condemned or 
not even discussed in the un and in conversation in off several several people of the un of the high one 
echelon of the un have already discussed with him that the question is that 
whether or not to say anything is anything against the states 
united in relation to vietnam the 1 would be closed next to the body 
[Music] 
I think the kiss is just to set an example another funny example is the 
united states has a rule that it is if any american will return to 
international judo court like us 
the international criminal court is the united states can and and save that american 
rescue this American what in Europe they call the invasion law 
another question of democracy and the end of it democracy mlb and motocross is 
neoliberal and solve but the team is in solving the man 
oe mail sir you a symbol of those of the south the cold nor muller is again this 
is an issue that is in the hands of people like you if these powers are 
authorized to act in their interests 
if they do not act according to their interests and and against the interests of the 
most of the population but it is not just a question of the 
liberalism leaving neoliberalism aside we are in a dodo phase of the 
capitalism in which anyone who knows how to read knows that we are facing 
of a problem of existence even though the issue of global warming by 
example is jeopardizing the continued existence of humanity 
and in view of that what big corporations and use 
governments of different countries have done is not only is not to limit the use of 
fossil fuels for example but how to maximize this use and invest 
more and more on that so it's an example is we don't even have 
words is to write and that kind of attitude 
but it is a radical example of what capitalism is you should do is 
you must invest in profit even when it means not investing in 
continuity of the human species and human societies but this is what the 
people are watching it happen now is I had ten questions 
we had four more subscribers but we had a schedule agreement with the 
professor johns that we would finish at 9 15 we are finishing at 9 and 18 i 
wanted to apologize for 1 to 0 and 6 1 to julia for mariana rotten year but the 
We would like to thank you for the chance 
guerrilla fans of the night is neither effective nor the mother wanting to read the 
request is wire is obliged to everyone and I stand before 6 love says of the Finnish wi fi and wi 
fi and ethernet
