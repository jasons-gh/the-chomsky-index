the primary attribute of supernatural
thinking is that there are magical
entities or forces which control the
fate of humanity on the contrary most
natural ists argue that humans are
actually just one sort of animal very
much a part of the natural world this
then means that our behaviors are
determined by some combination of a
genetic makeup and the environment from
birth to death act and howl with that
environment acts on those genes do you
think such a naturalism leaves open the
possibility of free will which seems to
contradict our notion of
cause-and-effect universe no it doesn't
contradict anything it just says that we
don't know whether the phenomenon that
we all experience it's our most
immediate experience the phenomena of
freedom of will is a real aspect of the
universe that we simply don't comprehend
yet or maybe ever or whether it's an
illusion that can be explained in some
other fashion that question just remains
open there's plenty of things we don't
understand for example we don't really
have a an intuitive grasp of something
which now naturaliss take for granted
namely that if I move my hand I can I'm
moving the moon you know that there can
be interaction at a distance when Newton
proposed that he regarded as a total
absurdity that's why he which is he said
no person of sound scientific
understanding can imagine to be true for
a moment if I spent the rest of his life
trying to find some way to get around it
as did leading scientists of his day but
four centuries afterwards it finally
became scientific common sense well
there are things about the world we just
can't comprehend and we don't know how
far if we are just part of the animal
world as I believe and I think you
believe then our cognitive capacities
are going to be like all our other
capacities they'll have a certain scope
and they'll have certain limits that's
the nature of a biological organism so
you're suggesting that until we know
more about the workings of the human
mind or you know that neuroscience is
starting to show us we can't defeat come
down one way or another on the freewill
question
it's more of a matter of intuition and
still in the realm of philosophy
Bertrand Russel pointed out back in the
1920s and I think correctly that there
are several grades of confidence that we
have or we should have in our belief
system the highest confidence is in our
immediate experience mmm the second
level of confidence he said is in the
report of immediate experience by others
who are like us and the third level the
lowest level of confidence would be in
the scientific constructions that we
develop to try to make some sense out of
our experience well you know our most
immediate experience I can't think of
anything more immediate and less
questionable is that I could decide
right now to say hang up the phone or
start talking about you know the Boston
Red Sox or a thousand other things but
I'm not going to do it because it
wouldn't be appropriate our most
immediate experience is that we act in
ways which are somehow appropriate to
situations which is quite different than
saying they're caused by them now maybe
there is some way of accounting for our
choices in terms of the circumstances in
which were placed and something internal
to us but you know that's a thesis it's
certainly counterintuitive and and I
think philosophers who discuss what do
you call themselves determinists like
your friend of mine ten hundred would
argue that it is counterintuitive and it
might be easier to dismiss what they
call counter causal freewill and then to
affirm pure determinism but it is it is
a very complex question I don't even
believe that it's a complex question I
think it's something that we simply do
not know mm-hmm there are a lot of
things we don't know one of them is
whether the immediate experience of
freedom of will is an illusion or
whether it is in fact an aspect of the
universe that we have not yet come to
comprehend and that our cognitive
capacities may not allow us to
comprehend just as our cognitive
capacities we are serious about it are
like Newton's they do not like
allow us to comprehend the fact that
action without contact as possible we
accept it and we understand theories
about it but there's a big difference
between intelligibility of theories and
intelligibility of the world in fact
what happened in the Newtonian
revolution took a long time for it to
sink in was that the aspirations of
science were lower in the early modern
scientific revolutions a Galileo up
through Newton and beyond the assumption
was guiding idea was that the world is
like is a kind of a complicated machine
sort of like a clock you know in the
fancy clocks that artisans write just a
lot more complicated and we can
understand it and we and our goal is to
try to gain the understanding of how
this machine works well when Newton came
along he was accused of reviving occult
forces the things that machine can't
have like action at a distance and he
really he was accepted that and you know
he's not a fool nor were the other great
scientists of the day and in fact if you
look at what really happened over time
the aspirations were lowered the goals
of science were lowered from
intelligibility of the world which we
kind of give up to intelligibility of
theoretical explanations of the world
which we hold and try to pursue well the
reason why I'm asking this question at
all because I think it might be
important due to the understanding it
might offer us and how we treat one
another especially with regard to say
the criminal justice system for instance
if we understand that we're not
ultimately responsible for our actions
as determinists say we might want to
alter our rather punitive methodology
regarding methodology regarding
punishment and reward and we focus our
efforts on creating a healthier
environment from the get-go I think I
mean I agree with your goal we should
know what you're describing but I think
that's totally independent of what
speculations we have about the nature of
freedom of the will we do it anyway I
mean in our ordinary lives and in human
affairs we simply take for granted that
people have freedom of will just as
seeing ourselves and that they therefore
have moral responsibilities how we
proceed to deal with the questions that
arise that's a matter of the level of
humanity and of civilization that we've
achieved
