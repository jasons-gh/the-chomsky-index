if you look at the debate over American
foreign policy in these years you find
that it has some very interesting
properties until the late 60s when the
pressure of the student movement sort of
compelled the universities and the
journals and so on to at least pay a
little bit of attention to some critical
scholarship until that time it's quite
fair to say I think that American
scholarship with regard to foreign
affairs oscillated you know fell
somewhere on a spectrum that was defined
between two extremes at the one extreme
you have what is sometimes called the
Orthodox version as presented by people
like Herbert Feist or well essentially
Arthur Schlesinger and others like that
which essentially gives you might say
the government version of events
presents the state religion at the other
extreme you had the critics who were
often called the realists critics people
like George Kennan and Hans Morgenthau
and if you look at the debate that took
place between the Orthodox theorists and
the can and the critics you discover
something rather interesting about the
way in which a system of propaganda and
indoctrination functions the Orthodox
critics held very much as Schlesinger in
that comment that I mentioned that the
United States is unique among the
nations of the modern of the world and
modern history in there maybe any
history in that it it hasn't it really
has no foreign policy it's sort of
blunders about in the world you know
reacting to what other people do guided
by kind of an abstract moralism I mean
benevolence concern for wilsonian
principles of freedom and
self-determination and so on but these
are for some reason that the United
States does is too naive and simplistic
to really have any concept of material
interests that we just kind of you know
basically react or defend ourselves or
something of that kind
that's the Orthodox view now the
critical view the view of the critics of
this is very revealing and interesting
it's always much more interesting in
studying a propaganda system to look at
the critics that is the ones who are
tolerated the tolerated critics what the
critics say is yes it is true that the
United States is unique among the
nations of history in this lack of
policy and commitment to abstract moral
principles but this is bad because what
we ought to do is
have a more committed the understanding
of the national interest and pursue that
and so the debate rages between these
two polarized extremes all of whom of
course accept the same tacit and
fundamental premise that the United
States is unique among the nations of
past and present history etc etc now as
I said the work of the realist critics
is the work that certainly gives you the
deepest insight into how the system
functions and to take a to get an idea
what I'd suggest is those are interested
to take a look for example at some of
the work that was coming out in the
early 60s that's an interesting period
because that's a moment when the
intelligentsia got what they thought was
their shot at power Kennedy seemed to be
inclined to bring some of the you know
the eastern liberal intellectuals into
at least rubbing shoulders with people
who made big decisions and so on and
that led to a feeling of euphoria on the
campuses and in intellectual circles and
a interesting outpouring of literature
which is worth looking at and again well
I think maybe the most interesting work
is say perhaps that of Hans Morgenthau
who's a very interesting figure for one
thing because he is a very serious
political analyst and furthermore
because only a few years after this he
in fact he was so close to the limits of
what is tolerated as you know legitimate
and critical analysis and therefore he's
an interesting figure to look at when
you and he's also sort of you know the
grand figure of American political
science and hard-headed political
analysis and so on he has a book that
came out I think in 1961 or 62 about
then called the purpose of America and
that's very interesting reading he
describes in there what he calls the
transcendent purpose of the United
States and he says the United States is
different from other countries in that
other nations other states developed
their purpose after they came into
existence but in the case of the United
States its purpose actually preceded its
existence that is the United States came
into existence to realize an already
existing purpose that's why he calls it
a transcendent purpose and that purpose
was
the search for equality and freedom for
ourselves and for the world and he says
that American policy since that time has
been guided by this transcendent purpose
what he calls the national purpose well
he's a historian and he then goes on to
look at the history of historical record
and he says well you know you look at
the historical record you find some
funny things
I mean slavery for instance for a
century and you know degradation of
ethnic minorities since you find
intervention in Central America but he
says these were just isolated forays of
no significance and then the
intervention in the Philippines but
again that was just a sort of a random
event we forget about that statistical
error and so on and then then he goes on
to describe these these things and he
says well he says many critics who have
looked at this historical record have
concluded that all of this talk about
national purpose and our commitment to
wilsonian ideals and so on is just
rhetoric intended to disguise what's
really going on he says well you know
those critics you can sort of understand
them but he says they're committing a
fundamental error of logic and the error
of logic is this I'm quoting they're
confusing reality with the abuse of
reality now reality you have to get this
reality is what is the national purpose
as it was intended the abuse of reality
is what actually happened and then he
says this is really there I'm not making
it up if you don't believe me look at it
he then goes on to say that they're
committing what he calls the error of
atheism which has criticized religion on
similar grounds and that's a very astute
comment in fact we should also draw the
further conclusion that in fact the what
what he and most of a good deal of
academic scholarship is presenting is a
kind of religion thus take religion and
we might call it that is a set of
beliefs that you're just supposed to
have if you want to be a civilized and
you know well behaved person with a good
shot at a job and that sort of thing and
in fact it is committing the error of
atheism to raise you know to to mix up
what really happened with the religious
doctrine to which we are about what we
are
- about that - which we are actually
committed
