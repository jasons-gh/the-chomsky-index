a decade ago we were celebrating the
birth of a global justice movement which
could properly be called the
globalization movement if that term had
not been stolen by powerful sectors
state and private for whom globalization
means a particular form of international
economic integration it's a mixture of
liberalisation and protectionism in the
interests of the designers not
surprisingly along with drastic
provisions to enhance investor rights
these are the natural preferences of
those who meet in Davos the de facto
world government run by the Masters of
the Universe in the words of the
business press the global justice
movement in sharp contrast seeks
authentic globalization a global
integration in a much broader sense and
crucially in the interests of people not
narrow concentrations of power within
the reigning doctrinal system it is
therefore called anti-globalization the
global justice movement has registered
some successes in the past decade most
strikingly perhaps in the region were it
gained its first large-scale public
expression South America the site of the
earliest meetings of the world Social
Forum in the years since for the first
time since the European conquests South
America has taken significant steps
towards the two forms of integration
that are essential if the region is to
escape the repression and suffering that
have been the fate of the vast majority
on
colonial and neo-colonial rule the first
form is integration among the countries
themselves which is a prerequisite for
independence the second is internal
within each of the societies the
traditional structure has been the rule
of a small Europeanized elite enriching
themselves and protected from the sea of
misery around them in both respects the
steps towards integration of in halting
but real encouraging and potentially
quite significant in the move towards
integration a some organizational
structure has been taking shape one
example is who know sewer the Union of
South American Nations in September 2008
unas were met in Chile to consider the
violence that had just erupted in
Bolivia as traditional elites with us
backing of course sought to regain the
power they had lost in the impressive
bolivian elections of December 2005 the
una Sur meeting condemned the massacre
of peasants by the quasi secessionist
elements the traditional rulers and
declared quoting them their fullest and
decided support for the constitutional
government whose legitimacy had just
been even more strongly ratified in the
recent referendum in response president
Morales I thanked Luna sir for its
support and observed in his words that
for the first time in South America's
history the countries of our region are
deciding how to resolve their own
problems without the presence of the
United States that's true
and it's of historic significance a year
later another una Sur meeting took place
this time in Ecuador and in this case
under the shadow of renewed US military
intervention Ecuador had expelled the
United States from its monta base in
Ecuador last military base in South
America Washington reacted that once by
gaining six new military bases in
Colombia it's one remaining military
ally in the region President Obama
recently added two new bases naval bases
in Panama Semmy colony unas were met
again last September and expressed
serious concern over these developments
particulars expressed over I recently
discovered US Air Force documents which
explain actually I'll quote them
explained that the bases would provide
the Pentagon with the capacity for
full-spectrum dominance in almost all of
Latin America to respond to the constant
threat from narcotics funded terrorist
insurgencies and addi US governments and
to improve theater security cooperation
and expand expeditionary warfare
capability the documents also outline
longer-term plans to link these
capacities to the Africa command that's
part of Washington's system of
full-spectrum dominance of the entire
world the u.s. also reactivated the
fourth fleet which operates in Latin
America and Caribbean waters it had been
dismantled 60 years ago
Washington has also sharply increased
training of Latin American officers with
the mission of come
adding radical populism that's a concept
that's understood all too well in Latin
America the traditional means of
Imperial control have been violence and
economic strangulation and these have
lost much of their power as a result of
moves towards independence in South
America and also diversification of the
global system but they have not been
abandoned as these recent developments
illustrate there have been three
military coos in Latin America in the
new century the first was in Venezuela
in 2002 it was quite openly supported by
Washington which had to back off and
turn to subversion that when the coup
was quickly overthrown by a popular
uprising the second military coup was in
Haiti that carried out by Haiti's
traditional torturers France and the
United States which spirited the elected
President to Central Africa and has
sought to bar his return to the
hemisphere and the third was in Honduras
just a few weeks ago in that case the
last case Obama separated the United
States from all of Latin America almost
all of Latin America and Europe by
accepting the military coup which his
administration refused to describe in
these terms
virtually alone the United States
recognized the elections which were then
held under military rule Obama's
ambassador to Honduras
Hugo Lawrence called the elections a
great celebration of democracy
he was echoing Kennedy Johnson
ambassador to Brazil
Lincoln Gordon after the us-backed
military coup in 1964 organized during
the Kennedy administration
right after the assassination that coup
instituted the first of the neo-nazi
national security states that spread
through the continent leading to the
worst repression worst plague of
repression in its history that Gordon
was very proud of the coup he exulted
that the Brazilian coup was the most
decisive victory for freedom in the mid
20th century and he added that the
democratic forces as he called them the
democratic forces now in charge should
create a greatly improve climate for
private investment much like Honduras a
great celebration of democracy with
similar effects the ties between the
Pentagon and the Honduran military are
so close and US aid is so decisive for
this virtual client state that the US
could easily have joined Latin America
and Europe in defending democracy but
Obama chose to keep to the tradition
democracy democracy is fine if and only
if it occurred with US state than
corporate power interests so it's fine
and Eastern Europe at least up to a
point but not in our own domains the
vast majority of US aid to Honduras was
never suspended after the coup in
contrast after recent military coos in
Mauritania and Madagascar Aid was
immediately suspended the u.s. also
prevented the Organization of American
States from adopting a resolution
refusing to recognize under an elections
carried out under the dictatorship
elections that Washington quickly
applauded the coup in Honduras preserves
for Washington its pol Merola military
base which was called the unsinkable
craft carrier for the us-run forces
attacking nicaragua during Reagan's at
terrorists wars in Central America in
the 1980s and that base is becoming
increasingly valuable today as Latin
America especially South America it
takes steps towards independence after
the under an election such as it was
Arturo
Valenzuela that's Obama's State
Department official in charge of Western
Hemisphere affairs he told the press
that the issue is not who is going to be
the next president the Honduran people
decided that choosing between two coup
supporters that while the elected
president was holed up in the Brazilian
Embassy Obama's representative to the
Organization of American States
meanwhile instructed the backward Latin
American peons that they should join the
United States in the real world
abandoning their world of magic realism
and they should recognize the military
coup as big brother had done Obama even
broke new ground in support for the
military coup there are two
government-funded organizations that are
supposed to support democracy in the
world the International Republican
Institute the National Democratic
Institute two political parties the
International Republican Institute
regularly supports military cooze to
overthrow elected governments most
recently in Venezuela and 2002 and Haiti
in 2004 but up until now the National
Democratic Institute had held back
including these two cases in Honduras
for the first time Obama's National
Democratic Institute agreed to observe
the elections under Miller
Rule unlike the Organization of American
States and the United Nations which are
still wandering in the realms of magic
realism refusing to join the United
States in the real world the overthrow
of democracy in Honduras takes its place
in deeply rooted and consistent policies
and attitudes which trace far back they
traced back to the monitor of doctrine
in the 1820s which essentially declared
that the u.s. is sovereign and the
hemisphere well that couldn't be
implemented at the time because of the
British deterrent but later it was as
u.s. power increased and Britain's
declined and it's taken very seriously
when Cuba finally attained its
independence in 1959 the United States
reacted at once within months in fact
with significant terror escalated during
the Kennedy administration and economic
warfare and the reasons were plainly
stated in internal documents of the
Kennedy Johnson era the reason was
Cuba's successful defiance of American
policies going back 150 years that is to
the monitor of doctrine Russians just
defined successful defiance of orders
the warfare over these years has been
carried out with quite incredible savage
or in intensity it's quite enlightening
to look at the details and also in
opposition to the will of the public
well that's normal but more
interestingly even in opposition to
major segments of the business world the
pharmaceutical industry is energy
industries agribusiness and so on that's
more unusual and it's an indication of
the importance of the state interest
in punishing successful defiance that's
what we might call the Mafia doctrine
one of the leading principles of
International Affairs the Godfather does
not tolerate disobedience for good
reasons it might spread and the system
of control might erode the basic
outlines of policy were outlined with
regard to Latin America were outlined by
the National Security Council in 1954
quote their document primer the primary
threat to US interests in Latin America
is posed by radical and nationalistic
regimes that appeal to the masses of the
population and seek to satisfy the
popular demand for immediate improvement
in the low living standards of the
masses and development for domestic
needs these tendencies conflict with the
demand for a political and economic
climate conducive to private investment
with adequate repatriation of profits
and protection of our raw materials ours
though by accident they happen to be
somewhere else a large part of
subsequent history flows from these
unchallenged conceptions Honduran
President Zelaya was beginning to
challenge these fundamental principles
the New York Times reported with unusual
clarity that the coup reflected a
yawning political and socio-economic
divide for the small upper class as olia
was becoming a threat to what they
called democracy namely the rule of the
most powerful business and political
forces in the country the Gir x account
is quite accurate
he was initiating such dangerous
measures as a rise in the miserable
minimum wage in a country
60% live in poverty so plainly he had to
go Honduras is a weak enough state and
sufficiently under US control so that it
was possible to resort to the classic
method of military cool-cool of course
concealed with polite rhetoric well
there's much more to say about imperial
projects in the Western Hemisphere and
elsewhere but I'll drop the matter which
I think Tariq will address in his talk
today without further elaboration as
these examples illustrate the progress
towards a new world with more respect
for peace and justice is not mirrored in
the north and much the same is true
internal to the rich countries that
we've just witnessed the dramatic
collapse of the neoliberal policies that
have wrought havoc in the south and also
in the rich countries to the in so far
as they've been applied limited ways in
the United States real wages for the
majority of the population have
stagnated or declined for 30 years while
economic growth has found its way into
very few pockets that bringing about the
worst inequality at least since the
1920s perhaps ever that's one of the
many harmful consequences of the
substantial shift shifts in
international economic policies from the
1970s when the post-war Bretton Woods
system was abandoned and the
financialization of the economy began in
its grim course at the beginning of this
process in the United States financial
institutions accounted for perhaps 3
percent of gross domestic product now
it's about a third an important
concomitant was the hollowing out of the
productive capacity of the domestic
society blowing an air bus that now
virtually monopolized commercial
aircraft production and one of the more
comical performances in the World Trade
Organization is their constant battle
about which one gains more state support
than our free market economies Boeing is
a virtual offshoot of the US Air Force
and NASA the Space Agency it's now
transformed itself into largely a
managerial operation it supervises the
production of parts abroad
similarly the Obama administration which
has pretty much taken over the auto
industry is helping it to dismantle
manufacturing plants destroying the
lives of the workforce and communities
while the Secretary of Transportation
flies to Europe to use federal stimulus
money to obtain contracts for the
high-speed rail transport that the
country desperately needs and that could
be built by the skilled workforce in the
plants that are now being dismantled but
with less profit for the financial
institutions that increasingly govern
the society actually there was a
interesting illustration of that just
this morning the Ford Motor Company is
thinking of dismantling plants in the
United States and transferring them
right across the border to Canada a very
similar Society but different in some
respects that one is that it has a more
or less rational health care program in
the United States healthcare is about
twice the per capita cost of other
industrial countries and some of the
worst outcomes and it's the only
implicit it's the only privatized system
with very little regulation two factors
of course correlate and it costs auto
companies a thousand dollars or more a
year to produce a car in Detroit and
across the border because largely
because of the healthcare costs and
right now in Washington
the insurance corporations and the
financial institutions are exulting
because they've succeeded in preventing
any meaningful change in the healthcare
system and one effect is further
transfer of productive production from
Detroit to say Windsor Canada right
across the border the connections are
obvious but rarely drawn the collapse of
the financial institutions and also the
collapse of the reigning doctrines of
efficient markets have posed no
long-term problem except of course for
the general population the primary
agents of the collapse were at once
selected by President Obama that to put
some bandages on the wounds and they
performed their tasks admirably the
banks and the investment firms are
delighted with their performance profits
and bonuses have risen to historic
heights thanks to the huge public
bailout and the success of the Masters
of the Universe in undermining any
thought of meaningful regulation there
were some fears that the Senate might
venture into this dangerous territory
but the fears were overcome two days ago
when the Senate Banking Committee
surrendered to business power so any
thought of minor of regulation is now
out the window the biggest firms like
Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase are
even bigger than before and are able to
drive out competitors thanks to the
government organized mergers and their
privileged access to cheap credit all
backed with a significant expansion of
the government insurance policy which is
called too big to fail that enables them
to make risky and hence profitable
transactions without undue concern about
consequences because they'll be bailed
out accordingly they are prospering well
regional and come
banks which serve the public are
struggling and steadily failing so the
business press informs us actually the
scandal has reached such proportions
that the leading business weekly
Business Week ran a cover story with the
title Wall Street versus America they
were reviewing how sharp lawyers and
investment firms investment firms
managed to cheat cities towns pension
funds and other public entities of
billions of dollars with deceptive
claims and hidden conditions leaving
wreckage in their wake all within the
law such as it is the too-big-to-fail
government insurance policy exacerbates
an inherent in efficiency of markets in
a transaction the participants look out
for their own welfare but they ignore
what economists call externalities the
impact on others so if it's well managed
Goldman Sachs takes into account the
cost to itself if a loan fails but it
doesn't take into account what's called
systemic risk the effect throughout the
financial system which can be huge
in fact as we've just once again seen
well that's almost bound to bring the
system down periodically all of that is
well known but ignored and in any event
the powerful win alan greenspan who was
the prophet of the religion that markets
no vest did pronounce the words
irrational exuberance during the tech
boom of the late 1990s that he
supervised and he's been criticized
since for not following through to do
something about it particularly when the
tech boom was followed by an eight
trillion dollar housing boom which
somehow escaped the notice of the
Federal Reserve Bank that he headed as
well as almost all economists
but it's the wrong criticism it's
completely rational exuberance when the
government is there to bail you out the
basic insight was provided by Adam Smith
he pointed out that the principal
architects of policy in England and his
day that was the merchants and
manufacturers is that they make sure
that their own interests are carefully
secured by the policies they design
however Grievous the impact on others
including the general population much
has changed in the past 250 years but
Smith's maximum retains its force and
we're seeing it today the same is true
of fundamental market inefficiencies
they remain now by now they are so
severe that they suggest a revision in
the guiding theme of the early global
justice movement the theme that a better
world is possible by now we have to ask
whether a world is possible at all at
least a world in which there's some hope
for decent survival the predictable
failure of the Copenhagen conference
brings that question to the floor quite
ominously the Masters of the Universe
have announced publicly that they will
do everything they can to undermine even
mild energy and environmental
legislation in the United States and
their intense propaganda has been
extremely successful in the United
States concern over global warming has
dropped very sharply during the past
year due to intense business propaganda
most people are just confused by now
barely a third of the population think
that human activity contributes to
global warming
well the Masters understand as well as
the scientific community that their
actions may lead to a terminal crisis
and that the world that they mostly own
may well be destroyed but their choices
are quite
national within the reigning
institutional and doctrinal systems the
goal is a short-term profit and market
control the fate of the species can be
dismissed as an externality and those
who refuse to play that game are likely
to be forced to abandon it
the term capitalism is hardly
appropriate for the prevailing systems
designed by the architects of policy
systems that socialize cost and risk and
privatize eventual profits but the
fundamental market deficiencies remain
and they are well implanted in the
political economy and the power of
concentrated capital has predictably
lethal impact unless the global justice
movement is able to show that a new
world is possible
and soon the opportunity to do so may be
lost forever
