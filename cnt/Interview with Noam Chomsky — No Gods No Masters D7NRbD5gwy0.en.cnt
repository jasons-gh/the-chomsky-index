English sorry for my French with worst
what's called anarchism I have to be
careful about this what was called
anarchism was a pretty much an immigrant
phenomenon
actually there were indigenous
developments sometimes called anarchism
sometimes not which are similar in many
ways so people don't call the Knights of
Labor or the farmers alliance anarchism
these were huge popular movements which
had kind of Erica strange to them they
never heard of anarchism if you look at
factory workers right around here in New
England where the Industrial Revolution
began in the 1840s 1850s they were
despont as they had a labor press which
was a very lively
labor press in which working people were
participating and artisans young women
from the farms and so on and a lot of it
was anarchist themes they never heard of
anarchism the you know workers should
those who own and who work in the mills
should own them we don't want to who
were being degraded by the force of
capitalist oppression we should be free
we should have our free rights as humans
they're taking away our culture and so
on a very similar to the themes you get
in the anarchist writings there was also
a parallel the farmers movement remember
it was mostly an agricultural society
but there was a huge spontaneous farmers
movement actually rooted in Texas it's
hard to believe when you come
but none quite radical radical populist
movement the farmers were being wiped
out by merchants banks and and they were
trying to find ways out of it and as
they tried to work their way out of it
they began to form cooperatives first
marketing cooperatives later production
cooperatives finally even financial
independent financial institutions to
free them from they didn't call it Wall
Street then from the New England you
know that the Boston bankers and so on
the New England bankers who were
strangling them and they tried to you
know and they had just plain mostly with
people without any formal education you
know just somebody had been to school
for two years as what they called
lecturers going around but most of the
country organizing people and so on
became he point
it's the largest radical democratic
movement
the Industrial Revolution was beginning
and working people were beginning to
struggle against the growing business
system later the corporate system and
you see it in the labor press of the
kind that I mentioned there were people
bitterly combating what they call the
new spirit of the age gained wealth for
getting all but self that's not the way
we live we live cooperatively we help
each other work we have a high cultural
level which in fact they did and it's
all being destroyed we're being degraded
that had not turned into the night so
that's one of those streams that led to
the Knights of Labor which was quite a
massive organization hundreds of
thousands of people it was destroyed
that they tried to link up into a farmer
labor alliance became the populist
movement among the agrarian population
the quaint lively labor movement and I
mean it some in the late an 1890s I mean
in the mining and steel areas like
western Pennsylvania they were running
the towns they had the mayors and so you
know it was pretty much crushed by force
right through this period Knights of
Labor were crushed and by Jay Gould you
know in the gang you know security
forces smashed up the strikes they were
never able to figure out a way of
preventing scabs strike breakers and
that they were used along with National
Guard and private security forces just
to smash up strikes
there was a substantial Jewish anarchist
movement including people imagined like
Emma Goldman Alexander Berkman others
and it was organized the newspapers
schools working class organization
actually my own father who came here as
an immigrant in 1913 went to work in a
sweatshop he actually joined the IWW he
didn't exactly know what it was but just
seemed like these guys he told me once
they were for the workers he joined them
you know but and they were what that
wasn't Jewish particularly but she was
in it but by the time I came on the
scene in the 1930s some of the
newspapers are still around like fry our
plate there damn it it was there and it
was read that it was small I mean I
spent time as a kid and the offices of
fry or Veidt Thurston had just told him
to older people picking up pamphlets and
things like that of course there was
also a major Italian anarchist movement
which was developing the same way I mean
immigrants coming in German anarchist
movements and others the the and then
there were the independent indigenous
forces like say the huge farmers
alliances Knights of Labor or labor
movement so on and they had various
relations but by the 1920s it had been
pretty much silence mostly by force
actually there's a very important book
on American labor history by David
Montgomery
labor historian it's called something
like the rise and fall of the House of
labor or something like that and the
fall as the 1920s
the United States a very violent labor
history there was there were no way of
preventing strikebreakers troops were
brought in if they had to homestead
Pennsylvania which was basically a labor
run town that was just smashed up by
force when Berkman tried to kill Frick
it was in response to the violence of
the Carnegie private security and state
security forces that were used just to
smash up the labor unions and the
activists murderers I mean as late as
the 1919 30s that workers were still
being killed in the United States on in
labor actions it hadn't happened in
Europe for decades no in fact when even
conservative visitors came to the United
States they were appalled by the way the
labor was treated you know the London
Times Australian unionists and so on you
know the civil war never really ended in
the United States literally you take a
look at the 2012 election at the take a
look at the electoral maps of the day
after the election you know the red and
blue states and it's the Confederacy in
the Union lost exactly and out of the
Civil War came sectional parties the
tufa there were two political parties
Democrats and Republicans but they
reached sectional the motto was you you
vote the way you shoot was and the two
sectional parties never became class
parties they were both taken over by
entrepreneurs and bankers and so on so
and that goes right to the president you
don't have class parties you know
there's no parliamentary Labour Party I
mean this you know differences between
the two parties but they're both
basically business parties and that goes
way back to the Civil War we've never
gotten out of it black population being
criminalized sent to prison
a workforce a lot of the Industrial
Revolution came out of that and
antagonisms between race antagonists
were used and exploited to break up
working-class organization and the same
was true the immigrants so for example
in Boston right here you go back to the
late 19th century Irish were regarded as
kind of like Negroes you know you could
have restaurants saying no dogs or Irish
and things like that and it was what
were called Haun's meaning almost
anybody from southeastern Europe and so
on they were hated and the this complex
society led to a lot of internal
conflict
Bolshevism was the blow Stalinism turned
it into something for a test they were a
particular kind of orthodox MARSOC
Marxist to hell that the you know the
revolution will have to be led by the
proletariat in the most advanced
capitalist country which for them was
Germany so they were looking forward to
a revolution in Germany in the late
teens you know nineteen seventeen and
eighteen and then Russia would become a
kind of backwater well there was a
uprising in Germany but it was crushed
by force that was gone and after that
they simply moved to a form of basically
state capitalism and yes there were
anarchists armies in Russia itself like
the mono army which were used to drive
off the whites but then destroyed by the
Red Army they didn't want any they
wanted a tight ship that they were going
to run Florence came and it was the last
gasp of any independent left in Russia
there was kind of a widespread belief
that somehow this is a socialist
revolution now this is going to be the
leadership of the World Socialist
Movement in fact my view was a very
reactionary movement from the beginning
from nineteen eighty and seventeen and
eighteen yet but the picture that emma
goldman and others gave after they were
there but i think it was you know i
wasn't alive but looking back it seemed
the obvious that from the very beginning
however that became the leadership of
the left and as a result that it under
seriously undermined a real popular
radical forces
there was an anarchist important
anarchist revolution in 1936 first of
all a major strains of anarchism like
anarcho-syndicalism were assumes they
were gonna have a highly organized and
highly structured society based on
voluntary association on federalism that
kamil structures cooperatives all kinds
of things and sometimes it was spelled
out an enormous detail the for example
is a book by I think an Argentine
anarchists was about to Santa yawn and
must be 1936 or so which it's called
something like after the Revolution and
it's a it's a critique of Spanish
anarchism and a description of what it
ought to be like and he gives an
extremely detailed picture of what an
anarchist society should be like but
that was within the spirit of the
anarchist movement yes they intended to
have an organized structured society
organized from below controlled from
below but not just we say no here's what
we want that was crushed mainly by the
communists to preserve by force I mean
the Communists in Spain were the
petty-bourgeois the police and so on and
Stalin didn't want to he didn't want to
popular revolution anywhere
there's an understanding kind of an
intuitive understanding everywhere that
we need not submit ourselves to this
neoliberal tyranny and we've got to rise
up against it that takes different forms
in different places in many ways the
major one was Latin America Latin
America in the last 10 years has
undergone a really historic change and
it's a largely a revolt against the
neoliberal structures of of Washington
Consensus that Latin American elites had
adhered to very rigorously they were
constantly being praised by the for
their you know loyalty to the great
principles but for the population was a
disaster it's and about a decade ago
they began to pull out of it and for the
first time in 500 years to move towards
some kind of integration towards
throwing out extra cating themselves
from imperial domination and also
dealing with the internal problems of
societies with potentially quite rich
societies which a lot of resources and
so on but a tiny a Leeds Europeanized
mostly white in a huge mass of poverty
and they're beginning to confront this
and it's showing up in international
affairs like US has lost all its
military bases this used to be what was
called the backyard and now the US has
almost excluded
there was a hemispheric conference about
some several months ago in Colombia
where there were two major issues one
was admitting Cuba to the hemispheric
system the other was ending this
grotesque drug war that the US is
running which is tearing Latin America
fart on those two issues the United
States and Canada
totally isolated if there's another
hemispheric conference they may not even
be invited there are now alternative
structures being developed which only
include Caribbean and Latin America not
the northern white countries because it
reflects an understanding that things
are badly wrong the same thing began to
happen and were called the men our
countries Middle East North Africa the
uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt were in
no small measure or revolt against
neoliberalism the Egypt for example was
praised by the World Bank in the IMF is
just running a marvelous economy doing
everything right except for the
population it's was a famous statement
by a Brazilian neo-nazi general back
around 1970 when Brazil was being
praised saying the economy is doing fine
it's just that the people aren't you
know that's that's what what Egypt and
Tunisia were like in the uprising which
had a big labor element the millet lever
movement was substantially like that
hasn't won the neoliberal system is back
under Muslim Brotherhood rule but I
think it's going to break it's going to
explode again because the problems are
still there
people may accept obedience and
deference and following orders but not
very far below the surface they don't
like it
and when people can express themselves
you see it I say in the labor press in
this area in the mid 19th century which
are pretty radical though they never
heard about any radical movements so you
have to block democracy that's a real
threat and if you can there's many ways
of trying it's a same domestically I
mean it's a long story but in the United
States for example in a very free
country by comparative standards roughly
70% of the population has no influence
on policy at all it's been well studied
even in professional political science
influence increases until the very top
you have people essentially get what
they want that has nothing to do with
democracy in the if you look at popular
attitudes in the United States there are
actually mostly social democratic even
on the right like the tea party people
want more spending on education on
health care and so on you know these
things have to be stopped it can't allow
that right now it's very striking all
the talk in the United States and a
political class you know the government
the media and so on is about the deficit
you take a look at popular opinion the
public thinks the deficit is not a major
problem the major problem is jobs to get
jobs you have to stimulate the economy
and interestingly the business press
agrees with them Bloomberg Businessweek
for example says the same thing but
that's not what the financial
institutions want that's not what the
wealthy want so therefore it doesn't
enter into political discussion well
that's a kind of democracy you know
people aren't sent to
log and so on but it's very constrained
democracy it's a it's a business run
flawed democracy and just as in Egypt or
Brazil or anywhere else
elites certainly don't want functioning
democracy functioning democracy would
mean for example that stakeholders
workforce and community take over
enterprises and run them themselves they
call it impossible we say it's possible
so we're demanding the impossible to be
realistic demand the impossible means
we're gonna make it real and so yes
impossible is their term but reality is
what we want to construct
it keeps reviving because I think it's
just below the surface actually so it
keeps reviving all the time revived in
the 1960s again in many different ways
and out of every time it revives you get
these anarchists trains coming out by
now around some of the work class areas
in Ohio around Cleveland there's there's
a network and a a growth of worker owned
enterprises some of them fairly
substantial the US Steel the Union has
just made an arrangement with Mondragon
in Spain you know huge conglomerate
which is work around worker managed in
this pretty successful and where it'll
go I don't know but there's at least
tentative efforts in this direction to
try to try to reconstruct what has been
a force in American history from the
beginning we want to run our own lives
we don't want bosses we don't want to be
degraded that we don't want to live in a
world of deference and obedience and we
want to run enterprises ourselves we
don't need you who I have bosses that
keeps coming out but that's one of the
reasons why the business world was so
terrified in the 1930s as you can see
from business publications when the
sit-down strikes began that was really
threatening I'm gonna sit down strike
you know the workers don't march outside
they sit in the factory and we're going
to take long before they decide why
don't we just run this factory who needs
those guys now we have the skills we can
do it do it all ourselves throughout the
bankers and you know managers sitting
off in some New York suite and we'll run
the place and that's frightening that
things like that are happening all the
time
they've started up again in the current
financial crisis and they you can't
is this anarchist you can't really say
it's it's got some of the same strains
and it's and we do have to remember that
a large part of the anarchist movement
was not just saying no it was saying yes
to a different kind of society which
will organize and run and there are
efforts now to develop you know fairly
elaborate conceptual frameworks theories
if you like about how this might work
like participatory economics Albert and
Hahnel and shallow and a lot of others
be groups all over the world in fact
here too whether all of this can come
together in some form it's pretty hard
to say but it might I'm gonna take say
let's keep to the United States a couple
of years ago as part of this financial
crash the owner of companies crashed and
the government took over a substantial
part of the auto industry they were kind
of quasi nationalized that's under Obama
there were a couple of paths that could
have been taken that one was the path
that actually was taken to reconstruct
the industry so that it's more
profitable and you know lower wages and
two-tiered work systems in which new
workers don't get benefits and so on and
then hand it back to the banks and
management class and they go on
producing automobiles and so on that was
these are also incidentally big
financial institutions the General
Motors and so on so reconstruct them
into something like what they were but
more efficient that was well the course
that was taken there was another
possible course which was talked about
and a little bit of organizing about but
not enough to have a big impact that was
hand
a whole industry over to its workforce
and to the communities so-called
stakeholders let them have it
and let them produce things of the
country really needs
the future I think it depends on whether
the things that develop what we we say
spontaneously but nothing really develop
spontaneously there's always a
background of thinking organization
struggle and so on but when something
bursts out like say the Spanish
revolution or Occupy or indignados or
latin-american breaking of neoliberal
bonds or Tahrir Square or Enterprise
workaround enterprises and Cleveland all
over the place
when anything breaks out it typically
has an anarchist flair to it and it's
also just in personal life breaking down
of bonds of patriarchy let's say that's
those are anarchist positions way back
not only anarchist if you look around
the world I don't think we have to waste
time on the fact that we have a major
environmental crisis it's huge and it
may be imminent and if you look around
the world the groups that are in the
forefront of trying to do something
serious about it our indigenous
communities you know they may call
themselves Aboriginal indigenous First
Nations whatever they call themselves
these are the ones that were pressing
the hardest to pay attention to what
they even call the rights of nature
which is an old anarchist idea
incidentally though they never heard of
it rights of nature have to be protected
I mean in countries with a large
indigenous population like Bolivia and
Ecuador it's actually in the laws now
you have to respect the rights of nature
these are people who are struggling
against mining all over the world big
battles all over the world India
Australia Colombia you know against
mining operations which are just
destroying nature and destroying our
lives at the same time
and that's kind of ecological anarchism
from a different point of view and
that's a kind of sensibility that the
industrial world is going to have to
internalize or we're going to be really
facing doom
seriously
