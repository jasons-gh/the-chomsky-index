some of the challenges and confronting
the major issues of our time some not
challenges in terms of facts but
challenges in terms of how we actually
go about building something against them
building something positive and also
just building something against the
power structures and with such massive
massive issues I'm thinking particularly
about climate change
I think there's particular challenges
that come along with that and one of the
main ones I think is is sort of the lack
of feedback that happens if you're
trying to do something positive about
them trying to make something happen you
know there's the National Security
Agency and and things like econ economic
inequality which are massive by
themselves but climate change is really
massive it it's going to take completely
changing how we run their societies how
we run our economies and how we plan our
cities it's a really huge challenge and
as someone who's confronted huge issues
before that seemed hopeless at the time
like Vietnam I was wondering if you had
any thoughts on how we can as
individuals and as groups go about
trying to organize and confront
something as major as climate change
when it can feel like you're pushing a
giant rock and not getting anywhere the
problem of how you do something without
necessarily getting positive feedback
well you can't expect positive feedback
from power systems now they have their
own interests let's say take climate
change
Canada is a good place to think about
this it kinda des used to be a pretty
civilized society by comparative
standards and now it's becoming the
scourge of the earth that's partly
canadian mining operations which are
very destructive all around the world
and are arousing great resistance among
the victims mostly indigenous people but
also the dedication to develop the most
harmful forms of fossil fuels just this
morning's newspaper there's a discussion
and
take a look at the business section of
the New York Times it discusses Canadian
plans plans of Canadian corporations in
the Canadian government to vastly expand
the pipeline system to the west to aim
for the Asia market and to the east so
as to be able to reach directly to
Europe within the rest of the world
without going through the United States
and it points out that there are
difficulties in at the west there are
problems with First Nations the town
where they wanted the major export
terminal to be has voted and strongly
against allowing it to be used the
indigenous groups are struggling hard
against it this is typical this tells
you first of all it's partially an
answer your question also tells you
something very interesting about the
current world it takes a Canada when
this is typical the richest most
educated sectors of the society with the
greatest advantages are pressing very
hard to escalate the threat of global
destruction the people who we consider
primitive you know in Canada first
nations in Latin America indigenous
people in Australia Aboriginal tribes
and India but tribal societies they're
the ones who are trying to retard the
threat and what's happening in Canada is
typical and it is a kind of an
interesting you know if you're if you
can separate yourself from the
horrifying consequences it's it's an
interesting kind of paradox if you like
but it tells you the answer to your
question every it's urgent for those who
have the most privilege of the most
opportunity the greatest advantages to
be in the forefront instead of in the
rear in trying to impede what is like
is to be a serious catastrophe again
take a look at this morning's newspaper
the lead story in The New York Times
other newspapers is a several scientific
reports that just came out about
Antarctic ice melting West Antarctic ice
melting it's now pretty much determined
that it's taking place and probably
irreversible and the predictions are
that within several generations it will
start it will keep increasing sea level
rise but within a few generations it
let's plate very fast - about a 10-foot
rise in sea level take a look at the
world and ask what will be like with a
10-foot rise in sea level well while we
were looking at that we see that in
Canada and in the United States those
sectors of the population which have
most power most influence most advantage
are trying to race as fast as possible
towards this destructive outcome
meanwhile First Nations and their
counterparts elsewhere trying to retard
it that it's the answer popular forces
just have to move up to the front and
not not accept the what's being done in
their name and there's no big secret
about how to do that I mean every
possible social you know every positive
social change in history that I could
think of has worked pretty much the same
way grassroots organizing the
development of popular movements finally
enough pressure on the centers of power
so that they're compelled to respond and
that can happen we don't live in
totalitarian dictatorships we're by
comparative and historical standards
they're very free to act sure they'll be
refreshing that's taken for granted but
nothing like what's been faced in the
past or is faced elsewhere and therefore
it's really a matter of will and choice
the the the situation is so big though
and there's so many different
you know avenues you could go about
trying to to work on on the issue and I
think if if at least for me if you just
focus on the facts of the matter it's
very easily to quickly feel paralyzed
and not know how to move forward and
given you know you've talked about when
you were first getting involved with the
Vietnam War yourself and others would
try to give speeches and it would be to
a tiny group of people maybe basically
just the organizers and one other person
thing you said at the time things felt
completely hopeless that it would be
impossible and you just kept kept going
anyways and so I was wondering what your
thoughts on this for climate change
alright I mean do you think generally it
helps to try to focus on one small area
even if it seems trivial in the vast
scale of things and and try to work on
that or and in order to get a sense of a
feedback and like you are having an
impact depends who you are and where you
are there's no single right answer for
everything there are some places where
maybe the most important thing you can
do is it's to local pressures to a
support say use of solar power or wind
power or weatherization of homes there
are other places where maybe the most
important thing to do is to press for
control over the plans to create
pipelines and impede them my First
Nations can do it there's no reason why
people in Toronto can but but this
simply no single answer we hope we have
all kind of ways of it's very different
from the early Vietnam War movement then
that as you mentioned it was no support
and now there's pretty substantial
recognition that there's a serious
problem actually some polls just
international polls just came out a
couple of weeks ago there I don't think
they included Canada but I'm sure Canada
would be in the mainstream spectrum it's
this pretty high recognition in the
population of the world that there's a
serious problem I think the highest that
they found that the international
was Brazil than more than three-quarters
the United States is below the norm but
that's for a simple reason
partly you can see it outside this
window where you see the Koch Cancer
Center there's a huge propaganda
campaign perfectly public nothing secret
about it by major sectors of the
corporate system energy market Chamber
of Commerce others working really hard
to try to convince people that either
there's no global warming at all or if
there is humans have a role in it that's
and that has had an effect on the
population it's below the global norm
and it's interestingly stratified so if
you break it up when and polls break it
up into democrats and republicans that
democrats are somewhat below the global
norm republicans are off the planet yeah
they're way down at the bottom and they
are the ones who are much it's it's the
party that's former part i we didn't
call it a political party anymore that's
lockstep dedicated to the service of
wealth and power and for them what
happens in the future just doesn't
matter didn't have to recognize that in
the moral calculus of north american
state capitalism the fate of
grandchildren amounts to essentially
nothing as compared with the need for
profit tomorrow now people can
understand that it's not like the
anti-war movement the majority of the
population already understands it the
point is to get them active energized
all kinds of ways protests sit-ins take
over buildings whatever it takes to try
to make it possible for our near
descendants it's not very far off to
have a chance for a decent living that's
pretty straightforward message one of
the things they always point out is you
know if you were asked
for the civil rights movement would it
make sense for someone to stay just
sittin at a counter you'd have said
probably not and same with the occupied
we went if people asked you should you
you know have a camp in at Zuccotti Park
it was said be a waste of your time
and I guess I guess one of the main
issues is we never know what's what's
actually going to work sometimes we can
despite our best efforts it might even
be a pushback where we actually lose
ground and so I wanted to get your
thoughts on that how does one keep
forward or keep going in the face of not
knowing if the tactics that you are
pursuing are even worthwhile or not well
as you've just indicated I'm probably
the worst person to ask because my
judgment has often been wrong well the
first case you mentioned was the
Greensboro North Carolina a couple of
black students sitting in out of lunch
counter and my assumption when I heard
about it is this is going to be smashed
instantly turned out to be a spark that
set off a huge popular movement occupy
if I could unfortunately I wasn't asked
but if I had been in Zuccotti Park I
would have said you're wasting your time
turned out sometimes I think it's my
judgment right other times or not but
the point is you really don't know so
how do you keep going
you've considered the alternatives the
one alternative is to say look I don't
know if it's going to work so I'll do
nothing thereby helping ensure that the
worst will happen
the other possibility said look I don't
know whether it's will work I'll use my
best judgment if my best judgment is
there's a chance it will succeed I'll
try
