you
is my honor today to introduce professor
Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky is an
institute professor and professor
emeritus of linguistics at MIT widely
considered one of the fathers of modern
linguistics professor Chomsky has also
established himself as a political
activist in prominent critic of u.s.
foreign policy the nature of American
support for Israel in particular
professor Chomsky received numerous
awards including honorary degrees from
over 30 universities his written wept
written and lectured widely on subjects
ranging from linguistic theory to
international politics among his recent
books are new horizons in the study of
language on nature and language and the
forthcoming hopes and prospects I have
always considered Noam Chomsky rare and
refreshing source of clarity especially
regarding Palestine Israel I think I
speak for many of us when I say Noam
Chomsky is a tremendous personal
inspiration and I cannot imagine a
speaker who would generate more
excitement on campus please join me in
welcoming professor Noam Chomsky
Thanks
now we can go home well let me begin by
giving credit where credit is due
to someone I rarely praise in fact I
can't remember when I ever have namely
the Jerusalem correspondent of the New
York Times
Ethan Brunner had a good column this
morning it's worth reading he's
describing the the mood and Israel on
Independence Day and he points out that
the mood was on you unusually grim in
fact maybe uniquely so he refers to a
quite an interesting letter that was
written by one of the major Israeli
correspondents Ari Shavit
in our it's kind of a centrist
correspondent very influential it's an
open letter from Chevy to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and he says we don't
really know each other but I know who
you are you know who I am and I never
write letters to people in the
government but the moment is so
significant and dangerous that I just
have to write you the letter he has a
long open letter letter says that you
mr. Netanyahu or maybe the most hated
person in the world in Israel the left
hates you the right hates you all my
friends hate you I'm the only person who
doesn't hate you and of course all the
Arabs hate you and everyone the United
States hates you and the rest of the
world and so on and he says the reason
is because it's not your fault he says
you know I really like you I think
you're a nice guy but Israel's facing
maybe the worst crisis in its history
and we have to do something about it and
then he runs through the crises the
worst one he
it's just a general attitude in the
world toward Israel well he didn't know
it but the day after his letter appeared
there was a poll an international poll
by the Pew Research Center which
incidentally he's an runner also refers
to in his column and the poll ranked was
a global ranking of countries as to what
people think about them in many
countries and Israel ranked way down at
the bottom fact right next to North
Korea almost at the very bottom and
attitudes so the the concern is
justified of course it's a lot of
paranoia and self-righteousness the
world doesn't understand us everyone
hates the Jews we're right about
everything but there's no point just we
can't go along just knowing that we have
to somehow do something little convince
the world there are some striking
analogies which brunner didn't bring up
one of them is South Africa there are a
lot of analogies drawn between Israel
and South Africa most of them of pretty
dubious quality but one makes a lot of
sense it has to do with the history if
you go back about 50 years the mood in
white nationalist South Africa was very
similar to this they they were aware of
it that they were aware that they're
becoming a pariah society they reacted
very much the way Israel's reacting
today a large-scale international
information systems effort to explain to
people it's not propaganda its
explanation just as it's gold in Israel
to explain to them that everything we do
is right just and highly moral and you
should understand it and so on and also
kind of circling the wagons a lot of
defiance shifts to the extreme
nationalist right right ultra
nationalist movements and a lot more
it's all very similar about that time
about fifty years ago the South African
Foreign Minister in a conversation with
the American ambassador told him that we
know that there are strong resolutions
and the United Nations denouncing us
passed by most of the countries in the
world but he said that doesn't really
matter and his words were what matters
more than all other votes put together
is the position of the United States in
view of its predominant position of
leadership in the Western world so in
brief there's only one vote in the
United Nations that's yours
as long as you vote for us the rest of
them we don't care about that was an
accurate observation then it's pretty
much an accurate observation today and
it became much more so in the case of
South Africa as the decolonization
proceeded remember this is 1960 the
decolonization proceeded and protests
international protests against apartheid
were more intense
well actually the u.s. continued to
support the histories informative the
United States continued to support South
Africa the US government the apartheid
regime right through the period of
mounting protests at home to that
continued right through the Reagan years
into the late 1980s Reagan had to at
that time he already had to evade
congressional sanctions against South
Africa in order to make sure the US
trade increased as it did and he also
had to ignore even business opposition
it's a little unusual by then the
business world late seventies early
eighties the American business world was
starting to disinvest they didn't like
what was happening they thought the word
they should get rid of apartheid but
Reagan over
folded and it was no small matter in the
South African crimes with us court
dwarfed the crimes that Reagan was
responsible for in Central America in
the Middle East which were pretty
awesome but in South Africa was much
worse I'm just in the surrounding
countries Angola and Mozambique the
South African depredations were
responsible for killing about a million
and a half people causing sixty billion
dollars of damage not a small thing
and the US government not the population
not even Congress not even business
content but the government continued to
support it right through they had a
reason and the reason is familiar a
justification the justification was the
war on terror what we're told these days
is that George Bush declared the war on
terror and after 9/11 which is not quite
accurate Jiri declared it Reagan had
declared it when he came into office in
1981 the centerpiece of u.s. foreign
policy is going to be state directed
international terrorism the plague of
the modern age retiring the barbarism in
our time and so on that's all been wiped
out of history for simple reason
reagan's war on terror very quickly
turned into a massive terrorist war with
enormous destruction and atrocities and
that's not a good thing to maintain
within history so it's kind of going
away except for the real world
elissa when Bush Reedy cleared it the
original had been forgotten defense of
South Africa was justified by the war on
terror 1988 the Pentagon declared that
the African National Congress Nelson
Mandela's a African National Congress
was one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world that was 1988 after
everything that happened in fairness
I should say that a year ago last May
Mandela finally was removed from the US
terrorist list so he can now travel in
the United States without special
dispensation but that was 1988 and in
fact the apartheid regime looked
unassailable the foreign ministers
analysis in 1950 was pretty accurate as
long as they had that one vote the world
could be disregarded well right at that
time for reasons which aren't exactly
known a US government policy shifted and
within a two or three years apart height
had collapsed that's gone that's a lot
to say about what followed not so
beautiful but it was certainly a major
victory for freedom and justice those
are important lessons worth keeping in
mind and it's worth keeping in mind that
virtually without exception Israeli
actions and Israeli policies are in fact
joint policies their u.s. Israeli
policies Israel can go just as far as
the u.s. permits just as far as it
supports it and no further
I mean Israel doesn't does something the
u.s. doesn't like tells them loud and
clear and they withdraw quiet doesn't
matter who the president is under george
w bush there were some extreme examples
that's and in fact israel relies much
more on the United States for diplomatic
military and economic support than South
Africa did South Africa was getting
support from other terrorist states like
Britain and others Israel in particular
but the but Israel is really not it's
much more dependent on the United States
and it follows that any meaningful
change in the relationship is rayul and
Palestine is going to have to be based
on a change here
in the United States now there have been
substantial changes in past years so a
meeting like this it would have been
inconceivable as recently as five or ten
years ago in fact wasn't long ago that
when I am a couple other people tried to
talk about these topics we literally had
a half police protection and the
meetings were broken up even my own
University MIT police protection
meetings were broken up
couldn't talk about it it's all
radically changed particularly since the
Gaza attacked last year which made a big
shift and how to dudes and understanding
and it also means that actions are now
feasible that weren't even thinkable up
until recently for example the kind that
were taken with regard to South Africa
after decades of education and protest a
long time but by 1977 Hampshire College
I think was the first one did pass a
divestment resolution and by the early
80s as I say it was even congressional
resolutions there's a crucial example in
fact is is just that divestment from the
US corporations that are involved in
criminal actions in the occupied
territories there's that focuses right
where it should on our activities
focuses on us it's what we should do
anyway your responsibility is yourself
not other people's crimes and it's also
the decisive factor in what's going to
happen that's what we can influence
there is a brown group of brown students
for justice in Palestine which is called
for divestment from US corporations that
are involved in criminal actions and the
occupied territories so in other words
is asking Brown University to keep to
the law international law in fact
domestic law that the actions are
criminal is not really in question the
wall so-called separation wall
what we called an annexation wall that
cuts through the West Bank as many of
you I'm sure know that was subject to a
decision by the the World Court
International Court of Justice which
unanimously including the US Justice in
a separate declaration unanimously
concluded that the Geneva Conventions
applied to the occupied territories the
Geneva Conventions very explicitly bar
any transfer of population from the
occupying power to the occupied
territories so that means any settlement
anywhere in the occupied territories is
just illegal de-facto and violation of
international criminal law the u.s.
judge judge Burgin thaw declared that
includes every part of the fence that
goes into West Bank territory roughly
85% of it which is there not to defend
Israel but to defend settlers who were
there illegally so the wall is illegal
and the same is true of every other
settlement with regard to Jerusalem
which is the area of extreme intention
now the actions are doubly illegal a not
only in violation of international law
but even in violation of very specific
Security Council resolutions which the
u.s. in fact agreed to back in the late
60s in the early 70s when the United
States was still part of the world on
this issue departed in the mid seventies
but those resolutions still stand say
that's dull criminality and it was
understood in Israel so in late 1967
right after the June 67 war is when
question of settlement and the occupied
territories is beginning to be brought
up Israel's top legal adviser Theodor
meron
was a very distinguished international
lawyer is on the
national Commission's Human Rights
Commission's and so on he informed the
government that the Geneva Conventions
clearly apply to the occupied
territories and that any transfer of
Israeli citizens there would be in
violation of fundamental international
law the Israeli Attorney General
seconded that and if interestingly the
person was really in charge of the
occupied territories much a day on his
defense minister but he was responsible
for what happened there he agreed that
publicly said yes it's in violation of
international law but we're going to do
it anyway because countries violate
international law all the time so we
will - and he was basically correct he
he probably not consciously but he was
essentially repeating what the South
African Foreign Minister said as long as
the master agrees it doesn't matter if
it's in violation of law I'm the master
happens to be a criminal state anyway
and if it authorizes criminal actions
we're okay doesn't matter what the law
says and that goes until today very
strikingly in fact it rarely rarely even
gets reported in fact mostly it doesn't
but as I'm sure you all know the big
issue the big international issue is
Iran and it's possible pursuit of
nuclear weapons capability and you know
a lot of hysteria about that Obama just
made a big speech which presented a new
nuclear posture and said us promises not
to attack not not to carry out a first
nuclear strike against countries that
don't have nuclear weapons with an
exception he said there were outliers
and the main outlier as you put it is
Iran so we can carry out a nuclear
attack against them even though they
don't have nuclear weapons right through
this period you know Security Council
resolution
so on there are other things going on so
the International Atomic Energy Agency
which is responsible for you know
monitoring the non-proliferation treaty
last September it passed a resolution
calling on Israel to join the
non-proliferation treaty and open its
facilities nuclear facilities to
inspection a Europe and the United
States tried to block the resolution but
they failed and it passed anyway well it
didn't really matter wasn't reported in
the United States or in England and one
or two notices here and there also
unreported except for the Muny newspaper
in Washington The Washington Times was
that Obama immediately informed Israel
that it doesn't apply to them so they
can forget about it same time the
Security Council passed a resolution
which got plenty of publicity it was
described as aimed Iran so it was good
it called on all states to join the
non-proliferation treaty and to settle
their disagreements within the framework
of the of the UN Charter and the the
non-proliferation treaty mean by
peaceful means
well those provisions were directed
against the United States there's only
two countries in the world that are
threatening the use of force which is
also criminal take a look at the UN
Charter which bars the threat or use of
force and international affairs but
across the spectrum in the United States
the threat of force is considered
legitimate and often the use of force
so yes it's a criminal state across
across the spectrum and so the US and
Israel the only countries that are
threatening the use of force and in fact
repairing for it so we'll do it who
knows but without report here the United
States has recently sent to the island
of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean has
sent submarine tenders to care for
nuclear submarines the nuclear
submarines are under
to Poland they can carry nuclear weapons
and it has also sent to diego garcia the
biggest bombs in the u.s. arsenal short
of nuclear weapons would have called
massive ordnance penetrator zuv bunker
busters they're called their aim
specifically Iran nobody else is a huge
13-ton bombs which are supposed to be
able to penetrate deep into the earth
through you know thousands of tons of
reinforced concrete it doesn't get
reported here but of course it's known
to Iranian intelligence and it's
supposed to be it's a threat of force
actually Diego Garcia the riego Garcia
is an island which isn't talked about
much but it's crucial to us
international aggression it's the major
base for the bombing of the Middle East
and Central Asia and so on that's
actually was a British island the
British expelled the population on
orders of the master the appeal to be
returned and one in British courts but
as Diane said law doesn't matter if the
master says no so they can't return
Jago Garcia is part of Africa the
African Union just a couple of months
ago established a nuclear weapons-free
zone if anybody were really interested
in stopping nuclear limiting nuclear
proliferation what they'd be doing is
supporting nuclear weapons-free zones
around the world well Africa finally had
one but they can't implement it because
of Jago Garcia the United States and
Britain loyally trailing behind refused
to allow the nuclear free treaty to
apply to Diego Garcia because they
intend to use it they do use it for
storing nuclear weapons I might use it
for attacking the outliers
that's instantly not the only case
there's also a South Pacific nuclear
weapons-free zone which also isn't
implemented because the u.s. insists on
excluding the Pacific Islands which are
used for bases where
the Us stores nuclear weapons nuclear
submarines and so on so that's not
implement come back to another important
nuclear weapons-free zone in a moment
anyway the outlier is Iran now actually
there are three countries that have not
ever signed the non-proliferation treaty
in nuclear States Israel India and
Pakistan all developed nuclear weapons
with us support and are still doing so
Pakistan it's one of Ronald Reagan's
gifts to the world India
it's accelerated in the last couple of
years there's an under bush there was a
u.s. Indian treaty sign which is in
direct violation of all the
international conventions on
non-proliferation it permits India to
develop nuclear weapons in secret and it
permits the u.s. to help them by
providing them with nuclear technology
now the story is it's for civilian use
but everybody knows that the boundary
between civilian use and military
application is quite small and
furthermore even providing it for
civilian use permits India to divert its
technology and research to nuclear
weapons as in fact it's doing quite
openly so immediately after the Security
Council resolution I mentioned India
announced that wasn't recorded here that
it can produce nuclear weapons with the
same yield as the superpowers the US and
Russia Obama quietly informed India that
the Security Council resolution doesn't
apply to them
Pakistan responds to India's so they're
openly in fact developing new nuclear
weapons facilities your aim in Richmond
and so on those are the real threats of
nuclear weapons in the region the three
countries that refused to sign the
treaty and that are backed by the u.s.
that when they openly defy
the Security Council the International
Atomic Energy Agency and so on not the
out the outlier may be a problem but
that's a u.s. issue and so the u.s. is
not supported by the world on this
contrary to what you read so the call
for sanctions what you read is Iran is
defying the international community the
international community is a term that
has a rather technical meaning it refers
to Washington and whoever happens to
agree with it at the moment so the
international community excludes the
majority of states in the world the
non-aligned former non-aligned movement
which vigorously support your ends right
to develop nuclear power though as
permitted under the non-proliferation
treaty everyone agrees it excludes a
China and Russia its excludes India
which as opposed to sanctions excludes
Brazil which is pointedly opposed to
sanctions at Turkey the one major Middle
East powers doesn't want sanctions in
fact even the Arab League which the u.s.
is supposedly catering to they just had
a meeting and declared their opposition
to sanctions call for diplomacy but
nevertheless the international community
steadfastly insists on higher sanctions
incidentally the American people aren't
part of the international community I
haven't seen a recent poll may opinion
may have changed after all the
propaganda the last couple of years but
in 2007 a considerable majority of
Americans agreed with the world outside
the international community that has
agreed that Iran has a right same right
as everyone else to develop nuclear
energy well there are the outliers there
was a meeting in Tehran of 60 States a
couple of days ago it's very hard to
find out who was there because nothing's
covered but there was a meeting and they
came out with a declaration calling for
an end to any nuke
weapons and they called for establishing
a nuclear weapons-free zone in the
Middle East
that's an interesting proposal in this
case the u.s. population is
overwhelmingly in support of it and so
it's just everyone in the world who's
polled at least very strong support for
a nuclear weapons-free zone that would
mitigate and maybe terminate whatever
the alleged threats are of Iran
developing a nuclear weapons capability
it is called for it in the Tehran
meeting I don't think it was reported
here there are two countries that have a
particularly deep commitment to this
namely the United States and Britain the
reason is because when the US and
Britain invaded Iraq they tried to
provide a kind of a thin legal cover for
it and the way they did it was by
appealing to a Security Council
resolution resolution 687 1991 which
called on Iraq to dismantle its weapons
of mass destruction and the US and
Britain claimed they hadn't done it we
know that was false but that was the
claim and that justified their invasion
of Iraq well if you bother reading that
resolution you'll see that it commits
the signers to establishing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East so
the US and Britain over and above all
others have a commitment to this and if
there was a real interest in
non-proliferation instead of just
rhetorical that's what would be pursued
well going back to Israel which is not
the only beneficiary of u.s. criminality
India and Pakistan are - but in the case
of Israel they're immune from the
International Atomic Energy Agency
Security Council and in fact the long
record of US vetoes of Security Council
resolutions that charged Israel with
another crime actually the USPTO's
resolution charging itself with crimes -
if we had a free education system in the
United States everyone would know that
the United States is the only country
that has rejected a World Court decision
in the past it was one of three Libya
and Albania also hadn't accepted them
but they've since accepted them so the
u.s. is in splendid isolation that was a
World Court decision calling on the
United States to terminate its terrorist
war against Nicaragua of course totally
rejected that went to the Security
Council there were two resolutions
calling on the all states didn't mention
the u.s. calling on all States to
observe international law the u.s.
vetoed both of them France and Britain
politely abstained so there are outliers
in the world but Iran has got an awful
government nobody doubts that but there
are other outliers maybe more
significant ones certainly more
significant for us well it's going back
to Israel Palestine it's kind of strange
on the surface that the conflict
persists why does it why is it called
unresolvable you know toughest problem
in the world I mean there plenty of
problems in the world where it's hard
even to conjure up a solution to imagine
one in this case you cannot only conjure
it up but everyone knows what it is
and furthermore the whole world agrees
to it outside of the United States and
Israel and in fact it's even got
international law and it's supported by
the Arab League it's supported by the
Organization of Islamic states including
Iran
supported by the relevant non-state
actors like Hamas the resolution does it
the basic contours are very well known
to state settlement on the international
border pre June 67 border perhaps with
minor and mutual modifications
that was the official us term back in
the late 60s and early 70s before the
u.s. departed from the world on this
issue so settlement on the international
border was a ceasefire line so kind of
messy with minor and mutual
modifications and various conditions
about Jerusalem refugees and so on well
well that's a solution but much like the
nuclear free weapons free zone there's a
barrier and it's right here the US won't
accept it and as long as the US doesn't
accept that Israel feels entirely free
to continue to violate it now that's
been going on since the mid seventies in
1976 January 76 the major Arab states
brought a resolution to the Security
Council a calling for a settlement
roughly in these terms recognizing the
rights of every state in the region
including Israel to live in peace and
security within recognized boundaries
all the standard diplomatic terminology
it was vetoed by the United States again
in 1980 record and General Assembly is
similar a veto by the United States is
in fact a double veto maybe a triple
veto first of all it doesn't happen and
secondly it's vetoed from reporting and
third is vetoes from history so you have
to look pretty hard to find find out
much about this that's what it means to
have overwhelming power those are some
of the prerogatives overwhelming power
and a very obedient intellectual class
which keeps things quiet you know
doesn't make sure that young minds
aren't distorted by knowing too much
about the world the but in fact in this
entire record of 35 years of US
rejection ISM there's one exception and
a very illuminating one it's in 2000
year 2000 it's not the one people talk
about
everyone talks about the Camp David
negotiations which failed but that
wasn't the end of it after the collapse
of the Camp David negotiations President
Clinton recognized that the us-israeli
position that the negotiations could not
be accepted by any Palestinians even the
most were called moderate ones pro-us
ones so Clinton in December of 2000 what
he called his parameters they were kind
of vague but somewhat more forthcoming
he then said that both sides Israel the
Palestinians had accepted his parameters
both sides had made reservations to them
well they met in Taba Egypt in January
2001 sinica to try to iron out the
differences the reservations and they
made quite a bit of success in their
last press conference we know a lot
about this it was internationally
monitored there's extensive reports from
Israel most of it in Hebrew but some in
English so we know quite a lot about it
they practically reached agreement in
their last press conference they said if
they had a few more days they could have
reached agreement on every issue pretty
much in line with the international
consensus you know tweaking it here and
there there were few issues still Israel
called off the negotiations prematurely
and that was the end of formal
negotiations informal pretty high-level
negotiations continued leading to some
agreements the main ones called the
Geneva Accord it was rejected by Israel
ignored by the United States so that's
down the tube all this is quite
significant it means that a resolution
in terms of the international consensus
is feasible if the United States will
permit it
unfortunately there's very little sign
of that well meanwhile the US and Israel
are just extending and deepening the
illegal occupation
in 2005 September August September 2005
Israel made a sensible tactical decision
the right-wing government are real
sheron's decision the government decided
that that make any sense to keep seven
or eight thousand Israeli settlers in
the Gaza Strip which by then had been
half destroyed taking you know maybe a
third or more of the resources and land
and protected by half the Israeli army
so he made the decision to transfer the
settlers illegally settling in the Gaza
Strip to the West Bank which is much
more important now it could have been
done just like that a flick of a wrist
you know but they decided to stage with
what was called a national trauma so
there was a huge trauma perfectly
completely farcical if the if they'd
want to do it quietly all I had to do
was announce that on August 1st the IDF
the Israeli army is going to leave the
Gaza Strip at that point the 8000
settlers would have climbed into the
buses provide trucks provided to them
and they would leave their subsidized
homes in the Gaza Strip to subsidized
homes in the West Bank but you don't get
any propaganda out of that what they
wanted was a trauma so it was staged you
know big front pictures on the front
pages of you know little boy pleading
with the soldiers not to destroy his
home Boston Globe and so on and shouts
of never again and so on you know
no more Holocaust so and it was pretty
effective actually it was a it was a
farcical repeat of a similar stage
trauma in 1982 when they had the part
take settlers out of Egypt out of the
northeastern Sinai
there were commentators in Israel who
just ridiculed it correctly like the
late one of Israel's leading
sociologists
kimberley died recently rooted just just
ridiculed the farce as it should have
been done but it played it played where
it mattered here so never again we've
got to hold on to the occupied the West
Bank well after the withdrawal from
technical withdrawal from Gaza Israel
maintained its total control and it was
pretty vicious it picked up in intensity
a couple of months later when the
Palestinians committed a serious crime
there was a free election in Palestine
in January 2006 and they voted the wrong
way now that's not acceptable you can do
all kind of things but not that you
don't vote the wrong way in a free
election so the u.s. quite openly Israel
- of course did turn to punishing the
Palestinians for this crime and it
wasn't secret like you can read it in a
column in the front page of the New York
Times right alongside another column
which is lauding our magnificent
messianic pursuit of Wilsonian ideals
and supporting democracy and so on
there's no contradiction so Orwell you
may recall how - concept which you call
double think the whole think is the
capacity to have two contradictory ideas
in mind at the same time and believe
both of them that's almost a definition
of the intellectual culture but this was
a dramatic case and immediately after
that crime the punishment of the Gaza
Strip sharply increased got worse later
I won't go through the details but it's
pretty awful very savage siege brutality
and so on it peaked December 19 2008
with the latest us Israeli invasion
which was murderous and destructive the
invasion of the US has it's called an
Israeli invasion it's a u.s. Israeli
invasion us arms US diplomatic support
and so on it was given a pretext but
every activity
has a pretext so you have to ask does it
meet anything actually the pretext was
that Israel was defending itself against
rockets from Gaza that pretext is
accepted by the human rights groups by
the Goldstone Commission by about a
hundred percent of commentary it doesn't
have a particle of credibility Israel in
the u.s. knew exactly how to stop the
Rockets there had been a ceasefire and
during the ceasefire Israel admits there
was not a single Hamas rocket Israel
violated the ceasefire a couple of
months earlier and the rocket started
Hamas called for renewing the ceasefire
Israel considered it and refused well
you know the use of force when you
haven't exhausted even tried a peaceful
means is just pure it's just major war
crimes I mean the discussion about the
war crimes in Gaza is trivialism in
comparison so Israel in fact at a free
pass from the Goldstone report and
others well since then the savagery
continues they will go on the details
I'm talking too long that's pretty
similar in the West Bank the
restrictions are not quite as not a
severe in the West Bank as they are in
Gaza which has become basically
unlivable that's the point
but they're bad but Israel has finally
understood in the West Bank that it
should do what every colonial power has
done don't punish the entire population
ensure that the elites are making out
fine you go to any third world country
you know under colonial rule or neo
colonial rule and there's a sector of
wealth and privilege which is you know
beyond anything that we dream of and
Israel's finally understood that that's
what you do so if you go to Ramallah you
can go to elegant restaurants and you
know go to the theater just like being
in Paris in London you go a couple of
miles away and it's
horrible but that allows the the
journalists and others to talk about the
wonderful achievements in the West Bank
well when you're running in fact Israel
is following finally the explicit
recommendation of Israeli industrialists
about ten years ago who urged that
Israel should move from what their words
from colonialism to neo colonialism it
should establish the standard
neo-colonial structures like this took a
long time to realize is but the doing
fact that becomes even more like South
Africa South Africa relied on the banter
stands and it tried to keep them they
weren't they're pretty awful but it
tried to keep them viable it needed it
that was their labor force so they kept
them going they tried to get
international recognition for them but
outside Israel no country recognized
them but that's Israel's not doing it
for all the West Bank it's just doing it
for the elite sector in Ramallah where
the Palestinian Authority is well if you
want to maintain a neo-colonial system
you have to have a an iron fist say any
military force and there is one it's
called it's the army run by General
keith Dayton actually that's the more
mild of the military forces but the
better known one u.s. general runs an
army trained in Jordan with us Israeli
participation and support and it keeps a
grip over the population in fact Obama
the Obama administration was
particularly impressed by how well the
army worked during the attack on Gaza
during the attack on Gaza there were no
protests in the West Bank which kind of
surprised everyone and that's attributed
to the power of the Dayton Army which
prevented any protests so Palestine is
our course they can't demonstrate or
anything they were not even allowed to
protest the destruction of the other
half of Palestine what's going on and
yet has it at John Kerry in particular
Senate Foreign Relations Committee was
particularly impressed with this he said
finally he said Israel may have a
legitimate partner for peace thanks to
the success of the general Dayton Army
and suppressing the population
sufficiently so they can't even protest
against the massive atrocities well
let's turn finally to the options for
Palestinians what are they here the
discussion I think is pretty misleading
and you should think it through one
option of course is the international
consensus and there's a barrier the u.s.
won't accept it but that's our problem
now a very common view you hear it all
over the place now from Palestinians
from Israeli doves from the supporters
of Palestinians here that the
alternative to that is that Israel takes
over the territories it becomes a single
state and you can have a civil rights
struggle an anti-apartheid struggle
within this single state in which
Palestinians will be roughly half the
population and that's many of the doves
including Palestinian leaders think okay
that's better than the vanishing
two-state settlement there's only one
problem with that logic those are not
the two alternatives there's a third
alternative which isn't discussed the
third alternative is that the US and
Israel continue doing exactly what
they're doing and what they're doing is
very clear has a name Prime Minister a
who all merit called it convergence what
you do it what Israel with us backing is
doing is taking over everything behind
Xing everything behind the separation
wall some of the most valuable land all
the water resources that's quite crucial
and zared region that takes over the
Jordan Valley you know more fertile
territory kicks out the Palestinians and
runs some salience
settlement salience right through the
territories actually the three of the
big one east of Greater Jerusalem
Jerusalem's been sharply expanded is one
that goes almost at Jericho and two
others to the north one taking in the
town of Ariel the other town of to do me
a look at a map I'm feeling it a map it
looks as it doesn't penetrate through
deeply into the West Bank but that's
misleading because the area where it
doesn't penetrate is mostly rocky desert
where you can't settle the livable part
of the West Bank is broken up into four
major Canton's what Arielle Sharon in
fact the architect of this called the
banter stance he was honest except that
they're not cared for as well as a ban
to stands so Israel take those no
demographic problem no palate very few
Palestinians if there are a few you kick
them out no problem of too many non-jews
in a Jewish state no civil rights
struggle no apartheid struggle as for
the Palestinians they can rot up in the
hills that Israel takes no
responsibility for them they can follow
a proposal of Moshe Dayan back in 67
the defense minister was in charge he
said we should tell the Palestinians
that we have no solution for you we're
going to you're going to live like dogs
and whoever wants to leave can leave and
we'll see where that goes well yeah
that's the policy and that's the real
alternative to his two-state settlement
there is no alternative of the kind
that's being discussed because neither
Israel nor the United States are in fact
anyone the world is more except that
rather they'll continue doing exactly
what they're doing now that's not going
to change unless there are changes
inside the United States as in the
current world scene it's hard to see
wherever where else changes could come
from and that's kind of an optimistic
conclusion for us for people who oppose
current US Israeli policies because here
is the one place where we can influence
what happens and here is the one place
that matters
that's where this going to make a
decisive difference now there are
implications for tactical choices I
think they should be pretty obvious but
the I'll stop there sorry to have gone
on too long
you
I take a look at the history of
apartheid it's suggested not exact but
suggested took decades of education and
organizing things of things like this
before the situation in the United
States reached the point where Congress
the business world you know general
population was so opposed to apartheid
that the Reagan administration had to
lie its way around it to try to keep to
maintain the support well okay that's
one thing that can be done another thing
that could be done is what began in the
case of South Africa and the late 70s
namely divestment by then it already had
the support of a large part of the
population including even businesses and
pretty soon Congress but the requirement
that US corporations divest from a white
nationalist firms in South Africa which
they themselves are already beginning to
do under pressure here okay that can be
done now that's that you can go beyond
um there were a number of international
reports about the Gaza attack one of the
most important was from Amnesty
International not exactly an extremist
organization they called on the United
States to withhold all arms shipments
from Israel saying that the arms
shipments violate international law
which they do and they even violate US
domestic law arms shipments are supposed
to be subject to the condition that they
are used only for defensive purposes or
for you know internal security and the
Gaza attacked wouldn't had no defensive
purpose as I mentioned and certainly
wasn't for internal security and they
were used in commission of major crimes
crime of aggression lots of other were
crimes so there could be a popular
movement here to call on the US
government to live up to its own laws
and to terminate arms shipments and
there's a lot of other things you know
so there's no shortage of things that we
can do well you know it's no deep secret
I mean like we're doing right now
how did people have just taking a look
at the change just take the recent years
in the United States you can go all the
way back in history but how are you go
back further how a slavery overcome how
did women get the right to vote you know
how and they since the 1960s were
women's rights pretty substantially
established not perfect but totally
different from anything before how our
civil rights achieved
how did environmental concerns begin to
be addressed not well enough but at
least somewhat and every step forward in
history comes the same way
and people like you do something about
it and there's it's very free country
you can do all sorts of things your
people in universities are extremely
privileged students for example or in
the moment of their lives when they are
most free they're sort of out of
parental control they don't yet have the
burdens imposed on them to try to
survive in a society where incomes for
the majority of stagnated for 30 years
because of government corporate policies
so you know they're kind of free they do
lots of things that others don't have a
choice about okay do them yeah that's
fine I think that's one of the things
you can do but there's plenty more I
mean we all know that a vote doesn't
mean much thank you it does a vote
I'm in more democratic countries than
ours that's understood like take say the
poorest country in South America
Bolivia I mean they had a pretty
remarkable election 2005 another one
just last year in which the majority of
the population indigenous people the
most repressed people in the continent
had by then organized enough to enter
the political arena and vote somebody
from their own ranks you know not some
rich guy from you know went to
skullenbones Yale but they've elected
someone from their own ranks they
formulated the programs which the
president is following serious programs
and the voting was just one moment in an
ongoing struggle it wasn't I go to the
polls I push a button I forget about it
for the next four years it was there's
just an ongoing popular struggle about
all kind of serious issues you know
access to water control of resources
complex complex questions of ethnic and
civil rights and a complex society and
they're at it all day all the time
okay that's functioning democracy we've
got a long way to go but we've had it in
the past but it's kind of been
suppressed and it can be recovered and
that's what elections ought to be just a
moment in a process which goes on from
there hi first thank you so much for
coming I've learned allowing - what you
shared with us my question is
specifically about Iran and the nuclear
weapons and the discussion that you were
having with regard to Iran in the
international community
I definitely understand the idea of a
country obtaining a nuclear weapon or
developing one themselves out of a form
of protection or to be on the same I
guess international status as other
countries who
are considered superpowers or on the
same level as a superpower because they
themselves have nuclear weapons but what
do you do when a country is openly
trying to develop one or obtain one and
also open it open and openly threatening
to wipe out a country and claiming that
a country shouldn't exist I mean those
are two really big issues that we're
dealing with and I didn't really think
you address that and I was curious to
say well what do you do about countries
that already develop nuclear weapons
outside the framework of the
non-proliferation treaty and are daily
violating resolutions of the Security
Council in the International Atomic
Energy Agency that's the much more
serious problem but that's a different
situation because that cup those
countries aren't openly threatening to
wipe out another country nor is Iran
just take a look at the statements the
statements are that they don't think
they said in the actually goes back to
Romania at the time of the u.s. Iranian
alliant the Israeli errata an alliance
and Israel didn't care about it then I
keep being repeated the statement is
that you know in the course of time
Israel should no longer exist
well actually I happen to agree with
that too fact so to a lot of people in
Israel the ones who think there should
be a single democratic state
that's not calling for wiping anyone out
in fact Iran has supported the
international consensus on the through
state settlement actually there is there
are two countries that are not only
calling for some nation not to exist but
are destroying it mainly the US and
Israel that's their position with regard
to the Palestinians and they're not just
saying
stress they're not just saying it
they're doing it day by day that's the
meaning of the policies that are going
on right before our eyes in Gaza and the
West Bank which we are supporting and
paying for so sure you shouldn't call
for the destruction of another nation
and you shouldn't implement that
actually the official position of Israel
backed by the United States they've
slightly modified it but back about 20
years ago their official position the
coalition government labor Likud was
that there cannot be I'm quoting it an
additional Palestinian state between
Jordan and Israel in other words they
declared and the u.s. supported that
Authority is a Palestinian state namely
Jordan and the Palestinians object you
know they say no no way man that's not
our state but who cares about them we
say that's your state and there can't be
an additional one well I goes well
beyond calling for the destruction of
another country I mean it's it's
analogous to saying that if somebody
came along suppose I might and the judge
said the Jews don't need Israel because
they already have New York okay I mean
you know we'd call that a revival of
Nazism but that's the official you has
been the official US Israeli position so
there's a lot to be instantly about Iran
nobody in their right mind wants Iran to
have nuclear weapons or anyone else but
it is well and it's a horrible regime
undoubtedly though there are worse ones
in the region which are our allies but
every everyone I'm not referring to
Israel I'm referring to the other Arab
state I'm in comparison with Saudi
Arabia Iran looks like a civil rights
paradise but the but it's awful you know
no doubt and and as a way to deal with
it
like for example moving towards a
nuclear weapons free zone but among
strategic analysts including Israeli
ones there is no real is there's no real
question about why Iran is moving to
nuclear weapons capability which is not
the same as
having nuclear weapons it's just being
at a point where you could have them
like most of the advanced industrial
world is in that position Japan Italy
all sorts of countries the reason is
very simple actually was described by
one of Israel's leading military
analysts very hawkish Martin fund Cray
felt a couple of years ago after the
invasion of Iraq he wrote an article in
which he said he doesn't know if Iran is
developing nuclear weapons and he hopes
not but he says if they're not
developing nuclear weapons they are
crazy
that was his word they're not developing
they're crazy the United States is just
announced we're going to attack anybody
we feel like and invade you if we can do
it with impunity so you better have a
deterrent well maybe they're developing
a deterrent no serious analysts thinks
that they would use nuclear weapons now
if you ran had nuclear weapons and
missiles which will be saying wants them
to have I mean if they went as far as
even loading a missile the country would
be vaporized you know instantly even if
there was a suspicion of it well you
know the clerics may be hideous people
but they've shown no particular
inclination for suicide and destruction
of everything that they own and
everything they value the same is true
about the leaking nuclear weapons to
others if there was any suspicion that
they were doing that you can say goodbye
to Iran so chances they're using it or
you know probably at the level of an
asteroid hitting the earth or something
like that but it's a serious problem in
fact if you look at the Israeli
literature they're pretty straight about
it they say the real threat of an
Iranian nuclear weapon is not against
Israel but it's against Zionism that is
what they're afraid of is that if the
region becomes too dangerous people in
is religious going to leave people who
have the capacity to more educated
wealthier and so on because they won't
want to live in a region with that
threat and in fact immigration is a
pretty serious problem emigration of the
educated and the the trained educated
sectors so they don't want to face that
threat but I don't think any serious
strategic analyst at least I've never
seen one who thinks that this the threat
that Iran might use a nuclear weapon I'm
gonna do it total suicide thank you
first thank you Anna good evening dr.
Chomsky um my question is concerning the
well just getting information how do we
how do we inform the intellectual
classes where do you find your
information and how do you how do you
access truth in in a media that's so
corrupt and overtaken by corporate
interests just how do you become a good
biologist you work you know I mean you
know that the important results aren't
like written in boldface I mean you know
the best biologist is not somebody who
read all the technical papers there are
and can't do that you have to know what
to look for and I have to like take say
would be some of the things I mentioned
like the International Atomic Energy
Agency resolution on Israel that I
mentioned well I was lucky I happened to
be in Mexico last September and they
have happen to have an independent
newspaper in Mexico that's the only one
in the Western Hemisphere that I know a
very good newspaper you know big
newspaper second-largest in Mexico gets
no commercial advertising because
business won't advertise there but they
subscribe they they do very well just on
reader support and they happen while I
was there they happen to run an
Associated Press piece on this well you
know I didn't know whether to believe it
or not so when I came home I checked up
Associated Press which is on the
internet and now it's true then
and I did a media search and I found out
that there was one mention of it in the
United States in the Muny paper in
Washington The Washington Times it also
won in the United Kingdom in the Irish
Times okay that's the kind of thing you
got to do on all sorts of issues I'm if
you know what you're looking for and
you're willing to put the effort into it
you can find out a lot of things now for
an individual it's extremely hard I have
to be kind of a fanatic but if you're in
a group if you're part of an
organization it gets a lot easier I mean
that's one of the advantages of joining
with other people you can do a lot of
things you can't do a or so so somebody
finds something you disseminate it you
know others help out and pretty soon you
get things done and one more thing if
you could just quickly repeat the the
column you mentioned in the beginning of
your if you're top o the the myth this
morning's New York Times
Ethan Brunner thanks who I think is a
terrible correspondent but he have never
good you haven't had a good column this
morning good honest column I also did
his homework he dug up the Chevette
article which didn't expect it's on I
don't think it's in English so it's in
Hebrew I believe and he also dug up that
international poll which I haven't seen
you reported it anyway so thanks for
coming again um I recently watched the I
guess the classic video of you with with
Buckley debating the Vietnam War back in
the 60s um so I feel like you've been
asked probably every question or Neath
the Sun so um I guess my question would
be what what does Noam Chomsky now wish
that Noam Chomsky back when he was
debating buckling in the 60s what is
what did he wish he knew and if you
could also indulge us what is your
happiest moment in life
I don't answer personal questions there
are well I don't actually remember I
think that debate was in 69 so can't
remember it in any detail but looking
back at the period in general my main
regret is I was much too mild I mean
what I should have been cold taking out
much stronger position
I mean Buckley's team would disagree
with that he would disagree yeah but if
I was having a debate with some soviet
commissar and i criticized what russia
was doing he'd say it's too harsh but
maybe you have to remember that it was
not easy then in retrospect the sort of
fairy tale is that everyone was opposed
to the war that's absolutely untrue I
mean in the early stages of the war in
Vietnam it was much harder to talk about
than it is to talk about Israel
Palestine today I'm in the as late as
October 1965 that's three years after
Kennedy had launched a major war against
the south in fact the South practically
destroyed we tried to have our first
public meeting in Boston
Boston's pretty liberal City there is a
place in downtown Boston wasn't common
which is you know dedicated to open
meetings so we figured okay we'll take a
chance and have a public meeting on the
Boston Common criticizing the war very
mild criticisms I mean it was broken up
by students if it wasn't that there were
a couple hundred State Police there we
probably all would have been killed the
Boston Globe you know the liberal
newspaper a huge denunciation how dare
you stand up and criticize our
magnificent government and so on it took
a long time before any kind of a peace
movement developed and then if you look
at how it developed in fact you can read
this today in your history books and in
the press and so on what developed was
quite different in the elite culture and
in the popular culture if you look at
the elite culture which
reading a history book or you know in
the newspapers and so on was that there
was a debate over whether the war was
winnable or not okay in fact when people
make analogies to Afghanistan you know
or Iraq they say well you know is it
winnable I mean that's like a debate and
the Nazi General Staff after Stalingrad
you know did Hitler make a mistake in
opening a two-front war you know should
we have knocked out England first I mean
that's the kind of debate that takes
place here now decades after the Vietnam
War that try to find check and see you
know history book press journals a
debate over whether it was simply a
monstrous crime the kind of crime for
which Nazis were hanged at Nuremberg go
on I mean in same today I mean it takes
a Obama he's considered a principled
opponent of the Iraq war you know a lot
of praise but what was his criticism his
criticism was that it was a strategic
blunder like Nazi generals after
Stalingrad or what you could read in
Pravda in 1985 when a lot of people were
saying openly I have a strategic blunder
to invade Afghanistan we don't call that
principled critique when others do it
and what we call it criminal but to try
to look at ourselves is extremely hard I
mean not just in the United States
almost anywhere your own history is
whitewashed consistently now even do it
in personal life if we're honest it's
pretty hard to look in the mirror but
it's crucial if you want to understand
the world and it's crucial for the
entire world in our case because the
u.s. are so powerful my second question
pardon you don't answer my second
question sure all right what's your
happiest moment in life
no that one as I said I'm not going to
answer no clam chowder or something
that's fun you just say clam chowder
yeah look a lot happier than that thank
you again for coming to speak to us
today was very informative in your talk
you discussed the importance of the
Geneva Conventions today and setting an
appropriate standard and code of conduct
with behavior and international affairs
especially in times of conflict you use
the Geneva Conventions and then you
apply it to Israel especially in their
loss of the war and some of the actions
that Israel's own past I want to ask
your opinion do you think that these
same conventions and stands are should
be applied to Hamas even though they are
non-state actor you don't have
conventional military forces and also do
you think that you need conventions need
to be adapted today for the question of
asymmetric warfare well on the second I
don't see any reason whatsoever why the
Geneva Conventions should be modified
for what we call a symmetric warfare a
symmetric warfare refers to our
invasions of other countries and
resistance to the invasions by people
who are weaker we didn't call it a
symmetric warfare when we were
supporting radical Islamists to try to
drive the Russians out of Afghanistan
okay we didn't call the partisans in
Europe a symmetric warfare when they
were fighting the Nazis isometric
warfare means when somebody tries to
defend themselves against us or our
client and there's no reason now the
Geneva Conventions have to be changed
for that any more than there were when
the Nazis killed the partisans you know
so the second question know as far as
Hamas is concerned Hamas is a political
party okay and I can't really apply
international law to a political party
you can say that actions of a criminal
of a political party are criminal right
and some of Hamas has actions are
criminal so sure
if for example take say the Amnesty
International report I mentioned it
didn't just say we should stop supplying
arms to Israel it said we should stop
applying arms to Israel and Hamas
well you don't supply arms to Hamas but
if we were doing it we should stop okay
so sure same standard should apply but
it's just you know it's so fantastically
disproportionate that it's almost
meaningless to raise the question
I mean if Hamas for example says we'll
never net recognize Israel okay
that's there's a political party has a
right to say that I'm a political party
in Mexico says I'm never going to
recognize the United States which sits
on half of Mexico obtained by conquest
that's a legitimate position the ruling
party in Israel they could happens to
have as its platform you can pick it up
in the internet it's official platform
is there cannot be a Palestinian state
anywhere in what they call the Land of
Israel sure it into the seed okay it's a
kind of like Hamas this program plan
nobody talks about it because there are
a lion clients so you can say whatever
they want and they're not only talking
about it they're doing it but sure if
Hamas fires rockets that stay wrote we
should stop helping them do that and in
fact we should take actions to prevent
them from doing it and we know what the
actions are except the cease fire when
the US and Israel did accept the
ceasefire the Rockets stopped and that's
officially conceded you can read it on
the Israeli government website official
website socially we should take actions
to prevent criminal acts by sub state
actors I know my name is David target
one of the deans here and I wanted to
answer the question that
had about how what what we can do about
the various political situations that
we're hearing about and actually the
answer to that question lies right here
in this room um 18 years ago the East
Timor Action Network established if it's
kind of core here at an event that took
place in Solomon 101 when Allan Nairn a
journalist and Amy Goodman another
journalist had come here to talk about a
recent massacre in East Timor on one of
the last massacres one of the most
recent massacres that was part of an
ongoing series of massacres that had
killed roughly one-third of the
population of East Timor and your friend
about that quite a bit
on and on people here actually it only
took a few hundred people there's only
you know four or five hundred people on
this room got together and figured out
strategically who to talk to who to
write to within Congress on to end
military aid to Indonesia and that was
actually the very first step of the very
first action by the United States to um
it's a lie and say that we really
disapprove of what you're doing in
killing innocent to Marines people um
and it was beginning at the end of the
occupation and killing a text more on
right now unfortunately we're back on
the I will right now we're back at we're
back on in a similar situation on and
that is that we're about to about to
resume military aid to Indonesia and I'm
wondering what your thoughts about that
word and what we could
about this point yeah actually firming
Etan the east steamer Action Network was
quite an important to action the
Indonesian invasion of East Timor began
in 1975 with strong us support all the
way through also support of Britain
France and others Indonesia's a rich
country you know ten pages to be
friendly to them and as you said it
killed you know maybe the worst act of
genocide in the late 20th century or one
of the worst all completely with us
support opposition actually began in
seventy five but it was minuscule I mean
talk to two people about it it did build
up and after the Delhi massacre the one
you're talking about when Ellen there
and Amy Goodman were attacked by
Indonesian forces I did get some
publicity and groups and a town was
formed then that was extremely important
and remember that was 1991 and the
killing went on for another eight years
the Clinton administration strongly
supported Suharto he was our kind of guy
in Clinton administration's said right
through 1999 atrocities and massacres
continued is particularly striking
because this was the same year that
there was a lot of agonizing about the
Serbian atrocities in Kosovo which were
now near severe as what was going on in
East Timor of course the background
didn't even come close finally there was
a major massacre in August 1999 and at
that point international protests and
domestic protests which by then had
built up and eat then had a lot to do
with this international protests against
Clinton was so strong that he took a
very simple step he told the Indonesian
army it's over literally they had sworn
they're never going to depart this is
our province we're never going to leave
as they a you know a word from the
master saying
games over they immediately we through
okay that tells you something that tells
you for the first the preceding 25 years
the United States could have stopped it
you know with a flick of her wrist
you didn't have to bomb Jakarta you know
you didn't need sanctions didn't need
anything just stop supporting it's over
it's kind of a little like what happened
with South Africa and it could happen in
this case - oh okay - what can we do now
will y'all protest about it I feel in
there and who's pretty much living in
Indonesia now and taking very dangerous
steps Alan his fantastic person is now
challenging the Indonesian army to
arrest him in Indonesia he's publicly
charging them with the atrocities that
he's exposed and to be not a trivial
thing to do in Indonesia not a nice
place so he's protesting it quite openly
he's insisting on being allowed to
appear on television to denounce them
you know do something about it and he's
calling of course for an end to military
aid to the to them and eat down is too
socially we can join those efforts and
support him he's still facing serious
danger thank you so much once again for
coming today professor Chomsky and is a
member of Browns students for justice in
Palestine we would really like to thank
you for your message of support but my
question relates towards the nuclear
weapons particularly American the
American facilitation of both the
expansion of weapons programs in Israel
Pakistan and India which all seem to be
rather schizophrenic given their
complicated histories not only among
India and Pakistan but particularly
among Pakistan in Israel and India's
vacillating relationship with Israel so
I was hoping you could comment on that
on the Israel into your relationship on
just all three in the ways all three and
the second I guess
equally schizophrenic policy of the u.s.
supporting really just brutal regimes
particularly the Saudi and like Arab
monarchs who and the Egyptian government
who
in no way respect human rights and how
that facilitates American policy within
the Middle East and how that relates to
it's very straight I mean let's take a
gyp one of the worst dictatorships in
the region very harsh brutal
dictatorship you all read about Obama's
trip to Cairo how he was praised you
know for opening his heart to the Muslim
world everything's going to be different
you know we love you and so on what
didn't get much play maybe almost
nothing is a press conference where he
was asked on his way to Egypt what are
you going to say about Egypt as they put
it
authoritarian regime an authoritarian is
quite an understatement but what are you
going to say about Egypt's authoritarian
regime well take a look at Obama's
answer he said I don't like to use
labels for folks when a politician
pronounces the word folks you just get
ready for the next series of Lies that's
coming out otherwise you talk about
people but if you've heard of folks you
know so the next thing that came out is
he's a good man Mubarak he's running a
stable society and he's our friend so
I'm not going to criticize anything okay
what do you think Egyptians or anybody
in the Middle East can how seriously can
they take his comments about human
rights violations in Iran how seriously
should we take them and Saudi Arabia is
even worse you know so what does this do
for us I mean these are loyal clients
the Middle East energy reserves are one
of the most important issues in the
world you go back to the 1940s
high-level US planners we're talking
about you know this is what they called
a stupendous source of strategic power I
mean
one of the greatest material prizes in
world history if we can control that
region we can control the world and so
on and that hasn't changed
that's why the US has a massive
intervention in the Middle East all the
way through replacing Britain which used
to be in the forefront and yes they
support dictatorial regimes I mean it's
very well understood you recall the
George Bush's plaintive question why do
they hate us and the answer you know
they hate our freedom and so on I mean
the press was kind enough not the report
or commentators that the same question
had been asked by Eisenhower in 1958 he
raised the question why is there a
campaign of hatred against us among the
people of the Middle East not the
government's but among the people and it
was a little surprising in 1958 because
that was right after the u.s. had
intervened to kick Israel England and
France out of Egypt which they invaded
but still there was a campaign of hatred
well the National Security Council
released highest planning body released
the study of it and said it's true that
they said there's a perception in the
Middle East that the United States
supports harsh and dictatorial regimes
and blocks democracy and development and
we do it because we want to gain control
over their resources and I went on to
say well you know perceptions more or
less accurate and that's what we should
do okay then don't hate us because they
hate our freedoms they hate us because
they want their freedoms and they
understand that the u.s. supports
dictatorial oppressive regimes blocks
democracy and development and we do it
because that's the way we control things
and it's the same today
actually after Bush's rather ignorant
question of the defense Science Board
one of the main advisory panels of the
Pentagon it came out with a study you
know why do they hate us study and they
said you know it's not our freedoms it's
our power
they hate our policies for good reasons
as long as we so why do we continue the
policies when they we know it's going to
lead to hatred it's because we're
trusting the dictatorships to hold down
their populations just as we're trusting
Keith Dayton's army to keep control of
the Palestinians so there will be a
legitimate partner for Israel I mean
that's our policy not only there but all
over the world and we didn't invent it
the British did the same you know the
French did the same and so on those are
Imperial policies we were in favor of
them okay let's be honest about it at
least and not pretend we're some kind of
a messianic Wilsonian state or not the
three countries with nuclear weapon oh
the three thousand clear wins well even
the Pakistan developed nuclear weapons
during the Reagan years and the Reagan
administration pretend that it didn't
though of course they know the reason is
they were supporting zeal Huck who's the
absolutely the worst and most atrocious
of the many military dictators that
Pakistan had zeal Huck was also carrying
out radical Islam ization of Palestine
of Pakistan with sooty support most of
this the kind of intellectual roots of
terror go right back to Saudi Arabia and
they were giving plenty of money so they
were providing lots of funding for
developing you know madrasahs actually
means schools but special religious
schools where the children are trained
just an extremist you know all they do
is read the Koran and you know learn
about extremist versions of Islam the
sooty versions and Reagan was supporting
that
so we supported part of his legacy is
you know al-qaeda style Tet terrorism
another part is Pakistani nuclear
weapons and the reason for it was
you know they were the Reagan
administration was and also the
Democrats were very excited about
Afghanistan they were gathering up the
most extreme radical Islamist fanatics
they could find anywhere in the world
and sending them to Afghanistan and
arming and with advanced weapons and so
on the goal was not to liberate
Afghanistan in fact the head of the CIA
station in Islamabad Pakistan who was
running the operation was very straight
about it he said we don't care one way
or another about Afghanistan the point
is to kill Russians and he said that's a
noble goal and that's what we want to do
when they got that goal they left
Pakistan in the hands of the u.s. back
were Lords were so vicious that when the
Taliban came they were welcomed so
that's Pakistan India actually the u.s.
as long as India was either neutralist
or you know had pretty good relations
with the Russians the u.s. was opposed
to their developing nuclear weapons and
imposed sanctions but by the last 10
years or so India has been drifting
towards a closer alliance with Israel
and the United States so and part of
that context is well they can have
nuclear weapons if they like and will
support it the treaty that granted in
the the right to develop nuclear weapons
with our support has a somewhat broader
context for one thing it was sold here
straight out as for commercial advantage
that opens up India to arms sales from
the United States sales of nuclear
technology and so on you know like a big
market and growing country but also it
has to do with Iran I mean a centerpiece
of US policy is to isolate Iran now
India is energy short and the obvious
way for them to get energy is with a
pipeline from Iran and Iran Pakistan
India pipeline because Iran is rich in
energy but the u.s. doesn't want that it
wants them not to
Iranian energy part of the way to talk
him out of it was to give them support
with developing nuclear energy which
meant freeing up nuclear weapons
development and actually the invasion of
Afghanistan has to do with that too I
mean in the background of the invasion
of Afghanistan this goes back 20 years
is the idea of setting up a pipeline
from Turkmenistan Central Asia which is
very rich in natural gas one of the
biggest in the world pipeline from there
to India which would run through
Afghanistan in fact it would run through
Conda haar the place that's there now
planning to attack and that pipeline if
it could be established would have two
functions for one thing it would
undermine efforts to establish Iran
India relations and it would also
undermine Russia's efforts to maintain
control of its former you know parts of
what used to be the Soviet Union that's
a kind of a background consideration for
the invasion of Afghanistan that we know
it's just how significant it is but in
that context understandable can't
approve of it but it's understandable
why the US government both Republicans
and Democrats would agree to support
India's violation of the
non-proliferation treaty and develop
nuclear weapons as far as Israel is
concerned that goes back to the Nixon
administration Nixon administration made
a deal with Israel that if you're in
turn the details this is a the main book
about it is by an Israeli analysts Avner
Cohen that's in English what he reports
is that it's not on paper but assume
that Nixon and prime minister golda meir
just made a deal that the US would
permit Israel to maintain its policy of
silence you know not admitting that it
has nuclear weapons and not denying it
and that the US would not interfere with
that and Obama reiterated that
after the International Atomic Energy
Agency called on Israel to open up its
facilities so yeah it's a client state
to valued us-ally so if they want to
have nuclear weapons okay you started
addressing the question but you've been
talking extensively about what
international laws we've violated and
how we violated them but maybe what what
I would like you to elaborate a little
bit on is why we violated them and as a
follow-up to that is what concern to
local population / international law
which would give in our quest to global
domination and our access accessing
local local natural resources look I'm
supposed some unbelievably powerful
country you know from Mars that decided
to take over us agricultural and mineral
resources because they wanted them I
suppose they were powerful enough to do
it what would we say they should do we
know what we would say they should do
okay same when we carry out what's
calling literally called protecting our
resources so you go back to top US
planners you know George Kennan and the
rest they say we have to use force to
protect our resources which happened to
be in other countries but that's not
like an accident of history a Clinton
for example his official doctrine which
was worse than Bush's was but it was
quiet so he made a fuss about it but the
official doctrine was that the u.s.
maintains the right to use force to
ensure our control over markets and
resources elsewhere okay that's our
commitment should we do that should any
other country do that I mean should
should do we did we support Saddam
Hussein when he invaded Kuwait why not I
mean he was trying to take control of
their resources which he actually had a
claim on you know there's an a serious
Iraqi claim to
a quake which was sort of stolen from
Iraq by the British to block Iraqi
access to the sea when those those but
did we say okay that's fine you can
protect your you can take your resources
by invading Kuwait I mean we have a
principle about this and we apply it to
everyone except ourselves for our
clients okay that's should we do that
well it depends whether you like to live
in a criminal city in a criminal society
as far as why we violate international
law it's just pretty straightforward
because we can get away with it
there's nobody else in the world does
not do anything about it and as long as
the American population is passive and
obedient no but nobody will do anything
about it here I mean takes a the the
World Court case that I mentioned to
repeat the u.s. is the only country now
having lost the companionship of Albania
and Libya the only country that has
violated a World Court decision take a
careful look at that world court
decision it's very illuminating the
court Nicaragua brought a case to the
world court run by a very distinguished
international lawyer Harvard Law
Professor the World Court threw out most
of the case almost the entire case and
just drew a decision on very narrow
grounds bilateral Nicaraguan US treaty
why'd they throw out the case because
the world courts rules require that it
cannot adjudicate a conflict unless both
parties agree to the jurisdiction now
when the u.s. accepted world court
jurisdiction in 1946 okay it added a
reservation saying that the u.s. is
immune to any case that relies on
international law meaning anything
involving the UN Charter or the charter
of the Organization of American States
the u.s. is immune to anything brought
up under those
conditions meaning the US this is 1946
when it was pretty much running the
world essentially said look we do not
accept jurisdiction we do not accept the
application of international law to
ourselves so though in the world Court
you know accepted that that's the way
its rules work and it even goes on I
mean in a couple of years ago I forget
early 2000s Yugoslavia brought a case to
the world Court about the NATO bombing
of Serbia okay one of the charges in the
in the indictment the petition that they
brought to the court was on genocide
well the u.s. withdrew from the court
proceedings on the valid grounds that
when the u.s. signed the Genocide
Convention after 40 years it added a
reservation saying it doesn't apply to
us okay so we're free to commit genocide
well okay we're free to commit genocide
we're free to violate the the UN Charter
and any other international treaty
because we say so okay and we can say so
first of all practically nobody knows it
you know you have to be kind of like a
specialist in the topic to know it I
mean if we cared about our freedom you'd
teach this kind of thing at elementary
school but almost nobody knows that
except the few specialists and it's if
it's brought up it would be considered
perfectly legitimate i'ma take say the
International Criminal Court when the
International Criminal Court was
established a couple of years ago it was
not permitted to include the crime of
aggression the most serious crime of all
because the US wouldn't tolerate that we
don't want the charges of aggression to
be floating around because we do too
much of it so that was knocked off then
even after that the u.s. refused to
accept the jurisdiction of the court now
the public wants to I mean the public is
strongly in favor of accepting
international jurisdiction but elites
are not
so the u.s. rejected the jurisdiction of
the International Criminal Court and in
fact a couple of years ago Congress
passed a law which the President signed
which in Europe is sometimes called the
Netherlands invasion Act the law
authorizes the President of the United
States to invade Holland if any American
is brought to the Hague to the
International Court to rescue them visit
I mean can anybody else even say that
you know yeah okay if you're a big
enough bully and you have an obedient
population you can do what you like
thank you very much hi um I was I was
thinking you talked earlier on that the
USA in America and Israel we're kin in
hand together committing war crimes and
breaking international laws and I know
that the u.s. USA gives over a billion
dollars to Israel annually and we as US
citizens we just paid we recently just
did our taxes and I can't help but think
wow some of my tax money is going to go
to Israel to help kill my family and
friends in Palestine and then as
Americans we go and try to enter
Palestine / Israel and we were given
denied entry and our American
citizenship are stripped away from us
and we give no they give us no reason
why like they give no explanations
denied entry and that's about it
who are you referring to who um I guess
a lot of my friends and families who are
not necessarily Palestinian Americans
but also Asian Americans are just not
allowed in not allowed entry you mean
yeah are given denied entry
but are given no explanations that's the
least of it yeah that's actually this
there are few Jews were not allowed
entry like Richard Falk the UN
Rapporteur for Gaza or Norman
Finkelstein maybe others Americans you
know happen to be Jewish but sure that's
bad but you know that doesn't begin to
compare with the crimes that are being
committed in the occupied territories
and certainly when you when American
citizens paid taxes that not only are
they helping fund Israel but though they
don't know it they're funding an
organization which is committed by law
in Israel to work for the benefit only
for the benefit of people on quoting of
of Jewish race religion and origin and
that organization is not a small when it
happens to control about 90% of the land
in Israel and Americans are contributing
to that because that organization has
tax-free status it's called the Jewish
National Fund I mean would you want to
contribute to an organization that is
bound by law to in say in the United
States to control 90% of the land for
the benefit of people of you know white
religion race and origin or something I
mean that's kept very quiet because of
Americans don't do anything about this
they wouldn't like it so okay that's the
task of people who care about the world
let people know
you
you
