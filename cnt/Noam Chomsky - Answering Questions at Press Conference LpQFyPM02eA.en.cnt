and the best jokes you see it obviously
answering the questions if they want to
do it I'm not very good at press
conferences and just they're all into
the floor and you can take a pop factor
but I'll never leave us the world's most
yeah I'm something what's your Indian
all in such overly populist left-wing
agitators such as Michael Moore on
whether they're of any looked healthy in
America today well I don't exactly know
what overly populist means he's trying
to reach the general public I don't know
that's the left he reaches the general
audience just out of curiosity Mike I
don't see films much but my wife and I
went to watch Bowling for Columbine and
went purposely to a sort of lower
middle-class working-class neighborhood
stay with the react more interested in
the reaction than in the film and it was
interesting I mean in a way he was
mocking their beliefs and commitments
but it was not pretty enthusiastic
audience whether because fairly clear
whether it was because they were
regarding it as satire and not
meaningful or whether they resonated
that what he was saying but he certainly
has has reached the very wide audience
but not particularly the left but she's
not talking to
told that they don't like guns but and
of course there's a backlash so across
the spectrum of educated opinion from
what's called left in the United States
like the New York Times which recently
was described as the most left-wing
institution on the face of the earth by
the president's economic adviser a
distinguished economist from Harvard the
so from the New York Times over to the
far right there's a they exploit his
exploit him as a way of kind of
undermine anything he's speaking for
actually that's true in England - I
don't read the English press regularly
of course but I did happen to be here
last May when the canon festival was
going on and I came close to winning a
prize and it was a long interview with
him in one of the British journalist
maybe the independent very cool which is
a rather derisive interview and I call
the author but entity made his standard
accusations that were wise and he's
trustworthy and so on the proof that he
lies the main proof that he lies which
was kind of interesting is that he
claims to have come from a working-class
background but his father owned the
house and on the car so he's lying his
father was an auto worker and he's
claiming to come from a working-class
background we've told he something about
not about him but about England and
about the way the notion class has been
eliminated from
consciousness so first names working
class he's not working class if he
happens to own a car every steel worker
does but that's pretty standard the kind
of division of his somewhat class-based
and somewhat populist critique what the
overall effect is it's hard to say
because the propaganda is all on the
others so what reaches readers of the
press and people watch television and so
on as the division and the fabrication
about is this untrustworthiness and so
on on the other hand he reaches a lot of
larger audience so it's a mixed makes to
fit yeah any other questions
it is yeah mrs. Jones I want to ask
about the Geneva Accords you have
recently induced them and I was
wondering I mean how do you see them as
being any different from what you call
the apartheid solution of the peace
process considering that the right of
return is given away yet the settlements
are not dismantled either and more
importantly even the resources in terms
of water and all these important
resources I mean that's not quite true
the first of all I wouldn't call the
peace process it's unclear which mean by
the peace process but if what you mean
is the international consensus of the
last roughly 30 years on a two-state
settlement on the international border
if that's what you mean whether peace
process then the Geneva Accords are
fairly for close approximation to it
innocently I didn't endorse them but I
suggested is that they're a very
appropriate basis for negotiation which
is why the United States unilaterally
and alone opposes them Palestinian
support them is really tough support on
the Europe supports the US has blocked
them and so therefore they're out of
discussion but there are a sort of a
natural evolution of the negotiations
that have been going forward towards
some sort of settlement roughly in
accord with the international consensus
the actual proposals at the Geneva
Accords the wording which on the right
of return is ambiguous Union should be
negotiated and I think can be fixed I
don't really think that's the issue
because on the right of return there
really is no disagreement across the
board at least among people who care
about the refugees
the fact of the matter is the refugees
are not going to return to Israel except
for a symbolic number for quite a long
time I mean it's possible at the end of
a long process of accommodation and
interaction and social and political
change there might be a possibility but
in the near term foreseeable future
it's simply deeply immoral to dangle in
front of suffering people the belief
that they're going to get something
which they're never gonna get there is
no international support for the right
of return to Israel there's a very
little Palestinian supported at the
political national arms those who try to
be realistic and if any support ever
developed which is hard to imagine
Israel would use its ultimate weapons to
prevent it meaning it would be nobody
left okay so therefore it to tell the
refugees we're going to get help you get
the right of return is simply deeply
immoral it's not a proper way to deal
with suffering of the people that were
really living in misery they should not
abandon the right of return I think
that's correct
just as the people who used to live
where I live and were mostly
exterminated by scotch-irish colonists
they have a right of return to but
they're not going to achieve it so the
right of return is legitimate but
implementation of the right is a
different question
could happen over a long period but if
we're serious it's not going to it can't
be an option for negotiation now the
serious issue is the territorial where's
the boundaries and on that the Geneva
Accords come closer to the international
consensus than anything so far I mean
they're the first ones that call for
hardly serious one-to-one land swap
which means a settlement roughly on the
border with some give either way and
that's that's actually the proposals
that these are the proposals that have
been on the international agenda for 30
years PLO accepted our states accept
them just reiterating them a couple of
days ago Europe Latin America
essentially everything the they're not
perfect you know but that as a basis for
negotiations I think they're very
sensible which is precisely why the
United States and Israel unilaterally
reject on any other questions do you
think it's more a part of the European
community of our an extension of America
Alma's another American state to Europe
in you've got your fate in your own
hands you know Europe is a powerful part
of the world it's comparable to the
United States or beyond and just at
every dimension except military force
which really doesn't matter in most of
these issues I set us up to Europeans
whether they would like to be sort of
dependent clients of US military power
were whether they would like to join the
large majority of American public
opinion which happens to be strongly
opposed to just about every policy in
the US government until look at US
public opinion it would it's very
similar to European public opinion on
just about every issue so when you talk
about the United States you're really
talking about u.s. the u.s. bipartisan
very narrow bipartisan
me
Elite consensus just very remote from
the population and Europeans have to
simply say well which America my
interested in the America that's in
favor of the kid the protocol that's
against the use of force and
International Affairs that wants to do
an International Criminal Court
that is in favor of spending on social
issues and not military and so on that's
the large majority of the population so
Europeans can decide do I want to be
connected with them where do I want to
be connected with Haley power which has
succeeded in largely marginalizing the
population so that the political system
is completely dysfunctional as a failed
state in that respect and that's that's
a choice that your hands after mate
I mean Britain has historically made the
choice of being the u.s. attack dog
basically but you know that's a choice
is not a necessity to what you think is
the best way forward for the left 37
were most probably gonna butt up against
a lock on mass media but to represent
the point of view that you thinking that
carried out at war and their of the
misinformation and weapons of mass
destruction human rights abuses
I was very hardly a point of your cross
because of media's was tightly
controlled
respect you know the media
overwhelmingly are instruments of
concentrated pride of the state power so
they're doing their job I mean should
criticize it but not surprised by it I
mean any more than you should be
surprised by the fact that a major
corporation is trying to raise profits I
mean you can say you can be critical of
this that thing they're doing but not of
their policies
I'll even be critical in existence of
the institution that's a different right
as for what the best way forward for the
left is I think it's to recognize that
the left is really the center if you
think I'm like my opinions I suspect
probably yours knowing you
in the United States and in England I
hadn't seen polls in England but I so
much the same the United States is very
heavily pulled I'm right in the ministry
in fact in many respects the public
opinion goes beyond what I would have
said I mean I agree with it but it's a
like for example majority of the public
in the United States I think that the US
ought to give up the veto of the United
Nations and follow the majority decision
I mean that is so remote from discussion
but you know it sounds like it's from
Mars nobody could say that or Wednesday
but it is the majority of public and
it's the same on other issues I mean say
take the Kyoto Protocol just when
there's you read in the press that
you're - that the United States didn't
go along have rejected the Kyoto
Protocol's
unilaterally
agree but that's true only in a very
peculiar sense now if you really despise
democracy with passion it's true the US
government did vote against it but the
American public is very strongly in
favor of so if the public is part of the
United States it's not true that the
u.s. opposed the public effect is so
strongly in favor of it
that a majority of bush voters assumed
that he was in favor of because this is
an obvious thing to be in favor and the
same goes through an issue after issue
I'm take just pure domestic issues so
the federal version just came out a
couple of weeks ago you go through the
federal budget what it expanded what it
cut and so on if you look at public
opinion which is carefully study it's
exactly the opposite on every issue
every issue run through it if legend
says X public says not X dramatically
and in a country where the public has
been largely excluded from the political
arena
like the United States or England to a
large extent it sort of doesn't matter
on the media note but that gives lots of
opportunities for the left in fact these
are very optimistic results it says the
country's just ready for organizing
activities which can recreate something
of a functioning democratic system and
then won't be what I want
a lot better than what exists now so
there's endless opportunities but it
doesn't make sense to complain about the
fact that the media are doing a job
which is to support to reshape the world
in support of the interests of power
which is pardon I mean be glad that
they're journalists like John Pilger and
others around don't do it but they've
got to be in a kind of fringe almost
necessarily for institutional reason and
then that's not an insuperable barrier
wonderful one thing the media are not
uninfluenced by public opinion I mean
even in a totalitarian state the
government is got to respond to public
attitudes just have to and in much more
free societies that's of course true the
plenty of ways of pressuring leading and
it has effects and then they're all
alternatives by now alternatives are not
difficult to construct contemporary
technology thanks to the Pentagon allows
lots of opportunities for alternative
media which reach plenty of people can
ask two-part question one which like to
comment on the fact that BBC has written
has issued a written apology to the
Israeli government for having
interviewed Mordechai Vanunu without
contributor going through the military
censors and connected with which Vanunu
is no the director the classical
University we think that and immodestly
we know have some kind of democratic
mandate among one body of students and
for Palestinian human rights and against
weapons of mass destruction
the BBC action would be comparable to
that having issued an apology
to Joseph Stalin for her interviewed of
Russian didn't think any further comment
is necessary about that it's
particularly grotesque in Britain since
he was kidnapped by the Israeli
intelligence taken to Israel given what
didn't even out to a sham trial I mean
they try to pretend there was a trial
put in prison for 18 years I think about
12 in solitary confinement I which is
pure torture
you know that's when he got out I
started corresponding with him and it's
amazing that he survived that but not
without problems of course and now
they're a very statistically and without
any political purpose of restricting him
in all kinds of arbitrary ways including
the latest imprisonment for having gone
to church somewhere where he's not
supposed to go to talk to a foreign
journalist or something for the BBC to
apologize for it be willing to talk to
him requires no comment the Glasgow
University decisions student decision
was very important thank you my
University there's no an effort that
might be an effort to try to award in
the fellowship for next year for human
rights program and I think many more
things of that and what that kind of to
be done to put pressure on
indirectly on Israel but primarily on
our own government the ones we can
influence which set very narrow
conditions on what is
and it's very easy to criticize Israel
for doing this that the other thing
that's also very misleading I mean they
can do precisely nothing unless they're
permitted to permitted by the United
States and secondarily your that sets
the balance within which is small state
and operate US and that's these are
things that we can certainly influence I
mean here I don't know you can't take a
poll on for the for the simple reason
that in the United States at least I
don't think you know one out of a
million people that are heard of that's
distinct from say European and East
European visit but among the people that
ever heard of it there's a total outrage
and that can be can be turned into an
effective weapon not only for him
personally but for everything that he
represents which is not just his freedom
but non-proliferation and after all
that's a major issue probably gonna wipe
out the species it's not a minor issue
and he's a symbol of what the
non-proliferation movement ought to be
making sure that the nuclear States
don't have nuclear weapons and you
couldn't have a better symbol so that's
it C stands for something of an
extraordinary wouldn't affect survival
of the species is what he stands for and
that's not an exaggeration chances of
total destruction by nuclear war
reasonably high and increasing I see who
else would like to ask just mr. Chomsky
a question so from some idea time it's
got a grueling schedule what
across the question all right the g8
summits into the needles with each year
in our series the Scottish practically
been obsessed with anarchists and
demonstrations and Lisa be circulating
all sorts of rumors about what might
happen including support attacks in the
Parliament in all sorts of outrageous
smears and in particular one of the
things that we serve saying is that
they're gonna have access to Navarro
plastic bullets to watch cannon imported
from Belgium to thousands of police
imported from the border and one of the
things that suggests to us issues is
that they've travelled slightly wavy
demonstrators from commenting illegals
tony blair has said just the other
evening with something real that he
doesn't know why people will demonstrate
against the DA because the entire
gender' is for the good of humanity it's
Africa is quite a changed cetera what
would you say in response to do what
does what does the river do challenge
the median is reporting challenge the
police make sure that they trying show
the demonstrations will be peaceful to
attract more and more presence of people
or what if the past is any guide and
it's the only guide we have I would
suspect that the hysteria about
anarchist violence and bring in police
and so on is probably provocation and
they like nothing more than to provoke
the violent confrontation that puts the
issues of the agenda then you don't have
to bother with the issues that the
protesters are raising and you can talk
about the fact that somebody threw a
stone at a bank window and in the past
even at these demonstrations but
traditionally a large part of the
violence is provoked by its provocateurs
in Paranal in Genoa for example that
turned out that a lot of the violence
was just police provocation internal to
the people who sort of put on just style
clothes and then were to discovered a
couple of days later at the local police
station and that's quite typical not
just here but generally so for example
in Algeria and the 1990s there was
tremendous violence attributed to
Islamic fundamentalists but it turned
out on investigation that the typical
act of actually there was a study done
by expatriate Algerian physicists some
of them one of them at Oxford one of
them at MIT which is I got to know about
it in which they just did a careful
analysis of the massacres in Algeria and
published a big volume about it which
incidentally was banned in France the
interest of freedom what they discovered
was that the typical massacre would be
in a refugee camp where people dressed
up as kind of Hollywood versions of an
Islamic fundamentalist would come into
the camp and spent three days
slaughtering everybody the camp would be
maybe you know a kilometer away from a
major military base with nobody noticed
it and after the place was wiped out and
hundreds of people were killed and so on
six months later some general would come
buy up the land for my five cents and
build a fancy tourist hotel or something
like that and it also turned out the
French intelligence was involved
directly France never gave up Algeria
they just tried to reconstruct their
control of it in other ways economic
political and the standard devices of
Western society things by inheritance
intelligence and security penetration to
carry out provocations
well that's been typical of the big
demonstrations forever remembered very
well in the 1962 fed in the 1960s I was
involved very much in organising
resistance and the resistance groups
were really invested in a deep way we
did
things that we did not publicly know but
every group knew very learned very
quickly that you cannot have you can't
just talk about anything serious in a
meeting which includes say seven or
eight people because one or two of them
will be an informant
so everything serious that had to be
done we've always done with affinity
groups small groups of people who don't
know each other you can trust each other
and so on and that's true on just about
everything
so I'd assume it's very likely true here
too and the trying to build up an
atmosphere of tension will both tend to
provoke the violence that they're hoping
for and if it doesn't they'll do it
themselves
that's what Lisa provocateurs are for
it's an old tradition of security forces
what the protest I mean their statement
is
like the BBC apologize let's talk about
it we know what G ages it's not a
monetary organization and the protesters
had something very important to say a
navigate across one of the methods of
preventing them from doing it will be to
create an atmosphere of violent
confrontation in which case you can talk
about stone-throwing and ignore to the
significant points that are being
brought out
but the demonstrators should have their
pursue their own agenda actually this is
extremely typical of lots of and it's a
long history of this you take a look at
the whole history of the external
imperialism or internal domestic control
so it always most always turns into a
matter of a confrontation between two
kinds of strength you know one is
political strength the others military
strength the imperial powers and
military strength but not political
strength that's Angela population
domestically and whether it's union
organizing or you know protests about
government policies or whatever it's the
public that has political strength it's
the power centers that have the means of
violence and that just extends to almost
everything and it means that a very
natural you know the proper tactic for
those in powers they try to shift
everything to the arena of violence
because that's where the strong and the
proper tactic for everyone else
to shift matters but the to the domain
of issues principles and so on because
that's where the air strong and I
suspect that what you're describing is
just the preliminary stages of trying to
shift the entire event to the domain of
violence where first state power is
overwhelming and the shifted away from
the arena of debate and discussion where
state power is very weak and have to
react expected and reactive canasta
tools and would you would you believe as
media live colonies moving steadily it
was made a momentous occasion in freedom
prosperity democracy we had a couple
hundred years of history living right up
to the present and they're not opposed
like for example traditionally say the
United States and England France and
others have supported democracy at home
and abroad as long as it's under control
so it's better to have formal democracy
in which people cast votes and that's
everything but only as long as they're
excluded from political decision-making
and that's been the struggle in the more
free and democratic societies for
hundreds of years I mean the fixate in
England became formally more or less
democratic society about a hundred years
ago that's when you started getting
Labour Party's mass suffrage there's
some degree of participation in the
political system and the reaction was a
very strong reaction to say well we
can't stop this anymore we can't break
it down but violence so we have to
figure out ways of accommodating it
that's when for example in the public
relations industry again
and it's striking that it developed in
the United States and in England the two
freest countries in the world and in
this in both countries it developed very
consciously now you read it in this
literature as a way of dealing with the
fact that people can't be controlled by
force anymore you can't break up the
union organizing by police violence is
going beyond that you can't stop
parliamentary Labour Party's and smaller
so the you have to shift to controlling
attitudes and opinions by other means so
you get these huge industries devoted to
the trying to get control to the
opinions and the atomized people that
marginalize them and so on and so forth
so that kind of democracy and then a
struggle goes on we're going to have
real democracy
decision-making popular ratification
with political scientists called
polyarchy which is what the England
states over other countries so that's
domestically and internationally it's
the same thing under there they're not
opposed to prosperity as long as the
people who matter the rich and powerful
get what they need then it's kind of
irrelevant whether other people can
survive unless they can okay there's no
opposition to it but policies are
naturally designed in the interests of
the policymakers and it's you know
that's the whole of history nothing
he's even moving to Asda or moving
towards one and the Middle East in
Jinnah the Middle East like every other
part of the world for years decades I
mean the Middle East has been moving
towards democracy so if you go back say
to the 1950s in in 1958 it's a very
crucial year world affairs and the least
Affairs particularly we know from it in
the United States a very free country
most free in the world with huge access
to internal planning records
declassified documents and so on so in
principle you can know a lot about what
happened
part of the job of the media and
educated sectors is to prevent the
population from knowing it but it's
there and what you find is that in 1958
the Eisenhower administration had three
major foreign policy crisis one of them
was Indonesia one was North Africa and
the other was the
it's only all Islamic and critically all
oil producers which was the religion and
in each case democracy was a serious
issue in Indonesia there was it was a
post-colonial society and it was
developing parliamentary forms and the
government was simply too democratic it
was permitting a party to the poor to
participate in elections and it was
winning a lot of political power it
looked like it might even become a
majority and the Indonesian military and
the United States agreed that if they
couldn't be controlled but it would have
to be military coup to destroy them that
was 1958 in effect Eisenhower ran the
biggest clandestine operations in
American but we're history up until
Nicaragua to try to support a military
whose would take over the outer islands
where all the resources are even under
US control that didn't work and then
they turn to supporting military and
ended up with their pool and that took
care of democracy today massacre maybe a
million people most of them from the
party of the poor the problems with
democracy anymore
now that's when
since we acted with utter euphoria as
the United States stated about this
great achievement so that took care in
Indonesia in North Africa the problem
was Algeria Algerian independence which
is another manifestation of popular
efforts they control over your own lives
well that sort of get fast in some
fashion when a formal Algerian
independence was granted in the Middle
East the problem was that every act
which had been a British dependency ever
since the British created it the early
20s broke out of the anglo-american
condominium over energy production which
is crucial for world control Iraq had a
sort of a populist who I was a big
problem if there was consent they
thought over England in the United
States reacted with complete mysterio
the British Foreign Minister so employed
flew to Washington discussions with John
Foster Dulles and they decided that
their actual decision was that
exact words that if it's that for one
thing they decided was to grant the
British colony of quite nominal
independence so like a kid at his own
post office that kind of thing but to
try to restrict the threat that
independent nationalism might spread but
if anything went wrong for whatever
reason internal equate or anything else
the British would intervene as they said
ruthlessly is suppressive because the
British economy relied quite heavily on
weighty investments and oil resources so
Britain would intervene ruthlessly to
suppress any move and quate towards
anything you know internal that's part
of the background of the invasion of
1991 and the United States accepted the
same right ruthlessly to intervene in
the big oil producers relative role with
the US mainland by in Saudi Arabia and
the Emirates and so on and the point was
to try to prevent the spread of secular
nationalism which was symbolized by NASA
and what they were really concerned
about was that the Nasari pressures
would try to use the resources of the
region which are immense for their own
populations instead of the way it's
supposed to work for the wealth of
Western corporations
lately to work with and well that
problem is taken care of by the Israeli
by the 1967 war which will destroy it an
answer and made is really just like that
he loveth my state of West for having
achieved people and that's the relation
never sent us but but if you look back
that's 1958 and the concern in all three
areas was too much pressure toward
democracy abilities and they were we're
so for example Eisenhower in 1958
discussed with his staff secretly what
he called the campaign of hatred against
us in the Arab countries and they
discussed why and the National Security
Council Elias planning agency attributed
it to what they said the perception in
the Arab world that the United States is
opposed to democracy and development and
supports accredit regimes and military
dictatorships because the US wants to
maintain control over their energy
supplies and they said well the
perception is essentially accurate but
that's what we ought to be doing and it
continues right up to the present you
know neither studies done right after
9/11 and I found essentially the same
reactions and it's precisely the same
today you take a look at every single
case which is called
u.s. British support for democracy it's
actually extremely reluctant
accommodation to independent democratic
forces which then you try to shape
modify that assembly I mean say thank
you for at you know I mean it's so
obvious in Iraq that even the editors of
the Financial Times described accurately
because it just can't miss it
I mean Britain and the United States
were passionately opposed to elections
in your right and try to every
possible way to block them that they
just couldn't deal with the nonviolent
resistance I don't really care about the
bomb throwers it's again usual story I
mean violence is this is a near monopoly
of violence and they end to the powerful
state so if it's gone throwing okay they
can take care of it but what they
couldn't take care of was the nonviolent
resistance you know the mass popular
refusal to accept the u.s. British
efforts to write a constitution to have
a caucus system which would obey
elections and so on
when they finally were forced to it
agreed of it they of course to credit
for it that's natural again and then the
first thing that they did was to say on
the day after the elections Tony Blair
at a major interview with the Financial
Times big full-page interview and she
starts off by saying right away they
were going to subvert the elections and
it's simple vertices but that's the
meaning he was asked first question he
was asked in the interview was will
written in the United States present a
timetable for withdrawal and his first
comment is there is no possibility of
any timetable for withdrawal that was
the leading plank of every party in the
election so what Blair was saying yeah
we were forced to accept elections we
were gonna subvert and that's what the
headline would have been in any Free
Press in the world and they said the
same in Washington yeah so yeah we were
forced to accept them can't get around
it now I got a suburban and this is the
crucial issue it's not the only one
other ones are whether the US and
Britain can maintain the illegal
legislation that was imposed by the
occupying forces which essentially open
up its economy to the foreign takeover
and they're acting odd it's not like
it's a vagina traversing the United
States you're trying to force them to
keep it that's true all along but that's
you know it's so typical that for anyone
in those any modern history this kind of
footnote you know it's exactly what
you'd predict it's exactly what always
for the son and for and it's rational
you know it's not surprising it's what
you'd expect if you're rational it's
what you always do and the same is true
in every other case that it's
interesting that the more honest
scholars who advocate all of this know
that people are really directly involved
in it they started conceded they regard
it as what they call a double stand or a
paradox or an inconsistency I mean the
paradox is that the powerful states I
have a rhetorical standard which they
was always inconsistent with their
actual practice and that's a strange
paradox which you need to kind of think
the thinkers to explain that's why it
feels like international relations
theory and so on to try to explain this
strange paradox that people produce
uplifting rhetoric and then act in
different ways it's like we don't think
it's paradoxical when Stalin did it
so Stalin was full of the most uplifting
rhetoric about democracy and freedom and
so on but in different ways and we don't
have an academic discipline that tries
to look into the deep reasons why this
might be true but in the case of our own
elites you can't just say what's obvious
to say it so you need intellectual
discipline
located and complicated politic rhetoric
and so on that's why people go to
graduate school internalized by the
election like states took place the
American public were pretty wet where of
that the justifications the reasons and
the grounds on which the United States
for America
surrender is set up and triggers and
engaged in a war they were rebuilt by
the time did the elections took place I
mean most of the people got to know
actually that most of those
justifications were falsified and were
basically lies could one in the context
of the American palaces but in the
American elections and probably most
likely in the context of the next
general elections in Britain which are
likely to be one of our neighbor could
one possibly be justified in talking
about apart the magic shifts in
political force and political
consciousness in such a way that force
and palaces that probably a decade
twelve years ago would have been
condemned probably by a majority has
been neo-fascists being racist and now
except as nice tree analysis for one
thing just about the facts about the
American public which is to say we know
a lot about because there is very
intensive Poland one of the consequent
think that Iraq was developing weapons
of mass destruction and had relation
with al-qaeda and was planning mortar
attacks like 9/11 and you can understand
why they believe it of the Senate
Majority Leader Bill Frist during the
Condoleezza Rice hearings set it
straight up on the Senate floor he said
well you know we have to defend
ourselves against countries that are
developing weapons of mass destruction
planning the attacks on
on us like as her acted and the press
reports it in the interests of what then
the profession is called objectivity you
go to journalism school you're taught
have to be objective the objective means
you have to report what people in power
say without any analysis or criticism so
like if your objective in North Korea
you report what Kim jong-il says and you
don't comment on it now if your
objective and Brittany's work with Tony
Blair says they got some commentary on
the scientists but these are the net
effect of all of this is the public
basically believes it okay even after
it's been officially rejected as to the
and in fact those beliefs are highly
correlated with support for the war as
you'd expect so like I believe the
things that the public believes that
support the work too but if you compare
it with the past I think it's the
opposite of what they describe so take
say the election of Richard Nixon in
1968 32 I mean at that time about 70
percent of the public regarded the
Vietnam War as quoting fundamentally
wrong and immoral not a mistake 70
percent no among any leaves that was
non-existent so you can't find any and
barely find any statement like that
liberal critics and so on the most David
said is it was a mistake it's costing us
too much and so on but for the public it
was fundamentally wrong and immoral not
a mistake
nonetheless they voted for Nixon and
again you can understand why either just
forget another it's just on the war
issue I mean he had a plan for getting
the United States he ran on the program
of withdrawing from Vietnam okay he said
he has a secret plan to do it so even on
that single issue people voted for him
and remember that was after seven years
in 1968 was after six years of war way
worse than Iraq I'm in the u.s. attack
South Vietnam in 1962 Kennedy I have a
serious attack chemical warfare millions
of people driven into concentration
camps
marek bombing by the US Air Force no
protest not here either
it was years before any purpose
developed but here did by the time
develop South Vietnam in practically
destroyed and even then the kind of
doctrinal system had shifted the
discussion to the bombing of North
Vietnam the peace movement went along
with it so mostly was a protest against
the bombing of the north which was bad
but a peripheral issue the main issue
was the destruction of the south and you
know that has but even after years and
years of war and practically this
country directly destroyed
pretense about barely a pretense about
defending them preventing them not like
you're right
forever throwing at firing you know
nothing covered it up just straight
invasion and instructional massacre
virtually no protest when it developed
it was against a serious eye tissue and
the worst gangsters were elected I'm
there's been a lot of progress since
then in public attitudes so I think it's
the opposite of waited all right the way
it's presented to us is what you
described but I don't think that's what
happened if I protest against the
Vietnam War was so slight even as Pete
but to this day almost no one knows that
South Vietnam was the main target of the
attack North Vietnam this is no protest
against me I'm an England protest was so
slight I'm taking personal experience
that the person who sort of rant really
ran the international peace movement and
almost totally ran it in England was
Peggy Doug if she wasn't a militant a
woman she we've got 25 Nobel Peace
Prizes but she was excluded because of
this characteristic but she basically
Brannock internationally and in the in
England almost total she had to bring
people in from the United States like me
and business stone to give talks at
public meetings
in London just couldn't find any
well-known British figures are willing
to do a lot of more against the war
didn't want undignified did stand up in
the growling in opposing so that's when
I was in Oxford in 1969 that issue was
locked lecture and I spent correctly
every night getting talks of houses
Oxford to student colleges and you know
I asked asked me to hold left lane
faculty members of Congress party and so
they we do it I mean it's just it just
don't do that kind of thing if you're in
the British but but you know even in
1969 the protest was slowly generated
from the outside the large extent we're
from popular movements of course
neighborhood street and that's different
of some wonderful it was better after
you think about that the Iraq war was
unique in the history of Europe hundreds
of years of history try to find an
example I think this is the first time
in the whole history of European
violence which part of the world the
major war any even a minor war was
protested massively before it was
undertaken I can't
I mean just sitting on the biggest
demonstration of it against the Vietnam
War in London of zona there's a hundred
thousand people the big demonstration
against the war here the goal is two
million next a Lusitania fighting
question elections again given that I
mean the elections are coming up over
here as well yeah so I just wanted to
draw a parallel between what happened
were probably will happen now and what
happened in the US elections given the
amount of resentment that there was
against the Bush administration and then
the opposition to the Bush
administration was seen as not being too
different so and then people I mean the
leadership on the left in a way through
the weight behind not exactly through
the way behind caring but advocated that
I mean Kerry should be like hell they
should work Kerry just in order to get
Bush out but the question is that given
that at the beginning there were almost
35 percent people who wanted for a later
to run and later on I mean I feel that
it could have this was a moment when
some kind of a third party woman could
have developed if all those voices have
been taken into account instead I mean
those were those felt marginalized and
they felt that they could not make a
difference with say 35 you know maybe
100 percent wanted to run but probably a
hundred percent would want to Mickey
Mouse to run just because they think the
system will do the day any vet support
native support was very slight and if
you want to build a third party I mean I
think make sense to build a third party
political kind of it but you don't do it
by showing up every four years and say
for me I mean if you if you're seriously
interested in developing an electoral
alternative you do it every day
so say in Brazil a much more democratic
country than when England of the United
States there is a independent
alternative for me criticize it or
dislike it or whatever but the Workers
Party whatever you think about it is a
mass political organization that is
working every day you know locally
regionally variety of issues
all kind of participation and so on the
landless workers movement which is the
most important factor to movement in the
world hundreds dozen people is out there
every day doing everything from taking
over a work plan for limitless workers
and fighting off the police and get
killed and so on
the building collaborative setting up
the social system and so on that's
democracy and that doesn't exist and
barely exists in the United States me
and on the basis of that kind of
democratic participation constant
Democratic participation you can develop
Elector alternatives in fact in Brazil
they were powerful enough to be the
presidency but it's not something that
happens by showing up once every four
years saying vote for me and then
you know so the mayor campaign was not a
serious political tournament coming out
of nope
there is a party that those try to work
regularly Bream's but he said whatever
you think about him again but you know
he just treated them with contempt
his attitude third them was well you can
endorse me if you like or else get lost
that's not a reasonable political
alternative so the actual choice came
down to something complicated in the
United States elections are extremely
limited most it in Congress
very few seats are even up for election
the incumbent always wins so they're
fixed see that's partly because of
gerrymandering by the way they've drawn
the district so that the incumbents win
and partly just because of funding the
the candidate who receives more funding
almost invariably wins in the United
States you can predict it with close to
hundred percent accuracy so motor
Congress is barely a contestant and in
the presidential elections it's like
flipping a coin Terry got 29 percent of
the electorate Bush got 31 percent
a slight difference Kerry would be in so
the issue and most of the states were
safe states they were going to go one
way or the other
so the only issues arose in vertical the
swing states you know it was sort of
balance where the coin was not too
biased when he flipped it and in those
states the reasonable position I think
my position was that in those states is
you vote against bush because the party
positions are not identical the bush
positions are much more dangerous but
both of the world and for the general
population so keeping the worst out and
leaving a little space for work for the
future it makes sense I think the in the
safe stakes you can do anything look for
Nader for greens and not vote as a
protest against the very beautiful
system or whatever you thought like
these and what actually happened every
does it I was a little bit of an error
to talk about elections wherever they
wanted any elections and we don't call
it elections
yeah they had elections but the
elections are run very explicitly by the
public relations industry and it's not a
secret they're doing the task of selling
candidate and they do it exactly the way
they sell toothpaste I mean if you turn
on and see an ad on television you don't
expect to be informed you know what you
expect to be is deceived the point is to
deceive the public that's a major task
of business business which contrary
again what you learned in economics
departments business despises markets
they're afraid of markets they hate them
they're going to destroy them in
economics versus they give you slogans
about informed consumers making rational
choices but business spends hundreds of
billions of dollars a year to prevent it
they diluted and the same of Elections
so people had no idea what the
candidates did it was just which image
you prefer to be diluted by you like
John Kerry you know goose hunting and
driving a motorcycle or do you like
George Bush living on his fake ranch
that they built floor
although they're very good but you know
it's not an election miniseries I think
we have to go I promised you a question
but I'm told that we have to duplicate
this room fairly quickly
and thank you very much you know George
for coming and speaking to the press
conference all the tickets for the
events that had reversed although long
long time ago and they've been offered
family pets and various things and I
wanted to prevent it's not possible
thank you very much thank you
