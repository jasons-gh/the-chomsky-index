and the latest report that just came out
from Oxfam from Amnesty International
and other groups about the effects of
the siege on Gaza what's happening right
now the seed a siege is an act of war if
anyone insists on that it's israel
israel launched two wars 56 and 67 in
part on grounds that it's access to the
outside world was very partially
restricted that very partial siege they
considered an act of war and suggest
occation for one of several
justifications for what they call
preventive or if you like preemptive war
so they understand that perfectly well
and the point is correct the siege is as
a criminal act in the first place the
security council is called on it for
Israel to listed others have it's
designed to as Israeli officials have
stated to keep the people of Gaza to a
minimal level of existence they don't
want to kill them all off because that
wouldn't look good in international
opinion but as they put it to keep them
on a diet the justification this this
began the May issue very shortly after
the official Israeli withdrawal there
was a election in January 2006 the
actually the only free election in the
Arab world carefully monitored
recognized to be free but it had a flaw
the wrong people one and the US and
namely Hamas which the US didn't want in
Israel didn't want instantly within days
the US and Israel instituted harsh
measures to punish the people of Gaza
for voting the wrong way and free
election the next step was that
the US and Israel sought to along with
the Palestinian Authority tried to carry
out a military coup in Gaza to overthrow
the elected government this failed Hamas
beat back the coup attempt that was july
two thousand seven at that point the
seeds got much harsher in between there
were many acts of violence and Michelle
Wayne was invasions and so on and so
forth but the basic Israel claims that
the seat that when the truce was
established in summer 2008 Israel's
reason for not observing it withdrawing
the siege was that there's an Israeli
soldier gilad shalit who was captured at
the border and this is international
commentary regards this is a terrible
crime well whatever you think about it
capturing a soldier of an attacking army
and the army was attacking Gaza
capturing a soldier of an attacking army
isn't anywhere near the level of crime
of kidnapping civilians just one day
before the capture of Gilad Shalit that
the border israeli troops that entered
gaza kidnapped two civilians the one our
brothers spirited them across the border
they've disappeared somewhere in
Israel's prison system which is there
hundreds maybe a thousand or so people
sometimes there for years without
charges there are also secret prisons we
don't know what happens there is this
alone is a far worse crime than the
kidnapping of a shall eat and in fact
you could argue that there was a reason
why was barely covered Israel has been
doing this for years in fact decades
kidnapping capturing people hijacking
ships killing people bringing the Israel
sometimes as hostages for many years so
it's regular practice but the Israel and
do what it likes but the reaction here
and in the rest of the world of
regarding the Shelly kidnapping
not kidnapping you don't kidnap soldiers
the capture of a soldier as an
unspeakable crime a justification for
maintaining a murderous siege that's
disgraceful no so you have Amnesty
International Oxfam save the children 18
other aid groups calling on Israel to
unconditionally lift the blockade of
Gaza and you have in the wikileaks
release US diplomatic cable provided to
the Guardian by the by WikiLeaks laying
out quote national human intelligence
collection directive asking US personnel
to obtain details of travel plans such
as routes and vehicles used by
Palestinian Authority leaders and Hamas
members the cable demands biographical
financial biometric information on key
PA and Hamas leaders and representatives
to include the young guard inside Gaza
the West Bank and outside it says that
should not come as much of a surprise
contrary to the image that's portrayed
here the United States is not a an
honest broker it's a participant in a
direct part crucial participant in
Israeli crimes both in the West Bank and
in jazan the attack in Gaza was a clear
case in point used American weapons the
u.s. blocked cease fire efforts gave
diplomatic support the same is true of
the daily ongoing crimes in the West
Bank we shouldn't forget that actually
in Area C the area of the West Bank that
Israel controls conditions for
Palestinians or have been reported by
save the children to be worse than Gaza
and again this all takes place because
of on the basis of crucial decisive US
military diplomatic economic support and
also ideological support meaning
distorting the situation as is done
again
dramatically and the cables the seeds
itself is simply criminal it's a it's
not only blocking desperately needed age
from coming in it also drives
Palestinians away from the border Gaz a
small place heavily of densely
overcrowded and is Israeli fire and
attacks a drive Palestinians away from
the arable land on the border and also
dry fisherman in from Gaza and
territorial waters they're compelled by
Israeli gunboats all illegal of course
to fish right near the shore we're
fishing is almost impossible because
Israel has destroyed the power systems
and sewage systems and the contamination
is terrible this is just a stranglehold
to punish people for being there and for
insisting on voting the wrong way and
for just refusing Israel once they
decided we don't want it we don't want
this anymore let's just get rid of we
should also remember that us Israeli
policy since Oslo since early 90s has
been to separate Gaza from the West Bank
now that's that's in straight violation
of the Oslo agreements but it's been
carried out systematically that hasn't
been effect means almost half the
Palestinian population would be cut off
from any possible political arrangement
would ever be made it also means that
Palestine loses its access to the
outside world Gaza should have and can
have airports and seaports and the West
Bank it's what's being left I mean right
now Israel's taken over about forty
percent of the West Bank Obama's latest
offers have granted even more and
they're certainly planning to take more
and what's left is just can't nized it's
what the planner arielle shoreham called
bantu stands and they're in prison too
as Israel takes over the Jordan Valley
drives Palestinians out so these are all
crimes of a piece the Gaza siege is
particularly grotesque because of the
conditions under which people are forced
to live I mean if a young person and got
a student in Gaza let's say it wants to
study in a West Bank University they
can't do it if a person in Gaza needs
advanced medical training had treatment
from an East Jerusalem hospital with the
trainings available they can't go
medicines are held back I mean it's a
it's a scandalous crime what do you
think the United States should do in
this case what the United States should
do is very simple that you join the
world I mean there are negotiations
going on supposedly they're presented
here as standard picture as the US as an
honest broker trying to bring together
two recalcitrant opponents Israel
Palestinian Authority that's just a
charade I mean if there were serious
negotiations they would be organized by
some neutral party and the US and Israel
be on one side and the world would be on
the other side and that is not an
exaggeration it shouldn't be a secret
that there has long been an overwhelming
international consensus on a diplomatic
political solution everyone knows the
basic outline some details you can argue
about it and includes everyone except
the United States and Israel the US has
been blocking it for 35 years with
occasional departures brief ones it
includes the Arab League it includes the
Organization of Islamic states which
happens to include Iran includes every
relevant actor except the United States
and Israel the two rejectionist States
so if there were to be negotiations that
were serious that's the way they would
be organized the actual negotiations are
barely reached the level of comedy the
issue that's being debated is a footnote
minor foot
expansion of settlements of course it's
illegal in fact everything that Israel's
doing in the West Bank and Gaza is
illegal that's been it hasn't even been
controversial since nineteen sixty seven
known we have to break my own highest
legal we're going to come back to this
in a minute Noam Chomsky author and
institute professor emeritus at MIT as
we talk about WikiLeaks and the state of
the world today this is democracy now
