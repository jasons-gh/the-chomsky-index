the high-tech weapons have become the
stars of the war Tomahawk cruise
missiles there is a system of domestic
power that's not a great secret that has
an enormous influence on everything that
happens in the society it it directly
determines production consumption
patterns and so on and so forth it
strongly influences in fact largely
controls the political system pretty
much limiting it to two factions of a
business-oriented party and as far as
the media are concerned they are simply
part of that system
we are a public corporation there are
people who buy our stock asking us to
deliver a return to them I have always
considered myself a banker I am a banker
I am an officer of a company that uses
other people's money and invest and we
try to use it carefully so I I think
it's wonderful that our news department
is profitable and they are simply major
corporations parts of even larger
conglomerates like any other
corporations they sell a product to an
audience to a market the the market in
this case is advertisers other
businesses and for the agenda for the
major media the product that they sell
is basically audiences and privileged
audiences
[Music]
you say okay you are selling widgets and
your widgets are for the 18 to 49
population we happen with this program
XYZ to deliver a hundred thousand
viewers in that age group so every
hundred thousand dollar for every
hundred thousand we're gonna charge you
all ten fifteen twenty thousand dollars
wait obviously it's the the news product
is going to reflect the interests and
the commitments of the sellers the
buyers and the product unfortunately it
is cold they present a picture of
reality that conforms to the needs of
power and power in our own society
happens to be largely vested in a state
corporate Nexus so that's the way and as
far as the Gulf War is concerned it's
just that's the way the preliminaries to
the war were presented that's the way
the war was presented and that's the way
the post-war period is presented
