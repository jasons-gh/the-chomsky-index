how did you get to know giannis uh well
through common interests really
uh we i'd never met him before this was
our first meeting
but i'd read his work he'd read my work
we actually collaborate to some extent
one of the important things that he's
done i think is
to initiate a movement in europe
it's called dm 25 which is a
an effort to try to mobilize europeans
to combat the in europe it's called
austerity the neo-liberal
programs that are severely harming
europe and undermining democracy
but to do it in a way which saves the
european union
doesn't undermine it it tries to
maintain and develop the positive
aspects of the european union and there
are many
i mean the fact that you can travel from
you know france to
poland without knowing where you are
instead of shooting each other
that's a big improvement so preserve the
good parts of the european union while
overcoming the very harmful parts like
the stranglehold of the euro
without a political union that's
destructive
