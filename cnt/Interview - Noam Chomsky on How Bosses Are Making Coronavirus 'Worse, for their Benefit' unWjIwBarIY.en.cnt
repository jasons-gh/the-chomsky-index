well professor Chomsky thank you so much
for joining me I know you're swamped
with interview requests all the time so
on behalf of Labor notes just thank you
so much for taking the time to talk to
us
glad to so I wanted to start out with
getting your thoughts generally on the
unprecedented moment we're in we're
obviously in the midst of both a global
pandemic and a global recession and
right now millions of people in the
United States have found themselves both
unemployed and uninsured while our
health care system is overloaded and
lacking anything close to the number of
hospital beds and ventilators and
personal protective equipment that we
need and I know we could spend the whole
half-hour you know on this question
alone but kind of been briefed strokes
I'm wondering if you could just outline
for us how to understand the current
moment we're in and the political
choices that led us here well first of
all we should recognize that unless we
get to the roots of this pandemic it's
going to recur probably in worse form
simply because of the manipulations of
the capital system which are trying to
create circumstances and which will be
worse for their benefit we can see that
in the stimulus bill and many other
things now second because of the in of
the global warming which is going on and
puts all of this into the shadow and
where we will recover from this severe
cost we're not going to recover from the
ongoing melting of the polar ice sheets
and if you want to understand how
contemporary capital is looking at this
take a look at Trump's budget it's true
that this is a pathological extreme of
the normal capitalist system so maybe
it's not fair to use it as an example
but that's what we're living with so on
February 10th while the epidemic was
raging going to get worse the Trump came
out with his budget proposals what were
they
first point for continued the defunding
of health related elements of the
government throughout his term he had
been cutting back on funding of anything
that doesn't benefit private power and
private wealth from corporate power so
all the health related parts of the
government had been increasingly
defunded he killed programs all sorts of
things February 10th
let's continue with it so further
defunding of the center of Disease
Control and other health related parts
of the government but there were also
compensating increases in the budget for
the fossil fuel industry more subsidies
to the fossil fuel industry so let's try
not only to kill as many people as
possible now but let's try to destroy
all of society it's basically what the
words mean of course more funding for
the military and for his famous wool but
these two things stand out very brightly
as an indication of the criminality that
is first of all endemic but is
highlighted in the sociopathic white
house brings it out and radically but of
course Trump can't be blamed for all of
this it goes back and we better think
about it after the SARS epidemic in 2003
also the Kuran virus was well understood
by scientists that other recurrences of
learn another corona virus are going to
come probably more serious well
understanding is not enough someone has
to pick up the ball and run with it now
there are two possibilities
one is the drug companies that they
follow normal capitalist logic you do
what makes profit tomorrow
you don't worry about the fact that in a
couple of years everything's going to
collapse that's not your problem
so the drug companies essentially did it
nothing there were things that could be
done I'm a new earth there was plenty of
information circulating scientists that
knew what to do there could have been
preparations somebody's got to pay for
not the drug companies well in a
rational world even a capitalist world
prior to Ronald Reagan the government
could have stepped in and done it okay
that's pretty much the way polio was
eradicated first the government
initiated and funded program when Jonas
Salk discovered the vaccine he insisted
that there be no no patent sits he says
it's gotta be public just like the Sun
that's still capitalism but it's
regimented capitalism that was ended by
a stroke by Ronald Reagan governments
the problem it's not it's not the
solution let's legalize is tax havens
let's legalize stock buybacks costing
tens of trillions of dollars to the
public in pure robbery and of course
let's keep funding the parts of the
government let's continue government is
the solution when the private sectors in
problem in trouble that's understood but
if it's just the public and needs
something government's not the answer so
going back to 2003 Darwin couldn't step
in actually it did to a slight extent
step in and it's very revealing to see
what happened Obama after the Ebola
crisis recognized that there are
problems we have to do something that
one of them did several things one of
them was to try to get a contract for
ventilators ventilators are the big
bottleneck in the system right now
that's what's forcing nurses to decide
who to kill tomorrow
there aren't enough of them but the
Obama administration didn't contract for
the development of high-quality low-cost
denim leaders as if the company was
quickly brought up by a bigger one which
sidelined the project it was competing
with their own expensive ventilators and
then turned to the government and said
they want to get out of the contracts
not profitable enough okay that's savage
capitalism not just capitalism with
neoliberal capitalism gets worse in
January in February of this year this
year when US intelligence services were
pounding at the door of the White House
saying hey this is a real crisis do
something couldn't do it but the Trump
administration was doing something named
it was exporting ventilators to China
and other countries to improve the trade
balance that went on into March now the
same manufacturers and shipping
companies that were sending about
bringing them back double profit this is
what we're living with you know I mean
can easily go on so if you look back
over the whole thing that the basis is
that a colossal market food market
simply don't work they work for selling
shoes sometimes but if anything
significant happens it's none of their
business you have two operators Friedman
and others pointed out just by greed you
do things for your own welfare wealth
nothing else that's a built-in disaster
we've had so many examples I don't have
to review it so at the beginning is a
market failure then comes the extra
hammer blow of savage capitalism
neoliberalism which we didn't suffer
from over the world for 40 years that
goes beyond ventilators hospitals in the
United States have to be run on a
business model so no spare capacity but
it doesn't work even in normal times
plenty of people including me can
testify on that in the best hospitals
but it kind of works
however if anything goes wrong you're
sunk
tough luck that maybe that's okay sir
automobile-manufacturing doesn't work
for health care our health care system
altogether is international scandal but
the business model of course that puts
it just makes it a built-in disaster so
there's that and you know some of the
other things that went on there just too
surreal to discuss like there was the it
was called the u.s. did have a u.s. aid
had a program very successful program
from detecting viruses that are in
animal populations wild populations that
are getting into closer contact with
humans because of habitat destruction
and global warming so they were
identifying thousands of potential
diseases viruses working in China as
well Trump disbanded he'd been defunding
it but he disbanded it with exquisite
timing in October but just when the
thing was breaking out now if you go on
and on this is the picture you get a
bunch of sadistic sociopath in the White
House intensifying deep market failures
that go much farther back and now
intensifying it further that the rich
are not waiting to see how to build the
next world they're working on it right
now
making sure it comes out the right way
for their subsidies to fossil fuels that
destroy EPA regulations that might save
people but our profits going on right in
front of our eyes and the question is
will there be counter forces it's not
well before we move on to the discussion
maybe of popular movements and how to
fight back in this in the discussion of
market failures and they seem to be
combining as well with the legacy of
institution
racism in the United States and we see
this playing out in the disproportionate
impact that the corona virus is having
in black communities and you in your
view how should we understand this we
understand that by going but like for
centuries that when the first slaves
were brought I don't want to have to run
through the whole history but the most
vicious system of slavery in human
history is the basis large part of the
basis for us prosperity that cotton was
the oil of the nineteen 18th and 19th
century and you had to have cheap cotton
now you don't get that by following the
rules they teach you in the Economics
Department you get it by vicious brutal
slavery
okay that's laid the basis for
manufacturing textile manufacturing
finance financing all this commerce
retail obviously that went on through
much of the 19th century well finally
slavery was formally ended for about ten
years
reconstruction period and then there was
a agreement with the south that they
could go on exactly the way they were
before so you get what one of the best
books on the topic called slavery by
another name measures taken to
essentially criminalize the black
population so the guy standing on the
black guy standing on a street corner
define him for vagrancy can't pay the
fine okay to go to a change game and
result was this is the great
manufacturing revolution in the late
19th century early 20th century largely
built on those calls wasn't called
slavery ownership of the populace of the
black population by the state it's much
better than slavery if you have slaves
you have to keep my life well if you put
them in prison so the government
has to keep my life you just get them
when you need them and there's no
question of
lack of discipline or protest or
anything like that this went on almost
until the Second World War that point
there were jobs people had to work but
then comes new forms of imposed slavery
so well into the nineteen nineteen
sixties federal housing laws required
segregation there was a lot of public
supported everything going on in the
fifties the Levittown's and so on but
for whites no blacks
you know liberal senators voted for this
hated it but voted for it because there
was no other way to get any public
housing past Southern Democrats would
kill it you know the United States had
adding miscegenation laws so severe that
the Nazis refused to accept into the 60s
you know that it takes other forms the
Supreme Court that just essentially did
what the government did back at the end
of Reconstruction pull of the southern
states you can do it me like that
eliminated the Voting Rights say that
we've just seen this a couple of days
ago in Wisconsin that credible if you
want to see democracy simply crushed
take a look at what happened two days
ago in Wisconsin the governor sensibly
wanted Democratic governor wanted to
delay the primary and extend absentee
voting I mean nothing could make perfect
or perfect sense
the Republican there was a Republican
dominated legislature that had met mine
of small minority votes but
gerrymandering gave him the largest
number of seats under a Republican
legislature said there was a session he
called a session I don't think the
Republicans even bothered to show up the
majority leader simply called the
session then closed it then considering
the governor's proposal supported by the
Supreme Court
that this is designed to ensure that
poor minority voters people can't get
the polls easily mostly Democrats they
won't vote the rich the traditional of
the ones who love this neighborhood has
a ways an open way not even concealed to
try to ensure that no matter what the
public wants the most reactionary
policies will be maintained involved in
permanently Mitch McConnell is the evil
genius behind this he's been doing it
beautifully make sure that the judiciary
is stuffed with young mostly unqualified
all for a reactionary justices that
ensures that whatever the country wants
in the future they'll be able to kill it
just like the Roberts Court majority is
able to do it now Republicans know that
they were minority party there's no way
to get votes on their actual programs
that's why they have to appeal to some
called cultural issues and gun rights
abortions long not their actual policies
which are stiff the party to fill the
pockets of the rich that's the actual
policy Trump genius at this after admire
and with one hand he says I'm your
Savior I'm working from the poor working
guy the other hand he's stabbing him in
the back it's pretty impressive you know
is it most certainly the most successful
con men and American history ever
I presume it'll explode some time but so
far it's maintaining it oh and take a
look at this
they're trying very hard to dismantle
whatever elements of democracy they are
well there are models elsewhere or
bahtman hungary is doing the same thing
one of their big friends it's kind of
interesting if you try to my dent is
pretty hard to identify a coherent
geopolitical strategy from the chaos and
what else but there is one that comes
out with considerable clarity form a
international of the most reactionary
states in the world and let that be the
basis for us power so si si in Egypt the
worst tyrants in Egypt's history of the
family dictators in Saudi Arabia in
particular MVS biggest killer Israel
which is going way to the right center
of it the former tacit relations between
Israel and the Arab states now becoming
perfectly open the Modi and in the what
he's doing is simply unspeakable he gave
four hours notice for a total lockdown
most of the population in these informal
workers there have anywhere to go
is that they can't stay home just so
long so they're trekking on the highways
maybe a thousand miles to some village
somewhere dying on the way what's this
going to impossible to imagine what this
is going to do but since they're mostly
poor many of their Muslim thinkers
I mean so he's a major part of the of
this reactionary international nice guys
like gourmand and hungrier delightful of
them salvini in Italy one of the worst
gang stood around in the Western
Hemisphere the main representative is
bohlson ro in Brazil who's vying with
Trump to see who could be the worst
colonel in the world Trump easily can
beat him because of us power but look at
the policies not much different and
that's harming not just Brazil the whole
world
I'm in tark predictions in scientific
journals or that in about 15 years the
Amazon will shift from being a net
kharbut carbon sink to win a co2 emitter
that's a disaster all the results that
extended gifts by wilson are owed to the
mining industries the agribusiness
oldest ferment so there aren't guys
trying to create the next world the
working hard they always do the
relentless constant class work never
stops and if they're allowed to win
we're toast and along that lines you've
said it's really valuable to read the
business press because they're often
very frank about what they think of the
world and what they're doing what their
plans and schemes are from our viewpoint
we're seeing a lot of rank-and-file
activity in the United States right now
strikes are taking place in many
locations workers are organizing in
response to the corona virus and being
encouraged to work in unsafe conditions
are the employers talking about that and
what are they worried about it I'm old
boy are they in fact the as you know
every January though the guys who
modestly called themselves the Masters
of the Universe gather in Davos
Switzerland to go skiing talk about how
wonderful they are and so on and so
forth this January meeting was very
interesting very interesting if they see
that the peasants are coming with the
pitchforks and they're worried about it
so there's a shift you look at the theme
of the meeting it's yeah we did bad
things in the past we know understand it
we're now opening a new year and capital
isn't kept new year in which we aren't
just concerned with you know the stock
holders but with the workers and the
population and we're such good you guys
so humanists that you can entrust your
your fate to us we'll make sure
everything's fine that was pretty
interesting to see what happened there
were two main speakers this should be
played in every classroom in the country
main speakers Trump of course gave the
keynote speech read-a-thon Bert
go to the other speech the contrast was
fantastic
the first speeches is raving buffoon you
know screaming about a greedy is and
what kind of you can't even count up the
number of the lies second speech is a 17
year old girl quietly giving a factual
accurate description of what's happening
in the world and looking these guys in
the faces and saying you're destroying
their lives and of course everyone
collected collapse nice little go back
to school the reactions a trunk was
particularly interesting they don't like
him his vulgarity and crudite is
interfering with the image they're
trying to project of dedicated humanists
but they love him they gave him rounding
stand-up standing applause and couldn't
stop cheering because they understand
something this guy no matter how vulgar
he is knows very well whose pockets to
fill than how to fill them so he can be
a buffoon will tolerate his antics as
long as it continues with the policies
that count
that's the Davos man they didn't bother
pointing out that there's we've heard
this tune before back in the 1950s it
was called the soulful corporation
corporations have become soulful now
they're just overflowing with kindness
for working people and everyone else
it's a new year we've had some time to
see how soulful liver and this will
continue so either we can be taken in by
the con and let it go or you can fight
back and create a different world it's
very good opportunities for though the
strikes that you mentioned protests all
over the world there's community
self-help groups farming neighborhoods
poor neighborhoods are people helping
each other try to do something for the
elderly who
though some of them are astounding I've
got a Brazil where it's the president is
just a monstrosity for him the whole
thing is just a cold the Brazilians are
immune to viruses were special people
you know so on and so forth
the government's doing nothing some of
the governors are you know but not the
federal the worst of this is going to be
in the as it everywhere in the slums you
know the impoverished areas the
indigenous areas the worst slums like
the favelas in Rio the idea of washing
your hands every couple hours is a
little difficult but you don't have
water or separating yourself when you're
crammed into one room but there is a
group that came and tried to impose some
reasonable standards as well as possible
them in these horrible conditions who
the crime gangs that have been
terrorizing the favelas they're so
powerful the police are free to go in
they organized to try to deal with the
health crisis it tells you something
just like the nurses on the front lawn I
mean there are human resources there and
they can come to the floor in some of
the most unexpected places
you're not not from the corporate sector
not from the wealthy not from the
soulful corporations certainly not from
governments particularly pathological
ones like this are doing better but from
popular action that's the hope
Sanders when he would get his withdrawal
speech emphasizes said in the campaign
maybe anything move that isn't now it
sucked especially his young supporters
to put some meat into that that can be
done no matter what happens Trump's
reelected it's a utter tragedy Lions
elected won't be wonderful but either
way you've got to do what's possible and
it's not
how to read so do you think most people
are gonna emerge from their homes after
the quarantine is over with their
political opinions changed or intact
we'll see it's certainly a time for
reflection about the kind of things we
were just talking about why are we in
this situation I mean what you were just
talking about is not profound it's on
the surface it's not quantum physics
think about it a little it's obvious so
maybe people do it or maybe they'll stay
mesmerized by the con man in office I
mean I get letters from people you know
poor working people saying you've got
them liberals or bringing all the
immigrants to steal their jobs and like
Trump was saving this yeah okay maybe
it's possible to break through to them
it's not easy
these guys are turned to Fox News all
day that's the echo-chamber
in fact there's a very interesting if
you're looking at it from outer space
and you're not suffering from it you
think what's going on this maniac in the
White House comes out and says whatever
he says the opposite the next day it's
repeated it was fervor in the Fox echo
chamber says the office of the next day
same thing
meanwhile he's just looking at Fox News
every morning to figure out what the
city the source of news and information
the world isn't a hit and then you get
the intelligent voice like Mike Pompeo
who says God send your trump to earth to
save Israel from Iran that's a sensible
guy I mean you know that's some ironic
joke being played let's say there is a
God maybe if so he decided that
made a bad mistake on the sixth day and
he's enough I'm gonna end it with humor
just watch these people destroy
themselves that's what it looks like the
next one okay well I last question then
is there the chance that the United
States could build up a culture of
solidarity and a labor politics coming
out of this like the UK did after World
War two that could lead to something
like the NHS like recognizing all of
these market failures recognizing the
inefficiencies and the complications
that are created when you're competing
rather than coordinating resources is it
possible for the United States to
direction that's before I lived through
the depression
this was long white beard but in the
1920s the labor movement was totally
crushed take a look at David Montgomery
labor history one of his great books is
the fall of the house of labor he's
talking about the twenties as crushed by
the liberal Wilson administration the
Red Scare and all the rest and the
thirties began to revive the CIO
organizing sit-down strikes great threat
to management sit-down strike workers
are sitting there next thing that's
going to come to their heads is we don't
need the bosses we can run this place
ourselves and then you're done it's a
very fragile system well that led to
reactions there happened to be a
sympathetic administration which is
critical very good labor historian Eric
Loomis's studied case after case of this
and he points out that moments of
positive change have almost always been
led by an active labor movement and the
only time as they succeeded with them
there was a relatively sympathetic
administration at least a taller one
well they don't happen to have that now
but actually if Biden came in the great
could could be pushed
you know if the labor movement revives
the Sanders movement which is very
significant he's achieved great
successes that could take off that could
be once again could get out of the
capitalist crises that past was done in
the 30s I mean Rosa the New Deal didn't
end the depression the ward with massive
state-directed production but
nevertheless it was much better than
today I'm old enough to remember my
family extended family were mostly
first-generation working people mostly
unemployed living under poverty that
much worse the working-class today but
it was hopeful it wasn't they weren't
deaths of despair it wasn't a certain
feeling the world's coming to an end
the mood was somehow we'll get out of
this together working together so
whether we're in the communist party
somewhere in the labor unions but like I
had a couple aunts who were unemployed
seamstresses but there were an ill group
which gave them a life the cultural life
as meetings a week in the country you
know theater activities are being
carried but you can do something we're
together that could be revised well
thank you so much for your time I really
appreciate it okay good all right take
care
