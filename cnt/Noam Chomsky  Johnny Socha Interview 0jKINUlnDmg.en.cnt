in light of what's been happening in
Egypt and the wider Middle East with the
Arab Spring there is a justification
that's wheeled out regarding the u.s. is
support of Mubarak and that he
represented stability in the region of
course as a justification it falls apart
as soon as you examine it closely
however is there ever a case when you
would countenance supporting a tyrant at
least in the short term because
destabilizing the region could
precipitate catastrophic repercussions
for the whole species and closest
analogue I think of maybe Pakistan well
you can imagine all kinds of things but
before we even let's get discussed this
you have to decode the terminology at
least the term stability has a kind of
technical meaning in foreign policy
discourse what it means is subordination
to US interest that's stability and in
fact Egypt's a very striking case so for
example if you read press commentary and
foreign policy commentary they say
exactly what you said in fact they go on
to say that the 1979 egypt-israel peace
treaty is the cornerstone of stability
in the region now that's a very
interesting interpretation because in
the real world it's the cornerstone of
instability in the region the peat and
that's precisely why the Egyptian
population is so strongly opposed to it
and why the West so strongly wants it
just take a look as soon as the peace
treaty was signed Israeli analysts
strategic analyst right away began to
write about the meaning of it which is
transparent it removes Egypt from the
conflict Egypt is the only military
force in the Arab world so it eliminates
the sole deterrent and therefore it
frees Israel to carry out actions over
the very violent action without concern
very shortly they invaded Lebanon no
pretext at all incredible pretext killed
about 20,000 people destroyed much of
southern Lebanon
tried to fail to install their own
government and expanded their their
illegal occupation in the occupied
territory settlements and so on well
that's you know by the standards of some
objective observer that's instability
but by the standards of the power
systems that stability so therefore it's
the cornerstone of stability in the
region Mubarak kept instability this
usage is all over the place this affects
a Durant the other huge foreign policy
issue the Iranian threat asposed to be
the worst problem in the world if you
look at foreign policy literature and
media you know government's terrible
Iranian threat right under the Iranian
government is certainly a threat to its
own population but they're hardly unique
in that respect but so what exactly is
the Iranian threat kind of interesting
that it all the discussion about it that
question is almost never raised however
there is an answer to it an
authoritative answer comes from the
Pentagon and US intelligence every year
they present to Congress and analysis of
the global security situation the most
recent one of course discussed the
Iranian threat which they think is very
severe but it's interesting to see what
they said they said it's not a military
threat Iran has very low military
expenses you can buy standards of the
region that has little capacity to
deploy force its military strategy is
designed to try to hold off and invasion
long enough for diplomacy to set in they
of course talked about nuclear
capability they said if Iran is
developing nuclear weapons capability it
would be part of their deterrence
strategy so that's
military threat nevertheless there are
huge threat why their destabilizing the
region how are they doing it by trying
to increase their improve their
relations with neighboring countries so
they're trying to improve commercial
cultural political other interactions
with Iraq and Afghanistan and that's
destabilizing now when we when the US
and Britain invade the country's occupy
them half destroy them kill hundreds
thousands of people that's stabilizing
until you understand the terminology you
can even discuss these questions in fact
the whole terminology of political
discourses sort of reshaped so it's to
make it almost impossible to talk
sensibly so to go back to your question
suppose that we had is let's take say
Pakistan the Pakistan is very dangerous
country undoubtedly the main dangers
number has internal problems huge
internal problems it's a kind of
patchwork separate federated unit the
different languages different cultures
and so on but there are two main
problems for international concern one
is it's actually the most rapidly
growing nuclear power thanks Pakistan so
a huge nuclear power growing very fast
it's part of their competition with
India I secondly it has it has a
substantial not overwhelming but a
substantial radical Islamist streak that
we saw that recently when the governor
punjab was assassinated there was
enormous he was assassinated because of
his opposition of the blasphemy law and
though it was used to persecuted young
woman who was charged so he was
fascinated there was overwhelming
support for the assassin e assassins and
a lot of that support was coming from
the black student lawyers who were being
held
they led the reform movement that
overthrew Musharraf that's where the
support for the assassin was coming from
well these it's not a majority they
don't get a majority in any election but
it's there these are part of Reagan's
gift to the world the Reagan
administration pretended they didn't
know that Iran was developed Pakistan's
developing nuclear weapons of course
they did and they supported the worst
dictator in the history of Pakistan zo
huh who was radically Islam izing the
country with the support of Saudi Arabia
the major US UK ally in the region so
this company fecht at both the US and
Britain have tended to support radical
Islam for a long period this quite a
good book that just came out on this way
a British diplomatic historian mark
curtis it's also true of you never not
written but it's also true of the United
States and Pakistan's case in point so
yes there's a radical Islamist sector
there's a big nuclear power a lot of
internal problems what do we do about
this well one thing we do about it is
try to exacerbate so if you take a look
at the problems that Pakistan is facing
it has one stable institution the
military is highly stable highly
professional dedicated to the protection
of Pakistani sovereignty and the US is
pushing it to the wall overwhelmingly
Pakistanis support the right of the
Taliban to defend their Afghan Taliban
of Pakistani thought on the right of the
Afghan Taliban to defend their country
against aggression they don't like the
egg the Taliban they didn't like the
Mujahideen during the Russian invasion
but they do support their right to
defend the country against aggression
the United States is demanding that they
take part in that fight well that was
furthermore the drone attacks which just
there is terror weapons I mean if they
were drawn a tax year there could be 15
minutes we wouldn't know about it that's
what drone attacks are their terror
weapons and the Pakistani bitterly
resent them the military too and not
just because the kind of weapon they are
but just because they're bombing
Pakistan there are pressure and the
Pakistani army to participate in the US
war to go in the tribal areas to prevent
basis from which the US troops in
Afghanistan an occupying army can be
attacked I mean elect if the Russians
had tried anything like this during the
Russian invasion of Afghanistan but we'd
have had a nuclear war you know nobody
would have tolerated but the Pakistani
army is infuriated that's dangerous if
they are forced into a military
confrontation they'll fight the reading
military specialists on Afghanistan am
at Pakistan points this out and that
could even lead to the leakage of
fissile materials into Joey hands and
this has just happened right before our
eyes and is not being discussed that
take the bin Laden assassination that
was obviously an attack on Pakistani
sovereign TV you know 79 commandos in to
assassinate them but more than that they
were under orders to fight their way out
of the head to if they the American
American commanders the orders were for
your way out fight your way out means
you're going to get air support and all
sorts of things you'd be war with
Pakistani army and they'll fight and
then comes possible cycle maybe nuclear
weapons going to the hands of jihadis
well the Obama administration and
Britain we're willing to chance that is
that stabilized it's quite the opposite
in fact one of the major experts
pakistani military on it though given
his military store in in england one of
the main experts in pakistan he wrote
recently has a book that just came out
which talks about this in detail but in
an article ii had recently he said that
american and british soldiers are dying
in Afghanistan to make the world more
dangerous for the United States Britain
and what we call that stabilization the
budget cuts in the US and United States
a merry old England Cameron recent began
as soon as a massive cuts to the welfare
state to negate the British budget
deficit as many other countries have he
talks about tough times ahead and yet as
he's someone born into absolute
privilege in comfort many people me
included find such comments critical I
mean what does he know about tough times
and yet there's an argument which states
it isn't important because I guess he
understands the concept of financial
hardship intellectually and therefore
you may be doesn't need to understand it
empathetically what's your position does
a politician need to have endured a
degree of poverty to make equitable
far-reaching decisions regarding it my
Matador I'm takes a Franklin Delano
Roosevelt you came from wealth and
privilege big estates in New York but he
was sympathetic to carrying out highly
progressive policies that were great
benefit to the population maybe it helps
to know something about poverty but it's
certainly not critical you know in fact
let's go back to the founder you know
the hero of the modern conservatives who
actually hate his principles but they
put him up as a hero Adam Smith yeah I'm
in his moral philosophy which was the
foundation of the economic theory was
based on the assumption that core human
emotion sympathy acting David Hume the
other major founder of classical
liberalism same thing
and that is indeed a core team in
emotion it takes real effort to drive
that our people's head in fact it's kind
of striking to see it it takes a the
United States and no better the early
industrial revolution in the United
States for around here eastern
Massachusetts the latter part of the
eighth nineteen century at that time
that was the period of the freest price
in american history lots of newspapers
popularly run lots of engagement lots of
leadership many of the much of the press
was coming out of the labor movement
workers and factors and so on what they
called factory girls young women from
farms moving the textile factories in
irish artisans from Boston and so went
the ring the papers they bitterly
condemned the new industrial system
which was destroying their culture their
lives and slaving them and so on but one
of their main complaints was against
what they called the new spirit of the
age gain wealth for getting all bit self
and that's totally inconsistent with
they're just normal feelings that's
taken 150 years to try to convince
people that they should be committed to
the new spirit of the age and it's still
going on massively that's why you have
tax on nuts of security on engines and
so on those are all based on the attacks
are based on the new spirit of the age
after hundred fifty years ordinary
people don't feel that way now they
think we ought to have responsibility
for a disabled way to across town of
those men of money d but from the point
of view of those who Adam Smith again
called the Masters of mankind that they
follow their black we call their vile
Maxim all for ourselves nothing for
anyone else that's the new spirit of the
age and from their point of view why
should I care about the disabled little
gross down and why should I care of the
kid across the street as a school I
don't
kids in school why shape a practice with
that you know that's the new spirit of
the age and I don't think that has much
to do with whether he grew up in
wellford poverty as to do whether you
are willing to allow your basic human
consciousness and understanding to
prevail in your ordinary life Richard
were thoughts on the same thing but the
banks that once again reverting to their
previous position of huge bonus isn't
short two ingredients of the austerity
measures with large numbers of workers
losing their jobs are having pain
condition severely affected and yet I'm
just shocked by how brazen the corporate
world supposed to be with Goldman Sachs
15 billion in bonuses just one example
they appear to have absolutely no
concern over the growing hatred and
anger that exists within the population
towards them now a produce state that
their raison d'etre is to create profit
for their shareholders and companies in
the short term so problems that only may
reach there's anything a generations
time are irrelevant to the exigencies of
now however this anger that I mentioned
if mobilized into action could severely
damage them in the short term and it's
very hard to predict don't they care are
they counting on the general public
remaining atomized and passage that's
what they're gaining on foreign policy
works the same way that I was in England
for a week couple months ago every day
the front page story about some scandal
at Barclays Bank paying executive huge
bonuses well people are suffering that's
the way the systems designed and they're
yes counting on the passivity of the
public actually there's a doctrine that
was expressed pretty clearly with regard
to the Arab Spring it was expressed by a
man a marlin and washer who's the chief
middle east analyst for the Carnegie
Endowment for murder day and I official
and I forget his exact words but we said
is as long as the population is quiet
you can do anything you want
and that's correct domestically to Egypt
is a very striking case this are the
sportsman of arc is not coming out of
nowhere back in the late 1950s the
President Eisenhower it was concerned
about what he called a campaign of
hatred against us in the Arab world and
not among not in the government's there
ok but among the people and at the same
year the National Security Council and
it's the main planning body it came out
with a study of this and they explained
it they said there's a campaign of
hatred is based on a perception in the
Arab world that the United States
supports harsh brutal dictatorships and
we block development and democracy now
we do this because we want to ensure
control over their resources and went on
to say that the perception is more or
less accurate and furthermore that's
what we should be doing we'll count on
the dictatorships to control the
population and count on the washer
doctrine and that's fine that's why
Obama supported mubarak to the bitter
end count on the dictatorship control
the population and it's going it
continues to go on and it goes on
domestically as long as the population
is maybe they're angry maybe they're
frustrated maybe they hate institution
long as they don't do anything about it
the Masters of mankind all pursue their
vile Maxim moving on to Iraq I was
discussing my position recently
regarding the Iraq war they might be in
Blair and ghosts should be at The Hague
in front of the ICC not that I have
expected to happen I was asked whether I
wanted every leader of every country
there was a member of the Coalition of
the Willing to be placed on trial what
about countries that we remember the
coalition but didn't fight like New
Zealand or countries that didn't have an
army such as Micronesia and Palau what
will ward your answer be well basically
the Nuremberg principle then put
everybody on trial
in fact lower little people were not in
tried at Nuremberg the people who were
tried were the leaders of the decision
makers the people who were sitting in
the room while the decision was made to
invade Poland people like the front
Ribbentrop foreign minister was hanged
incidentally that's several charges but
the crime against peace was he was there
when the decision was made to invade
Poland he supported a preemptive war
against Norway and the Nazis knew that
the British were planning to invade from
Norway they invaded first pre-emptive
work well you know a pal colin powell's
more guilty than he would but but but
they didn't you know that the people who
threw bodies into the crematoria they
weren't directed November some were
charged they also there but thee and
certainly not collaborators here in
there and the same principle is proved
here I'm Blair and bush and their close
associate made a decision to invade
another country to carry out the supreme
international crime of Nuremberg which
remember has defined at Nuremberg and
found its way into international law
that supreme international crime the
question of the tribunal its aggression
but it's more than that they said it's
different from other war crimes because
it encompasses all of the evil that
follows so in the case of Iraq it
encompasses the destruction of the
national heritage the sectarian warfare
which toured the country to shreds is
now spread over the region these are
huge consequences millions of displaced
people and maybe hundreds of thousands
or more kill you know all of those are
consequences that's really serious and
the answer it should be didn't know if
law meant anything they would be
effective again
nuremberg principles are interesting the
chief counsel for the prosecution
justice jackson us justice that he made
a pretty impassioned appeal to variable
saying it were handing these defendants
of poisoned chalice and if we ever sit
from it we have to be subject subjected
to the same principles or else all
trials of forest it's not his exact
words there's nothing like that so we
have a choice either the trial was a
farce and we political we murdered the
knots of defendants extricated
traditionally or else you're right
should apply to us stay with Blair I
heard a recent interview with john de
querer who stated that after scene
blares performance of the children
cotton Cairo and Iraq he wouldn't want
to interview or ask him anything I take
it he meant that Blair had covered all
the angles sealed off the Monell if that
he was now impenetrable if you had a
chance would you ask Blair a question no
I wouldn't ask durables a question not
that he's saying that it's the same
principle I mean there are businesses to
protect themselves to produce answers
which they'll make any sense in fact i'd
like to point talking to the journalists
and intellectual support of the war I
mean you can always make an excuse for
anything you know but Hoover were
worried when information even a good
room moving on to Palestine I ask you a
question in a past email regarding the
ongoing Israeli atrocities across these
talks of Palestinians and the fact that
Israel always resort to that tiresome
line of defense regarding an ass and
aims being the destruction of Israel I
wondered why her masculine just shout a
rejection of violence and their
willingness to go along with whatever
the Palestinian people want from the
rooftops you stated that you agree the
day an ass should shout it from the
rooftops though it wouldn't be listened
to I'm not sure about this so wouldn't
it be the case that if Hamas were
absolutely unequivocally about their
commitment to nonviolent resistance the
Israeli and the compliant elements of
the world's media would not
able to offer any justification for
their violent actions Hamas could in
effect call Israeli I love I think we
have zero of it and there's no
particular reason why they should
humiliate themselves I mean if you want
to play the game of commitment to
district commitment with molasses
already four years joins come out in
favor of the international consensus on
the two states settlement they say they
don't want to recognize Israel I mean
this is a democratic party you recognize
Pakistan at political parties don't
recognize countries if they're part of a
government that recognizes Israel okay
that's all the matters that may just
save you recognize these rages and why
should they need concrete of this I
don't think they should should the
Democratic Party recognizes a England I
mean doesn't make any sense why this is
simply a means of trying to humiliate
them and prevent diplomacy these are
ridiculous demands for furthermore if we
want to pursue this line of reasoning
let's take the ruling party in Israel
Likud Party oh there they have a program
I'm their official program program on
which they won the election is that
there cannot be any Palestinian
self-determination anywhere in the Land
of Israel well what's the Land of Israel
maybe they meant the Jordan to the city
but if you go back to the Likud charter
which is never withdrawn that includes
Jordan so they're committed to the
destruction of wolf Palestinian and
further it's not just a verbal
commitment they're carrying it out and
they have a goal to say Hamas is
committed to our destruction I mean you
can't even laugh
and I you know what i don't like about
from us but to ask them to accept these
terms is just an effort at sheer
humiliation why should they accept it
you could say the same about other
countries I suppose that the United
States insisted that Mexico recognize
the right of the United States to exist
sitting on half of Mexico comfort in a
war why should they they'll never do
that they recognize the United States
but not its right to exist sitting on
half of Mexico I suppose that Iran was
powerful enough that it could demand
that we recognize Iran as an Islamic
state should we do it no why should we
why should anyone recognize Israel as a
Jewish state I mean there's no reason to
set up these standards these are just
the various techniques that have been
designed to try to give a in diplomacy
you mentioned in a recent interview that
Reagan's deification is in marked
contrast to public opinion Joey's during
his lifetime and diametrically opposed
to his actual achievements whilst in
office you stated that having goals to
worship is the easiest way to distract
people why Reagan loan Kennedy why not
Carter or LBJ is it because they must
easily fit round America well Kennedy is
deified mostly among kind of liberal
sort of the educated sector and he was
he knew what he was doing he realized
that if he sort of buttered up the
intellectuals he'd get a good press and
if you look at the whole creation of the
Camelot image that just would happen I
mean it was right here in Boston it was
dramatic there was a shuttle plane that
went from eastern shuttle went from
Boston to Washington every day and
back in the morning the Harvard and MIT
professors would get on the shuttle to
go down to Washington you have lunch
with Jackie you talk to the great man
come back in the evening tell us
marvelous catalytic I'm an exaggerated a
little bit that guy but that was the
that that's kind of what was going on
and it ended up with Kennedy having a
very good picture the administration of
the crimes and just suppressed that was
needed in a very dangerous man I could
go through it but his administration
brought us pretty close to nuclear war
needlessly a lot parking lot of other
things but it may be scholars know about
it but it's not the image i where we're
raking well you know Reagan it was not
particularly popular there are polls in
the United States you can check on Nick
to have been study in fact when he left
the office say around nineteen ninety he
was polls show that he was actually the
most unpopular living president apart
from Nixon he was below quarter and so
on but then a huge campaign developed
called the Reagan legacy to try to turn
him into a kind of Kimmel some figure so
if you read publications from say the
Hoover Institute at Stanford University
he's described as colossal figure hovers
over us like a Friendly Ghost that's the
kind of thing you might get out of North
Korea but night here you get it out of
the Hoover Institute at Stanford and it
has been presented as the model of the
free enterprise limited government and
so on actually he tripled the deficit he
the government grew under his regime he
was the most protectionists in post-war
American history doubled the import
restrictions try to salvage
incompetent American management which
couldn't compete with the Japanese in
the international sphere system of mass
murder I mean in Central America he had
a war on terror it killed a couple
hundred thousand people it's being
suppressed like in this morning's
newspaper if you read the New York Times
you notice a little item about the
arrest of 20 Salvadoran soldiers for the
murder of six Jesuit intellectuals in
1989 it happened to be slightly after
Reagan left but those are the policies
of the Reagan administration was
initiating the killer's didn't say it in
the paper but the killer's had just they
came from a battalion the applicable
battalion which had already killed tens
of thousands of people with one was
brutal vicious battalions armed and
trained by the Reagan administration
they had just come from upgrading their
training at the John F Kennedy special
warfare school and Fort Bragg North
Carolina ties it together nicely came
back to El Salvador given orders by the
High Command which was in close contact
with the u.s. to break into the
University and assassinate the Jesuit
intellectuals now this is a week after
the fall of the Berlin Wall that not
only destroyed essentially wiped out
liberation theology which was a great
fear for the u.s. back from the night
early 1960s might began they were
adopting the preferential option for the
poor you know they were trying to go
back to the Gospels aus what a major war
against the church this was the latin
play religious martyrs this was the last
pretty much less
lots of enormous historic importance
it's out of history and that's just a
piece of Reagan's legacy and Reagan was
one of the strongest supporters with
apartheid the he input in order to
increase support for the apartheid
regime Reagan not on had at the
inviolate congressional sanctions which
he did and it was a justification war on
terror 1988 the White House condemned
the African National Congress says the
words were one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world in fact
Mandela himself just got off the
terrorist list about two years ago he
can now come to the United States
without a special visa so in order to
fight the war on terror that the support
apartheid and not only did that support
crimes inside South Africa but it also
supported South African rampaging in the
neighboring countries which according to
a later UN analysis led to limit in a
half death in the Middle East strongly
supported the Reagan supported the
israeli invasion of lebanon and of
course participated in it vetoed
Security Council resolutions and so on
the usual and if I continued to support
it until it became was becoming harmful
to American interests by mid-august so
he ordered big and to call it off or he
was on what you the 1982 August 82 and
of course Israel obeyed they have to so
he you know gave him to go ahead called
it off when it was done another 20,000
people his record it goes on and on this
guy's a serious mass murderer and
certainly you know to call him a image
of free trade and acted a deficit the up
until reagan the united states had been
a creditor country world-leading
creditor the reagan very quickly turned
into the world's leading debtor that's
fiscal responsibility
and also triple the national debt but
you know you can't cut the imagery do
anything you like that's what public
relations with about moving on to the
media I'm completely in accord with your
position regarding the subjugating force
of the mass media especially the role
the tabloid media plays whereby uses as
a trivia to distract and remember supine
the elements the population you should
feel most aggrieved however I've been
told in the past that I'm trying to
impose my own set of values the gender
upon people and if they bad papers that
headline the stories about the
licentiousness of celebrities or the
apotheosis of sports out that's because
they're enacting their rights as free
individuals to choose that paper and
that story if they want to know about
human rights abuses in Iraq goodbye in
the UK anyway the independent of the
Guardian in addition newspapers of
businesses in a cut pro in diminishing
industry why shouldn't they maximize
their profits by giving people stories
they want to read about why should they
feel obligated to depress people stories
at war on destruction how would you
respond to that first what's interesting
to look at the history of the British
tabloid media you go back not very far
to the 1960s they were left liberal
newspapers handled the mirror and the
Herald harem what Harold was a Social
Democratic newspaper actually the most
popular paper England did a lot of
popular support that this disappeared I
think in the early 60s but it just
couldn't meet the it couldn't compete
with capital concentration and
advertiser reliance so it didn't matter
how much public supported that James
turns with a lot about this but even the
tablet they were left newspapers it was
same here New York Post which is now
when it takes any more about counted
when I was growing up it was a kind of
left liberal a new deal paper you know
human beings haven't changed their
genetic character they're just given
different choices as I mentioned in the
period of the really freak breath late
19th century the labor press was pretty
quite impressed I think I've frankly
myself and discussing them mediate not
talked about this much I how much more
interesting the elite media and they're
a very interesting question comes up so
it takes a the New York Times and
counterparts elsewhere which sort of
sets the agenda with regard to serious
issues how do they do it what's their
commitment actually they have a
commitment so if you're sayin Allah
stand here and let's say what is
discussed is determined by the Guardian
Council the ruling clerics decided what
you discuss in the United States free
country not done that way but they're
still what solvent it's what's discussed
in within within the Beltway what's
discussed between Democrats and
Republicans and the corporate sector
that's what you disguise if it's
something else that and that's what's
called objective unbiased and anything
else is sentimental wrestling and it's
very interesting the way it turns out so
take right this minute take a look at
new york times with on the web you'll
see that they're featuring one of the
things that the sovereigns as it
important is israel palestine obviously
that's important so they feature a
debate about it on the debate is called
Barack vs. BB so the two poles of the
debate are Obama and Netanyahu not from
the point of view of the Arab world if
they're both at the same you know I mean
they're both traditional us-israeli
rejectionists and in front point of view
of history that's correct and for 35
years the US and Israel bin Laden
political settlement Moroccan BB
represent
kind of like a debate between two
Iranian clerics over some obscure point
of theology I mean maybe from their
point of view that's a debate but not
from the point of view of the world or
even the interests of Americans that
they may think so but that's because
it's olefin and very few people know
that both of them are have been leaked
today and their predecessors have been
leading the rejections camp for 35 years
well okay that's a kind of objectivity
if you like but highly skewed so that
and it's not very surprising I mean
after all be the reason the dirt Daily
Herald went under is because it couldn't
compete with concentration of capital
and advertiser reliance and that tells
you a lot about what the media are
actually media cancer I know I'm not so
convinced that print media can survive
the day I just can't I was in Mexico
over the weekend I go there fairly
frequently they're a very good newspaper
there and it's the best one in the
hemisphere or not it it's a very high
quality i thought the editors know the
journals really good people it's the
second largest newspaper in the country
has virtually no commercial advertising
because business hates it but it relies
on the reader sport maybe they have some
other kind support but that's a very
high level newspaper high quality
newspaper well actually this for example
they saw the door and recording at times
i read about it a couple days ago there
you know and very often they find out
things have never even appear here so
i'm skeptical about the economic issues
thank you so much now
you're a thank you
