which were a very rich store of
information dan ellsberg who released
them did keep one volume he did not it
was one volume he didn't give to the
press people who I was one of the people
who distributed the papers a couple of
the friends of his so we had the volume
I was able to read it but we didn't give
it to the press I wasn't convinced that
that was necessary but made some sense
the volume was about negotiations and
there were ongoing negotiations so he
took the negotiation seriously and
frankly it didn't then it would have
there's an argument for not releasing it
might disrupt the negotiations but an
argument hasn't given and it's very rare
that that burden can be met it's kind of
like the burden that has to be met by
any authoritarian or hierarchic
institution as to justify itself it's
not self-justifying you take a look at
the WikiLeaks I think there's I can't I
can't think of anything there that there
would be any argument to have suppressed
and there's a lot of interesting
material very interesting maybe the most
interesting material that leads to me is
what it tells us what the WikiLeaks tell
us not about government's but about our
own intellectual communities the
communities that we live in the educated
sectors you know the cultural melee if
you like the press and so on and what
what it revealed is extremely
interesting that's even more interesting
that it hasn't been noticed pretty
transparent if you I suppose the Dutch
press was much like the English language
press in the English language press what
it got the most attention you know big
headlines and everything was that the
Arabs support us on Iran crucial issue
and a lot of excitement you know the
shows we're doing the right thing even
the Arab supporters strongly support us
well take a look at what came out in
WikiLeaks
that what came out with statements by
Arab dictators they allegedly support us
what about the Arab population actually
there's a lot known about our public
opinion it's not recorded at least in
English maybe it was reported here I
doubt it but a lot is known about our
public opinion there recent polls taken
by the most prestigious us polling
organizations released by major
institutions workings Institute in
Washington others and what they what
they say is quite interesting they said
for example in Egypt ninety percent of
the public think their worst enemy is
the United States the figures are pretty
similar for the whole region United
States and Israel which are regarded
correctly is about the same thing so you
know on the order of eighty ninety
percent throughout the region say that's
the main threat what about Iran a ten
percent think he ran as a threat in fact
support for Iran and a rather a hatred
for Western policy is so extreme that a
large majority think that the region be
better off if Iran had nuclear weapons
in Egypt eighty percent you know well
you know the Arab support us yeah the
Arab dictators what matters to the
editorial writers and the commentators
and the public intellectuals and so on
is that the dictator support us if the
population strongly opposes us who cares
as long as they're quiet as long as you
keep them under control who cares now
that that reveals an attitude towards
democracy which is extremely significant
it indicates pretty strikingly the
extent to which democracy is absolutely
hated by educated sectors sectors that
have any connection to power or
privilege and it's very relevant to
incidentally this is not the first time
this has been true this has been true
for decades and there's plenty of
evidence about it but again it's not
it's not what you're likely to be caught
in school or reading the newspapers and
so on but you can find it out and you've
learned something about yourselves
that's really important knowing yourself
is quite important that's why that bad
guy drank the hemlock what is the role
of intellectual critique in a society
like Holland where critique and not
positive policy making is the standard
we're what is the role of intellectual
critique interested in that puzzle
there's the continuation Isaac should
intellectuals take on a more positive
role in making meet plans that can be
implemented in practice instead of a
critical approach well taking the last
part I don't see where there's a
distinction taking a critical purchased
in order to criticize you know makes it
maybe makes you feel good but no point
that taking a critical approach because
you want to see policy changes you know
that makes good sense so go back to say
the prophets when they were giving a
critical analysis of the deeds of the
you know evil kings they were calling
for a change in policies and attitudes
and that's what critical people ought to
be doing critical intellectuals if you
like is the was the first one is the
role you have an intellectual critique
in a society where critique is nothing
yeah change the society that's work yeah
thanks you said don't speak truth to
power is they'll know it already how do
you explain they don't act on this truth
don't speak truth to power oh they do
I mean how the powerful oh sorry what
you argue for is reasonable very
reasonable to any human being how come
people in power don't act on it are they
all corrupted by power immoral perhaps a
moral they may be what whatever they are
that's you know for their families and
psychiatrists to worry about but there
but there are institutions when you're
an institution and yet play a role in
that institution there are some limits
on what you can do so let's take
something let's take a couple of I think
concrete examples are good to think
about instead of abstract discussion
we're in the middle of a huge fiscal
crisis economic crisis now where did
that come from well to a large extent it
came from a basic principle of market
systems which is an unavoidable property
of market systems namely if your say
suppose you sell a car to somebody if
you're paying attention you carry out
that transaction so that you make out
reasonably well and the other person
does too but there's some things you
don't consider lucky good you don't
consider the effect on her say that's
called an externality if you've studied
economic theory the effect of a
transaction on others is something you
don't consider in market systems right
there is an effect like if you buy a car
there's more pollution there's more
congestion a lot of things that affect
other people but those are externalities
you don't care about them well in
financial systems there's a big
externality which is well understood
it's called systemic risk systemic risk
is the risk that the whole system will
crash okay so if say Goldman Sachs makes
a transaction which they will
if they're doing their job they'll cover
the risk to themselves right they'll
take that into account they won't take
into account the risk of the whole
system will crash that's a externality
well you know that externality happens
to have big effects like crashing the
system repeatedly ever since rig during
the 50s and 60s there weren't any
financial crashes because there were
regulations in place in the 70s on the
80's 90's the regulatory apparatus has
been dismantled as a result systemic
risk is always ever-present and you have
repeated financial crises well these
financial crisis these are pretty bad
crises the financial crisis leads to a
general economic crisis so people don't
have jobs in the United States now
probably twenty percent of the
population qualifies for food stamps
because they can't get food you know it
is pretty serious but for the rich and
the powerful it doesn't matter because
they have they don't really just comes
back to talking truth to power they may
preach market systems but they don't
believe in what they believe in is a
powerful nanny state that works for them
not for anyone else but it works for
them so if the system crashes a Goldman
Sachs and JP Morgan Chase Barkley banks
and the rest of them if they crash the
system as they just did they have a
solution run to the nanny state you know
holding your copy of Hayek and so on and
tell them to bail you out meaning the
taxpayer to bail you out which is what
happens that's a government insurance
policy it's called too big to fail means
if you crash the system you just come
and say look I'm too big to fail bail me
out and the taxpayer dutifully bails
them out right now they're richer than
ever
right following what's happening the
United States their huge protests all
over the country in Wisconsin and
elsewhere and people are in real trouble
at the same moment and they're cutting
back collective bargaining pensions and
when I cut Social Security everything's
got to be cut luckier meanwhile the very
same moment the people who caused the
crisis are giving themselves fabulous
bonuses Goldman Sachs just quietly and
they're the worst of them announced the
17 and a half billion dollars in bonuses
for management 12 and half million just
for the CEO triple is hollering so on
that's happening right at the moment
when this real suffering around the
country the same I just happened to be
in England this front page story every
day about you know the bankers gave
themselves a massive bonus probably the
same is happening here but but so that's
an externality you don't pay attention
to it now let's go back to the CEO of
Goldman Sachs is he a bad person no he's
I don't know who I don't care one way or
another was a good person or a bad
person like I say that's a problem for
his family but his the role that he
plays it forces this decision decision
literally if he decides I'm not going to
make that decision he's out and somebody
else is in who will make it because
that's a property of the semi market
system that he's participating me now in
that case there's somebody around to
bail you out when everything crashes but
there's another case quite a critical
one in fact a lethal one where
externalities are ignored and
necessarily ignored and it'll probably
destroy the species that's the
environmental crisis the the business
world does not want to do anything to
deal with the environmental crisis for
good reasons it harms their short-term
profit
now suppose you're the CEO you know
chairman of some major core
