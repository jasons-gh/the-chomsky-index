what does the phrase national interest
mean I mean the phrase national interest
is used standardly in the academic world
no international relations theory claims
that states pursue the national interest
that's the leading principle of all
discussion what is it I mean does the
CEO of General Electric have the same
interest as the janitor cleanses floors
they have totally different interests
now there's all kinds of interests and
what's called the national interest
turns out to be the interest of dominant
domestic forces in u.s. society so the
national interest means the interests of
the very rich major corporations the
ones who set government policy and so on
that's the national interest and not the
population the population is basically
irrelevant the population will often
strongly opposes government policy and
they're simply disregarded not just on
this case many others say take Cuba for
50 years the United States has been
waging a war against Cuba major
terrorist war not trivial it's not these
jokes about
Castro's beard that the press talks
about major terrorist attacks thousands
of people killed and so on an embargo
crushing embargo that the whole world
opposes how does the US population feel
about it well there have been polls
since the 1970s large majority of the
population thinks we should normalize
relations with Cuba does anybody pay
attention to them doesn't make any
difference in fact the gap between a
public opinion and policy is enormous on
issue after issue and it takes a
domestic issues for again about 40 years
their regular polls asking people what
they think about the tax system
overwhelmingly people say there should
be much higher taxes on the wealthy what
happens
taxes on the wealthy go down and it's
the same on issue after issue we do not
live in a society in which the public
determines policy the public's around
you know but basically disregarded
unless they force themselves to into the
system by serious activism and I think
that's true of national interest so
let's take national interest in its real
sense the interest of those who are in a
position of power in American society to
be able to make decisions what's their
interest well lots of interests some are
straight strategic now you go back to
1948 the Joint Chiefs of Staff were very
impressed with Israel's military
performance during the 48 War and
recognized as they put it that Israel
could become a valuable base for
American power I said it's the major
military force in the region outside of
Turkey and it would be a perfect ally
and base for u.s. power the oil
dictatorships Saudi Arabia primarily
they made it very clear that they didn't
mind there was not going to be any
threat to US oil interests in fact they
had their own Saudi Arabian Saudi
Arabia's a family basically you know the
royal family they made it quite clear
that that even though they had to
publicly condemn Israel they didn't
really mean it they actually thought it
was fine if Israel was there Israel
their concern remember at the time was
Britain the main concern of the in the
Arab world was Britain it and Jordan
which was a was Transjordan at the time
which was a British colony and the
Hashemite rule and the Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia just driven the Hashemites
out of the you know the holy territories
Mecca Medina they thought they might be
coming back now they didn't want that
they wanted a deterrent to Jordan
Transjordan especially because the
British were trying to set up a
Hashemite system
which would govern both Transjordan and
Iraq which is regarded as a threat
serious threat by Saudi Arabia and what
are now the Emirates and Israel was a
kind of a deterrence so they didn't
really mind and in fact that continues
Saudi Arabia and Israel have fairly
common policies right now furthermore in
1967 crucial year that's when US the
us-israel relationship was actually
established in its current form before
that it was kind of friendly but nothing
unique became unique after 67 something
happened in 67 Israel provided a great
gift to Saudi Arabia and the United
States there was a conflict has been
long-standing conflict between radical
Islam and secular nationalism and the
United States like British Britain
before it has pretty consistently
supported radical Islam still continues
to the center of radical Islam is Saudi
Arabia the most extremist radical
Islamist state in the world and also a
missionary state they try to expand
their wildest Salafi doctrines all over
the place and they're the strongest ally
the United States and Britain had
similar policies in 1967 there was a war
going on between Saudi Arabia and Egypt
Egypt was the center of secular
nationalism Israel invaded Egypt then
pretty much destroyed its its basis its
base in the Arab world also Syria
serious blow against secular nationalism
great victory for radical Islam big
victory for the United States which
regarded Nasser's Egypt as the main
threat that's when the special
relationship was established and it
continued like that first time I go on
it remains a major strategic base fact
they want to know how serious it is that
one of the most interesting of the wiki
leaks was a list
of the regions of the world that the
United agon regards as super important
have to be protected you know no matter
what that one of them is right outside
Haifa Rafael military industries it's a
high-tech military industry right
outside Haifa one of the places where
most of the drone technology was
developed it's so closely linked to US
industry into the Pentagon that they
actually shifted their management
headquarters to Washington where the
money is
but it's it's just essentially part of
US military industry and that's just the
beginning it's a major player the millet
for US military industry Israel's just a
bonanza when the u.s. cell gives you
know high-class jets to Israel of course
Lockheed Martin makes a lot of money but
it's more than that when Israel when
they when the United States gives Israel
high-tech military equipment that's a
teaser because they call it in the
retail business
Saudi Arabia comes along says hey we
want some of that stuff too and we want
a lot more
so Lockheed Martin is happy to sell
sixty billion dollars worth of Lockheed
Martin and others of second-rate
equipment to Saudi Arabia so that they
can don't be happy that they have a lot
of this stuff to that they don't know
how to use so it's a it's terrific
bonanza for military industry also
Israel provides special services it can
try out advanced military equipment
against live targets that's what they're
doing all the time you can't usually do
that but every was doing it constantly
that when they attack as a operation of
the West Bank when they invade Lebanon
they've done five times they are testing
advanced US equipment figuring out what
works and they develop their own
equipment of course they're a major
supplier of advanced military equipment
including
equipment for suppression they trained
us police forces for example plenty of
work in the third world fact that when
Reagan was blocked from direct support
from South Africa Israel was used as a
conduit and same in Central America so
there's plenty of services like that but
there's a lot more one reason is one
factor that tends to be underestimated I
think is Christian Zionism Christian
Zionism goes back way before Jewish
Zionism it way into the 19th century and
it's a very significant a leap
phenomenon in the United States they say
people like Woodrow Wilson Harry Truman
so on the read the Bible every day you
know and are believers in the biblical
prophecies while the Bible says you know
God promised the land to Israel so got
to give it to Israel and the Roosevelt
administration one of the leading
figures Harold Ickes described the
return of the Jews to Palestine as the
greatest event in history by now it's
expanded from a lead Christian Zionism
to mass popular Christian Zionism with
the enormous rise of the far-right
evangelical Christian movement since
mainly pretty much in the 1950s it was
always around but became expanded and
organized the major base for the
Republican Party
and their super Zionists they're also
extremely untie semitic their theology
if you read it is you have to support
israel because that'll lead to
Armageddon
everybody gets slaughtered and the souls
that are saved rise to heaven and
everybody else goes somewhere bad and
including all the Jews you can't be more
anti-semitic than that but a hundred and
sixty thousand Jews can be saved because
they're going to you know recognize
Christ in time or so that's the story
there are tens of millions of Americans
who believe this they're a large part of
the base of the Republican Party now so
one of the reasons whether
Republican Party is more extreme in
support of Israel than the Democrats are
even though you know the money in the
votes mostly go to Democrats from Jews
and liberal but and the another factor
which i think is underestimated is what
I mentioned before the u.s. is a settler
colonial society it's based on
extermination of the native population
for the greater good of all that's the
way we you know that's of course part of
the background so when you see Israel
doing the same thing you should support
it it's just instinctive you know if we
did it it's got to be right by
definition and they seem to be doing it
so you know it's got to be right I think
that's a not negligible factor in it in
addition there is a there's a
significant lobby so there's an ethnic
lobby which is powerful but ethnic
lobbies are pretty limited in their
power I mean they can be overwhelmed by
the major lobbies and instantly I'm the
military lobby for example Dwarfs APEC
the Chamber of Commerce you know the
business lobbies Dorf all of them if
they really decided that their interests
were being harmed they would put the
lobby out of business in no time so
they're there but as long as they're put
their actions support the national
interest in the real sense you know the
interest of the powerful you know
they're influential so you can get votes
in Congress you know 100 senators voting
recognize the capital of Jerusalem which
and they don't do things like that when
the lobby runs into conflict with real
US power it just backs off they're not
idiots and that happens in case after
case but these are plenty of factors and
I think they can be overcome but we
shouldn't underestimate their
significance
