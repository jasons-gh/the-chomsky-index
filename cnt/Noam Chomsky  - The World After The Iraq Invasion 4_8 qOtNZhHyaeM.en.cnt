the US alone voted against it Israel
reflexively accordingly it's not
reported and it's not part of history
except that it is part of history and it
tells you a lot about what's going on
it's December 1987 well it continues
like that at that time they were
constrained there was a deterrent
there's a limit on what you can do the
deterrence gone you go on to the
national security strategy uses
September 11th as a pretext the pretext
is used by States all over the world the
Russians immediately used it as a
pretext for stepping up their really
vicious terrorist atrocities in Chechnya
assuming correctly they'd get us
endorsement for it China did the same
Israel that the same in the occupied
territories it's all over also states
all over the world from the Central
Asian terrorist dictatorships that Bush
backs to the more democratic countries
all over the world it was used as a
pretext to discipline their own
populations we know what happened here
the Bush administration has made
extraordinary claims and they've been
upheld by the courts to a large extent
they've claimed the right to imprison
people including US citizens without
charge without access to lawyers or
family and to do so indefinitely until
the president declares that an emergency
is over which means executive authority
that's an astonishing claim the George
Bush is supposed to have a bust of
Winston Churchill on his desk that was
given to him by his friend Tony Blair
Churchill had some things to say about
this might listen to them he said the
power of the executive to cast a man
into prison without formulating any
charge known to the law and to deny him
the judgment of his peers is in the
highest degree odious and the foundation
of all totality
arian government whether not see or
communist that that was
that's what is being claimed and
implemented by the United States
Churchill said this in 1943 Britain was
in very serious straits at that time
they were under attack by the most
murderous military force in history and
came close to being destroyed that's the
moment at which Churchill declared that
whatever you think about the threats to
the United States and nothing like that
and he's right it is in the highest
degree odious and the foundation of all
totalitarian government whether or not
see or communist or Washington right now
but those are just plain facts no take a
look and it's getting worse there's a
new Justice Department proposal which is
being called Patriot to it was secret
but it was leaked he was leaked by
somebody who didn't like it on there
have been a couple of reports about it
in the press you can actually read it
it's posted on the internet NYU Law
Professor jack balkin wrote about it
sittin says the following there is no
civil right not even the precious right
of citizenship that this administration
will not abuse to secure ever greater
control over American life and if you
read the proposal he's exactly right it
even grants the Justice Department the
right to take away citizenship just by
inference what they call inference not
any actual actions they somehow infer
from something they don't like that you
don't they don't like you they can take
away your citizenship nothing's ever
been claimed like that that goes far
beyond what Churchill described as in
the highest degree odious well you know
whether that's implemented or not as up
to us Alan Gilbert here has a recent
book which he opens by quoting James
Madison who warned about those who
seized upon dangers abroad
to blind your eyes to dangers at home
that rings pretty true we're thinking
about well September 11th was the
pretext National Security Council
security strategy was announced election
campaign came along the doctrine was
announced the doctrine of war against
anybody you don't like preventive war
the purpose is to establish that as a
norm of behavior what international
legal scholars will call a new norm in
international law but to establish a
norm you have to do more than declare it
you have to illustrate it you have to
carry it out you got to show that you're
going to do it then it becomes a norm if
you're a rich and powerful country not
if you're somebody else well how do you
do it you got to pick a target target
has to meet several conditions one
condition is it has to be defenseless
you got to make sure that you're going
to have an overwhelming victory so you
can rejoice over the destruction of
people from a safe distance secondly
it's got to be important so like there's
no point going after you know burundi or
someplace like that it's got to be a
place that matters okay what state
satisfies those two conditions
completely defenseless and very
important well that's Iraq it's been
utterly devastated by a decade of
sanctions it's the weakest country in
the region which is why it's not feared
no matter how much it's hated even in
queit and Iran which it said I'm invaded
not feared in fact for the last five
years they've been trying to reintegrate
it into the regional system / strong us
objectives that's the United States that
fears it alone just like it feared
Nicaragua and Grenada and other demons
and that's extremely important as the
second largest oil reserves in the world
back as far back as 1945 the State
Department disk
i had persian gulf oil resources as in
their words this stupendous source of
strategic power the greatest one of the
greatest material prizes in world
history ever since then the US has been
determined to control it it's a leading
principle of foreign policy actually
goes back before but it was the British
before and it's understandable you don't
give away a stupendous source of
strategic power and one of the greatest
material prizes in world history it's
important to recognize that that means
control not access us didn't need the
oil effects barely needs it today look
at intelligence projections they're
expecting to rely on more secure
Atlantic Basin resources western Africa
West West Western Hemisphere but they
want to control it just as they did
after the Second World War and there's a
reason for that if you control the
stupendous source of strategic power you
control the world that's a lever of
world control you have what planners at
the time called veto power over other
countries you can also set prices and
production levels within the range that
you want and you can make sure that the
profits flow back into the right pockets
it's isn't enormous to a stat to mink to
gain control over this resource and that
have probably military bases there is a
tremendous achievement for world control
that's what you're aiming at you hear
you read counter arguments to this and
they're worth looking at so it's argued
that the can't be true because the costs
are the reconstruction are going to be
greater than the profits that will be
made well you know maybe that's true
maybe it isn't but it's totally
irrelevant and the reason is because the
costs of reconstruction are going to be
paid by the taxpayer but you and the
profits from the are going to go right
into the pockets of the energy
corporations so yeah the men are how
they balance out it's just another tax
bear subsidy to the rich the matter what
the numbers are so all the discussions
are completely irrelevant the
construction the profits will go to you
know bechtel corporation or Dick
Cheney's Halliburton Empire or one thing
or another which will be chosen to will
be called rebuild Iraq at taxpayer
expense and that's part of the way in
which you transfer wealth and power from
the population to the rich many ways and
that's one is there another way to
proceed at this point yet there sure is
the United States could pay reparations
to Iraq that's that's that would be
proper and remember what it is I mean
you know you're not reading about it in
the newspapers but you all know it's
reparations from 20 years of devastation
of Iraq first ten years of support for
Saddam Hussein right through his worst
atrocities the guys now in office and
care about the atrocities continued to
support him provide him with means to
develop weapons of mass destruction they
even said where they were doing it I
didn't have to do with the war with Iran
continued after I ran the reason was
because of us George Bush number one
explained his administration our duty to
support American exporters that's why we
had the support Saddam Hussein after the
gassing of the Kurds and everything else
and then they added the usual
boilerplate about the Saddam Hussein
being a source of stability and you know
we can help improve the human rights
situation and so on I went right up to
the day of the invasion of Quade first
first mistake didn't follow orders the
other crimes were fine then comes the
war and ten and a decade of sanctions
which have devastated the population
civilian population and strengthened
Saddam Hussein and furthermore made the
population more dependent on him that
means a murderous tyrant but a very
and a very efficient food distribution
system which people were dependent on
stay alive the world food organization
says the best the most efficient food
distribution system they know if they
say they can't duplicate it even by half
you know monster but an efficient
monster not the first one in history so
it forced the population to be dependent
on them it devastated the civilian
society strengthened Saddam Hussein
that's one reason why he's still there
otherwise he'd probably have been
overthrown by now remember that Saddam
Hussein was not the only monster who was
supported by the guys now in Washington
they had quite a quite an straight and
entourage that they collected they were
supporting among others Marcos and the
valet and so heart though and Mobutu who
was the first foreign leader invited to
the Bush White House they loved them so
much the Ceausescu is easily comparable
to Saddam Hussein saying vicious
murderous tyrant supported up until the
day he was overthrown by the people now
in office every single one of those guys
was overthrown from within why didn't it
happen to said even though they were
being supported by the United States why
didn't it happen the Saddam Hussein well
I know the people who the Westerners who
know Iraq best have been talking about
this for years they don't enter you
don't read about them in the American
media can't find the names in the New
York Times Index you can read them in
Canada or over City England or elsewhere
namely the administrators of the UN what
so-called oil for food programs Dennis
Halliday and hunts wants boning both of
them resigned in protest against what
they call the genocide Allah fective the
of the program the sanctions and the
fact that they were destroying the
civilian society and strengthening
Saddam Hussein and they've been pointing
out for years that the way to overthrow
Saddam Hussein is from within just like
every other
gangster that was supported by the
people now in Washington can't happen if
you destroy the civilian society in your
strength and the dictator and you make
people dependent on the main effect of
the sanctions as in harms that on the
same strengthened them but it's kept
them from being overthrown otherwise
chances re would have been gone the way
of Ceausescu and the rest of them a long
time ago but an internal revolt is
unacceptable to the United States just
as Saddam's leaving your act is
unacceptable as they announced that the
summit meeting the reason is very simple
it doesn't leave the United States in
charge leaves the Iraqi people in charge
and that's no good at the azores summit
bush and layer announced it explicitly
that even if Saddam Hussein goes we're
going to invade anyway because we have
to impose the regime of our choice not
the choice of the Iraqis whatever that
might be that's critical well give you
some tasks for people here one is to
ensure the least harmful outcomes
whatever can be done another is to try
to get to the point where we can provide
reparations to Iraqis and if we can't
get to that level of honesty at least to
provide aid that they can use to rebuild
the society the way they want to and not
the way somebody in Crawford kelson
the next task after that and Karl Rove
just told you this morning what it is as
if you didn't know was to face the next
challenge as the new norm and
international relations is put into
effect somewhere else and now that it's
been established by this action you want
to know what it is
