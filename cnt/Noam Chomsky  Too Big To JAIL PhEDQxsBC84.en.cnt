for most people in the country the real
incomes have stagnated and they've been
getting by with increased work hours by
now far higher than Europe even Japan
debt which can only go on for so long
and asset inflation like the expected
bubble the housing bubble is the most
recent case and these bubbles are
repeatedly destroyed by the financial
crisis crises that began to occur in the
Reagan years as the regulatory apparatus
was dismantled the effect is that the
country is being severely weakened well
none of this is problematic for the very
wealthy in particular for the financial
institutions that their share of
corporate profit arose to an astonishing
forty percent in 2007 right before the
crash that they caused and the major
players benefit from a government
insurance policy which is called bull
too big to fail and as one commentator
quipped too big to jail they can get
away with any crimes they like currently
the financial and economic crisis is
traceable in no small measure to a
fanatic faith in certain dogmas such as
what's called the efficient market
hypothesis and in general to what Nobel
laureate Joseph Stiglitz 15 years ago
called the religion and it is a religion
that markets know best the religion made
it unnecessary for economists and in
fact the Federal Reserve the central
bank made
unnecessary for them to notice that
there was an eight trillion dollar
housing bubble it's a lot of money eight
trillion dollar housing bubble no
economic fundamentals no relation to
anything that in the economy but they
didn't have to notice it because the
market knows best efficient markets
devastated the economy when it burst
that's a serious religion that interest
incidentally that religion has been
reconstituted almost without change
after the total collapse of this edifice
this intellectual edifice it's a
remarkable event in economic history in
fact an intellectual history
