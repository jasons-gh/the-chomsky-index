the discussions about r2p or its cousin
humanitarian intervention are regularly
disturbed by a skeleton in the closet
history to the present moment not past
history throughout history to the
present moment there are a few
principles of international affairs that
apply quite generally one is the maximum
of facilities that the strong do as they
wish while the weak suffer as they must
a corollary is what Ian Brownlee
distinguished international legal
specialist what he calls the hedge
ammonia approach to law making the voice
of the powerful sets presidents another
principle derives from Adam Smith's
account of policymaking in England as he
put it the principal architects of
policy in his day the merchants and
manufacturers make sure that their own
interests are most peculiarly attended
to however grievous the effects on
others including the people of England
but far more so those who were subject
to what he calls the savage and justice
of the Europeans particularly in Concord
India Smith's own prime concern a third
principle is that virtually every use of
force in international affairs has been
justified in humanitarian terms
including the worst monsters just to
illustrate in the standard scholarly
study of humanitarian intervention shaun
murphy sykes only three examples of
humanitarian intervention between the
kellogg-briand pact and the UN Charter
Japan's attack on Manchuria Mussolini's
invasion of Ethiopia and Hitler's
occupation of parts of Czechoslovakia
all accompanied by lofty rhetoric and
factual justifications and the basic
pattern continues to the present moment
the historical record is worth recalling
when we hear r2p or its cousin described
as an emerging norm in international
affairs in reality it has been
considered a norm as far back as we want
to go so the founding of this country is
an example in 1629 the Massachusetts Bay
Colony was granted its charter by the
King of England the stating that
rescuing the natives from their bitter
pagan fate is the principle end of this
plantation the Great Seal of the colony
depicts an Indian saying come over and
help us so the English colonists were
thus dedicated to their responsibility
to protect as they proceeded to
extirpate and exterminate the indigenous
population in their words and for their
own good as their honored successors
explained in 1630 John Winthrop
delivered his famous sermon depicting
the new nation ordained by God as a city
on the hill that inspirational rhetoric
that is regularly invoked to this day to
justify any crime as it worse the
deviation from the noble mission now
there's no difficulty adding similar
examples from other great powers in
their day and the Sun the powerful are
free to say that we should forget
history and look forward for the week
it's not a wise choice the skeleton in
the closet made its appearance in the
first case considered by the
International Court of Justice 60 years
ago the Corfu channel case
the court determined quoting that it can
only regard the alleged right of
intervention as the manifestation of a
policy of force such as has in the past
given rise to the most serious abuses
and such as cannot whatever be the
defects in international organization
find a place in international law from
the nature of things intervention would
be reserved for the most powerful states
and might easily lead to perverting the
administration of justice itself the
same perspective informed the first ever
meeting of the South Summit of 133
states it convened in april two thousand
its declaration surely with the bombing
of serbia in mind rejected what it
called the so-called right of
humanitarian intervention which has no
legal basis in the United Nations
Charter for the general principles of
international law the word wording has
been repeated since among others by the
ministerial meeting of the non-aligned
movement in Malaysia in 2006 again
representing the traditional victims the
same conclusion was drawn in 2004 by the
high-level UN panel on threats
challenges and change the panel adopted
the view of the ICJ and the non-aligned
movement concluding that article 51
needs neither extension nor restriction
of its long understood scope the panel
added that for those impatient with such
a response the answer must be that in a
world full of perceived potential
threats the risk to the global order and
the norm of non-intervention on which it
continues to be based is simply too
great for the legality of unilateral
preventive action to be accepted
allowing one to act
is to allow all which is of course
unthinkable the same position same basic
position was adopted by the world summit
in 2005 the summit also asserted the
willingness to take collective action
through the Security Council in
accordance with the Charter should
peaceful means be inadequate and
national authorities are failing
manifestly failing to protect their
populations from serious crimes now that
phrase sharpens the wording of Article
42 at most in clarifying the conditions
for the Security Council to resort to
force and it keeps the skeleton in the
closet if and it's a large if the we can
regard the Security Council as a neutral
arbiter not subject to the maxims of
vicinities and Adam Smith come back to
that there have been some departures
from the curfew channel restriction and
its descendants the constitutive act of
the African Union asserts the right of
the Union to intervene in a member state
in respective grave circumstances now
that differs crucially from the charter
of the Organization of American States
which bars intervention for any reason
whatever in the internal or external
affairs of any other state the reasons
for the difference are clear the Osos
charter seeks to deter intervention by
the Colossus of the north and has of
course failed to do so up to the present
but after the collapse of the apartheid
States the African Union face no
comparable problem now if the African
Union doctrine were to extend to the OAS
or NATO then its members would be
entitled to intervene within their own
alliance that idea yields interesting
and revealing
conclusions which I not have time to go
into but they would be inoperative in
any event thanks to the maxim of acidity
now there is a high-level proposal to
extend r2p beyond the African Union
doctrine it's in the report of the
international commission which advocates
action within area of jurisdiction by
regional or sub-regional organizations
under chapter 8 of the Charter that the
skeleton and the closet rattles rather
loudly at this point the powerful
unilaterally declare their area of
jurisdiction so for NATO it includes the
Balkans and now Afghanistan and beyond
secretary general yup sheffer informed a
NATO meeting in June 2007 quoting him
that NATO troops have to guard pipelines
that transport oil and gas that is
directed for the rest for the west and
more generally have to protect sea
routes used by tankers and other crucial
infrastructure of the energy system the
expansive rights accorded by the
International Commission are restricted
to the powerful radically violating the
principles of corfu channel and its
descendants and opening the door for
potential use of r2p as a weapon for
Imperial in intervention at will the
curfew channel principle which runs
right through the World Summit provides
considerable insight into the
selectivity and timing of r2p and its
cousin the alleged normative revolution
as its described that took place in the
1990s immediately after the collapse of
the Soviet Union which had in earlier
years and provided an automatic pretext
for intervention however frail the
argument the Bush administration
Senior bush administration reacted to
the fall of the Berlin Wall with an
official exposition of Washington's new
course in brief everything will stay the
same but with new pretexts so we still
need a huge military system but for a
new reason what they call the
technological sophistication of third
world powers we have to maintain the
industry defense industrial base to
euphemism for state supported high-tech
industry we must maintain intervention
forces directed at the Middle East
energy rich regions where the thrum
quoting were the threats to our
interests that required military
intervention could not be laid at the
Kremlin's door contrary to decades of
pretense so new pretexts for
intervention were needed and the
normative revolution soon took place the
natural interpretation of the timing
gained support from the selectivity of
application of r2p and its cousin there
was a full of course no thought of
applying the principle to the Iraq
sanctions administered by the Security
Council condemned as genocidal by the
two directors of the oil-for-food
programme the respected international
diplomats Dennis Halliday and hunts
transpo neck both of whom resigned
because of their genocidal character
funds monex detailed study of the
horrendous impact of the sanctions has
been under a virtual ban in the US and
UK the primary agents of the programs
though they were administered by the
Security Council there's no thought
today of protection of the people of
Gaza that's another UN responsibility
along with the rest of the protected
population under the Geneva Conventions
also denied
human rights in these and numerous other
cases the selectivity conforms with
considerable precision to the maximum of
acidities and the expectation of the ICJ
sixty years ago perhaps the most
striking illustration of the radical
selectivity was in 1999 when NATO bombed
Serbia that's an attack featured in
Western discourse as the jewel in the
crown of the normative revolution the
emerging norm that was when the US was
at the height of its glory in leading
the enlightened states leading the
liteon states the leadership in the
hands of an enlightened idealistic new
world bent on ending in humanity
everywhere to cite just a few of the
flood of accolades by Western
intellectuals there are a few
difficulties confronting this flattering
self-image one problem is that the
traditional victims of Western
intervention vigorously objected I've
already quoted the stand of the
non-aligned movement Nelson Mandela was
particularly harsh and his condemnation
well that problem was not serious easily
overcome the views of the unworthy are
easily ignored as indeed they were
furthermore the bombing plainly violated
the UN Charter that problem too was
easily put to rest the as the Goldstone
Commission determined the bombing was
illegal but legitimate they reached that
conclusion by reversing the chronology
of bombing and atrocities which leads to
a third problem the facts which happened
to be very richly documented in this
case from impeccable Western sources and
what they reveal is unequivocal the NATO
bombing did not end the atrocities but
rather precipitated by far the worst of
them as had been anticipated by the NATO
and the White House the conclusions that
are so richly documented by the Western
records are reinforced by the indictment
of Milosevic issued by the International
Tribunal at the height of the bombing
with a single exception the crimes
charged followed the bombing and we can
be confident that the one pre bombing
charge the ratchet massacre was of
little principal concern to the US and
Britain if only because at the very same
time they were not only condoning but
supporting actively supporting much more
serious crimes in East Timor where the
background of atrocities was
incomparably more grotesque than
anything that had happened in the
Balkans and this incidentally is only
one of many examples right at that time
well this problem too was overcome quite
simply by virtual suppression of the
ample record I do the case of East Timor
is particularly instructive just add a
personal note I testified about it at
the fourth committee in 1978 when
atrocities reached the level i'm quoting
of extermination as a crime against
humanity committed against the East
Timor ease population it's the words of
the later un-sponsored truth commission
and 1978 was also the year in which
Britain and France joined the United
States in supporting extermination as a
crime against humanity and continued to
do so right through 1999 as atrocities
sharply mounted once again after the
final paroxysm of state terror in
September 1999 which destroyed most of
what remained of the country National
Security Advisor sandy Berger said that
the United States would continue its
support of the aggressors explaining
that I don't think anybody ever
articulated a doctrine which said we
ought to intervene whenever there's a
humanitarian problem so
r2p vanished in the standard way to end
the atrocities in this case would not
have required any action not bombing not
sanctions and the other act beyond
withdrawal of participation and that was
demonstrated shortly after burgers
reaffirmation of US policy when under
strong domestic and international
pressure President Clinton formally
ended us participation the invaders
immediately withdrew and a UN
peacekeeping force was able to enter
facing no army that could have been done
at any time in the preceding quarter
century astonishingly this horrendous
story has since been reinterpreted as a
vindication of r2p it's a reaction so
shameful that words fit well I mentioned
that the consensus of the World Summit
adheres to the curfew principle and its
descendants only if we assume that the
Security Council is a neutral arbiter it
plainly is not the council is controlled
by its five permanent members and
they're far from equal and operative
Authority one indication of the
difference is the record of vetoes
that's the most extreme form of
violation of a Security Council
resolution the relevant period is from
the mid 1960s when decolonisation and
recovery from wartime destruction gave
the UN at least some standing as a
representative of world opinion since
that time the u.s. is far in the lead
invitas Britain a second no one else is
even close in the past quarter-century
at China and France Evita three
resolutions Russia for the United
Kingdom 10 and the United States 43
including even resolutions calling on
all states to observe international law
the skeleton in the closet nods in
recognition as the maximum of acidities
strikes again American public opinion it
brings up a further consideration the
Maxim's that actually one way to
mitigate this defect in the world summit
consensus and it's a serious one would
be to eliminate the veto okay that's
incidentally in accord with the will of
the majority of Americans they believe
that the United States should follow the
will of the majority and that the UN not
the United States should take the lead
in international crises but that's not
on the political agenda because we run
up again against Adam Smith's maxon
which ensures that such heresies are
unthinkable as much so as applying r2p
to those who desperately need protection
but are not on the favored list of the
powerful American public opinion brings
up an important consideration the
Maxim's that largely guide international
affairs and practice are not graven in
stone and in fact they've become
considerably less harsh over the years
as a result of the civilizing effect of
popular movements and for that
continuing and essential project r2p can
be a valuable tool much as the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights is even
though states do not adhere to the ud
and some formally reject much of it
nonetheless the it serves as an ideal
that activists can appeal to in
educational and organizational efforts
often effectively and my suspicion is
that a major contribution of the
discussion of r2p may turn out to be
rather similar thanks thank you very
much
