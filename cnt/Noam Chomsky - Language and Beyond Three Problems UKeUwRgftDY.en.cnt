for much of my life I've been intrigued
by several problems one of which have
sometimes called Plato's problem another
Orwell's problem and also by a third
which we might call de cartes problem
plato's problem was lucidly formulated
by Bertrand Russell and his last major
philosophical work he asked how comes it
that human beings whose contacts with
the world our brief and personal are
limited are nevertheless able to know as
much as they do know and the roots of
that go back to Plato we can borrow some
of the same words to formulate Orwell's
complimentary problem how comes it that
human beings with ample and reliable
information at hand and nevertheless
know and understand so little de cartes
problem had to do with freedom of choice
and action unique to humans so he argued
and what he called the noblest thing we
have illustrated most clearly for
Descartes and his followers in what we
may call the creative use of language
the capacities shared by all humans to
freely express their thoughts in
constantly novel ways over an infinite
range in a manner that's appropriate to
circumstances but not caused by them
that's a crucial distinction and that is
also not causally determined by any
extra mental internal state humans may
be incited or inclined to speak in
certain ways by internal or external
circumstances but they are not compelled
to do so as his followers but the matter
for them the dividing line
between humans and what they call beast
machines animals or machines they were
describing the normal everyday use of
language later Vil hum hum the lump one
whom well called that the infinite use
of finite means a core element of the
human creative impulse that should be
nurtured by education in any decent
Society he and other classical liberals
argued these are ideas that were
developed further in Marx's early
manuscripts and that have repeatedly
animated popular movements I discussed
these three problems in memorial
lectures for Bertrand Russell at
Cambridge University forty years ago
about plato's problem a good deal has
been learned since at least in a few
domains Plato of course had an answer to
the problem his theory of reminiscence
from an earlier existence Lydon it's
found plato's thesis convincing when as
he put it purged of the error of
reminiscence which to us must mean when
formulated in terms of genetic endowment
a topical that's at least in principle
susceptible study des cartes problem
remains shrouded in mystery perhaps
permanent mystery so Descartes
conjectured and we have no strong reason
to believe otherwise
David Hume reached similar conclusions
about the limits of human understanding
he was writing about the man he
described as the greatest and rarest
genius that ever arose for the ornament
and instruction of the species Isaac
Newton and about him Hume concluded that
his most memorable achievement was to
draw the veil from some of the mysteries
of nature while at the same time
restoring nature's
ultimate secrets to that obscurity in
which they ever did and ever will remain
presumably it was with such thoughts in
mind that Russell gave his last great
philosophical work from which I quoted
the title human knowledge its scope and
limits the title is appropriate if
humans are part of the organic world not
angels so that all human capacities have
fixed scope and limits the two
intimately related the inherent
properties that provide their scope also
determine their limits and inescapable
contingency that's true whether we're
considering athletic feats of
intellectual and artistic achievements
or any other capacity including the most
ordinary and familiar such as speaking
our language Newton had consigned
nature's mysteries the permanent
obscurity hume explained by revealing
the imperfections of the mechanical
philosophy philosophy then of course mid
science so mechanical science the that's
the conception of the world as a machine
that conception provided the criterion
of intelligibility for Galileo and in
fact all of early modern science
including Newton who regarded his
demolition of mechanical science as so
great an absurdity that I believe no man
who has in philosophical matters a
competent Faculty of thinking can ever
fall into it although he was compelled
to accept that it is true which was
inconceivable to him but nevertheless
true so by invoking the inconceivable
notion of action at a distance we
concede that we do not understand the
phenomena of the material world
we're understanding is given a sharp
meaning its construed in terms of
intelligibility to the human mind with
its own limits the great scientists of
the day a shared Newton's judgment
sometimes with a degree of contempt
christiaan huygens for example described
newton's principle of attraction as an
absurdity
Leibniz argued that Newton was
reintroducing occult ideas similar to
the sympathies and antipathies of the
much ridiculed scholastic science and
that he was offering no physical
explanations for phenomena of the
material world to these objections
Newton partially agreed but only
partially his principles he conceded
were occult but not a cult
in the sense of the Scholastic's the
reason is that as he put it while the
causes he postulated are occult and
nevertheless to derive general
principles inductively from phenomena
and afterwards to tell us how the
properties of actions of all corporeal
things follow from these manifest
principles would be a very great step in
philosophy even though the causes of
these principles were not yet discovered
yet because we hope they might be
discovered but in fact they never would
be discovered in terms that Newton and
other founders of modern science
regarded as intelligible in accord with
common-sense understanding so in that
respect
Humes statement that left us with
permanent mysteries appears to be
correct Thomas Kuhn famous historian of
science suggests that Newton presumably
wished to write a principles of
philosophy like Descartes
meaning true science
but his inability to explain gravity
forced him to restrict his subject to
what he called the math mathematical
principles of natural philosophy which
did not even pretend to explain why the
universe runs as it does leaving the
question in obscurity permanent
obscurity human conjectured some of the
ablest scientists of the 18th century
continued to seek a mechanical
corpuscular explanation of gravity that
is what they took to be a physical
explanation as indeed Newton did himself
to the end of his life in later years
positivist positivists reproached all
sides of the debate quoting for their
foolishness in clothing the mathematical
formalism of physical theory with the
gay garment of a physical interpretation
a concept that had lost substantive
meaning that's Heinrich Hertz as the
impact of Newton's discoveries was
slowly absorbed
science simply lowered its goals in a
manner that's now so routine that its
unacknowledged scientists abandoned the
animating idea of the early scientific
revolution namely that the world is in
principle intelligible to us and they
restricted their goals to construction
of theories that are intelligible now
that's a very significant step in
intellectual history by now so standard
that it's not noticed by the time we
reach Bertrand Russell his analysis of
matter in 1927 he dismisses the very
idea of an intelligible world as an
absurdity and in fact he repeatedly
places the word intelligible in quotes
to highlight the absurdity of the quest
qualms about action at a distance he
writes were little more than a prejudice
if the world consisted of billiard balls
it would be what we call intelligible
that is it would not surprise us
sufficiently so as to make us realize
that we do not understand it in this
last phrase that Newton is invoking one
of the great intellectual contributions
of modern science namely the ability to
be surprised by what seems superficially
obvious and hence to recognize that we
do not understand it it's quite a
difficult step to take in fact for 2,000
years scientists were mostly satisfied
that apples fall to the ground and steam
rises to the heavens because they're
seeking their natural place it's only
when Galileo and others were willing to
be puzzled by the simplest phenomena of
nature that modern science began from a
different perspective when he moved from
physics to psychology Wolfgang kohler
observed that in psychology it's far
harder to make exciting discoveries in
physics even the most elementary
discoveries are exciting because they
run so counter to common sense for
example Galileo's demonstration which in
fact was by a thought experiment like
most of his experiment his demonstration
that rate a fall is independent of mass
contrary to what common sense wouldn't
indicate but in psychology curler
pointed out discoveries seem routine as
if we always knew that or at least we
believed we did even far-reaching
insights seem unsurprising or to some
incoherent for example the observation
of Descartes that we can freely express
our thoughts in novel ways without limit
so we speak effortlessly all the time so
what can be problematic some modern
thinkers like Vidkun Stein dismissed the
very effort
at explanation of such matters as a
childish error that should be overcome
in favor of what he called compiling an
assembly of particulars just collecting
data anything beyond that is a childish
error similarly how can there be
anything puzzling about acquisition of
language after all it's done routinely
by infants so it must be straightforward
and efforts to deal with it should
appeal to nothing beyond appointing us a
stench and training those are vacant
Stein's two principles of language
acquisition or perhaps to conditioning
as WV Quine insisted some went on to
invoke analogy and induction when
plagued paying attention which is rare
to the truisms that were at the core of
Cartesian philosophy but these notions
remained completely mystical and still
do outside of narrow domains such limits
on curiosity have been standard practice
for the 2500 years of extensive study of
language they persisted almost without
question into the 1950s they're still
largely prevalent today and in such ways
inquiry into language and other mental
processes was stifled at birth much in
the same way that the Natural Sciences
were curtailed before puzzlement about
simple phenomena became the norm in the
early Scientific Revolution historians
of science have recognized that Newton's
reluctant intellectual moves set forth a
new view of science in which the goal is
not to seek ultimate explanations but to
find the best theoretical account we can
we can of experia the phenomena of
experience and experiment these more
limited goals were
entirely new they have roots in an
earlier scientific tradition that had
abandoned the search for what were
called the first springs of natural
motions their actual causes and of other
natural phenomena the keeping to the
more modest effort to develop the best
theoretical account that we can this
more modest project is what historian of
philosophy Richard Popkin calls the
constructive skepticism formulated and
detailed by Marcin and guess nd later by
Hume and what he called his mitigated
skepticism skepticism because we can
never know be sure to know the answers
are mitigated because we could at least
go some of the direction some sub steps
towards answering them
this mitigated skepticism according to
that science proceeds by still quoting
Popkin by doubting our abilities to find
grounds for our knowledge while
accepting and increasing the knowledge
itself and recognizing that the secrets
of nature of things in themselves are
forever hidden from us that's the
science without metaphysics he says
which was to have a great history in
more recent times the goal is now
sometimes called induction to the best
explanation
but that's remains a mysterious notion
which has to be spelled out and
explained somehow it's an important
topic of cognitive science in principle
not one that's been investigated but in
principle it is it still remains at best
at the margins of inquiry well a curious
feature of contemporary intellectual
culture is that anti foundationalism is
regarded as a courageous battle cry it's
curious because
foundation foundational is it was almost
entirely dismissed and said in the 17th
century and later once
Newton's discoveries made the transition
from the absurdity that he believed them
to be to scientific common sense which
is now sharply divorced for a mere
common sense understanding well
Descartes too before Newton had
recognized the limits of cognitive reach
if you look at the regula rule eight
reads if in the course of subjects to be
examined we come to a subject of which
our intellect cannot gain a good enough
intuition we must stop there and we must
not examine the other matters that
follow and must refrain from futile toil
from speculation based on nothing that
Descartes speculated that the workings
of the mind of his race Koga tons might
lie behind human not beyond human
understanding as he put it we might not
have intelligence enough to understand
the workings of mind but if you know the
explanation for the normal use of
language and other forms of free and
coherent choice of action if such
explanation lies beyond our cognitive
grass that should give no warrant for
questioning the authenticity of our
experience went on to say that there is
nothing we comprehend more evidently and
more perfectly than our ability to
choose our course of thought and action
and it would be absurd to doubt that
something that we comprehend intimately
an experience within ourselves and
namely that the free actions of people
are undetermined would be absurd to
doubt that merely because it conflicts
with something else which we know to be
in its nature incomprehensible to us
well for Descartes what was
incomprehensible to us is divine
preordination for a tradition from Hume
to Russell
the mysteries that lie beyond cognitive
reach of this particular organism
ourselves with its own scope and limits
that there are mysteries of this kind
should be again the mirrors truism
assuming that we're part of nature a
separate matter and an interesting one
is how these mysteries relate to
questions that we might like to answer
or that we might like even the pose and
proper terms that's in principle a topic
subject to empirical inquiry so it might
turn out that what we call science human
science is a chance convergence between
aspects of the truth of the world and
our cognitive reach biological property
of humans that's a conclusion that might
be established for example by some
differently organized alien intelligence
that just as we can reach similar
conclusions about insects and there is
furthermore no contradiction in
supposing that even within the limits of
our cognitive capacities we might in
principle discover a good deal about
what these limits are so for example
within our cognitive limits Newtonian
science did provide evidence that
intelligibility of the world is in a
crucial sense beyond our cognitive grasp
and if it were some days shown that
intelligibility of theoretical
explanation for humans is restricted to
determinacy and randomness it might be
possible to provide empirical
justification for Cartesian speculations
about our inability to comprehend what
we know to be our noblest property our
capacity for free choice of coherent
action and in fact the core of our
existence one philosopher scientists who
have tried to address these problems
seriously was David Hume whose
misleadingly
described as the arch empiricist it was
very far from that he pursuing his
mitigated skepticism the Hume recognized
that much of animal and human knowledge
must as he put it derive from the
original hand of nature which provides
scope and limits to what can be attained
the original hand of nature is what we
would call genetic endowment and he
argues that that provides the means for
the experimental reasoning that guides
scientific inquiry in some obscure
fashion and also the experimental
reasoning on which the whole conduct of
life depends it can be nothing but a
species of instinct or mechanical power
he said that acts in us unknown to
ourselves and in its chief operations is
not directed by any such relations or
comparisons of ideas as are the proper
objects of our intellectual faculties in
other words whatever it is lies beyond
their intellectual faculties in our
Terms rephrasing this the genetic
endowment and its cognitive
manifestations lie far beyond the level
of accessibility to consciousness that's
an idea incidentally which is dismissed
as an absurdity by leading contemporary
philosophers who regard themselves
curiously as firmly within the modern
scientific tradition in reality the
doctrine of accessibility to
consciousness is sheer Dogma nabarro
uncritically from long abandoned
tradition and amply refuted by empirical
evidence but quite prevalent in
contemporary philosophy Humes ideas were
taken up in different terms by charles
sanders peirce a century ago and he's
best known for other
work but in an essay which is barely
known on what he called abduction which
long remained in obscurity in that essay
purse faced playtest problem squarely
it's unusual he recognized that
attaining theories requires some
principle rooted in our nature which as
he put it puts a limit on admissible
hypotheses a very narrow limit if the
experimental reasoning and the whole
conduct of life are to be feasible purse
could not spell out this principle of
abduction and there's been very little
progress in doing so since beyond quite
specific domains purse believed that
whatever it is this human capacity for
abduction is a reliable grasp a reliable
a guide to grasping the truth of the
world he gave an argument based on
natural selection which he said must
have favored organisms capable of this
achievement but that surely is a fallacy
no selectional process made it possible
for Galileo and his successors to be
puzzled by what seemed obvious for two
thousand years and to construct
theoretical explanations that may or may
not approach the truth of the world
which we instinctively believe to exist
even by those who hotly denied we cannot
avoid being naive realists Russell
observed any more than we can keep
ourselves from perceiving the moon
illusion the great figures of the 17th
century speculated about the mysteries
of nature in ways that have a resonance
today even though we don't use their
terms so Newton for example thought that
some unknown force which he called
spirit may be the cause of all movement
in
including the power of moving our body
by our thoughts and the same power and
other living creatures though how this
is done and by what laws we do not know
we cannot say he said that all nature is
not alive going beyond Newton Locke
concluded that we cannot say that matter
does not think as he put it in his
theological framework just as God had
added inconceivable effects to motion so
he might have super added to matter a
Faculty of thinking but we cannot reject
it on that grounds it he said it's true
that this idea that God might have
superadded he might have created
thinking matter
that's repugnant to the idea of
senseless matter but we cannot reject it
on these grounds
given our incurable ignorance and the
limits of our cognitive capacities what
he called our ideas so having no
intelligible concept of matter or body
or physical we cannot dismiss the
possibility of living or thinking matter
particularly after Newton had undermined
common sense understanding well Locke's
repugnant idea of thinking matter was
developed extensively through the 18th
century the leading finally to the
important work of scientist philosopher
Joseph Priestley who liked Locke and
others recognized that the traditional
mind-body problem had become unform you
label with newton's demolition of the
only coherent notion of body or physical
or material so for Priestley and others
the only plausible conclusion quoting
him was that properties termed mental
reduce somehow to the organical
structure of the brain
similar conclusions were drawn from Hume
to Darwin Darwin asked rhetorically why
is thought being a secretion of the
brain more wonderful than matter than
gravity a property of matter today
curiously it's widely held among
philosophers that there's a crucial
explanatory gap as it's called between
the physical and consciousness that is a
gap beyond the concerns for the
unification of science that arise
throughout efforts to understand the
world as somehow a more fundamental gap
however unless the that notion physical
is given some new post-newtonian sense
which has not been done or even
attempted unless that's done there's
even less reason to have qualms about an
explanatory gap than in cases where
there is some clear sense to the assumed
reduction base the most extreme of these
concerns and perhaps the most
significant for the subsequent
development of the sciences is the
explanatory gap that Newton unearthed
and left unresolved that perhaps a
permanent mystery for humans as David
Hume conjectured well there are other
curious aspects of contemporary debate
about plato's problem evidently the
growth and development and if in any
domain involve three factors genetic
endowment external data and laws of
nature for language the first factor
genetic endowment is sometimes called
universal grammar ug and contemporary
work it's about adapting a traditional
term to a new usage that ug exists can
hardly be doubted I mean otherwise it
would simply be a miracle that every
child acquires language well it's
pet kitten or chimp or songbird whatever
exposed to exactly the same data that
cannot even take the first step at
determining which aspects of the data
are related to language that's no
trivial task incidentally a little on
all the rest and nevertheless the debate
has raged over this matter for decades a
very odd debate if only because it's
one-sided there are innumerable condom
nations of what critics call the innate
nurse hypothesis apparently referring to
the truism that ug exists there are no
defenders of the hypothesis just as
there are no defenders of the hypothesis
that the mammalian visual system has a
genetic component the only serious
question as in the case of every other
subsystem of the organism is what are
the properties of ug and how do they
interact with other factors in growth
and development
another common objection is that little
is known about the neural circuitry
that's involved in the language faculty
either in its initial state before
experience as determined by ug or in the
mature state that it assumes that - is
rather odd little is known about far
simpler questions for example the
neurophysiology of the remarkable and
navigational capacities and
communication systems of insects but
that's never been considered a reason to
question the research that seeks to
determine their properties abstractly
properties which as in the case of
language that provide a kind of a guide
to inquiry into what Priestley called
the organical structure of the brain
that underlies these properties one
prominent cognitive neuroscientist CR
gal Estelle has a important recent book
in which he argues that
- throughout the long history of inquiry
neuro physiologist psychologists
computational linguists and philosophers
have been looking in the wrong place
they've been studying associative bonds
and synaptic conductance and that he
writes cannot encode facts about the
state of the experienced world memory
storage or the stable systems that are
called upon in performance instead he
says they've got to throw out the whole
traditional enterprise begin again start
looking for elementary units of
computation with the properties that
enter into any kind of computational
system units that have the property of
read write and address elementary
properties any computational system and
these he argues are quite appropriate to
the tasks at hand even for insects and
very likely for humans - but are not the
things that neurophysiologists are
looking for they're just looking in the
wrong place the science has to be
completely reconstructed if he's correct
which he may be well depart the carts
problem is beyond human inquiry perhaps
forever and we can at least try to
discover the mechanisms that are used in
free choice of action including his
prime example creative use of language
that is we can try to discover the
finite means that enter into infinite
use in home bolts formula by the mid
20th century the general mathematical
theory of such mechanisms was quite well
understood and it can be adapted to
language where by language here I mean
an internal system a subsystem that
interacts with other systems in the life
of the organism what biologists
sometimes called modules or organs each
language must be based on a finite lease
if I'd computational procedure that
generates an infinite range of
hierarchically structured expressions
that provide instructions for two
language external systems the
sensorimotor system which we use to make
the noises that we hear and produce and
the systems of thought and action so
putting it in different terms the
computational procedure provides
information for the phonetic interface
and the semantic pragmatic interface all
parts of our body in in that way the
language will satisfy the conditions
formulated by aristotle who described
language as sound with meaning actually
recent work suggests that the
formulation should be changed that
languages meaning with sound that's a
significant difference according to that
view externalization of language by the
sensorimotor system is a secondary
process both from an evolutionary
perspective and the perspective of the
structural design of the system I can't
go into details here but the basic
thrust of the argument is fairly
straightforward the internal
computational procedure is sometimes
called a generative grammar or more
perspicuous lee an internal language
it's incorporated incorporated somehow
and any such procedure is an operation
call it merge that takes two objects
already generated and forms from them a
new object
the simplest operation will leave the
two objects unchanged and an order so we
can take the new object to be just the
set of the other two reapplying merge
over and over again we obtain an
infinity of hierarchically structured
expressions if furthermore if no
special stipulations are added merge
will form structures with what are
called displaced elements so for example
if merge is applied to the structure
underlying John saw what it will form
what John saw what and if we carry out
merge again it can form guess what John
saw of what that structure is then
transferred to the two interfaces well
it turns out to be just what is required
for the semantic pragmatic interface
where the element what has two functions
it's the direct object of the word C and
gets its semantic interpretation from
that and it's an operator ranging over
the whole expression which means
something like guests for which thing X
John saw the thing X the X is
interpreted twice that's the right
information for the semantic pragmatic
interpretation but it's completely the
wrong information for the phonetic
interface so we do not say guess what
John guess what John saw what rather we
say guess what John saw we delete the
second occurrence of John the less the
lower occurrence in a hierarchy only the
most hierarchically prominent occurrence
remains in externalization the others
are all deleted and in more complex
expressions that means lots of deletion
well that makes sense from the point of
view of efficiency of computation and
articulation they are greatly simplified
by this procedure however it raises
problems for communication it's
necessary for the hearer to determine
what's missing and where it is and that
becomes an extremely complex problem as
anyone knows has work done automatic
parsing programs or on perceptual models
well what this illustrates is that
there's a conflict between
mutational efficiency and communicative
efficiency and in this and every similar
case of conflict that's known language
design favors computational efficiency
and sacrifices communicative efficiency
in other words considerations of
computational efficiency yield the right
results at the somatic pragmatic
interface for thought and action but
they harm communication well that's an
important conclusion and in fact the
outcome is exactly what we would expect
on evolutionary grounds so merge is in
fact clearly a universal property of the
human mind brain today but our early
ancestors lacked that property hence at
some point in the past not the very
remote past some mutation must have
taken place perhaps very slight which
rewired the brain to yield this capacity
to yield this operation merge well
mutations take place in an individual is
not in a group and the person who
underwent this mutation could exploit
existing conceptual capacities to think
to interpret to plan over an unbounded
range the person had what's sometimes
called a language of thought well that
that presumably confers a selectional
advantage in part it would be inherited
by offspring sometime later the property
would be shared by enough people in a
small breeding group and we come from
very small groups maybe a few thousand
individuals that could the property
could take over a small group at that
point if enough people have the capacity
it would be advantageous to externalize
the inner thought to do so it's
necessary to solve a hard cognitive
problem that is to relate the internal
generative system
which had emerged suddenly to the
sensorimotor system which had been
around for hundreds of thousands of
years we know that from fossil evidence
so we would expect then that this
secondary system the secondary component
of language the externalization would be
complex a varied subject de Starkel
change and so on and that's indeed what
we find overwhelmingly the fact is very
familiar from language acquisition to
learn a second language one has to
acquire the vocabulary which is an
arbitrary linkage of sounded meaning you
have to acquire inflectional systems you
have to learn about linear order and so
on but no one can learn the syntactic or
semantic rules or for that matter even
the meanings of words in their normal
rich complexity because evidence for
that is virtually non-existent in many
cases totally non-existent and no one
could teach any of this since our
knowledge of them is beyond the reach of
consciousness and what theoretical
understanding has been attained as
surely not put the use in in language
acquisition notice that a unbounded
generative procedure is an
all-or-nothing affair either have it or
you don't have it there are no
intermediate stages
well it's commonly argued in fact almost
universally that there must have been
preliminary stages that sometimes called
proto-language there's no empirical
evidence that any such stages ever
existed and there's no conceptual reason
to suppose that they did if they did
exist by some chance they were
irrelevant it's just as hard to move
from seven to unbounded as from one to
unbounded so in the absence of empirical
evidence or conceptual justification and
normal scientific practice would lead us
to assume that there are no intermediate
stages that
actual truism seems problematic or even
outlandish to almost all researchers and
other curiosity they're accustomed to
think of evolution as a series of
gradual steps which certainly is not no
serious biologist can believe that but
it's a kind of what's sometimes called
pop Darwinism popular version of
Darwinism totally not evolutionary
theory but standardly believed even by
some scientists amazingly the truism is
all often condemned as catastrophism
based on vague ideas like mutation but
those objections are entirely without
merit they actually come from scientists
the catastrophism is a conceptual
necessity there's no way to go from
finite to infinite except by what's
called catastrophism can't go in small
steps and it's not in the least
inconsistent with evolutionary theory
within which of course mutation is a
core principle well design notice that
design considerations and evolutionary
considerations converge they yield the
same conclusion that language is
designed for computational efficiency
yielding a language of thought but it's
not very good for communication it's
inefficient for communication the
conclusion was expressed lucidly by
Nobel laureate Francois Jacob he
observed that the role of language as a
communication system between individuals
would have come about only secondarily
as linguists believe I think is
referring to me the quality of language
that makes it unique does not seem to be
so much its role in communicating
directives for action
or other features of animal
communication but rather its role in
symbolizing in evoking cognitive images
in molding our notion of reality and
yielding our capacity for thought and
planning through its unique property of
allowing infinite combinations of
symbols and therefore mental creation of
possible worlds those I think are
accurate ideas which actually traced
back to the 17th century cognitive
revolution and have been richly
elaborated in the past half century well
that seems surprising to a lot of people
virtually virtually everyone who works
in the field but it's pretty
straightforward and I assume sooner or
later will be understood to be pretty
close to truism well to summarize so far
plato's problem falls within those parts
of biology that at least we know how to
study and in some domains including
language there has been real progress in
recent years though de cartes problem
remains beyond reach there has been
considerable progress in finding about
there has been considerable progress in
at least discovering the mechanisms that
enter into the infinite use of the
finite means the problem that plays such
a central role in Cartesian thought and
yield some consequences that depart
quite sharply from common assumptions
like the ones I've mentioned well let me
turn finally to Orwell's problem
illustrations abound even giving
examples is misleading because they're
everywhere they're ubiquitous and they
give a good deal of insight into the
prevailing intellectual cultures and
it's not hard to identify the means that
have been developed by systems of power
to under to ensure that people will know
and understand little despite the wealth
of information available to them
well again I can only give scattered
illustrations and they're inevitably
misleading because they may appear to be
exceptional although they're in fact the
practices are ubiquitous so take just
one case a recent and illuminating one
the NATO bombing of Serbia it was the
subject of an inquiry by the prestigious
specialists in international law led by
the eminent South African jurist Richard
Goldstone the panel determined that the
bombing was in their phrase illegal but
legitimate the illegality was
transparent it was a flagrant violation
of the UN Charter foundation of modern
international law in fact it was an
example of what the Nuremberg Tribunal
determined to be the supreme
international crime differing from other
war crimes because it encompasses all
the evil that follows that was the crime
for which the Nazis were hanged at
Nuremberg and this is a protocol that
kind of a
a test example a standard example of
them and nevertheless the panel found
this work run to be legitimate because
as they put it there was no other way to
stop the killings and atrocities in
Kosovo it should be noted that this is a
standard interpretation in the West it's
a Western interpretation accepted almost
without exception in the West the
non-aligned countries which represent
the majority of the world bitterly
rejected it condemned the bombing and
what they called the so-called right of
humanitarian intervention on which it
was based they regarded it as just more
of the posturing of Western imperialism
with its civilizing missions and other
familiar affectations of benevolence and
more revealing than that is the question
of fact which is actually
uncontroversial in this case to reach
its conclusion that there was no other
way to stop the killings and atrocities
in Kosovo the panel had to reverse the
chronology and to reject the unanimous
conclusions of a mass of impeccable
Western studies including to detailed
state department reviews and reports of
NATO the OECD the Western monitors on
the ground and others the evidence
reveals unambiguously that the killings
and atrocities were overwhelmingly the
consequence of the bombing not the cause
and in fact its anticipated consequence
NATO the commanding general Wesley Clark
he informed the press as the bombing
began that atrocities on the ground were
predictable
he had already briefed the White House
with the same prediction actually the
facts are revealed as well and the
indictment of Milosevic which was issued
right in the midst of the bombing the
charges if you look are all post bombing
with one exception which we know men
absolutely nothing to the attackers
because at that very moment they were
supporting comparable atrocities carried
out by their allies in cases where the
past record was farm work or a test than
anything that had happened in the
Balkans and furthermore they continued
to support those atrocities well after
the bombing of Serbia ended well this is
only a fraction of the story what's
relevant here is that the fallacious
conclusion of the Goldstone panel is
almost universally accepted in Western
intellectual culture in complete
disregard of the unusually rich
documentary record that could hardly be
a clear illustration of Orwell's problem
and as history and familiarity with
cultural norms would suggest a rational
discussion of this matter is virtually
impossible in the West any mention of
these uncontroversial facts elicits
the most impressive Tantrums and that's
understandable the period before the
bombing was marked by one of the most
extraordinary episodes of self
glorification in intellectual history
can't think of anything like prominent
figures in the West lauded themselves
and their own States for acting on
principles and values for the first time
in history as the attackers led the
enlightened States to a new era of
history acting out of pure altruism in a
noble phase of their foreign policy with
a saintly glow and so on in a deluge
would have impressed Kim il-sung and
after that performance recognition of
the elementary facts of the matter would
be a psychological impossibility for the
educated classes and they have therefore
resorted to what comes naturally to them
familiar means of to protect themselves
from exposure and unwanted facts
slanders lies hysteria denunciation all
of them virtually unanswerable given the
near monopoly of control over expression
in this case it even includes the
dissident fringes in the mainstream
which had been in the lead if you look
back and trumpeting their own
magnificence and supporting the attack
now there's a great deal in print about
all this but it's irrelevant
it's far too inconsistent with doctrinal
orthodoxy and with self-protection to
enter awareness well the example is
perhaps unusual in its clarity but apart
from that it's pretty close to the norm
the mechanisms that are adopted to
implement Orwell's problem are also not
obscure I mean on the contrary they've
been described and frankly and with
approval by the leading practitioners
than the most respected ones well in
brief by World War one elite circles in
the West primarily England in the United
States the more free societies elite
circles were coming to understand that
popular struggles had achieved so much
success that the population could no
longer be easily controlled by force and
it was there it would therefore be
necessary to control attitudes and
beliefs among other devices a huge
industry was created to fulfill this
task it's called the public relations
industry and primarily a u.s.
secondarily British invention later
taken over elsewhere there's an early
industry
manual by one of its leading figures
Edward Bernays it opens by observing
that the conscious and intelligent
manipulation of the organized habits and
opinions of the masses is an important
element in democratic society but
clearly it is the intelligent minorities
which which need to make use of
propaganda continuously and
systematically because only they
understand the mental processes had the
social patterns of the masses and are
therefore in a position to pull the
wires which control the public mind
which they can regiment every bit as
much as an army regiments the bodies of
its soldiers this process of what he
called engineering consent is the very
essence of the democratic process
Bernays wrote that 20 years later when
he was being honored by the American
Psychological Association in 1949 for
the quite impressive achievements that
he had made Bernays was not on the right
wing he was a good rose
roosevelt liberal wilson roosevelt
kennedy liberal in fact he had honed his
skills in Woodrow Wilson's Committee on
Public Information the name should give
it away it's the first u.s. state
propaganda agency the committee was the
official component of a campaign in
which the most respected liberal
intellectuals undertook in their words
to serve as the faithful and helpful
interpreters of what seems to be one of
the greatest enterprises ever undertaken
by an American president they were
referring to Woodrow Wilson's decision
to enter the European war right after he
was elected on the promise of peace
without victory
not entering the war now so that was one
of the greatest enterprises ever
undertaken by a president and the
liberal intellectuals had to serve in
that cause unwittingly they were serving
as instruments of the British the
Ministry of Information which secretly
defined its task as to direct the
thoughts of most of the world but
particularly the thoughts of American
intellectuals the British recognized
that that would be necessary to bring
the United States into the war the
target the targets of British propaganda
namely the liberal American
intellectuals they were adopting good
will sown in doctrine Wilson's own view
was that an elite of gentlemen with
elevated ideals is necessary to preserve
stability and righteousness it's it's
the intelligent minority of responsible
men who must control decision-making
another veteran of the Committee on
Public Information explained and his
quite influential progressive essays on
democracy in the same years as they were
called
that's walter Lippmann as a leading
American public intellectual of the 20th
century also a Wilson Roosevelt liberal
this specialized class of public men is
responsible for the formation of a sound
public opinion quoting Lippmann as well
as for setting policy the public must be
put in its place its function in a
democracy is to be spectators of action
not participants it may act own it may
act but only by aligning itself as the
partisan of someone in a position to act
executive Li in periodic exercises
called elections that's the liberal end
of intellectual thought and the liberal
academic world agree
Harold Lasswell one of the founders of
modern political science also liberal
intellectual he explained that the
intelligent few must recognize the
ignorance and stupidity of the masses
who have to be controlled for their own
good well I've been sampling only from
the progressive end of the spectrum of
his become harsher as we move towards
the so-called conservative reactionary
end and others were impressed by the
success of these enterprises to control
the public mind Nazi propaganda for
example consciously based itself on
American commercial advertising with
unfortunate success as the Bolsheviks
tried to do so as well but much more
clumsily it was never particularly
successful the basic principles remain
they take various forms although of
course they're constantly denied with
rhetorical flights about dedication to
democracy well unlike the other two
problems Plato's and decart's Orwell's
problem is quite easily solved that the
intellectual level but the solution to
the problem explains why it remains with
little impact within the dominant
intellectual and moral culture that
leaves obvious tasks for those who do
not accept the guiding principles
