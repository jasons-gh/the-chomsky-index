praised work so John Kerry is like
Obama's spokesperson gave a very
important speech on on Israel Palestine
the most detailed Obama administration
speech yet on what should be done and it
was the usual stuff where we're in
neutral you know honest broker we try to
do everything wonderful and so on but if
he throw out the boilerplate he did say
something he said that all this time
Israel and us have been trying
desperately to find a legitimate
negotiating partner in the pail among
the Palestinians we've always failed but
now finally we may have a legitimate
negotiating partner and his reasons
we're interested his reasons were the
during the Gaza war there weren't any
protests in the West Bank and there
weren't any purpose because the US had
established an army they run by general
Keith Dayton which is analogous to the
Philippine Constabulary they had an army
which was able to quash any protests
that's ahead and actually that's the
soft part of the repressive forces
that's under State Department controls
of a little gentle there's also a
cia-run Force which apparently is much
harsher there anyway we've got good
repressive forces there they're able to
control the population keep them quiet
there's an elite as always you know we
go to Ramallah you know people are
living fine they get a ton of European
Union money coming in so on and so forth
so it's taking the shape of a
traditional neo-colonial system of the
kind that the United States in fact
innovated that was different from
European colonialism and it's been
applied in other countries under us
control heyhey Dominican Republic you
know Nicaragua a lot of massacre and
destruction but then left in the hands
of a National Guard you know Philippine
Constabulary and cooperative elite in
fact that's just what's going on before
you know so yes that's that's those are
innovations so we're somewhat different
from other Imperial countries also again
I stress that this is settler
colonialism the u.s. it's like Australia
you exterminate the natives Europe is
different violent Savage history may be
the most savage place in the world but
they didn't they didn't slower everybody
okay the in fact they sort of kept the
traditional institutions and part of the
reasons why you have mildly social
democratic structures in Europe is that
the modern Europe grew out of a feudal
society the United States didn't listen
blank slate and in feudal societies
everybody has a place might be a lousy
place but you have some place and that
kind of evolved into you know social
democratic systems beyond what we had so
sure we're different but not often not
very attractive ways ok the next
question here first of all
the question is despite the actual
motivations of the cultural imperialism
is there no actual credence to the claim
that President Obama made this week that
a rapid quad from Afghanistan Iraq pull
out of US troops from Afghanistan and we
can apply that to o Iraq and the 800 US
military bases around the world would
negatively affect us security the
picture is there any truth to the claim
of President Obama that a rapid pullout
from Afghanistan or other parts of the
world would adversely affect American
security here at home is there any truth
to that claim United States is the most
secure country in the world I mean if
you accept say John Lewis goddesses
principal expansion is the past the
security yeah we're not going to be
secured till we control every inch of
the world but if you buy any sensible
measure of security the United States is
unusually secured and has been for a
long time I mean the United States wins
every war for a good reason there are no
comparable enemies the United States
pretty much controls even if say Bolivia
isn't totally under control the u.s.
pretty much controls the hemisphere
controls both oceans controls the
opposite sides of both oceans
substantially yeah you can't totally
perfect there are things like terror but
there are ways to stop terror if you
care about it for the first one I'm
talking about our terror which
overwhelms everyone else's but the bad
terror you know that there are the bad
guys you can stop it there are ways to
do it to do it I mentioned a couple and
there are others near Rosen who's one of
you know really top flight journalist
along the best in the Middle East region
just recently was on democracy now you
might have seen him where he was asked
something like
what do we do in Afghanistan or
something he basically see really knows
the region will and he said if you want
to stop Muslims killing you stop killing
that
and then concretely say okay there's
something that Kashmir you know where
the Indian the terrorists are bad enough
the Indian Army has been monstrous so do
something about that there's something
with Palestine do something about the
other grievances they're real and then
you will undermine the kind of support
that that extreme elements rely on so
yeah they're things to do if you want to
increase security but if you want to
increase control which is very different
from securities are different things one
second man we are beginning to get
toward the end so I'm going to ask maybe
a couple of people to ask questions and
then because of chops he can respond to
them not just individually so go ahead
yours can you give us some insight into
why the u.s. ruling class chose to
support and to assure the election of
barack obama to the tune of 1 billion
dollars the most expensive campaign in
the history of this country and even
given us these Allison Allison
Wonderland political paradigms of a
post-racial America what are the broader
implications of his presidency for this
country both in terms of race relation
they attack the increase in tax attacks
against the working class in the
implications of whether or not we will
pull out of this depression
my question but it's really about what
are the implications of Obama's election
for race in America I see ok the next
decade one of us question also yes and
also as a teeth a language teacher I
just started teaching and language arts
at the very challenging district in New
York City and what John Lewis or
language teacher like me or you can help
students understanding the world more
easier or help the world I mean I'm the
fact that there's a black family in the
White House I think it's really
significant and no matter what do you
think about Obama and that's bound have
effects it's having multiple effects for
the black community it was kind of you
know it's a real lift look whatever
happens they may make out worse than
before but nevertheless it's some kind
of belief in its having a caer effect
and this is kind of like hard to be sure
like you may have heard Jimmy Carter
come recently claimed that the you know
almost hysterical hatred of Obama which
is you know beyond anything that I don't
know of historical analog through it
here he suggested willya has its roots
in race maybe I don't know how you
estimate that but I think that's
something effective as for the actual
impact of the policies on black people I
don't see any reason to think it's going
to be good there's
you just take a look at the policies
that are being pursued I mean Obama was
you know Obama is almost like a
caricature of one of the most persuasive
and well-supported theories about
American political life that I know
namely Thomas Ferguson's would equals
the investment theory of politics I says
let's take a look at invest at elections
as occasions on which groups of
investors coalesce to invest to control
the state we call that an election and
then the policy is he argues a pretty
well follow the groups of investors
needs them pretty impressive work on
this for over a century Obama is most
like a caricature and he was put into
office by the financial institutions who
much preferred him to McCain so the core
of the funding apparently came from
financial institutions you got it's
tricky estiva to look at bundling and
all kinds of things but that's what it
looks like and they're getting
everything they want you know I mean
bonuses bank profits you know they're
just exulting it's like a great victory
okay that's what you'd expect things
like no Afghan of the things are
languishing but um so kind of what you'd
expect I mean he he came in as a kind of
centrist Democrat in the Clinton model
and those are the policies some other
not as harsh as some say Reagan but Bush
but pretty much within the same spectrum
so the effects on on blacks are likely
to be pretty bad just as they were under
Clinton we can change that of course I
mean any president no matter who it is
reflected response to public opinion
that was true for example of Nixon who
many ways was the last liberal president
we've had but it did there was a
response to public opinion and there
were some pretty good policy
domestically so I don't think I don't
know how to predict it I mean it depends
just like a matter of will and
choice we have to change it and the
language teacher you are advised to her
well you know in language teaching
itself it's like any other kind of
teaching I mean you two ways to do it
basically I mean you do it like the
Marine Corps which is called No Child
Left Behind you train people to be
obedient submissive you know passed the
test forget everything you learned when
you pass the test we've open through
that and our own experience ensure you
know obedient passive students that's a
bipartisan program or you can try to
encourage kids natural creativity and
you know search for the kids are curious
they want to learn things learning
languages for children is extremely
ridiculously easy I mean it come it's
like a sponge you know in water just
comes so set up the conditions under
which it will come naturally and then of
course of that you can also be
encouraged their own creativity
exploring imaginative work writing
writing things and so on and so forth
but that's a matter of kind of like how
you deal with you know how you deal
sensitively with young people that
you're a parent or a teacher or anything
else but I don't think language teachers
are linguists or physicists or anyone
else has anything special to say about
kind of problems we're talking about I
mean you know each of us if if we're
kind of beats and human beings are not
just kind of like focused on some
professional problem can I prove this
theorem say but we're also human beings
they're concerned about the world okay
that's part of your life and you have to
decide what you're going to do with it
right here like lots of choices let me
just I think just to war here very
quickly pose a question and then we
press Chomsky lancer will have to end
a twelver Congress has passed the
Patriot Act and the animal enterprise
terrorism act and opponents of both I'd
say that the government attempting to
impress against their policies and
opinions against what the US
conservative group wants to do so I
wanted to ask again you said that were
in a better place now than in the 60s I
I mean people will say that because
these acts are being passed and we're
not allowed sometimes to speak out
against the United States we're in a
worse place so how would you respond
patriot act is unpleasant but in terms
of what people are live with all over
the world it's that kind of like a tea
party and in fact the repression in the
60s was far worse that take a look at
the record somebody mentioned Fred
Hampton before ok Fred Hampton was
assassinated Gestapo style assassination
set up by the FBI was part of a major
program COINTELPRO which was directed
first back went through four presidents
run by the national political police the
FBI I had attacked everybody it started
small and ended up attacking the black
movements the women's movement the
entire new left anything you thought of
and it was no joke it went on until the
mid 70s there's nothing like that now
and that was nothing like Wilson's Red
Scare I mean yeah we don't like it when
people are repressive but I mean the
kind of repression that we face is so
slight as compared with what people live
with all over the world that we really
don't have much of a right to talk about
I don't think we should object to it
there are things to protest for example
we should protest things like say
incarceration which is a very ugly
technique of control especially the u.s.
style and it's the only country that
targets children and this international
came out of the report a couple years
ago
investigating around the world children
who were in jail for life with no
possibility of parole remember the exact
numbers was something like 2,500 around
the world of whom may be 2,300 the
United States something roughly like
that I'm this included like 12 year old
kids who were present when a felony what
when a murder took place so they're in
jail for life no possibility of parole
it is just the numbers incarcerated or
out of sight I mean back around nineteen
eighty it was like the rest of the world
you know the industrial countries may be
a little high but through the Reagan
years and the Clinton years and on until
today is just shot out of sight a lot of
it is under drug war pretexts pretext i
stress and it's targeted primarily black
males also like women Hispanics doin
extend and if you think about the
history and eric and say this much
better than i can but if you look at
african-american history it's been one
of almost constant slavery I mean it was
literal slavery for much of the black
population up until Civil War there was
a period reconstruction ten years and
went right back to what it was pretty
much through criminalization I mean
black life was criminalized you know
he's standing on a street corner you
look the wrong way at a white woman
whatever you go to jail forever a large
part of the US Industrial Revolution was
based on what amounts to slave labor
criminalized blacks and of course
correct me if I'm wrong but my
impression is that the treatment of
blacks in the post Reconstruction period
was worse than slavery at least as far
as I can make out for good capitalist
reasons you know if you own a slave
that's capital you've got to kind of
keep it take care of it if you just pick
it up from that you know
the jail's where the state is doing the
work of criminalizing black life okay
who cares working the death and throw it
away and get the next month well there
was a pure that really went on to the
Second World War during the Second World
War there was a need for free labor then
comes a couple of decades of you know
when blacks could kind of work their way
into the skilled labor force you know
become an autoworker that kind of thing
and but it was over by the mid 70s by
the shift in the economic programs to
financialization of the economy and
undermining of productive capacity and
right after that comes the incarceration
which and I think if you look at it in
many ways is kind of structurally
similar to the post reconstruction you
know criminal criminalization and
slavery period so there's a whole
history you know I mean says no sketched
more complex obviously I don't you think
that's more or less well you're at the
time to get it like that big fun all
right the final question very briefly
please I would like to thank you first
for being here today second as a
Palestinian I appreciate it on you
spreading the truth about what's going
on now Israel might ask you a question
about the big new virginity zbigniew
brzezinski I'd like to ask you a
question by he was very influential in
Obama transition team I believed was an
adviser we know that he created the
Mujahideen to find in Afghanistan I was
wondering what if what were your views
on it in you know in 1998 Brzezinski
gave a famous interview in which he took
credit for firm it for creating the
Mujahideen ok we don't really have much
evidence that that ever happened I mean
he was national security adviser under
Carter and it's true that there was a
kind of a trickle of a
to jaha Dean but it really took off
under Reagan so I don't know if he was
boasting or if it's true he was taking
credit for overthrowing the Soviet Union
essentially in fact he was asked in that
errors though he was asked in that air
view was in France don't you think it's
kind of ugly to destroy Afghanistan by
supporting these radical Islamist
fanatics they said well you know if you
weigh in the light of history what's
more important the fate of Afghans are
overthrowing the Soviet Union basically
is answered whether it was true I don't
know I don't think we have much evidence
for it but he was on the quarter
transition to you and I should say that
on on the Obama transition team and you
know you know in the spectrum of policy
analysts he's one of the saner ones I
think and some a lot of way says makes
pretty good sense on the Middle East to
ya know like I'm sure he wouldn't like
me but a lot of its pretty rational not
just there for example on the
anti-missile systems in Europe which is
a big topic in itself he's the one
person up in the foreign policy a leader
I've seen who said straight out what the
truth is is just a non-functioning
technology against a non-existent threat
and that's quite true I mean even fear
act Iran had nuclear weapons and
missiles you know but we want that of
course but the chances that they would
use them are like miniscule the US
intelligence analysts say it's
undetectable I'm all they have to do is
load a missile the country gets
vaporized you know if they have them at
all it's for deterrence and that was
understandable with a possible
superpower octa dying two countries on
the borders Israel threatening to attack
them all the time so yeah maybe
no no no but at least he said it
sensibly he's also been one of the few
people whose talked openly about the
fact that you know we should go ahead
and sort of break our 35-year
opposition's of a diplomatic settlement
in Israel Palestine and joined the world
on this pretty original one well let us
all thanked
he wasn't on TV he was there speaking
directly to the military-industrial
complex he was there speaking directly
to the military who will carry out and
genocide on Carolyn darl'n quality of
the US government this giant empire that
knows that he cannot survive that he
cannot live without exploding and raping
and pillaging the resources development
in you to be in it
that spirit that we can truly bill and
anti-war movement got something of rise
to the political foes words right here
the climate becomes with the
demonization criminalisation of her a
Muslim people okay any score was
thank you for having me for tonight
there is a voice that is listening a
voice that long ago recognized the
criminalization of the poor or home the
criminalization of the poor and the
joblessness that forced them to join the
military so that they could be
something to rich get richer a voice is
missing that long ago understood the
imperialism and the racism at home as
well as a voice that understood through
her fight against racism against north
white people and included other
religious movement while ago understood
that the Muslim community was as much a
part of America as every other community
a voice that long ago understood
anti-immigrant feeling when she spoke at
a rally and said the only difference
between many of the people here and that
might early by relative my cruel father
is the saber white and you are not that
they were Christian and you were loosely
and this let's work on your oppression
actually a voice that long ago
understood freedom
the operation people
the same Jeanette all of us or none of
us a voice that understood inclusiveness
of people of like mind and a people who
support justice when we get it together
this Empire will fall so I say to own
rule in Stuart on the inside who said
never stop educating never stop
organizing and give the missing all of
us or none of them
you
