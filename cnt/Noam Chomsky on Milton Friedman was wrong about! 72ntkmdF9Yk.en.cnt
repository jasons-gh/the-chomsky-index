I think milton friedman's
interpretation of the success of market
systems is historically seriously wrong
and his faith in market systems to
achieve desirable ends I think is
grossly mistaken and I don't accept his
values either I don't think that the
ability to succeed in a system of the
competition is much of a value to be
admired so I think there are plenty of
differences both in I mean let's just
take take the first history so take the
United States richest Society and most
powerful society in the world
what was it how did it develop
economically well through massive state
intervention huge state intervention I
mean what economists sometimes talk
about is the high level of protectionism
which is true the United States was a
pioneer and protectionism in order to
develop first the textile industries the
beginnings of the beginnings of
Industrial Development then on through
steel and other industries had to
protect itself from superior British
technology and production I mean while
stealing technology from Britain and
others but that's the least of it that's
what economists talk about but that's
the periphery I mean the US economy was
built on vicious and murderous slave
labor these slave labor camps in the
south producing cotton that would have
impressed the Nazis and they were quite
efficient efficiency was in fact
increased productivity was increased
rapidly through the technology of a
bullwhip and a pistol just by torturing
people much more viciously and that's
the source that's a large part of the
source of the modern economy not just
cotton of course was you know fuel of
the
early industrial revolution but it's not
just cotton production cotton LED cotton
production which expanded over the world
based very heavily in slave labor camps
here was the basis for the development
of the merchant a lot of the merchant
class of early industrialization the
biggest industrialization anywhere where
the you know the textile mills Lowell
and Lancashire and so on developed the
the financial systems which we used to
finance it and arranger interactions it
became globalized that's an enormous
contribution to the economies developing
economy of the United States of Britain
of other European countries and so on
what's that got to do with markets I
mean that's just a violent intrusion and
market systems and that's only part of
it and what about clearing the continent
of its indigenous inhabitants it's a
pretty severe interference of the state
of course in human interactions and
social and economic systems they had an
economy in fact a pretty advanced
economy was destroyed they were
destroyed there's some margins left
somewhere at reservations and that's
just the beginning I'm not even talking
about the effect of imperial aggression
on developing the economy I mean the
idea that economies developed through
market systems is so grossly false that
you can hardly even talk about it
of course I talk about the United States
but the same is true of England before
it but basically the same methods and of
every other developed economy the
Germany of France France for example and
as it's estimated that about roughly 20%
of France's wealth
it comes from murders vicious slave
labor in one colony Haiti which transfer
truly destroyed and is still
contributing to destroying today they
participated in throwing up the elected
president a couple of years ago and that
generalizes around the world
there you can argue you know maybe right
or maybe wrong that markets are useful
for things like conveying information
that it's that that can be disconnected
from the assigning from a giving gain
and profit to those who are
participating in them if you come to the
present let's take a look at
contemporary markets forget the history
so on the eve of the last recession for
which the financial institutions were
largely responsible their share of
corporate profits in the United States
was about 40 percent so they're a huge
part of the economy where do they get
their profit from well I think there was
an IMF study a couple of about a year or
so ago which tried to estimate the
source of the profits of the six biggest
American banks JP Morgan Chase Citigroup
and so on it concluded that the profits
come almost entirely from a public
subsidy an implicit public subsidy it's
called too big to fail and formally
which is an implicit government
guarantee that we're not going to let
you fail that gives them of course the
credit rating agencies know this very
well they get higher credit ratings they
get access to cheap money they get
incentives to carry out risky
transactions which can be quite
profitable because they're going to be
bailed out if they collapse all of this
amounts to a huge subsidy the business
press estimated it over 80 billion
dollars a year
there are various debates among
economists as to what it is but it's
huge that's the beginning what about
energy industries a huge part of the
economy the IMF just came out with
another study or recently which
estimated that worldwide of course
concentrated in the rich countries the
subsidy from the public called
government subsidy meaning from the
public amounts to maybe five trillion
dollars a year
this is a market system
