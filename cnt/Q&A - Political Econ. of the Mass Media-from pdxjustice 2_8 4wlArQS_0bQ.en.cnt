simply the matter a matter of selecting
purely symbolic figures then you would
have gone a long way towards
marginalizing the public and that pretty
well happened in the last eight years
you know you had somebody who probably
didn't know what the policies work his
job was to read the lines rich written
for him by the rich folk what he's been
doing for the last 30 or 40 years and he
seems to enjoy it and he gets well paid
for it and everybody seems happy but to
vote for Ronald Reagan is like voting
for the Queen of England and that's an
advance
I don't really mean this as a joke I
think that's an advance you know it's
progress in marginalizing the public
part of marginalizing the public is
taking the formal mechanisms of
participation which exist and ensuring
that they don't lead to a crisis
democracy by being substantive and what
better method can you think of than
simply reducing them to the selection of
symbolic figures I think that happened I
think the press is covered it though
they doubtless know it but as for George
Bush I think you got to return to you
know to a sort of more normal situation
I don't have any reason to believe that
there's any hands-off policy if there
will be the same kind of resort to
covered activities that there's been in
the past when does the government resort
the covered activities well typically
when the domestic enemy doesn't allow it
to carry out the activities in public
that's when a government resorts to
clandestine activities clandestine
activities are difficult complex
expensive they carry the danger of being
exposed it's much easier and more
efficient to carry out violent
activities overtly and a government
typically our government in particular
when it resorts the clandestine
activities it's usually because it's
afraid of the public those activities
are not much of a secret from anybody
else there's certainly not a secret from
the victims they're not a secret from
other from the various mercenary states
that we have involved in it like the
whole stuff and iran-contra hearings
that wasn't a secret to Nicaragua wasn't
a secret the Israel it wasn't a secret
to Taiwan or Saudi Arabia Brunei nobody
wasn't secret to anybody out there it
wasn't a secret to the whole array of
shady business men who were in it to
make a buck like Richard C chord word
hack him and so on fact of the matter is
it wasn't even a secret to Congress in
the media as I said they knew about the
Contra flights they just weren't
reporting it they also knew about the
arms sales to Iran through Israel and
they weren't reporting it they couldn't
suppress any of that any longer after a
plane was shot down with an American
mercenary and after the Iranian
government
revealed the fact that the National
Security Advisor was wandering around
pair on getting out Bibles and chocolate
cakes at that point you couldn't
suppress it any longer so it became
public and then comes a cover-up
operation but the point is it wasn't
really secret to anybody much and I
think you can easily document that I
mean I was for example writing about it
from public sources throughout this
whole period but the point is you can
keep it secret from the public it was a
low enough level so you can keep it
secret from the public and that means
the domestic enemy didn't get to
outraged over it remember that you've
got a control enemy territory and that's
what covered operations are for if the
government happens to be committed to
activities to violent or terroristic or
subversive or other activities that the
domestic public the domestic enemy will
not tolerate it'll move to covered
actions that's what they're for and
there's no reason to believe that the
bush administration will be any
different from others in this respect
especially you know in fact less reason
after all what's bushes background
dr. Chomsky you statement and the reason
it's urgent interview odd regarding the
feminist movement that has had been the
most importantly actual effects at our
social life cultural patterns he quoted
accurately it's been a lasting important
than the impact on everything why is it
that not only the left has trouble with
you know in some ways working with the
feminist movement but perhaps tolerates
to what I feel is an unacceptable degree
anti-feminist individuals and
perspectives within its mix that's one
question and the second place could you
be more specific about what you had in
mind well uh I I don't know it that's a
tough thing because I'd rather not okay
but another one I'd like to throw out
for you is that you are a world-class
linguist and I'm wondering how this kind
of blends in or interfaces with your
political work yeah well I mean the
actually the issues of feminism other
the context of that remark was my
expression if I recall correctly was my
was an answer to a question of what
happened to the movements of the 60s and
there is a propaganda story about this
the story is that the movements of the
60s had all this idealism and so on and
so forth and all faded and after that
anybody everybody's just interested in
themselves and all disappeared and i
think that's nonsense I think that's
propaganda and it's in fact an attempt
to make people feel that they ought to
give up but the fact of the matter if
you look objectively at least as I look
it seems to me that the movements of the
60s just expanded in grew in the 1970s
and expanded and grew even more in the
80s and they now reach into much wider
areas of the society than any ever
before groups like this for example
would not have been around and certainly
wouldn't have listened to a talk like
this 20 years ago but now they do all
over the country and not just in
universities also in small towns and
churches and so on and so forth I think
the movements just expanded that's why
the Reagan administration was forced
into clandestine activities in fact
enemy territory with
out of control but as for the femme the
reason I mentioned the feminist movement
specifically is because that's a product
of the 70s and in my view as ice as you
quoted accurate I think in terms of its
overall impact it's probably the one
that had the greatest impact on cultural
patterns and relations and structures of
authority and so on and so forth of any
of any of them and that's the 70s in
Haiti now to get back your point about
the left a large part of the origins of
the contemporary feminist movement were
in the left and they were in reaction to
the sexism inside the left that was a
big issue in the late 60s you know big
issue in a very emotional and
complicated issue and that was one of
the roots of the modern feminist
movement of course feminist movements go
way back and it could be that the left
still tolerates sexism and sexist
individuals I'm sure it does I if to the
extent that it does that's just
something to be overcome not just on the
Left everywhere else as well I don't see
it anything special to do with the left
hi my name is Nancy and I work with the
international socialist organization and
I just want to start by saying I like
I'm sure many many many other people who
are here tonight are deeply indebted to
your work it's been absolutely essential
in helping us cut through the kind of
garbage that we're faced with every day
when we try to figure out what's going
on in the world but I think if I could
continue I think there is also a problem
in the analysis that I've seen in your
works and that you presented tonight in
the sense that I think we can tend to
lose the forest for the trees that you
present so many you know astonishing
details about what is wrong with the
system and about what is wrong with the
media that we can tend to lose sight of
what I think the really key question is
which is why is this control necessary
in the first place and I would submit at
least that I think it's because there's
antagonism I got a minute and a half I
swear to god it's no longer it's because
there's antagonistic interests involved
they didn't talk about milk maids and
dairy went ugh whatever it was dairy
maids and spinsters and Labor's in the
17th century for no reason it was
because they were to work in class and
what we see today in this country i
think is quite frankly let's speak
bluntly a ruling class which tries to
control a working-class population and
that's what it's about is holding on to
that power if that's the case then it
seems like to me the question that we
face is how to organize to change that
system to challenge capitalism and I
think in that effort you do a disservice
to your listeners and to the people who
respect your work when you equate Lenin
with Stalinism as lightly as you did
tonight I say that and I think it's also
important to point out that that is an
unquestioning and also an easy applause
Gator we saw that you share with the
mainstream media and I think if it were
actually that simple the coat the
horrific kinds of measures that even
bushwa historians described as a
counter-revolution under Stalin would
not have been necessary if they were all
the same to begin with now in short to
sum up the situation that you have
outlined tonight I think is extremely
serious and I think it's important that
we all take it seriously what we're
talking about is literally the fate of
millions of lives around the world
particularly in the international
politics that you described that being
the case then I think we need a full and
a serious and a fair discussion of
various different alternatives not just
talking about the horrors of capitalism
but actually how to change it to end
this stuff once and for all well I think
you made okay
I think well there's several questions
there one is about the discussion of the
united states and i think what i said is
approximately what you said except i
didn't use some of that rhetoric the I
you know which I don't particularly
helpful to pay the truth either
analytically or to understand or
whatever but it's the same picture John
Jay had it straight the people who own
the country on a government and the
people who on
