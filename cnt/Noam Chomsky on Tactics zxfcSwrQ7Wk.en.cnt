the BDS movement and ok some of you
aren't turned in as the boycott
divestment sanctions movement about
Israel okay there is a story that
circulates which is what you repeated
that I'm opposed to it and that's kind
of understand that's an interesting it's
interesting fact about the popular
movements we kind of live in a Twitter
generation where anything that goes
beyond 180 characters it doesn't exist
and can't the understood but literally
actually I was involved in the BDS
movement before I even crystallized ten
years ago about five minutes before it
started I extremely important I've
always supported it I always advocated I
still do but NE tak it's a tactic it's
not a principal and if you're serious
about choice of tactics you ask a couple
of questions the one question you ask is
what's the effect on the victims it's
not the only question but you certainly
have to ask at least that well in some
cases the choice of tactics is helpful
to the victims for example if the EU
which is a major importer of goods from
the settlements if the EU were to stop
importing goods from these early
settlements which are illegal
uncontroversial II if it enhance
participating an illegal act they would
do that be good for the victims
similarly if they would follow the
advice of Amnesty International and
declare an arms embargo in Israel that'd
be good for the victims even more so for
the United States so these are fine
tactics on the other hand suppose that
you say I'm going to boycott Tel Aviv
University well there's an obvious
response that's going to come to that
have lunch boycott Harvard Harvard it a
much worse record than Tel Aviv
University and that's going to be the
immediate response and it's unanswerable
you know it's basically correct and the
effect is that you're giving a gift to
hardliners that's harmful to the victims
you don't pick your tactics in such a
way that it's going to
be a gift to the most hardline advocates
of repression and violence that should
be automatic and you know these are
debates that go on and activist
movements all the time let's go back to
say the 1960s in mostly aren't enough
old enough to remember but some of you
are in the united states in the activist
movements in the United States in the
late 60s there were groups like the
famous weather men who decided that the
way to express their opposition to the
war was to go out and break windows and
beat people up and so on and so forth
the Vietnamese were very strongly
opposed to that what they advised all
the time is to carry out nonviolent
tactics in fact what they favored and
they said so with things like you know
women standing quietly in front of the
graves of American soldiers that's what
they wanted now those are tactics that
help but they don't make you feel good
it makes you feel good apparently if you
can go out and break windows of banks
but as far as the victims are concerned
that's just harmful all it does is build
up support for the war which is exactly
what it did so and those questions our
eyes constantly you have to distinguish
feel good tactics from do good tactics
if you can make that distinction don't
even pretend to be involved in
solidarity movements I mean that's kind
of the minimum you know then come other
questions and I think those questions
arise in the BDS movement to unless if
you you know they're kind of suppressed
in a slogan based system in which you
have a catechism and you repeat it but
if you think about the matter those
questions are always going to arise
anywhere whatever tactical choice is
used
you could have debates about what the
consequences are but at least you have
to recognize that those issues arise and
I think that's critical in this case
