like I'm sure many many many other
people who are here tonight are deeply
indebted to your work it's been
absolutely essential in helping us cut
through the kind of garbage that we're
faced with every day when we try to
figure out what's going on in the world
what I think continue I think there is
also a problem in the analysis that I've
seen in your works and that you
presented tonight in the sense that I
think we can tend to lose the forest for
the trees that you present so many you
know astonishing details about what is
wrong with this system and about what is
wrong with the media that we can tend to
lose sight of what I think the really
key question is which is why is this
control necessary in the first place and
I would submit at least that I think
it's because there's antagonism I got a
minute and a half I swear to god it's no
longer it's because there's antagonistic
interest involved they didn't talk about
milkmaids and dairy wood whatever it was
dairymaids and spinsters and labors in
the 17th century for no reason it was
because they were a working class and
what we see today in this country I
think it's quite frankly let's speak
bluntly a ruling class which tries to
control a working class population and
that's what it's about is holding on to
that power if that's the case then it
seems like to me the question that we
face is how to organize to change that
system to challenge capitalism and I
think in that effort you do a disservice
to your listeners and to the people who
respect your work when you equate Lenin
with Stalinism as blithely as you did
tonight I say that and I think it's also
important to point out that that is an
unquestioned assumptions and also an
easy applause getter we saw that you
share with the mainstream media and I
think if it were actually that simple
the couple the horrific kinds of
measures that even bushwa historians
describe as a counter-revolution under
Stalin would not have been necessary if
they were all the same to begin with now
in short to sum up the situation that
you have outlined tonight I think is
extremely serious and I think it's
important that we all take it seriously
what we're talking about is literally
the fate of millions of lives around the
world particularly in the international
politics that you describe that being
the case then I think we need a full and
a serious and a fair discussion of
various different alternatives not just
talking about the horrors of capitalism
but actually how to change it to end
this stuff once and for all
well I think you made it okay
I think well there's several questions
there one is about the discussion of the
United States and I think what I said is
approximately what you said except I
didn't use some of that rhetoric the I
you know which I don't particularly
helpful to pay the truth either
analytically or to understand or
whatever but it's the same picture John
Jay had it straight the people who own
the country or a government and the
people who own the country have
basically now are a network of
corporations and conglomerates and banks
and so on they ought to govern it and
the way they do it is by the methods
we've described now as far as the Soviet
Union is concerned I didn't happen to
talk about it tonight but I've written
about this topic I haven't just made the
charge I've written about it and
explained why I think it's true
and it doesn't bother me if I happen to
agree with the mainstream media on this
Trotsky to pick somebody who you
remember once he was charged in the
1930s with agreeing with the fascists in
his condemnation of the Soviet Union and
he pointed out that his critique was to
be true didn't wasn't gonna abandon it
if somebody else had to sit up and say
it for different reasons so the question
is about the Soviet Union and
particularly about Lenin so what was
Leninism well and my here we have to
look at the facts now you know you look
at the fact I think here's which fine
Lenin was a right wing deviation of the
socialist movement and he was so
regarded he was regarded as that by the
Marxist by the mainstream Marxist we've
forgotten who the mainstream Marxist
were because they lost and you only
remember the guys who won but if you go
back to the to that period the
mainstream Marxist were people like for
example Anton punycode who was head of
education for the for the Marxist
movement and a serious he's the one one
of the people who Lenin later denounced
as an infantile leftist but he was one
of the leading intellectuals of the
actual Marxist movement rosa luxemburg
was another mainstream Marxist and there
were others and they were very critical
in fact Trotsky was one up until 1917
they were all very critical of Leninism
because of this what they regarded as
this
to Mystic Vanguard ISM the idea that the
radical intelligentsia were going to
exploit popular movements to seize state
power and then to use that state power
to whip the population into the society
that they chose now that was quite
inconsistent with Marxism as understood
by the mainstream sort of I'd say left
Marxists from this point of view
Bolshevism was a right-wing deviation
Trotsky made the same points up till
1970 now when Lenin came back to Russia
in April 1917 he took a different line
quite a different line than the one he'd
had in the past there you take a look at
Lenin's work it shifted character in
April 17 in April 1917 it became kind of
libertarian that's when he came out with
the April theses and that's when he
wrote state and democracy came out it
came out of here later but that's when
it was written and these were a state
and revolution these these were
basically libertarian works they were
very much more in the main in the
mainstream of sort of less a libertarian
socialism from sort of you know this
range that goes from anarchism over the
left Marxism of the panic of closer look
Sandburg variety any talk to that
Soviets in the need for you know a
workers organization and so on in fact
came really closer to what the essence
of socialism was always understood to be
after all the core of socialism was
understood to be workers control over
production that was the core that's
where you begin with then you go on to
other things but the beginning is
controlled by the workers over
production that's where it begins
then Lenin took power in October 1917
and what's called a revolution but in my
view ought to be called a coup and the
then the and things followed that coup
or revolution if you want to call it
that one of the things that followed it
was the immediate moves to destroy the
Soviets and the factory councils those
were some of the first moves of Lenin
and Trotsky after they took the Trotsky
joined at that point after they took
state power in fact if you look at what
Lenin wrote after that period or did
you'll find it's a reversion to the
earlier position
this sort of left deviation is that a
deviation you could ask why in my view
it was just opportunistic he knew that
in order to gain power he was going to
have to go along with the popular
currents that were developing which were
in fact spontaneous and libertarian and
socialist as most popular movements are
have been in fact since the 17th century
and being an astute politician which he
was he sort of went along with that and
talked the line that the people wanted
to hear it's just like when an American
politician goes somewhere and his
pollsters tell him say so-and-so and he
says it believes and letting Lenin was
doing the same thing with that polls in
any event whatever your interpretation
is when he took power he reverted to the
former Vanguard ISM and moved at once to
eliminate the organs of workers control
now that meant he was moving to destroy
socialism if socialism has as its core
workers control over production the
soviets and factory councils were
instruments of workers control and same
you could say they're defective
instruments this may be worked out
better and so on yeah yeah but they were
the instruments that had been developed
in the course of popular struggle for to
implement basically workers control and
those were the first things to go by
early 1918 this is now it's it's still
really before the Civil War sit in
Lenin's view was pretty clearly
expressed it was the view that both he
and Trotsky took the position that what
you need is with what Trotsky called the
labor army which is submissive to the
control of a single leader he said
modern you know progress and development
and socialism requires that the mass of
the population subordinate themselves to
a single leader in a disciplined
workforce well that has absolutely
nothing to do with socialism in fact the
exact opposite of it and was criticized
for that by the in a sense in a spirit
of some solidarity because you know the
revolutionary forces were still
operative it was credit he was
criticized for that by people like Rosa
Luxemburg and by Pannekoek and gore her
and the other mainstream sort of left
Marxists and that and I think they were
right it seems to me that
and then it just goes on from there I
mean Lenin reconstructed these are
systems of oppression often more
efficiently check KGB and other
techniques of control and oppression I
think from that point on there was
nothing remotely like socialism in the
Soviet Union I think it was in fact MIT
was a precursor of later forms of death
all terian ISM now you know you could
that's what I think happened and I think
that's what you discover if you look at
the facts now why is it called socialism
well I think there I think that's
complicated we should look at it this to
the Soviet Union calls it socialism and
you know after they took control of the
they did take control pretty soon of
most of the international socialist
movement because primarily the prestige
of having created something sort of
socialism instantly just aside remarked
Lenin remained despite at all as sort of
an orthodox Marxist in many respects and
as an orthodox Marxist he didn't believe
that it was possible to have socialism
in the Soviet Union this was supposed to
be up to his death or you know shortly
before his death when he was still
writing you know speaking lucidly he
took kept the view that the Soviet
revolution was a holding action they
were just kind of hold things in place
until the real revolution took place in
Germany because the revolution according
to Marxist doctrine was going to take
place in the most advanced sector of
modern capital industrial capitalism you
know for all the reasons that you read
about in Marx that's where the
revolution had to take place obviously
that wasn't the Soviet Union so they
couldn't be socialism there it was just
some kind of holding action and that
presumably gave some sort of
justification for eliminating the
socialist institutions I don't think
it's a real justification but probably
that was the internal justification and
again in taking that you he was in
accord with the mainstream Marxist
tradition well after that that comes the
view that all of this is socialism and
why should the communist parties take
that view I think the reason is because
they wanted to sort of exploit the moral
force
which was quite real you know it's kind
of hard to remember that today but at
that time it was very real this was
regarded as a you know as prot as a
progressive moral force and by
associating their own destruction of
socialism with the aura of socialism
they hope to gain credit in the working
classes and other progressive sectors
now the West also identified that with
socialism and they did it for the
opposite reason they wanted to associate
socialism with the brutality of the
Russian state that undermined socialism
so what you had is that the two major
world propaganda agencies for their own
and quite different reasons were
claiming that this is socialism that
this destruction of socialism is
socialism now it's very hard to break
out of the control of the world's two
major propaganda agencies when they
agree they agreed for different reasons
but they basically agreed and that then
became doctor and dogma well I think
people should ask whether that's true
take a look back and see whether the
moves that Lenin took and the Trotsky
supported him in taking and that they
both advocated had anything to do with
socialism as it was understood by the
say in the Marxist tradition or in the
left libertarian tradition and I think
the answer that you'll discover when you
look at that is that they didn't in fact
this was a destruction of socialist
institutions well you know this may be
true or it may be false but if it's true
and I think the evidence pretty strongly
supports it then I don't see any reason
why we shouldn't Express that fact and I
certainly don't think that we should be
deterred in expressing this fact if
other people who's you know on fascists
whatever happened to condemn the Soviet
Union just for the same reasons that
Trotsky mentioned in the 1930s
