people who are called intellectuals are
a very curious class if you think about
them so take where I teach MIT if
there's a Nobel laureate in physics
who's working 70 hours a week in his
laboratory on problems of advanced
physics that we don't call them an
intellectual if the janitor who cleans
his room happens to have a great deal of
knowledge about world affairs and a good
deal of insight into human life and
understanding that maybe more so than
the people who write books that we don't
call him an intellectual the
intellectuals are people who have a
certain degree of privileged enough to
be able to reach audiences and who
discuss issues of general public
interest so yes they have given the
privilege and the opportunities they of
course have greater responsibilities
privilege confers responsibility in fact
if you look at the history of
intellectuals it's not a pretty one
overwhelmingly intellectuals have
labored in the service of power - the
term intellectual entered modern Western
usage with the Dreyfus Orcs and nowadays
we respect and honor the Dreyfus Arts
the defenders of Dreyfus critics of the
French state
it certainly wasn't true at the time
they were bitterly condemned the leading
most prominent intellectuals that
announced them berated them for daring
to criticize state power and the holy
army and what right did these writers
painters and so on have to talk about
things they knew nothing about the
respected intellectuals the Immortals of
the
my phone says dinner were bitterly
hostile to the Dreyfuss ours
in fact emile zola the leading one had
to flee France that's typically the
pattern and it goes back in history as
far as you like I mean back to the
earliest recorded history there were
people who are approximately what we
would call intellectuals today so in
classical Greece one of them was forced
to drink the hemlock because he was
corrupting the youth of Athens by asking
embarrassing questions and challenging
doctrine and dogma around the same time
in the biblical record there were that
people who were basically intellectuals
they're called prophets but that's just
a bad translation of a pretty obscure
Hebrew word there were people who
criticized the crimes of the king called
for mercy and compassion for the poor
and deprived presented geopolitical
analysis warned of the threats that the
evil Kings were bringing to the people
so that's intellectuals that what
happened to them they were in prisons
they were driven into the desert they
were condemned their later centuries
later they were honored not at the time
there were people in Taleggio were
honored the flatterers of the court
centuries later they were called false
prophets that's pretty much the pattern
so for example in the West check
in/check dissidents were honored and not
at home not by the ruling authorities
and conversely intellectuals in the
American domains were but not only not
on earth they were murdered straight out
so for example in a week after the fall
of the Berlin Wall the in the country
that was the leading recipient of US
military aid
aside from Israel in Egypt that separate
category and had the worst human rights
record that's a standard correlation el
salvador the high command which is in
close contact with the american embassy
ordered a battalion of troops to invade
the university and murder six leading
Latin American intellectuals Jesuit
priests blow the brains out and killed
any witnesses who happened to be around
so they also killed their housekeeper
and daughter I doubt if any of you could
know their names even but if anything
like that has happened in Czechoslovakia
say you know probably had a nuclear war
certainly have bullying headlines about
it and you'd know their names but that's
the difference your own crimes you
ignore the crimes of your enemies you
love and you admire and you praise the
prisons to the skies that's the pattern
right through history intellectuals
don't have to do that as the fringe of
dissonance illustrates but that's
typically what they do but apart from
that they have what they can do is what
anyone else can do and more given the
relative privilege there
