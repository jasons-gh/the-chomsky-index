well the other there has been the Occupy
movement oh they said and then talk in
fact is quite unprecedented yeah thank
you
anything analogous to it but these are
quite unprecedented times we are now in
the young thirtieth year of a very sharp
change in American history you take a
look at American history since the
beginning I mean there were various ups
and downs and wasn't very pretty in a
lot of ways but there was a rather
steady tendency towards growth
development industrialization a sense of
hope for the future it was true even in
really dark times I've been I'm old
enough to remember the Depression my
family were mostly working-class mostly
unemployed and objective it was a lot
worse than it is now on the subject it
was different there was a sense of both
CIO was recognizing they were sit-down
strikes the WPA was giving occupations
was worker education my unemployed
relative some of them never got past
fourth grade and going to Shakespeare
plays we had a high culture the Union my
aunt's Teamsters it's on
so they was this was the world was a
life yeah the community became the
country there's something to do there
was a sense that we're in it together
we're going to get out of it that's just
not true now I'm sure the last 30 years
this one started in seventies there was
a sharp change in the economy conscious
change towards the industrialization of
the country
I mean industrial production continues
Apple computers still continue as bit at
Foxconn right so when you buy an Apple
computer you're buying something where
the parts the components the lot of
development comes from Japan South Korea
the title mod and it's assembled in
China it was very little value about it
and any other horrendous working
conditions and then you buy it here and
the profits go back it's the same across
the industrial system so by now you know
in manufacturing a real unemployment is
about the level of depression but with a
big difference in the late 30s you had a
sense that this might come back we're
going to get it back you know we can do
it and that would be the sense of my
working people with some justification
is that less policy changes sharply
you're not going to get it yet so
there's the general sense of
in that country sort of Lisi it seems
through an attitude towards institutions
like in Congress as well disappear
impatient that the things true just
about every other institution there's
that and its objective I mean for the
roughly thirty years real incomes have
barely grown for most pretty much
stagnated for most of our population for
a tiny sector my so small it's not
picked up in the census there has just
been spectacular will it's actually
about a tenth of one percent that's and
that reflects the other major change in
the economy along the industrialization
of consciousness position came
financialization so investors can make
more money playing ridiculous games with
second entry and the financial sector
grew enormous divided by 2007 before the
last crash it was about forty percent of
corporate profits
do anything for the economy forms but it
does create an enormous
highly-concentrated will also drew us
plenty of thing I want away from other
things so tape saved my own University
MIT Science University is a great math
department but a large part of the math
department is now devoted to financial
mathematics which is just a waste under
behind any contact with movers no
trigger and that's not only harming
society but it's also a drawing away
talent that could be used for you know
developing advanced engineering and
production for the things that people
need I'm a society's not gonna survive
if it doesn't produce things people
inertia for a long time but it's the
self-inflicted decline after the
population you've got this tremendous
gap between stagnation there's lack of
hope for the future and fantastic wealth
and I remember a couple of weeks ago
there was front-page story in front page
of the New York Times had two stories
poverty right next to the story in
luxury stores they're raising prices
because it doesn't matter how much you
raise the prices people gonna buy it
anyway so and that's the country well
out of this the Occupy movement is
actually the first organized large-scale
protests directed to the whole set of
problems
the Wisconsin was very important but
that was specific it was due to the
efforts of the governor to try to
destroy the last remnants of
working-class organization it was very
impressive mobilization against that but
the Occupy movement is it's kind of
across the board let's go after a whole
range of issues that's destroying the
society and in that respect that's very
hopeful and kind of inspiring that
people who were involved in putting
himself in the line a lot of fun to
sleep in after day they've also
developed communities there's a sense of
solidarity that's been forgiven ours and
that was always the core of the labor
group solidarity one just a slogan
you're working to get an over part of
society and that's being rebuilt within
these movements and it's it
it's quite significant I think they're
setting up kind of bonds associations
learn how to do things together
community kitchens health centers
libraries and well that's the positive
side the power never says good luck yeah
thanks speculating it's going like that
and it's kind of we happen to have you
look at US history it's a it's different
than European countries for a lot of
reasons but it has a highly class
conscious business community always
fighting a bitter class were very
conscious about it you read the business
literature it reads like the rib mouse
where the book with the values you know
fight the everlasting battle in the
minds of men and overcome the
organization of masses which is a threat
to and in fact seventies the shift in
seventies came from organized efforts to
respond to the dangerous of
democratizing tendencies of the 1960s I
was pretty explicit but anyway its
explicit plan and now the this movement
is developing the backlash is of course
developing
with it there's gonna be better leaders
you don't win things quickly it takes a
long time it's a civil rights movement
you know it didn't begin when Martin
Luther King made his speech that start
in the thirties about a long struggle
early 1916 kids at lunch counters
Freedom Riders finally a big movement
developed but it's interesting to learn
a lot about the United States by seeing
what happened to it as long as Martin
Luther King was talking about racist
Alabama sheriff's it was supposed to be
had shifted to classes yes it was killed
off when you listen to the speeches on
Martin Luther King Day about breeding
voters typically ends which I have a
dream not with organizing of where
people's were where I'm going to Memphis
for a sanitation story it's a subpoena
and and that reflects the you know the
deep-seated idea of a lead of ideology
that the only thing that matters
rich the powerful and the rest are sort
of the way
luckily the population thinks about it
it's the way power sees himself it's the
media so their guess is this going to be
a long hard struggle you can't just sit
before there was a bowl that was just
reported today saying that about half
the population doesn't understand with
the Occupy movements
