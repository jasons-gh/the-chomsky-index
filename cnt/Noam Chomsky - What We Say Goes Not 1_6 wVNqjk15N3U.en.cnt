hmm good evening and welcome to the
global education center I'm Ellen O'Hara
Slavic a professor of art at UNC I will
briefly introduce my exhibition and
Kevin hewison who will then introduce
Noam Chomsky after my lecture you're
invited to visit the show aftermath that
consists of two projects protesting
cartography a series of drawings of
places the United States has bombed and
Hiroshima after aftermath both projects
up wait sorry a photographic project
about exposure radiation the a-bomb and
survival both projects were made in
protest of war with the intent to
inspire people to rethink war and to
acknowledge the continuing aftermath of
it
as Howard Zinn writes in his foreword to
my book bomb after bomb a violent
cartography when you bomb a country
ruled by a tyrant you kill the victims
of the tyrant war and the bombing that
accompanies war are the ultimate
terrorism for governments can command
means of destruction on a far greater
scale than any terrorist group these
considerations lead me to conclude that
if we care about human life about
justice about the equal right of all
children to exist we must in defiance of
whatever we are told by those in
authority pledge ourselves to oppose all
wars I would like to thank the Center
for Global Education the Carolina Asia
center Stephanie Nelson Laura Greist and
everyone that helped with the show I
would especially like to thank Kevin

wrongs to set the historical record
straight to speak truth to power but i
will let Kevin he wasn't introduced Noam

this case it's absolutely true everyone

I just I just want to say a very few
things first of all I want to thank all

Chomsky is Institute professor emeritus
in the Department of linguistics and
philosophy at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and as you all
know he's the author of numerous books I

his first five publications listed
gnomes going to speak for about 30
minutes on the topic what we say goes
not after that he'll take questions will
fill questions from the audience for
about another half hour and then you'll
be invited to join us for a reception
outside so please join me in welcoming
one of our greatest scholars Noam
Chomsky
you
well the phrase what we say goes of you
guessed is not mine it's a quote from
President Bush number one george HW bush
that was his pronouncement in February
1991 he was celebrating the glorious
victory in Iraq erect was virtually
destroyed by US bombing and it was maybe
even a more glorious victory than
Reagan's when he was you may recall
standing tall after having sent six
thousand US Special Forces to Grenada
where they overcame the resistance of 40
Cuban paramilitaries and got eight
thousand medals of Honor for their
service that was the Nutmeg capital of
the world this was even grander you know
there was actually a sort of an army
though not much of one I'll come back to
the details but it was a moment of in
general was a moment of euphoria this
was not long after the fall of the
Berlin Wall it looked like looked as
though we might the pronouncement might
actually be true what we say goes and
the world better know it if they don't
understand it just take a look at the
wreckage of Iraq after a couple of
months what happened right after the
fall of the wall is quite interesting
should be studied more carefully than it
is one of the things that happened had
to do with NATO as you all know NATO was
sold to the west on the United States on
the grounds that it was necessary to
defend the west from Russian hordes
Europe in the United States well the
Russian words were gone so people who
were naive enough to believe propaganda
and doctrine would have
that NATO would go with it quite the
contrary they expanded in an interesting
way there was a very good scholarship on
this so the details are known Gorbachev
Gorbachev proposed a security system for
Europe general security system including
Russian and he agreed to allow Germany
to be unified under and unincorporated
in NATO which is quite a concession just
on security grounds Germany alone had
practically destroyed Russia twice in
the century and now to allow it to join
a hostile military alliance led by the
global superpower that's a significant
concession and there was he thought a
quid pro quo he was promised by
Secretary of State James Baker and other
officials that NATO would not expand to
the east phrase was not one inch it
wouldn't expand to East Germany and of
course not beyond the United States
immediately expanded NATO to the east
the by now it's expanded to a global
intervention force under US command and
it's official mission is to among other
things to protect to control the energy
infrastructure of the world that means
pipeline sea lanes and so on Gorbachev
protested when NATO moved to East
Germany and told Bush Baker and Helmut
Kohl German Chancellor that they'd had a
promise to that they wouldn't extend one
inch to the east and he was informed by
James Baker that the promise was not on
paper it was a gentleman's agreement and
if he was stupid enough to believe in a
gentleman's agreement that he made with
the United States well that's his
problem but not our problem
so that's out of history the there's a
background to this I'm not going to run
through the whole history don't worry
about that but I want to just take the
first moment because the principles that
were laid down during the Second World
War are still operative there during the
Second World War there were high level
meetings of State Department and the
Council on Foreign Relations maiden
civilian input into foreign policy
planning the post-war world they went up
from nineteen thirty nine to nineteen
forty-five the plans are quite
interesting their sophisticated detailed
plans about how the US would run most of
the world in the early years of the war
it was assumed that the war it was
assumed all along that the United States
would end the word that the war would
end with the United States in a position
of overwhelming power replacing the
former British Empire at the beginning
it was assumed that there would be a
German run area and Asia so there were
going to be two major areas the us-run
area in the german run area the us-run
area they called the Grand area that
would include at the very minimum all of
the Western Hemisphere all of East Asia
and all of the former British Empire
which includes crucially West Asia
Middle East where the world's major
energy reserves are as the Russian army
began to grind down the Nazis after
Stalingrad the analysis changed and the
Grand area conception expanded to
include as much of Eurasia as possible
certainly it's a economic heart and
industrial heartland Western Europe had
included Lee said well that's the grand
area and within the grand area the
planners declared the United States
would hold I'm quoting now unquestioned
power with military and economic
supremacy
and limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by states that might
challenge these global designs that's a
crucial principle it's been operative
since its operative now an exercise of
sovereignty is a major threat to us
security so on a thesis that is very
much alive today and is involved in many
of today's very serious conflicts well
the details were later spelled out most
of the plans that were laid that were in
fact implemented in the early post-war
period which is not surprising it was
pretty much the same people in charge
and later there were further
explanations so with regard to Latin
America the one of the post-war
principles was that there were to be no
regional alliances Secretary of War
Henry Stimson insisted on an exception
to this namely Latin America they said
what it's what he described as our
little region over here which has never
disturbed anybody there there can be a
regional alliance under our control
later the US had all the power so did
would like the later at the mo time for
example when the Nixon administration
was planning the overthrow of Salvador
Allende the elected government in Chile
the National Security Council argued for
the necessity of this arguing that if we
can't control Latin America how are we
going to maintain stability and the rest
of the world stability is a technical
term it means us control so for example
leading foreign policy analyst James
chase liberal analyst former editor
Foreign Affairs explained that we were
unhappily forced to destabilize
in order to maintain stability and
that's not a contradiction the sentient
comment passed without anyone noticing
it because it's correct in the technical
sense we had to preserve stability us
nomination and it's crucial because how
else are we going to control the rest of
the world Nixon's National Security
Council recognized that allowing Europe
to enter Latin America might be make
would make sense on the official grounds
of keeping the Russians out but they
decided that's no good because it would
interfere with stability that is us
control that is the capacity to control
the rest of the world which hinged on
that with the much more significant than
Latin America was the Middle East but
lamarcus kind of taken for granted the
Middle East enter
