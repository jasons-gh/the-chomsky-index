when I hear the phrase on the edge the
irresistible image is the proverbial
lemmings marching resolutely to the
cliff for the first time in history
humans are now poised to destroy the
prospects for decent existence and much
of life the rate of species destruction
today is about the level of 65 million
years ago when a major catastrophe
presumably a huge asteroid ended the age
of the dinosaurs opening the way for
mammals to proliferate the difference is
that today we are the asteroid and the
way will likely be opened to bills and
bacteria when we have concluded our work
geologists as I'm sure you know it break
up the history of the planet into eras
of relative stability the Pleistocene
lasting several million years was
followed by the Holocene about 10,000
years ago coinciding with the human
invention of Agriculture today many
geologists at a new epoch the
Anthropocene beginning with the
Industrial Revolution which has
radically changed the natural world in
the light of the pace of change that one
hates to think when the next epoch will
begin and what it will be one effect of
the Anthropocene is the extraordinary
rate of species extinction
another is of course the threat to
ourselves
no literate person can fail to be aware
that we are facing a prospect of severe
environmental disaster with effects that
are already detectable and that might
become dire within a few generations
if Condon current tendencies are not
reversed and that is not all for the
past 70 years we've been living under
the threat of instant and virtually
total destruction at our own hands those
familiar with the shocking record which
continues to the present will find it
hard to contest the conclusions of
general lead Butler he's the last
commander of the Strategic Air Command
which has responsibility for nuclear
weapons
he writes that we have so far survived
the nuclear age by some combination of
skill luck and divine intervention and I
suspect the latter in greatest
proportion it's a near miracle that we
have escaped destruction so far and the
longer we tempt fate as we are doing now
the less likely it is that we can hope
for divine intervention to perpetuate
the miracle we might wish to consider a
remarkable paradox of the current issue
there are some who are devoting serious
efforts to avert impending disaster in
the lead or the most depressed segments
of the global population those
considered to be the most backward and
primitive the indigenous societies of
the world First Nations in Canada
aboriginals in Australia tribal people
in India and many others throughout the
world in countries with influential
indigenous populations like Bolivia and
Equador there is now legislative
recognition of rights of nature though
the government of Ecuador are actually
proposed to leave their supplies of oil
in the ground where they should be if
the rich countries would provide them
with development aid amounting to a
small fraction of what they would
sacrifice by not exploiting their oil
resources the rich countries refused
while indigenous people are trying to
avert the disaster in sharp contrast the
race
toward the cliff is led by the most
advanced educated wealthy privileged
societies of the world primarily North
America United States and Canada in the
United States there is now much
exuberance about a hundred years of
energy independence as we become the
Saudi Arabia of the next century the one
might take a speech of President Obama's
two years ago to be in eloquent death
knell for the species
he won't quote him he proclaimed with
pride - ample applause that now under my
administration America is producing more
oil today than at any time in the last
eight years that's important to know
over the last three years I've directed
my administration to open up millions of
acres for gas and oil exploration across
23 different states we are opening up
more than 75% of our potential oil
resources offshore we've quadrupled the
number of operating rigs to a record
high we've added enough new oil and gas
pipeline to encircle the earth and then
some the applause tells us something
important about our social and moral
malaise the president was speaking in
Cushing Oklahoma
known as an oil town as he announced in
greeting his appreciative audience in
fact it is the oil town described as the
most significant trading hub for crude
oil in North America and industry
profits are sure to be secured as
producing more oil and gas here at home
in the president's words will continue
to be a critical part of energy strategy
as the president promised a few days ago
the New York Times had an energy
supplement eight pages of mostly
euphoria about the bright future for the
United States poised to be the world's
greatest producer of fossil fuels and
missing from the eight pages is any
reflection of what kind of world we are
exuberantly creating in the moral
calculus of currently prevailing state
capitalism the profits and bonuses and
the next quarter greatly outweigh
concern for the welfare of one's
grandchildren and since these are
institutional maladies they will not be
easy to overcome thank you
