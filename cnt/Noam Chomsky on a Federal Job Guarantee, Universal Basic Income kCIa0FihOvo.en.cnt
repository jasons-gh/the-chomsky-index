what are your thoughts about policy
positions like a universal basic income
and how does how how would the effects
of that compare to a program that would
guarantee everyone a job from the
federal government in like how which
one's better I suppose it's hard to
remember but it was once a Democratic
Party position that there should be a
full employment act of the last gasp of
that was 1978 when humphrey-hawkins bill
was a full employment bill that Carter
didn't veto it but he watered it down so
that just became voluntary toothless and
since then Democrats have gone so far to
the right that they were probably
forgotten about it but that say makes a
lot of sense
I mean it's claimed that employment that
there's an employment is low but that's
mostly fakery I mean you're you're
classified as employed if you work one
hour a week if you take a look at the
job quality indices but people have
decent jobs and are they paid below the
average wage and you help quality index
is going way down
people are getting maybe have a job
technically but it's 30 hours a week
mopping the floor you know and you can
be cancelled whenever the boss says we
don't need you today and stuff like then
barely hanging on there's a way out of
that government provided jobs and
they're desperately needed I mean us
infrastructure is totally collapsing you
know no one to give you examples that's
a lot of very good jobs private private
industries not going
this should be government's government
jobs same is true all the way up to high
technology where the computers come from
the internet coal high-tech industry
public funding fifties sixties and
seventies continues until today the
advanced tech is mostly slick
pharmaceuticals mostly done at public
expense there's plenty of opportunities
for the public through the government
the one institution that's theoretically
responsive to the public to develop the
economy and provide full jobs it's not
done for ideological reasons you know
there's a mantra starts with Reagan that
government is the problem we got to get
rid of government the meaning of that
mantra is we got to get rid of the
population the government is the one
institution that's somewhat responsive
to the public private corporations
aren't so you get rid of the government
move it to private capital you're moving
into unaccountable private tyrannies
nobody's supposed to say that but
doesn't take a brilliant mind to see
that that's what's happening
so yes government-sponsored programs for
a good decent good jobs which would also
help the society we'd be much better off
with real infrastructure with
sustainable development with solar
energy wind power and so on but that's
gonna require a government initiative so
that's a and that would be the obvious
thing to do that what about the ubi
depends very much on the context
so the ubi was supported by Milton
Friedman for example before right but
yes look at his reasons he wanted to do
that so as to eliminate the entire
welfare system that's a catastrophe I
mean there are people who need things
over and above you know we're not all
identical and right-wing libertarian
ideology
we're all equal you know we just entered
the market everything goes wonderfully
in the real world just doesn't happen to
be like that
a mother with three kids you know enters
the market differently than Milton
Friedman does needs special care you
know so if you eliminate the entire
welfare system it's a catastrophe for
the part of the population that has you
know that isn't relatively privileged
and wealthy on the other hand if you
introduced the ubi as a kind of a floor
along with decent social benefit system
could make sense
