are there also questions that reflects
you personally therefore outside the
pattern or for which you have got you
have fun to play see the pattern or an
age give it I know that I just gave a
series of lectures at Columbia on
philosophy department one of them was on
the theme something I called 40 years
ago problems and mysteries problems
meaning by that distinction between
matters that we are in principle capable
of understanding we made understand them
but they fall within our cognitive reach
its you can imagine how we might
understand that those are problems
mysteries simply fall beyond our
cognitive reach and those are quite deep
seated right in the physicals and
Sciences they're not recognized enough
but if you look over the history of the
physical sciences that when you get to
the social side magnifies beyond the
discussion but at the core of the
physical sciences the hard physical
sciences there are mysteries for humans
which are passively understood the be
beyond political understanding human
understanding this classic moments of
this ticket early modern science or the
loop
for evolution which again basically with
Galileo and his contemporaries early
17th century they wanted to overcome the
neo scholastic mysticism going back to
with its recipient origins but they were
confronting a scientific world in which
explanations were given in terms of what
were called alcohol forces the
sympathies antipathy things fall to the
ground because that's their natural
place so on and so forth they want you
real Galileo but others one of you real
explanations and they had a concept of
explanation of intelligibility namely
had to be a mechanical explanation of
the world had to be accounted for as a
machine and what machine they meant
something very concrete so that an
artisan could build so in the ears
leavers so on and so forth in effect it
was supposed to have been built super
skilled artists so the next an
intelligible account versa gelo would be
an account in terms of mechanical
principles it's called the mechanical
philosophy philosophy just met science
teachers so mechanical science the
world's a machine and Galileo recognized
that he was incapable he lamented at the
end of his life she been incapable of
accounting for the motion of the planets
of the thighs and so on in mechanical
terms so this was not yet understood but
the concept of intelligibility was clear
this because
the next century the great scientists
Williams the part of life that's of
Newton all believed in the mechanical
philosophy and then a problem happened
and then discovered that it's false of
the famous what body-mind problem is
based on the assumption that body is
inexplicable and mechanical terms why
the Court recognized that there are
things that aren't explicable with
mechanical terms of that to the main
point was normal use of language for
good reason but so that was the basis of
mine these two substances sure there are
no bodies he showed that nothing is
explicable in mechanical terms the right
now machines this is totally
misunderstood especially in the social
sciences where it's assumed that
mechanical showed that the world
operates by mechanical principles it's
big machine he showed the opposite to
show that you cannot account for an
accountable terms the Newton regarding
this is a complete absurdity he said no
person with any scientific intelligence
could accept this and he spent the rest
of his life trying to overcome it he had
various the problem was happy encounter
for a passionate distance the
interaction without contact so how many
diff
the moon there's no conflict that's the
mystical force but and he was correct
that this absurdity but it was true and
it points to something that goes beyond
the level of human intelligence how can
we deal with the world that's based on
occult forces that we cannot comprehend
we have to accept them because they're
true but we can't comprehend them well
what happened and this was well
understood by his contemporaries by joe
bach later david hume overthrew the 18th
century since that's been forgotten the
concept a science simply limited its
goals science has since Newton have not
attempted to develop an intelligible
account of the universe they have
lowered the goals to try to develop
theories that are intelligible that's a
much lower bowl but to understand this
here is one thing understand with what
is talking about is another thing but
that goal has been abandoned well
there's a dramatic example of something
beyond the level of human intelligence
and it goes on there which includes a
more complicated things than in basic
physics at expensive
