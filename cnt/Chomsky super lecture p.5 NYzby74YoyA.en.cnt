uh what about the safety net story I
mean Gingrich is in favor of people sort
of being out there on their own you know
a rugged entrepreneurs and so on I mean
you can check that too he represents the
county district Cobb County Georgia
which happens to be that and he happens
to hold the national championship in
bringing federal subsidies to his rich
constituents to be precise among
suburban counties in the United States
Cobb County ranks third in federal
subsidies ranks right after arlington
virginia which is part of the federal
government's of course they get a lot of
federal subsidies like the Pentagon's
there and so on and brevard county
florida which is the home of the Space
Center so it's another part of the
federal government but if you move
outside the federal government itself
gingrich's district is number one they
get more federal subsidies than anybody
the biggest employer in cobb county is
locking which is a publicly subsidized
private profit corporation they don't
you know I mean they sell plant
commercial planes but those are just as
everyone knows they're just you know
kind of they use military technology is
that the way the system is designed
technology has developed under the guise
of the military and then hand it over to
private power when when it works let's
do of everything airplanes computers the
internet you name it and Cobb County is
right center this well he's in favor of
being you know all out on your own and
fighting in this harsh world ridiculous
he's the biggest welfare freak in the
country that's literally true except
that he wants the welfare to go to very
rich people notice this is not what's
called corporate welfare the corporate
wealth what they call corporate welfare
which also never gets touched to some
different category completely that's
like giving a special you know shot in
the arm to some particular corporation
this is something quite different this
is the way in which our economy works
the way our economy works take any done
just about any dynamics
there but you know at least that I know
and I've studied and you find that it's
based on massive public subsidy and
privatization of profit public pays the
costs and takes the risks and private
systems make the profit if there is any
cobb county is just an extreme example
of this not you ask how come people are
deluded well how often do you read this
you know i mean like these aren't
particularly subtle facts I mean these
are like glaringly obvious fact but okay
because the reason is because people
like Thomas Friedman and everyone else
in the business knows you're not
supposed to write about these things I
mean I don't know I'm not claiming he
thinks about it you know in fact the
people who write about it are probably
more deeply propagandized that even than
the people they're talking to you know
you cannot be a good propagandist unless
it's in your bones I mean it's extremely
hard to lie I think we all know that
from personal experience you know it's
hard the light of people every one of us
lies to people all the time unless we're
some kind of crazy angels but the way we
do it if you I'm sure you know this is
you first convince yourself that what
you're saying is true you know like your
you know your eight-year-old you're an
eight-year-old kid and you steal a toy
from your brother you know and your
mother comes in and yells at you you
don't say well you know I wanted to
throw and he had it so you know I took
it because I'm stronger than him what
you say is it really wasn't his and
besides he'd taken a toy in mine and
anyway I needed more than he did so it
was right for me to take okay I you know
I'm if people that haven't had that
experience there are some other species
I think but that kind of experience goes
all the way up to being a hotshot
journals for the New York Times you know
you don't even make it into those
circles unless you're already so deeply
overwhelmed by doctrine and propaganda
that you can't even think in other terms
and so you'll read say you know liberal
columnist in New York Times very angrily
saying when people talk like this nobody
tells me what to write
I write anything I feel like which is
absolutely true and if they didn't if
you know people with real power weren't
sure that they were going to say the
right things they wouldn't be in a
position to write anything they feel
like well how does that work you know it
starts from childhood it starts in the
in kindergarten on television there's
selection for obedience from the very
first moment you just think about I'm
guessing maybe I'm wrong so you tell me
I'm wrong but at least when I think
about my own school experience or any
other school experience I know about
there was selection for obedience I mean
I ended up going to fancy colleges like
this place and the way I did it was I
know exactly how i did it by shutting up
you know like if I thought that the high
school teacher was a horse's ass which I
did most of the time I didn't say hey
what you're saying actually sometimes I
did got thrown out of class but I
learned not to say anything just say
okay you know I'll do the next stupid
assignment and because I know that
that's the way I get ahead and
ultimately all do this and that all
right and you know you if you're nervous
you know whatever ability it takes to do
this kind of thing and you are
sufficiently disciplined and passive you
sort of make it through up to the higher
echelon there are people who don't I
mean I know something like somebody on
kids just didn't and they get in trouble
they're called behavior problems or you
know disruptive or you stick drugs in
them or something or other because
they're just too independent you know
and people who are independent or pain
in the neck you know they disrupt the
system and then they're going to be cut
off one way or another I can tell you
just you know at graduate school
teaching mostly graduate school you read
applications you can detect between the
lines when the person who's writing a
recommendation is telling you keep away
from this person they're going to cause
you trouble which means usually they're
going to go off and do the wrong thing
or something like that it's it's I I
don't want to exaggerate in the sciences
it's somewhat different and the reason
is the science of simply
require this kind of independence
they'll die you know unless people are
challenging all the time and questioning
so when you look at people who are say
studying physics at MIT or something
yeah it's totally different because you
just encourage people to be challenging
and creative and so on and so forth but
in most areas you don't you you want
them to be passive and obedient and
supportive and to fit there you know to
fit some kind of niche inside a
managerial system which is top down and
make too much of a fuss and so on and
the people who don't accept this they're
weeded out and one or another fish
