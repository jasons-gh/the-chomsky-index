political activist author linguist Noam
Chomsky is all of this and more he's
America's most outspoken critic of u.s.
foreign policy and the mainstream media
yet the New York Times is called Chomsky
nothing less than the most important
intellectual alive today over the years
his provocative views have inspired some
and enraged others over the years you've
written about and given voice to an
array of alternative views on issues as
diversas Vietnam and human rights and
the role of the media your views
traditionally tend to be a little bit
more critical and I would spoken
especially as it relates to you u.s.
foreign policy I mean I've got a quote
here where you're saying that the United
States is a violent and terrorists rogue
state with no interest in the rule of
law that's pretty harsh stuff and I
actually mostly based on quoting
official document mhm so the official
u.s. position is has been for years even
public that well Dean Acheson put it
pretty clearly about 40 years ago he
said in cases where there is a challenge
to the position prestige and power of
the United States the propriety of a
response is not a legal issue so others
we do what we want where there's a Chow
an in fact and that's been reiterated
very recently so Clinton spoke to the
United Nations a few years ago and he
said that the United States will act
multilaterally when it's possible but
unilaterally if we feel there's in our
interest and just last year the
Secretary of Defense William Cohen
reiterated that even more strongly so
the United States will take unilateral
action in matters relevant to its
interest which include such things as
access the two markets and resources and
the u.s. is quite happy to use violent
and terrorist means to do that but the
notion of America being a violent
terrorist rogue state I mean you there
seems to be a certain level of
acquiescence to America's involvement
right
and countries almost saying you know why
don't you get more involved in Sierra
Leone why don't you play your role as
world leader of ensuring that you know
civil society is maintained throughout
the planet that's not the u.s. role the
u.s. does get involved very extensively
so for example take a look at say arms
float well that's a good measure of
involvement if most of the arms flow is
from the United States it's the major
arms producer and exporter there are two
countries Israel in Egypt which are
always in the lead that has to do with
nomination of the Middle East don't put
them in a separate category if we look
at the rest the results quite
interesting so for example up and but
right now the leading recipient of us
arms in the world happens to be Colombia
Colombia also has the worst human rights
record in the hemisphere and has had it
for 10 years and has been the leading
recipient of us arms for 10 years that's
incidentally a correlation which is
pretty well established over the years
colombia moved in the first place in
1999 replacing turkey what about turkey
well turkeys a military ally and
strategic outpost so it always gets a
fairly high level of arms it shot up in
1984 and it stayed very high right
through 1998 in 1997 the flow of arms to
turkey was higher than the entire period
pre-1980 for those had nothing to the
Russians nothing to the Cold War what it
had to do with is the fact that Turkey
was carrying out a violent murderous
repression of its Kurdish minority
killing tens of thousands of people
creating two to three million refugees
destroying 3,500 villages which is seven
times Kosovo under NATO bombing and it
neat an eighty percent of the arms were
coming from the United States now that's
not creating now why did it shift to
Colombia well the reason is because
turkey finally succeeded in repressing
it's the the internal insurgency
Colombia hasn't yet
seated so the arms flows switching to
Columbia well you know that's not
preserving civil society that's
maintaining state terror well and you've
been very very you know vociferous in
pointing out the inconsistencies of us
initiatives based on on human rights
rationale and that do you believe that
for you date with an example like Cuba
for fur for instance for the United
States we cannot support this regime
because of the way they treat its
citizens yet and others it ignores
what's behind that what motivates
America in in your view and it causes
that inconsistency well first of all I
don't see it as an inconsistency it
seems to be very consistent so it's
consistently in support of the what are
called US interests which happened to be
the interests of dominant sectors within
us society which are primarily corporate
interests it's not a big secret and it's
not at all surprising in fact every
state behaves like this ever you know
the states are not moral agents they may
pretend to be in intellectuals may
produce flowery flav phrases but the
fact is states are institutions of power
how are often means violence and there
they act in the interests of dominant
social groups internally okay now in one
of your recent books the new military
humanism you focus on causal and again
you're very critical of the NATO us-led
interventions in into that country at
the time that view you know outraged
many of what you might see is your
natural liberal allies who saw Kosovo as
a moral war I mean here was an attempt
to stop you know ethnic cleansing man
was genocide what was your response to
those 82 problems with it for one thing
it did not stop it it initiated it
contributed to initiating it as
anticipated notice the bombing led to a
very sharp escalation of atrocities that
was anticipated as the bombing began the
NATO commander Wesley Clark informed the
press that it is in his words entirely
predictable that it will lead to a very
rapid escalation of atrocities shortly
after informed the press that
it was never the intent of the NATO
command to put an end to ethnic
cleansing nor to stop atrocities which
of course is true because it led to an
increase in them so in the first place
in the narrow case of Kosovo that was
not the it was not intended the stop
atrocities in fact it led to an
escalation of them but there's a much
more significant issue if someone
believed that this is a war fought for
principles and values and humanitarian
purposes and so on there is a simple
test namely what are you doing in other
cases where you can very easily stop
atrocities so it takes a team or the
other big issue till 1999 in the early
months of 1999 same time that concerns
were being expressed about Kosovo and
preparation for the bombing right at
that time Indonesian commandos trained
and armed by the United States we're
entering a steamer to carry out what
they called Operation Clean Sweep a mass
intimidation and terror operation
starting in February which carried out
extensive massacres had killed maybe
5,000 people or so by the first half of
the year giving ample warning this was
an attempt to intimidate the population
so that they would not vote for
independence in a referendum that was
being planned they gave ample warning
open public warning and much more has
now come out through beaked Australian
intelligence sources that they were
going to that if the population voted
the wrong way they were going to carry
out a mass destruction okay population
voted the wrong way they then did
exactly what they said they were going
to do this is the Indonesian army and
its paramilitaries armed and trained by
the United States and Britain primarily
and they then expelled about eighty-five
percent of the population from their
homes very violently and destroyed about
seventy percent of the country well what
was the position of the United States
and Britain during this entire period an
official position right to the end the
official position is it's their
responsibility and we're
going to take it away from them came up
notice there's no sovereignty here no
issue of sovereignty straight invasion
with us British backing the Indonesian
army had already killed about a third of
the population hundreds of thousands of
people now here's a very easy way to
stop atrocities tell them to call it off
you don't the bomb Jakarta you don't
have to impose sanctions you just have
to stop participating in the atrocities
and we'll stop providing the arms and
the diplomatic support right in the
middle and I can go on case after case
in the middle of this performance we
have the people you're talking about
complaining that I'm objecting to the to
their pretense and it certainly is a
propel immoral war of immoral or how can
you be carrying out a moral oh maybe the
maybe the bombing was right or maybe was
wrong that's a separate question but how
can you be pretending that this is a
moral endeavor while at the very same
time you're participating in massive
atrocities which are worse than those
you claim you want to stop well I want
to talk about even another case because
say you've probably been most vocal in
criticism of the bombing of northern
Iraq and ongoing sanctions in in that
country what's happening in Iraq well
its first of all what's happening in
Iraq is that sanctions are being imposed
which are destroying the country
devastating the population and
strengthening Saddam Hussein he's not
suffering like his power is greater than
before and there's not going to be an
internal rebellion when people are so
demoralized and devastated that they can
barely survive that's the effect of it's
exactly how many people have been killed
we're not certain but it's probably on
the order of a million maybe and the
country has certainly been devastated
evelopment ree well and it's been
reduced to one of the poorest in the
world not that is the effect of the
sanction so why is it being done well
there's an official reason it's repeated
over and over again every UN session
every public pronouncement what he said
is the following it said this man Saddam
Hussein is
such a monster that we can't let him to
serve us survive why is he a monster not
only did he develop weapons of mass
destruction but he even used them
against his own population the ultimate
atrocity all of that is absolutely true
but it's missing a few words it is true
that he developed weapons of mass
destruction and used them against his
own population with our support those
are the words that are missing with our
support the development of weapons of
mass destruction was in the 1980s the
use of the gassing of the Kurds which is
what they're referring to who was in
1988 the US and Britain responded to
that by increasing their support for
their friend Saddam Hussein increasing
his ability to develop weapons of mass
destruction and by putting to the side
suppressing the mass murder of the Kurds
not that tells you something that tells
you one thing it tells you as those
can't be the reasons they can't possibly
be the reasons for the sanctions because
we were supporting him when he did these
things and continue to support so the
reason so point number one is the
political leadership and that's not just
the United States and Britain it's the
Netherlands and you know every western
spokesman says the same thing they're
all lying transparently the media and
other commentators who are repeating
this are not telling the truth they are
omitting the crucial words with our
support which are very crucial and the
we want to find out what's happening I
have to look elsewhere mm-hmm they've
also been very critical about the median
you've written extensively and given
talks of how the media clues with the
political leaders to both set the agenda
and to maintain the status quo give our
viewers some insight into how you
believe that works well first question
is does it work and I think the answer
is yes I can't give the evidence here
but just take the cases we've been
discussing and ask how much has been
presented about that an answer is
virtually nothing how does it work it
seems to me fairly straightforward the
media are part of the
some of power in the United States for
example I mean talk about that what are
the media there are major corporations I
parts of even bigger mega corporations
like General Electric and Westinghouse
and so on they like other corporations
they produce a product and they sell it
to a market the market is advertisers so
other businesses that's where the money
comes from the product is audiences they
sell audiences to advertisers and for
the major media the ones that kind of
set the agenda like New York Times
Washington Post and so on they're
selling privileged audiences so you have
major corporations selling privileged
audiences to other businesses what
picture of the world you expect to
emerge from this system well it's one
that will reflect the interests of the
sellers the buyers and the product right
you've described this process in your
landmark book as manufacturing consent
give us a current example how where you
may see that happen to take say take
turkey in Cologne they transition from
leading recipient of us arms just last
year was from turkey to Colombia I
honest media would tell you that they
would say look we completed the
operation of massive ethnic cleansing
and atrocities in Turkey we have not yet
completed it in Colombia so the leading
flow of arms is shifting from turkey to
Colombia if you look more closely you
find that's exactly what's going on but
that's not what beings prevented turkey
was barely reported on the case of
Columbia this it's reported but in the
content under pretext under a pretext of
a drug war which can't possibly be taken
seriously this is not a drug work I mean
this is a counterinsurgency operation
attempting to destroy a peasant based
insurgency which the government hasn't
been able to control that it isn't a
drug wars obvious on the face of it the
abuse of lethal substances is a serious
issue by far the most significant by
orders of magnitude is tobacco that's by
far the most lethal drug in
international trade in the United States
alone there were about 400,000 deaths
tobacco related deaths last year and
16,000 from all hard drugs combined the
Supreme Court recently just identified
tobacco use of the leading public health
hazard the also it's a huge
international trade the matter of export
export of tobacco from the United States
has increased about five fold under the
free trade regime other countries are
compelled to accept us lethal substances
under pain of severe trade sanctions
furthermore they must accept advertising
for them aimed at vulnerable populations
or else there are trade sanctions
Colombia cartel is not permitted to put
ads on CBS television saying extolling
the wonders of cocaine here is a major
lethal substance by far the most the
worst which is forced on other countries
not we can go on but this is enough to
show that it's not a drug it's a it's a
counterinsurgency we're not going back
to the media why is this presented under
the pretext of a drug war like what I've
just said is not secret information it's
quite public yeah I'm interested to how
the media treats you because the same
media that ignores these issues you know
often you know ignores or dismisses Noam
Chomsky as his views are so extreme he's
from Neptune I mean you've you've heard
before me what's your response so though
is it from Neptune to report what the
Supreme Court just decided and on the
most on the greatest health hazard in
the United States or at the point out
that was just a straight fact that the
u.s. is using its alleged free trade
enthusiasm to force other countries to
accept lethal substances and advertising
for them I don't think that's from
Neptune that ought to be headlines if
the media do not want these to be
headlines that's something that they
have to answer for it and it's only it's
not me it's every grade but you have
been called conscience of the American
American people but I wonder in recent
years when what appears at least on the
surface to be a
growing consensus in favor of us
dominance around the world trade
liberalisation globalization whether you
ever feel like a lone voice out there
you know contrary I feel right in the
mainstream so let's let's take say
what's called trade liberalisation and
that's not what's happening what's
called liberalisation is in fact a
complicated interaction of
liberalisation and protectionism and the
interests of private power but let's
call it that who supports this certainly
not the world at least not if the people
of the world count so for example just
last last month there was there were
meetings of the called g77 it's the non
line country basically they account for
eighty percent of the world's population
they had meetings right here in a
hemisphere in Colombia and Cuba and
produced a declaration declaration of
the South Summit in which they bitterly
condemned the process of globalization
as it's being carried out not because
they're against globalization but
because it's being carried out in a way
which is harmful to the pup they see it
as harmful to the population of the
world they called for a reorientation
which would aim at the right of
independent national development ending
of poverty the the right of development
which they prioritize is officially
posed by the United States they
condemned what they called the so-called
right of humanitarian intervention which
they call a considerate guys for
traditional imperialism under its
familiar moralistic trappings this is
this is eighty percent of the world's
population well i did a database check
in the united states the declaration was
not reported well that's eighty percent
of the world's population well let's
take that the united states and canada
these are democracies so we have polling
and we know what people think on the
trade issues the populations opposed
despite overwhelming propaganda so the
media about a hundred percent in favor
of it as is the entire corporate world
and there's very little criticism
permitted nevertheless on the issues the
both the population of canada in the
united states have been consistently
pluralities have been consistently
opposed that is of people who pay
attention majorities in general that's
not a marginal position that's a
position right in the center of opinion
well we're starting to see you know
growing protest against Washington
visible for a visible but if we looked
at the pole like at the time of NAFTA
sure the despite in the United States
which I know better despite I say a
hundred percent enthusiastic media
support a public opposition persisted
and remain the plurality not to speak to
take part in that opposition is not to
be marginalized in fact it's the media
were marginalized when you see this
visible evidence of protest at the IMF
at the wet or WTO the OAS do you see
this as the worm kind of turning you see
the population starting to rise up
against the status quo I don't see the
worm is turning I see the general
opposition taking a more visible form
well and it's been doing that for a long
time let's take the multilateral
agreement on investment right which were
there were big public birth discs but
there were there was plenty of protest
actually initiated mostly in Canada
other the effort was to ram this home in
secret it's a huge investor rights
agreement rich they knew the public was
going to be opposed to so it was kept
secret by the media incidentally for
years it broke through largely because
of Canadian activism what bar those and
others when it did break through when
broke through the media self-censorship
instantly very quickly within a couple
of months there were protests all over
the world and the OECD the organization
of the rich countries had to back down
that's not this is a matter of general
public attitudes becoming harder to
suppress do you see the Internet as
providing an alternative means to get
public unions and forums discussed
outside of traditional media you know
takes a the multilateral agreement on
investment Bayon I mean the organizing
for that was none mostly on the end
it because it could not be done through
the mainstream media they wouldn't
permit it so it was done through the
internet a lot of the planning and
organizing for the recent demonstrations
has also been by getting around the
mainstream information system or
information control system by using this
the sames true in other countries like
takes a Indonesia the protests against
the Suharto government it could not be
done in mena an Asian press they were
done a lot of those done through the
internet was an internet organizing
system and in fact whether this will
continue or not is a real matt'll matter
for struggle we know certainly what
corporations want they don't want it to
be used for information and activism and
if the public is willing to struggle to
maintain control of what it created not
to hand it over as another weapon of
domination will and it will remain that
way but it's not going to happen
automatically over the years you've been
involved broad broad broad spectrum of
issues I'm interested what's what's
consuming you right now what's really
really your passion these days basically
the same issues the issues of Human
Rights democracy freedom justice there's
been a major attack on democracy in the
last 20 25 years that's in fact a large
part of what's called globalization that
what's called globalization is a kind of
a cover for the shifting of
decision-making away from instruments of
popular sovereignty like governments and
solving static countries in the more
democratic countries that means the
public to some extent of these shifting
of decisions away from them into private
Erinyes which is what corporations are
call them something else if you like but
they're private Pyrenees so as decisions
are shifted to investors lenders banks
manufacturing corporations and so on
which is what globalization is in fact
the this form of it that is an attack on
popular sovereignty
and it's intended that way so financial
liberalisation which is a big piece of
the current globalization system that
creates what's called sometimes a
virtual Parliament of which has veto
power over national planning it can
exercise that power simply by attacking
currencies and withdrawing cattle and
that constrains what governments can do
and in our democratic states that means
it constrains what people can do means
you can't carry out social and economic
planning which will be aimed for the
welfare of people rather than for
profits because if you do that there
will be an attack by the virtual
Parliament that's a major consequence of
financial liberalisation and it is
understood back in the 1940s when
written in the United States Cannes and
white created the Bretton Woods system
one of the was based on stabilization of
currencies and control of capital and
these were the quite explicit reasons
for it it was to allow governments to
carry out national socio-economic
planning without fear of the virtual
Parliament when this system was
dismantled in the 70s through state
initiative United States Canada Britain
and others that led to a major attack on
popular democracy that's only one
example incidentally this form of
globalisation that's been instituted
also is harmed the economy so if you
look at say growth rates they've been
for the less developed countries they've
been cut by about half during the last
20 25 years for the industrial countries
is almost as much cut by maybe a third
and the same is true of other
macroeconomic statistics in fact what's
called a fairy tale economy in the
United States a Goldilocks economy it's
a fairy tale for a very small number of
people who for about eighty percent of
the popular workforce in the United
States wages have stagnated or declined
than work hours have greatly increased
that's an unprecedented
of the economic system especially during
the period of moderate growth in the
last ten years these are all aspects of
globalization if you like that of a
particular form of globalization well
you know these are things that I think
that most people do care about and to
take part in that general opposition to
the form in which private power and
government power is directing the world
I think that's as i say i don't think
that marginalizes one into right and
center thing what's clearly here as
motivated as you ever have been above
these things Noam Chomsky I want to
thank you very much for joining it's
been a real pleasure okay
