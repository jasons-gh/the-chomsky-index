I imagine there a number of journalism
students in the audience tonight I
imagine they're in a good number of
people who well they they filter in the
middle echelon apparatchik II for the
media empire that you've discussed they
come out imbued with the ideology of
value free objective reporting it's the
major ideological offensive against the
kind of model that you want to pose as
an alternative I wonder if you could
talk to the audience here about the
ideology of objectivity and value free
reporting within this system well there
is such an ideology and it's interesting
to see how it's interpreted objectivity
means you take what people in power say
and you report it accurately without
distorting their quotes and then sort of
down at the bottom of the column you
know down at the bottom of the column
you may say things like what I quoted if
you're really an intrepid reporter you
say well this may seem to be
inconsistent with the spirit of the
peace agreement that's you know that's
objective reporting if the State
Department announces that Nicaragua has
called for revolution Without Borders
then even if you know it happens to be a
lie an objective reporter just reports
it because they said it after all it's
true that they said it and wouldn't be
objective would be introducing opinions
to say it's a lie I suppose so there is
an object ideology of objectivity and I
wouldn't just scoff at it incidentally
the fact of the matter is that by and
large American reporters if you had to
you know a bunch of reporters describing
something they saw I would end by and
large to trust the American reporter at
least as much maybe more than those who
come out of other traditions because
this tradish
business of objectivity is not
completely to be scoffed at the effort
to try to keep your reporting to the
facts and not the introduced opinion is
a worthy effort and sometimes it shows
up in accurate description and there are
some reporters I should say who do it
extremely well
and I've have a very good record of it
and in fact this even includes
reporters who work for the journals that
in my view are right at the core of the
propaganda system so take say John
kiffin er of the New York Times I think
he can tell when the New York Times
editors want some story to be reported
accurately for their own purposes that's
when they send John Kipner to report it
because he's been reported accurately
and when they don't want to report it
accurately anymore they take him off and
put him back at the Metro desk that's
one test as to what the editors have in
mind and they're there and there are
times when they want report as stories
reported accurately and there are some
journalists who really do it on the
other hand when they send Tom Friedman
out their current chief diplomatic
correspondent you know what they want
his propaganda you want somebody who's
going to say as he just said after he
was advanced to this August post that
the United States is now you know sort
of under the Bush administration
planning to support the Central American
Peace Accords which were introduced and
proposed and advanced by Costa Rica
Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador
mission there but that's part of the
game that's what happens when you send
Thomas Friedman to record a story and I
presume that the editors understand
these things
that's incidentally I presume why Thomas
Friedman's chief diplomatic
correspondent and John Keefe no reason
but you'd have to ask the editors about
that the so the the the get back to your
point the objectivity it's a good thing
it's a good value to be objective in
reporting and the people who do it
honestly do very good journalism but as
you're implying that ideology can be
used to be a distorting mechanism and
quite commonly is
