what does that mean to you to continue
in some way the legacy of the
Enlightenment like any major movement
and human life was pretty complicated
but its major features were commitment
to ideas that I think are basically
anarchist so take say ideas about say
takes a division of labor and let's take
a typical Enlightenment figure Adam
Smith what did he have to say about
division of labor well here it's worth
reading I mean everyone's read the first
paragraph of wealth of nations which
Witcher does his thing everybody does
their own thing everything comes out
fine so division of labor was marvelous
money only if you read in a few hundred
pages he comes out as a figure of the
Enlightenment he says division of labor
will turn human beings into creatures
that's stupid and ignorant as a person
can possibly be because it will drive
them into a repeating work on command
and therefore in any civilized society
says the government will have to move in
to stop it well that's a version of a
standard Enlightenment idea that your
own intelligence and creative abilities
derive from what you do if founders of
what we call classical liberalism
figure the enlightenment he encapsulated
it by saying that if a craftsperson
does say craftsman of course if a
craftsman produces a beautiful object on
command we may admire what he does but
will despise what it is he is a creature
is a tool and under somebody else's
control like a machine that's producing
a beautiful object if we want that
person to be a real human being they
should be doing things under their own
internal impulses and then if it creates
even maybe it's not a beautiful object
we'll still admire what the person is
well it's an Enlightenment idea grows at
a conception of human intelligence human
creativity is a very good idea the same
with some values like say freedom speech
I don't think we should preserve it and
even the questioning of authority and
dominance that's for enlightenment
values so I don't see what's wrong with
them
