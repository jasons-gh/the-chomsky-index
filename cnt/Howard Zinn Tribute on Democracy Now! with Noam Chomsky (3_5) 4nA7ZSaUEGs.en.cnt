I wanted to turn to Noam Chomsky who's
still with us on the phone from Boston
no I wanted to ask you about Howard sins
role in the anti-war movement in the 60s
in 1968 Howard's and traveled to North
Vietnam with father Daniel Berrigan to
bring home three US prisoners of war
they became two of the first Americans
to visit North Vietnam during the war
this is howard zinn speaking in 1968
after he returned to the United States
way back this made me seem presumptuous
on our part but when on our way back in
from Paris we sent a wire I think with
our last 15 bucks to the White House
saying something like we'd like to talk
to you President Johnson you know would
you please meet with us sir we just come
back from hello i would just talked with
the premier i'm going down but we just
read in a newspaper that you say to not
get nummies are not ready to negotiate
what we learned from pham van dong seems
to contradict that now we'd like to talk
with you about this and about the
prisoner released which we think has
been mishandled but we have not so far
received an answer from LBJ that was
Howard Zinn Noam Chomsky talk about this
period talk about the time Howards End
went with father Dan Berrigan to North
Vietnam and what it meant the Willet
that was a breakthrough recognizing the
humanity of the official enemy of course
the main enemy was the people of South
Vietnam who were practically destroyed
South Vietnam was had been devastated by
then and that was important but at least
in my view the most them were more
important was his book that you
mentioned before the logic withdrawal I
mean there was by then I guess must been
1967 in a substantial anti-war movement
but it was keeping to how it is you know
stop stop doing these terrible things
and do less and so on Howard really
broke through
the first person to say loudly publicly
very persuasively that this simply has
to stop we should get out period no
conditions we have no right to be there
it's an act of aggression pull out
actually he that was so surprising at
the time it became the more commonplace
later that he couldn't even there wasn't
even a review of the book in fact he
asked me if I would review it in
ramparts just so that which left-wing
journal it was running then just says
somebody people would see it so I did
that but it's sank in pretty quickly and
it just changed the way people look at
the war and in fact that was one of his
fabulous achievements all along he
simply changed people's perspectives
both by his argument and his courage and
his integrity and his willingness to be
on the front line all the time and his
simplicity and as Alice Walker said is
humor this is one case the war of
people's histories another case I mean
it simply changed the conscience of a
whole generation the it's there had been
some studies you know of sort of actions
from below but he raised it to an
entirely new plane in fact the phrase of
his that's always rings in my mind is
his reverence for and his detailed study
of what he called the countless small
actions of unknown people that lead to
those great moments that entered the
historical record a record that you
simply can't begin to understand unless
you look at those countless small
actions and you know I wrote about the
network only but he participated in and
he inspired others to participate in
them and the anti-war movement was 1k
civil rights movement before it
Central American wars in the 1980s in
fact about any you know office worker
strikes just about anything you can any
significant action for a peace and
justice Howard was there people saw him
as a leader but he was really a
participant his you know his remarkable
character made him a leader if even if
he was just sitting on the you know
waiting for the police to pull people
away like everyone else no min 1971 you
may remember this in fact you may have
been there but Howard Zinn and Daniel
Ellsberg were both beaten by police in
Boston at a protest against the Vietnam
War one day before the beading as in
spoke at a large rally and Boston Common
this is an excerpt from the documentary
you can't be neutral on a moving train
obedience obedience upset people to
trouble them to disturb them we commence
know sob another story
to what we mean to disturb those are in
charge of the law he said at the end of
his speech remember he said now let me
address the secret police in this crowd
don't you see that you're violating the
spirit of democracy my what to join
don't you see that you're behaving like
the sake of poly silicon stage
that cost him a bit I think the next day
when we were sitting in front of the
federal building i have a feeling
because again the police shows in the
end to rest almost no one they didn't
want to rest they didn't want a trial
they didn't want the publicity they'll
be associated with that they only
arrested a couple of ram leaders and one
of those who saw the battlefield every
town and city Litella killing stops
until we can hold of our heads again the
world cannot show the desirable world
without war and we lie together
and at that point the batons were raised
and they begin clubbing us very heavy
Howard was pulled up if I say a shirt
was ripped to parties taken away I saw
blood coming down his chest as you that
was an excerpt of the documentary can't
be neutral in a moving train was also
the title of howard sins autobiography
known we just have a minute left in this
segment but talk about that activism
well that case is very similar to what
Howard described about his a bombing
attack I mean the police were actually
sympathetic the individual policeman
they were coming over to demonstrators
you know speaking supportively and in
fact when they were given the order to
move forward they were actually telling
people Howard and others look please
move because we don't want to do this
but then when the order came they did it
I don't know who but it's much like he
said when you're in uniform under arms
an automaton following orders you do it
and as Dan pointed out they went right
after Howard probably in reaction to his
comments the day before and he was
dragged away and beaten but he was
constantly involved in civil
disobedience I was many times with him
as Dan Ellsberg was and others and he
was just he was fearless he was simple
he was straightforward he said the right
things said them eloquently and inspired
others to move forward in ways they
wouldn't have done and changed their
minds they changed their minds by their
actions and by hearing him he was a
really both in his life and in his work
he was a remarkable person just
irreplaceable you were personal friends
with Howard to you and Carol Howard and
Roz spent summers near each other on the
cake yeah we were personal friends close
personal friends for many years over 40
years
of course personal loss but it's a
beyond even beyond this close friends
and family is just a tragic loss to the
millions of people that who knows how
many endless numbers whose lives he
touched and changed and help them become
much better people he one good thing is
that he understood and recognized I'm
sure especially and those last
remarkable vibrant years of his life how
much his incredible contributions were
welcomed admired how much he was loved
and admired and he could look back on a
very satisfying life of real unusual
achievement well known Chomsky I want to
thank you very much for being with us

dissident and close friend of Howard
