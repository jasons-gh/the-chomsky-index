ladies and gentleman welcome my name is
Steven Sequeira I'm the Secretary of the
Committee on the exercise of the needle
to the rights of the Palestinian people
welcome this afternoon we have the
Singlish professor Noam Chomsky who will
take your questions but to present him I
have our vice chair of the Committee on
the exercise of the nabal rights of the
Palestinian people ambassadors are here
today ambassador Shannon you have the
floor thank you good afternoon welcome
to this press conference the Committee
on the exercise of the inalienable
rights of the Palestinian people is
honored to host within the framework of
the International Year of solidarity
with the Palestinian people such an
important event as today's with
exceptional guests on behalf of the
Palestinian rights committee I'm very
pleased to welcome professor Noam
Chomsky though I'm certain he needs no
introductions professor Chomsky is
undoubtedly one of the most prominent
critical thinkers of our time as
extensive study in work on the
israeli-palestinian conflict over the
past 40 years could not be more relevant
and pertinent than at this particular
juncture professor Chomsky will deliver
a lecture at 3 p.m. in the General
Assembly and the General Assembly all
previously it was informed to all that
was eco sockets zero simply halt on the
prospects for resolving the
israeli-palestinian conflicts in lives
of
Evans his lecture will be followed by a
discussion and Q&A session with Amy
Goodman journalist and host at Democracy
Now professor Chomsky will now first
give a short statement after which we
will open the floor for questions from
the media professors the floor is yours
thank you all very much for coming I'm
very pleased to be here and look forward
to discussing whatever issues you have
on your mind and would like to bring up
so I'll keep to a very brief statement
that floor is yours so please keep your
questions brief into the point and he'll
answer them one by one please professor
Chomsky on behalf of the UN
Correspondents Association your welcome
and thank you for being here the
Palestinian leadership is calling now on
the Security Council to adopt a
resolution to end the occupation within
a two years time frame do you think that
as the Security Council should take such
action thank you I think the Security
Council should take that action and
indeed stronger actions but as I didn't
tell you the Security Council can only
act insofar as the great powers permit
and in this case that means insofar as
the United States permits and my
suspicion is that the US delegation will
seek ways to block any such resolution
though I think it's certainly
appropriate the resolution that is
please
Thank You professor Chomsky
I wonder what moral position would you
take if you were a Palestinian and you
have the choice under the occupation and
you have the Islamic state that you see
nowadays and the Arab autocrat
authoritarian regimes what is the choice
that you take the moral one the moral
choice for the Palestinians yeah thank
you
well the moral choice is to resist the
occupation they have limited options the
moral choices cannot be divorced from
the concept of tactical judgments about
the consequences of actions so there's
no such thing as moral choices in a
universe divorced from the one in which
we exist and in the universe in which we
exist the moral choices are limited but
they are not non-existent for much I've
been I've had various involvement with
the Palestinian leadership for maybe 45
years and I think originally initially
through my friend Edward Sayid the close
friend arranged meetings we had
discussions and my feeling all along is
that the primary
focus of the Palestinian leadership
should be or at least a primary focus to
address the American population as I
think there will be no significant
progress in this conflict until pressure
from the American population induces the
government that take a different stance
and every third-world nationalist
movement the Vietnamese Nicaraguan
temari's or whatever it was have all
understood the significance of
developing solidarity and support among
the American population to the extent
that they can influence modification of
policy and I think that's a crucial
direction that the Palestinian efforts
should be directed to quite apart from
actions in the international arena so
for example yesterday's vote in the
British Parliament is an illustration of
the kind of step that can be taken that
can add to the growing effort to
pressure the the influential states in
the world unfortunately it's not an
egalitarian world the ones who have more
influence to use that influence to
advance a settlement of the conflict
which is within reach we pretty well
know what it is yes thank you professor
Chomsky my name is Abdul Hameed so I am
from detailee and could solara be that's
based in London and my question mr.
Chomsky is the two-state solution still
viable did you believe that there is any
chance left
for a second state and West Bank is
Jerusalem in Gaza that is viable
independent sovereign continuant
and independent
is there a chance is there a chance for
a two-state settlement with an
independent viable Palestinian state
yeah there's a chance and I don't think
it's hard to see how it could be reached
it's come it's come fairly close a
number of times so for example the Taba
negotiations in January 2001 approached
a settlement that might have been viable
in fact you may recall in the final
press conference of the negotiators
Israeli and Palestinian they did inform
the press that if they had a bit more
time they might have actually settled
the remaining issues there were several
outstanding issues remaining and
although lots of lots of happened since
then I don't see any reason to doubt
that a settlement roughly along the
lines that they were discussing could be
implemented it will require that as I
said before that the United States be
willing to accept such a settlement so
far that hasn't happened I mean as you
know just three years ago President
Obama vetoed a Security Council
resolution his delegation vetoed a
Security Council resolution which called
for the implementation of official US
policy as long as that continues to be
the stance I think there will be one
roadblock after another
Thanks what Matthew Lee inner-city press
on behalf of the free UN Coalition for
access thanks a lot for this briefing I
wanted to ask you know you obviously the
US has a veto in the Security Council as
to the other four and they had a veto in
choosing ban ki-moon as the
secretary-general and in being renewed
now that he's in his second term I
wonder how do you - since you're here at
the UN how do you view sort of the UN
Secretariat UNRWA the whole kind of UN
machinery on the question of Palestine
how do you view it as even-handed
between the two sides or is so and the
other if you're willing to go one beyond
Palestine
I'd love to hear your analysis of the
kobani the situation in kobani in in
Syria with the Kurds but only if time
permits thank you well the situation
with regard to the UN leadership one has
to always qualify there's a certain
range of options open to the UN
leadership but obviously the UN cannot
proceed beyond the bounds permitted by
the great power and in this particular
case is there a Palestine that means
primarily the United States the record
of is overwhelming and very clear for 50
for almost 50 years the and I think
within those bounds the UN leadership
has done about what it could you can
criticize this or that judgment but the
limits are fairly narrow as I just
mentioned that was even a u.s. veto of a
resolution endorsing official US policy
that's pretty extreme that indicates
what the limits are once again with
regard to kobani it's a shocking
situation this morning's newspaper as
you read described the Turkish military
operation against Kurds in Turkey not
against Isis a couple of kilometres
across the border where they're in
danger of being slaughtered as long as I
think the UN something should be done at
the UN at least in terms of a very
strong resolution to call for a
ceasefire it's hard to impose the use of
force but to the extent that it can be
done to try to protect kobani from
destruction at the hands of Isis which
could be a major massacre
with enormous consequences the strategic
significance of the town in the Kurdish
region is pretty obvious and turkeys
world is critical in this if we could
try to keep questions to Israel
Palestine I appreciate that
madam in the second row please do you
see a trend in Western Europe after
Sweden and the British Parliament which
doesn't necessarily commit the UK
government toward recognizing Palestine
as a state which was very much isolate
the US and secondly do you see the is
really criticism deteriorating into
anti-semitism it doesn't mean that you
have to be an anti-semite just criticize
Israel the Jew as we you and I know can
be very separate but do you see that
trend in Europe and elsewhere especially
in the Arab world well the classic
discussion of this was given by Israel's
UN Ambassador by Evan back about the
near must been around 1970 he has an
interesting article which you might want
to look up it appeared in Congress
weekly which is a major journal of the
American Jewish community the kind of
more liberal segments of the organized
American Jewish community and in that he
essentially gives his instructions to
the American Jewish community and what
he says is you your task is to convince
the population and the world that any
criticism of Israel is either
anti-semitism or in the case of Jews as
as an indication of Jewish self-hatred
and he actually mentioned two people one
was I F stone and the other was me was
happy to be designated as a neurotic
self-hating Jew
actually there's a history which I
presume about Evan knows certainly
anyone with the Jewish education knows a
real Jewish education this goes right
back to the Bible the first person to
use this argument was King Ahab Kings -
it was the epitome of evil in the Bible
and they happened Jezebel everyone knows
the story at one point he the King
called the prophet Elijah to him and
demanded of the Prophet that he he
condemned the prophet Elijah as the
Hebrew phrase is a hairy SRL the right
translation would be hater of Israel he
asked him why are you a hater of Israel
what the Prophet was doing of course was
condemning the acts of the evil king and
for the totalitarian mentality the power
centre is identified with the society
the culture the community and so on so
if he condemned the power center you're
condemning the country the nation the
history in the culture so the prophet
Elijah was a hater of Israel and the
person who issued the condemnation was
the epitome of evil in the Bible so we
have a choice do we want to join Elijah
or do we want to join King Ahab as Abba
heaven recommended as for the first part
of your question I think the British
vote yesterday was as it the press
correctly pointed out symbolic the
Conservative Party essentially abstained
the following Israel's request that they
ignore the vote and the Prime Minister
Cameron made it clear the stated that
this would not affect British policy
however it does affect British policy
it's another indication of the way the
populations in Europe and also in the
United States to an extent not as far
but it's moving in that direction or
want to distance themselves from the
actions that Israel is taking which are
very explicitly criminal actions there's
no question about it they're in
violation of direct orders of the
Security Council of the judgment of the
World Court there's no higher
authorities they want to distance
themselves from those actions both their
criminality and their brutality and ours
every society in particular more
somewhat more democratic ones like
Britain in the United States sooner or
later the attitudes of the population
can they may not but they can influence
the direction of policy if there's
effort and engagement in that direction
and will be saw in the case of Sweden
explicitly and now tentatively in
England that I there was a comment by
the French Foreign Minister that they
might be contemplating something like
that in the future I think that's a
direction in which things are going to
go as you know there are already I think
over 130 countries that do recognize
Palestine Sweden is the first one in
Europe and there will be great efforts
to prevent this on the part of the
United States and its close allies if
you look over the international scene
the strongest support for Israeli
policies has been what's called the
Anglosphere of Britain's the offshoots
of Britain the United States Canada and
Australia and I think that's where the
resistance will remain but they can't
divorce themselves in the world if
there's more moves in this direction in
Europe it will strengthen efforts in the
United States pressure the US government
to join the world on this issue
and that can have an impact
can I ask everybody to silence their
phones please
is that a boot of Al mayadeen television
in Beirut mr. Chun I'm from Al mayadeen
television in Beirut mr. Chomsky you
said a few years ago that democracy is
forbidden in the Middle East and it's
forbidden by the United States this was
your statement in 2011 do you still
believe like that and how do you
envisage the future of the area after
the emergence of Isis ISIL and nusra and
their affiliates well we have a good
indication of what the u.s. added to it
is towards democracy it's many examples
so for example that was the most
dramatic is the one truly free election
that took place in the Arab world there
are elections but they're always
constrained in one or another way
there was a very free election carefully
monitored declared to be free and fair
in January 2006 in Palestine how did the
US respond by immediately moving to
punish the Palestinians for voting the
wrong way in a free election of the u.s.
immediately began to organize a military
coup to try to overthrow the government
it's preempted in the 2007 that led to
the takeover Hamas and Gaza that was the
immediate reaction to the first free and
open democratic election it's not the
only case free elections are everyone
calls for democracy Stalin called for
democracy everyone loves the Mazda sea
but only when it comes out the way we
want it to and and that's demonstrated
over and over I want to say it's an iron
law but the tendency is overwhelming
I didn't get to the ISIS point yeah I
think it's very hard to predict
I simply Paul Pilar one of CI a long
background in the CIA mostly on the
Middle East leading specialist stated
the United States created Isis Graham
fuller also long background in the CIA
leading analyst of Middle East policies
recently had an article headlined the
United States created Isis both of them
said look we didn't the u.s. didn't
actually create it they simply created
the conditions from which it arose the
wind the fragile Society of Iraq fragile
for all kind of reasons we can go into
but when that society was hit by a
sledgehammer and smashed to pieces lots
of very unpleasant and ugly consequences
of rose quite apart from the destruction
the killings that exiles and so on one
of them was inciting sectarian conflict
previously it had been pretty subdued so
Baghdad was a mixed city people lived
all over often people didn't even know
whether their neighbor was Shiite or
sunny like you don't know if your
neighbor is one or another branch of
Protestant let's say within a short time
after the invasion us British Invasion
the which immediately imposed sectarian
divisions sectarian conflicts began to
arise out of this they're not they
tearing Iraq to shreds they're tearing
the region's to shreds
an extremist fringe developed Isis which
is an extremist branch of the most
extreme fundamentalist branch of Islam
Saudi Wahhabi Salafi doctrine already
extremist this one an extremist branch
of it
it's military victories are quite
startling it's hard to think of anything
like it
um the Iraqi army is three hundred and
fifty thousand men
it's an army that has fought bitter Wars
the case of Iran serious war went on for
years well-trained army willing to stand
up for nationalist struggle the arm
heavily armed trained by the United
States for over a decade as soon as a
couple of thousand lightly armed jihadi
appears the generals run away and the
soldiers had to flee after the whole
army collapsed what's that's pretty
unusual event in history of the
Peshmerga the Kurdish militia was able
partly to hold off Isis but probably
apparently the main fighting we don't
have a lot of evidence but it appears
that the main fighting is probably being
done by the PKK the Kurdish Turkish base
of actually is based in northern Iraq
mount kondal the Kurdish Turkish
background and Kurdish forces the ones
the turkey attacked yesterday the
president sorry just for quick follow-up
vice president first accused the Allies
the Gulf allies of conniving with Isis
the Vice President Biden US Vice
President Joe Biden he accused the
Allies yes he accused the Allies of
conniving or helping Isis and then he
apologised how he didn't actually say
they were allied with Isis he said what
he said was accurate he said they leave
the border open they leave ice they
leave the opportunity for Isis to
strengthen itself he did say that says
the same thing we would like to give
everybody it's what they say is they
will not an honor that they will not
focus on Isis unless
it also strikes at their enemies their
enemies are first of all the Assad
regime and secondly the Kurdish the PKK
and the Kurdish linked Kurdish groups in
Syria which they don't want to expand
and gain autonomy I'm in the air tahan
virtually says it and directly Abidin
almost didn't have to say on the actions
demonstrated once we give everybody a
chance we can have some time for
follow-up go ahead please professor
Jones gets very very wonderful to have
you here again do you see any connection
between US policy towards Palestine and
US policies elsewhere in the globe any
similarity of interest or tendency and
you also said that the u.s. population
would have to exert pressure on the
government but in one of your writings
you spoke of the the media's acceptable
spectrum of dissent and since the media
appears to be the mainstream media very
largely in support of whatever the US
policy is how would the information get
to the American people so that they
could the government well to begin with
the second point and remind me if I
forget the first because it's an import
it's important that's what you just
described this true of every issue it
was true of the war in Vietnam it was
true of the Central American wars it was
true of South Africa it was true of the
humor a struggle I was involved in for
many years you pick it it's always the
same the media pretty much hewed to the
government's line little pushing
stretching here and there but it's
pretty overwhelming so it takes a
Vietnam which finally ultimately became
a major popular movement which did
influence policy how did it begin I can
tell you I was involved
in the early 1960s I started trying to
give talks about Vietnam actually I live
in Boston which is probably the most
liberal city in the country the
university's academics professionals I
would give talks in somebody's living
room or in a church with maybe four
people we'd have to if we tried to talk
about it we'd have to bring in half a
dozen other issues to try to get a small
group of people to show up by 1965
October 1965 the anti-war activists
decided to join in the first
international day of protest October 15
1965 was called as an international day
of protest against the war in Vietnam
there were big demonstrations all over
the world and we decided to try to have
a demonstration in Boston on the Boston
Common that's the standard place for
public meetings and so on it was broken
up violently I was supposed to be one of
the speakers nobody could hear any of
the speakers the only reason we weren't
killed was there were lots of State
Police around we didn't like what we
were saying but didn't want bloodshed on
the Boston Common you take a look at the
Boston Globe the next day the leading
liberal newspaper in the country bitter
denunciation of the demonstrators how
dare these unpatriotic demonstrators say
let's not bomb North Vietnam and so on
Congress the same liberal congressman
Mike Mansfield others same denunciations
the next international day of protest
was in March 1966 we realized we
couldn't have a public open protest so
we organized it in a church Church was
attacked in cans tomatoes and you have
to remember what was happening then in
1966 there were a quarter of a million
homes 300,000 American troops in South
Vietnam South Vietnam had been
practically destroyed by then and the
war was expanding the North Vietnam and
though it wasn't known then into
Cambodia and Laos
at that point it was still though it was
almost impossible to have a public
protest without violence well a couple
of years later things have changed and
the same is true in every other issue
actually I testified at the United
Nations on East Timor in 1978 the press
wouldn't even come they didn't want to
hear about it
the US was providing all of almost all
of the arms to Indonesia for a huge
massacre virtually genocide 'el but the
press just wasn't interested and who
cares
no but finally it got out you know there
was significant pressure or something
happened it can be the same this way on
the first issue the US policy is like
that of every other great power there
are what are called national interests
they have nothing to do with the nation
they have to do with centers of power
within the nation so the national
interest is not to protect the
population it's easy to demonstrate that
it won't go through the details but
policy is designed for the to protect
and expand state power and the power of
concentrated the the domestic
concentration of powers in the United
States that's mostly the corporate
sector various sectors of it and
policies designed for that end well you
look at the history of us-israel
relations and it conforms pretty well to
that in 1948 of the Pentagon the Joint
Chiefs of Staff military were quite
impressed by Israel's military victories
and they described Israel as potentially
a significant US base in the Middle East
in fact they described that Israel as
the second largest military force after
Turkey native NATO a member and a
potential valued alloy the very
significant to the you know the most
significant issue the United States is
the oil reserves of the region they were
stupendous source of strategic power
greatest material fries in world history
mostly in Saudi Arabia also in the
Emirates but the a lot of documents have
been released for Saudi Arabia made it
pretty clear that they were not going to
object the US support for for Israel
they had their own reasons which we
could go into but and so I continued I
was not a it was a not a very intimate
relationship and there were conflicts
like in 56
but in 1958 when there was a real
problem for the US and Britain in the
Middle East what happened is that in
Iraq the U the British run government
was overthrown by a military coup that
was the first break in the
anglo-american
condominium over Middle East oil and
that was taken very seriously the u.s.
sent troops to Lebanon they were
apparently armed with nuclear weapons
there were the British sent troops to
Jordan it was quite a major reaction to
that Israel was the only state that
cooperated with the United States he
looked at the internal US records which
were Declassified they recognized that
Israel was the one cooperative state in
fact the CIA came out with an analysis
in fifty-eight saying that support for
Israel is a logical corollary of our
opposition to what they call radical
Arab nationalism radical means
independent that was the real enemy
banana was an asura see June 1967 it was
a major change Israel performed a huge
service to the United States enormous
and US policy toward Israel totally
changed and reached its pretty much its
present state what happened if you look
back was there was a major conflict
between two forces in the Arab world
radical Islamic fundamentalism based in
Saudi Arabia and secular nationalism
based in Egypt during Britain's
dominance of the region it had generally
supported radical Islamic fundamentalism
and the u.s. took that over for good
reasons the real enemies secular
nationalism they don't mind radical
fundamentalism and there was a war going
on in Yemen between Saudi Arabia and
Egypt Israel pretty much smashed secular
nationalism was tremendous gift both to
Saudi Arabia and to the United States
and it's solidified a relationship that
was already reasonably friendly and
created essentially the current
situation I
there's no time to run through the rest
of the record but it's essentially like
that actually we saw an interesting
illustration of it just a couple of
weeks ago you remember in the midst of
Operation protective edge when Israel
was smashing Gaza the attack was so
extreme they were beginning to run out
of ammunitions and it's a very heavily
armed country so they appealed of the
United States for more munitions and
munitions were in fact transferred to
Israel by the Pentagon in the middle of
the fighting they were transferred from
stocks that the United States pre
physicians in Israel for use by US
forces that's one of innumerable
indications of the nature of the
Alliance and there's much more like this
one of the most interesting leaks from
WikiLeaks which didn't get the attention
it should of was a list of highly
significant strategic locations so
significant for the u.s. that we have to
protect them at all costs one of them
was right outside Haifa Rafael military
industries which is a major advanced
military industrial installation one of
the places where they pioneered drone
technology for example I so closely
linked to the United States that
Raffaele actually transferred its
business operations to Washington where
the money is very tight linkages the
same with capital flows and many other
things so the United States is pursuing
the interest you'd expect of a great
power on the other hand what the
Palestinians offer the United States
they're weak they're powerless they have
no wealth they have only the most habit
support from these Arab rulers you know
they have to make some gestures support
to quiet their own populations but
nothing real so no power no wealth
therefore no rights those are we may not
like it but those are the laws of
international relations the gentleman in
the checkered shirt and then we have
time for only one or two more please hi
professor Chomsky my name is Sherman
Bryce the South African Broadcasting I
wonder if you're aware of the passing on
Sunday of the Kenyan African
intellectual elite Missouri who taught
in upstate New York do you you were on
the foreign policy top 100 global
thinkers listening 2005 and he shared
some of the strands to your thinking on
on the Arab is the the
palestinian-israeli conflict I wonder if
you could share a few thoughts on the
occasion of his passing and he's passing
and all your experiences which died a
few days ago Sunday your very important
intellectual I mean I would like to
answer your question but before doing it
I would want to look back and read it
carefully because it's memories I don't
like to talk about them but he wrote
very influential and important work on
this and other issues hi my name is Sam
azzam aren't from Al Arabiya Hadid
newspaper my question is regarding PBS
and your position on BDS and especially
in America and the fact that they
talking about mainly about institutions
and cultural and academic boycott thank
you
well BDS is a it's not a principle
that's a tactic it's a collection of
tactics
anyone who's involved in any form of
activism it is second nature to ask a
simple question about tactics are they
going to work that's the question you
ask about tactics what are you trying to
achieve and is a particular choice of
tactics likely to succeed or is a choice
of fact it's likely to backfire which
kind of happened so for example take
Vietnam again at the peak of popular
opposition around 1970 a lot of young
people in the United States were so
angry and desperate that they wanted to
do something really extreme and not just
try to carry out educational programs or
influence Congress or support resistance
or whatever but to march down Main
Street and smash up banks and weathermen
that was a tactic the Vietnamese were
strongly opposed to it because they
could understand something that tactic
is going to a lien 8.the a population
and it's going to lead to increasing
support for violence and terror so
that's the wrong tactic you can
understand the motivation but that
doesn't make it the right tactic and
that that's general the BDS movement
unfortunately has failed to understand
this lesson adequately other movements
have these are sensible tactics if they
are selected in such a way as to have a
positive effect not a negative effect
now first of all it's not BDS it's BD
sanctions come from States and we have
not reached the point in Palestinian
solidarity where states are taking
actions the one major exception to this
and it's an important one partial
exception is the European Union
directive to break relations with
institutions and gate involved in the
occupied territories
that's significant if implemented
the Presbyterian Church in the United
States took a similar resolution that's
boycott and divestment and crucially it
was aimed also at US multinationals that
are involved in the occupation and
that's significant
where BD type actions are taken to make
life uncomfortable for Israelis they may
have some value but it's not really
where the core of the problem lies they
have to change US policy and it's
possible and if you look at the you take
a look at the BD incidentally these
actions were going on before the BDS
movement was formed so these are tactics
that many of us have been using for
years the BDS movement itself has three
principles they varied little in
formulation but basically sanction and
boycott boycott BDS actions against
Israel as long as it maintains the
control of the occupied territories
that's the first the second is as long
as there is discrimination against
Palestinians within Israel the third is
until Israel allows the refugees to
return all right now if you're an
activist you ask yourself one question
which of these tactic what is the effect
going to be of these tactics and the
answer is transparent transparent in
advance and it's transparent from
looking at the record actions directed
against the occupation have been
successful effective successful also
targeting European and US institutions
understandable and have the very
positive effect of opening up discussion
and debate in the Western countries so
that people come to understand what
they're involved in all of that's
important you take a look at actions
concerned with the refugees zero effect
if anything's ever brought up it usually
has a negative effect
because it leads to a backlash saying
you're trying to destroy Israel the
groundwork no groundwork has been laid
for it in the middle case of repression
against the Palestinians inside Israel
which does exist in writing about it for
years it's serious but it raises a
question why not boycott the United
States okay serious you take a look at
african-american history in the United
States I won't go through it but it's
protest 500 years and there's maybe
since the first slaves came and a couple
of decades literally when there was a
more or less opportunity for freedom and
this isn't one of them raises that
question well maybe there are answers to
that question you have to lay the
groundwork for in educational and
organizational activities and that
hasn't been done the result is that
actions of that kind have usually led to
a backlash which is harmful to the
Palestinians these are the kinds of
questions you have to ask about tactics
all the time as I said it's second
nature and activist groups you don't
just say look I I like this it makes me
feel good it's right in principle
somehow you have to ask what's the
impact on the victims that's the
question you constantly have to ask and
that should be the guiding principle you
kind of debate and discussion about it
but that should be the guideline Thank
You professor okay I think we just have
time for one more question I'm very
sorry but there will be a Q&A at the end
of the other session please thank you
very much I'm Christopher Rotenberg with
the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten
thanks for taking my question you were
talking about why the u.s. behaves the
way it does towards Israel now that the
u.s. is becoming more and more self
reliant on oil and other fossil fuels
how can that change the geopolitics of
the region and in particular the u.s.
behavior towards Israel I don't think
it'll change at all
please please go ahead okay hello I'm
Anna from Armenia
first of all professor Chomsky I wanted
to thank you for your brilliant
contribution to science and for your
unyielding political activism we admire
you in my country Armenia very much for
that you are not afraid to raise your
voice even risking being unpopular and I
think you became even more popular after
that my question is this there were some
reports about genocidal massacres in
Middle East and also in Iraq and Syria
towards Kurds and Yazidis and speaking
of genocidal issues I can't but remember
first genocide of 20th century Armenian
Genocide in 1915 when the term itself
genocide by Raphael Lemkin was used
first when it was created when he
referred to Armenian Genocide being
deeply shaken by that next year we will
mark 100 years this horrible event
happened what's your stand about this
well let me first talk about the oil I
don't brief answer I don't think it'll
have any effect at all and we have good
reasons to assume that in the 1950s the
United States was the major oil producer
in the world didn't use Middle East oil
it was exporting oil policies are
exactly the same and if you look through
the record say take a win Alaska oil
came on stream finally after the rise in
oil prices in the early 70s at which the
US was not opposed to incidentally
because US corporations gained US
producers gain of the Alaskan oil mostly
went to Asia you take a look at the
Keystone XL pipeline the big excitement
now if it's a built the oil that goes to
the Louisiana refineries are probably
going to go somewhere else not to the
United States the issue all along has
not been access it's been controlled and
that's quite different if the US was
running a hundred percent on solar
energy I think would have the same
policy storage the Middle East
you want a it's
it's a very powerful instrument of
control to have your hand on the spicket
and that's been understood so you go
back 1950 roughly George Kennan leading
creator of the modern international
political system he explained internally
that if the United States controls
Middle East oil it will have veto power
over Japanese actions because they'll
control Japan's energy resources he'd
come right up to the present as big
native Brzezinski one of the main
planners it was kind of critical about
the invasion of Iraq but he nevertheless
said that a good side of it would be
that if it worked on the US could
control Iraqi oil which didn't need it
would have critical leverage over its
European allies allies means potential
enemies if they got to keep them under
control that's great power politics and
all the way through that's been true
it's still a huge resource huge
potential resource and control over it
and where it goes is of significant
instrument in world affairs so I
personally don't think that the in you
know the u.s. is now becoming again a
major exporter which is a disaster for
the world and we should not forget that
we are really playing with fire every
drop of oil that's extracted from the
ground is another blow in the coffin of
the human species
we're coming pretty close to a precipice
where we're going to destroy the
conditions for decent existence and
unless most of that oil stays in the
ground where it has to be the future for
our grandchildren is not very bright
this is constantly neglected when you
read the euphoria about the fracking and
so on you read the business press today
they're very excited because the price
of gasoline is going to go down in the
United States
a catastrophe for the price of gasoline
to go down as an utter catastrophe not a
time for you for you at least if you can
think beyond you know how many
commodities you can buy tomorrow if you
think about savior the world your
grandchildren will live in this is just
obvious but unfortunately it's not the
driving force in policy anyhow to get
back to the explicit question I don't
think that there'll be an impact on
policy because the issue has always been
control not access what is your opinion
on the genocide which was the first in
20 century well actually I was in Turkey
about a year ago to give the memorial
lecture for run tink the
turkish-armenian journalist who exposed
the Armenian massacres and it's it was a
huge atrocity no question about that a
very complex one so the first time I was
in Turkey for example was around 2000
and I was there to support Kurdish
rights I was there for trial and so on
and among other things I went to jar but
cure where Kurdish the Kurds had just
been subjected to a really horrible
atrocities in Turkey right through the
90s it was awful and this was kind of
the tail end of it and I was taken in
jarvik here by Kurdish friends to I
asked to visit the Armenian Quarter they
are back here was the place where the
final massacres took place mostly by
Kurds and the the internal psychological
conflicts are hard to describe they
themselves were just barely emerging
from major slaughters incidentally
backed by the United States which
provided about 80% of the arms and here
they were being I was asking them to
show me the remnants of a massacre in
which they were among the major
perpetrators the final almost made these
the words but almost a final solution
for the Armenians
in Turkey well they took me there was an
old church one church falling apart no
roof you know pieces total wreck but
remnants of the building were there I
asked if anyone had collected the relics
and they were uncomfortable about it
they took me to a little store nearby a
small store where there was an Armenian
man roughly my age who had collected
relics from the church and that was
about the remnants of the Armenian
community in jarba cure I mean I was
there last year for the run think
lecture very substantial change the
church had been rebuilt reconstituted
theirs at the run think memorial there
were probably hundreds of thousands of
people demonstrating big march through
Istanbul sporting bringing up the truth
about the Armenian massacres the police
didn't interfere or was too big a too
big a demonstration to interfere with
the final it ended at the publishing
house where hunting worked and where he
was assassinated and his wife his widow
was there I was there and there was a
big crowd dogs and so on
it's an enormous change and a positive
one so it was a terrible atrocity but
there's now the beginnings of coming to
terms with it it's not easy other
countries have similar problems I
mentioned before that the support for
Israel is primarily from the Anglosphere
think about the Anglosphere for a minute
what makes those countries similar in
the United States Australia and Canada
these are settler colonial societies
societies where the English colonists
came and virtually exterminated the
indigenous population all of them
not everybody the horrible atrocity have
we come to terms and why would this
might this be related to support
Israel I don't think it's hard to figure
out
especially when you recognize that these
are extremely religious society
societies with extreme fundamentalist
religious elements which take a
literalist interpretation of the Bible
you put all that together and it's a
cultural fact over and above the
geopolitical facts that lie behind this
have these societies come to terms with
their extermination of the indigenous
population it's a long time hasn't
happened have they come to terms with
the legacy of slavery which is still
alive remember you know look at the
number of black males in prison that's
the legacy of slavery 500 years have
they come to terms with it no turkey is
beginning to come to terms with a major
crime and I think that should be
applauded and supported but without
taking a superior stance make very few
countries that don't have something to
look back on thank you very much sir on
that we do have the session in the
General Assembly Hall like to invite you
to the General Assembly thank you
