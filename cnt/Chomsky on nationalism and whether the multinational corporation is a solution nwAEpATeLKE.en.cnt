if one assumes that nationalism
represents a possible threat to
democracy isn't one possible antidote
the multinational corporation our is the
is the cure worse than the illness well
first of all I don't think that
nationalism in itself is a threat to
democracy I mean nationalism is you know
it has all kinds of facets nationalism
can involve a focus on the richness and
authenticity of individual cultures for
example I mean natural if nationalism is
exclusive and oppressive yeah it can be
a threat to freedom if on the other hand
nationalism means accentuating and
enriching your traditional cultures then
quoting this very positive development
so nationalism in itself I don't think
you can say anything about pens out it's
used as to the Cure multinational
corporations yeah that's I mean we could
have an East India Company running
running the world I don't see what that
cures that's you know form of absolutism
kind of like Bolshevism and fascism so
it's not a cure for anything you know
it's just a increase in the power of
absolutist institutions I mean here I
entirely agree with conservative with
the few conservatives who are around
there aren't probably aren't any anymore
but the ones who were around the century
ago
incidentally these multinational
corporations just for to eliminate some
illusions about this there are there are
some very good technical studies of
multinational corporations that that's
one I know is any truck but there's a
very good and highly regarded technical
study by two British economist just came
out recently the best one they study the
top corporations and the fortune list of
international corporations and what they
find is that they are really national
corporations they're not multinational
overwhelmingly their sales are domestic
their power is domestic they rely
essentially on their national
governments to protect them their own
conclusion is that of the top hundred on
the fortune list everyone has benefited
from industrial policies of its home
government and more than 20 have been
able to survive as businesses because of
takeover or bail out by their own
government that's over 20 out of a
hundred that includes for example
Lockheed Gingrich's favorite cash cow
which was saved from destruction by a
huge government bailout well that's you
know that's the top multinational
corporations they're not really
transmitted they're very few that are
really transnational they're
domestically based they rely on the
powerful state and their and on local
markets they do international eyes but
not to the extent that's believed
furthermore most of the interactions
among them about seventy five percent
are in Europe Japan and the United
States that is at 75 percent of the
transactions well those are three areas
of the world where formal mechanisms do
exist
parliamentary mechanisms to control all
of this without fear of military codes
forget title of the book but something
about came out about a year ago and it's
the major technical study of
multinationals moment they're very
skeptical about the whole idea of
globalization as are plenty of other
people if you look at gross figures of
trade flow and investment and so on and
so forth
relative to the economy it's not much
different than it was in the early part
of the century under the gold standard
there are some differences but mostly in
short-term financial speculation that's
everything
