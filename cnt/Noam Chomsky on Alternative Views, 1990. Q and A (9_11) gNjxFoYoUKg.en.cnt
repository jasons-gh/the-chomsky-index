if you were the leader of the country on
issues such as Central America and
Israel and you were the one that was
making the decisions how would you deal
with the problem in the Middle East now
if I were the leader of the country i
probably wouldn't do anything very much
different from anyone else no matter
what I believe and the reason is I would
be under such tight constraints from
real objective power that I just
wouldn't have any leeway there's good
reasons for but so let me instead of
going into that I go into that if you
like but instead of doing that let me
answer your first question what let me
take your other way of formulating what
do I think we ought to do well I think
there are some pretty obvious answers
both in the Middle East and then at
least there's a general framework for
obvious answers in the Middle East and
in Central America in the Middle East
there's been a very broad international
consensus on a political settlement of
the arab-israeli conflict then there has
been for many many years that consensus
for example was expressed in a
resolution that came to the UN Security
Council in January 1976 that's 13 years
ago it called for a two-state settlement
establishment of a Palestinian state in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip a
settlement on the internationally
recognized borders mainly the pre june
nineteen sixty-seven borders and then it
just repeated the wording of un 242 the
main UN document with guarantees for the
independence and territorial integrity
and security of every state in the
region and it's right to live in peace
and security within recognized
boundaries and then it went on to
discuss some modalities you know for
achieving this in that's the basic
framework of the international consensus
well that particular resolution was
vetoed by the United States Israel
refused to attend the session the
resolution was initiated by the three
major Arab states syria jordan and egypt
the three confrontation states it was
supported by the PLO in fact it was
openly supported by the PLO according to
the israeli delegate who is now the
president of Israel
in fact prepared by the PLO notice that
that is worth noting this because that
means that already 13 years ago our
effort had gone exactly as far as he did
in that famous press conference on
December 14th which was alleged by the
media to have changed everything nothing
changed he just repeated the same
position had been saying for the last 13
years reasons why the United States
changed its position but that's
different this was supported by the
Soviet Union it was supported by most of
Europe it was supported by most of the
align non-aligned countries in fact
virtually by the entire world that's why
the United States had to veto it alone
well that's you could argue about
details but something like that is a
probably the only plausible least
interim settlement if you wanted to
pursue it seriously you'd have to talk
about economic relations of a federal
nature between the two states and all
sorts of other things and modalities to
secure it and so on and so forth but
that general idea has been a very broad
international consensus for years the
United States is alone virtually aside
from Israel and opposing it I mean not
totally alone like its supposed by
Qaddafi there are rejectionists aside
from the United States part there's
marginal groups around the world like
Khomeini you know the Afghan rebels I
mean few other groups that oppose it but
primarily it's posed by the United
States that's why it doesn't get
anywhere now that has disappeared from
history on the assumptions of the
propaganda model that's not part of the
peace process why because the United
States was opposed to it and it's a
logical impossibility that the United
States should be opposed to the peace
process so therefore that's going from
history when the United when the New
York Times or any scholarly monograph
for that matter reviews the peace
process they don't include this because
this is not part of the peace process
well that's only one example there are
many others and I think that's a general
framework for settlement as far as
Central America is concerned I think
it's pretty obvious what ought to happen
generally speaking I'm in the United
States has carried out major crimes in
Central America really major crimes in
the night I mean first of all our whole
history Central America's wanted
miserable areas of the
world and it's an area where US
influence has been enormous for a
century well at once that tells you
something you know I me not to think
very hard to figure out what that means
and it's for reasons there are reasons
for it you look into the details you can
find out reasons for it
