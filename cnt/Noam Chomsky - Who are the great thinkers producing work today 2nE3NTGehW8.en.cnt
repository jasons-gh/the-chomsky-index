that's a question I would just assume
avoid you can't pick that out for one
thing most creative work and significant
work is done cooperatively occasionally
you find somebody working in the Patent
Office in Switzerland who's doing
remarkable work although not divorced
from what other people are doing at the
same time I'm suffering to Einstein that
funk array was doing similar things and
so on but typically work is a
cooperative enterprise and picking out
particular individuals I think is highly
misleading yeah there are some who
really initiate breakthroughs but if you
look at the history of science quite
typically the breakthroughs are on the
verge at a particular moment and
somebody may happen to get a little bit
ahead but picking out that individual is
okay but you know respect them for the
work it's good but really we should look
at how the advance of understanding
insight grows and through the actions of
a great number of people who interact in
all kinds of ways
