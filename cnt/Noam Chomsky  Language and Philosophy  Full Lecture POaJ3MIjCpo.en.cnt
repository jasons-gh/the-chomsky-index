I'd like to introduce dr. one
acha who will be introducing dr. Chomsky
good afternoon everybody since we took
so so long to organize this is a
self-organizing crowd promise that the
better society is possible i will just
cut to the chase rapidly there will be a
talk on march first by david simon
creator of the wire another one of these
conversations Angela Davis will be here
on April 18 5 30 as well actually I she
will be in this room and David will be
in a gilded horn recital the format of
today's talk norm will give his talk and
then there will be microphones in the
middle so try to line up etc Norbert
this guy over here big guy is going to
sit here and they'll chat and you will
get your chance so I could tell you a
million different things but look if you
are in this place and you don't know for
Noam Chomsky is you're not just in the
wrong talk you're in the wrong planet so
let's just go directly to him it's to me
is a dear friend dear mentor inspiration
beyond belief so welcome now it's all
yours
thank you I've been asked to offer some
personal reflections about the several
notions grammar mind and body and being
obedient by nature I'd like to comply
but it's and I'll try to do so but it's
not easy one reason is that i'm
skeptical about the status of all three
of these concepts at least as their
conventionally understood so i'll try to
explain why and then go on say a few
things about how i think they can be
usefully reconstructed so take the first
grammar I'll keep here too common and
traditional usage a grammar a
descriptive grammar is supposed to be an
account of a language or maybe a text
that you can use to learn the language
grammars that kind go back to classical
antiquity and they contain a good deal
of information and a lot of insight but
they can't come close to being actual
accounts of a language for very simple
reason nowhere near enough is understood
for the same reason a theory of any
other complex system I'm saying the
visual system or insect navigation or
whatever you want it's bound to be
incomplete to understand the nature and
the workings of such systems is always a
very hard scientific problem very far
from being resolved it's interesting
that it's often assumed to be straight
forward in the case of language not in
the other cases so we constantly hear
that a strange failure of modern
linguistics is that hasn't provided a
complete grammar of any language
complete theory of any lang
when doesn't hear claims that modern
science has failed because it hasn't
provided a complete account of the
mammalian visual system or of the
navigation system of bees or something
like that or anywhere near it and I
think there's a reason for the
distinction and it has a long history in
fact it goes back to a belief actually
dogma might be better that the workings
of the mind have to be transparent for
contemporary philosophy it's often a
definition something is in the mind if
and only if you can it's accessible to
the introspection understandable
doctrine but completely untenable it was
thought traditionally you go back
centuries that the study of psychology
and the mind would be much easier than
physics because it's all open to you we
have to do is look well you can learn a
lot about language from a traditional or
a pedagogical but the reason for that is
they already know the answers to the
most fundamental questions and you know
the answer is because your human being
and you have the human language capacity
which enables you to what enable you to
acquire your language in the first place
from scattered and complex data and it
can help you use the data more or less
organized may be presented in something
that's called a grammar of the language
it wouldn't be too far from the mark to
say that grammars are collections of
idiosyncrasies the things you can't know
just by being human so you have to pick
them up from data it's in a rather
similar way if you have say a manual for
teaching tennis
it won't go into the instructions that
you send from your motor cortex to your
arm to lift up the racket and a theory
of motor organization is not going to
care how you get your ball past the
opponent on the first serve in general
the scientific theories are almost
complementary to the manuals of
instruction they deal with different
things what you don't care about for the
manual and structure of instruction is
exactly what you do care about for the
scientific theory that's something like
that it's true also with regard to the
what's called the grammar of a language
and what a linguist interested in the
nature of the language or language
generally would be interested in so take
one other example there's a one of the
more interesting discoveries of
perceptual psychology not too long ago
is human omens rigidity principle what
this means is if a subject is shown
several presentations of a few points of
light in sequence what the person sees
is a is a rigid object in motion the
constructed image is just produced
reflexively on the basis of inner
resources but the person who sees it
hasn't the slightest idea of what the
doing or how or why and similarly no
grammar of English what is called a
grammar of English I'm not talking about
a scientific grammar no but what's
called a grammar of English it doesn't
even try to account for innumerable the
very elementary facts about language so
give me a couple examples that make it
concrete so take the sentence he
wondered if the mechanics fixed the cars
you can ask how many cars and how many
mechanics that's respectively how many
cars did he wonder if the mechanics fix
or how many mechanics did he wonder if
fix the cars well think about those the
first of them expresses appropriately
the intended thought but the second
doesn't express the intended thought
there's no problem with the thought but
the language is so constituted that you
just can't express it in a simple way
the language design requires you to
construct some more complex
circumlocution well what are called
grammars of English don't deal with
matters like that let alone try to
explain them and for someone who's
trying to learn English that's no
problem at all because they already know
the answer just as the person who's
learning to play tennis doesn't have to
be told how to send signals from the
motor cortex to the arm the verse 8 to
follow the trajectory of a ball that's
part of your nature and similarly a
person doesn't have to be taught how to
perceive a rigid object in motion even
when there's no object then there's no
motion receive it anyway case as I
mentioned well take a take an even
simpler example so take the very brief
sentence kind of eagles that fly swim
and ask what it means it asks whether
the Eagles can swim it doesn't ask
whether they can fly similarly we can
say our eagles that fly swimming which
means is it the case that Eagles that
fly are swimming but we can't say our
eagles that flying swim meaning is it
the case that Eagles that are flying
swim again the thought is fine fine
thought expressed it proper way but the
language doesn't allow it to be
expressed without a complex
circumlocution and again there's no
problem for the person learning English
because the human language capacity
reflexively yields that result just as
it
determines that you see a rigid object
in motion and of course grammar books
don't try to teach you anything like
that they just confuse you if they did
fact nobody even noticed it well it's in
fact if you think about it the facts are
kind of puzzling in each of these two in
the sentences let's say are they are
again our eagles that flying or are our
eagles that fly swimming Eve our eagles
that swimming fly the verb at the
beginning the verbal element the
beginning has to pick up a verb inside
the sentence to be associated with and
it doesn't do it the easy way the
computationally easy way would be just
pick up the first one then you would say
our eagles that flying swim which
expresses a could express a fine thought
if the language allowed you to say it
and that's computationally simple is run
through the sequence of words find the
first verb that's the one you attach it
to but you don't do that you do
something much more complex you have to
determine the structure of the sentence
and then find the main verb and that's a
computationally complex task but that's
the way language works and we would for
the science of language you'd like to
understand why it necessarily works that
way there's some pretty good reasons
well puzzles like that are all over the
place in fact if you open a book at
random you'll find plenty of them and
language has been studied very
productively for literally for millennia
back to classical Greece and India but
until the dawn of modern linguistics
about 60 years ago things like that were
never even noticed and it's not
surprising we know the answer is
instinctively so for practical purposes
it's quite unnecessary even to notice
the fact or to try to understand how
language works apart from scientific
curiosity that is and it's much the same
as in visual perception and much else
further reason is that scientific
curiosity is not so easy to arouse most
of what's happening around us it just
seems obvious so you don't seek to
explain it of course through the ages
inquiring minds have sought explanations
that we have names for those those
quests we call them a religion or myth
or magic or in an organized more
organized and systematic form we call
them science there was a substantial
leap forward in scientific inquiry
particularly from the early 17th century
it's often called the Galilean
revolution and an important part of that
leap that moved forward was the
recognition that things that seemed
obvious were in fact very puzzling like
the example that I just mentioned so for
millennia that take suppose for example
that I'm holding a cup in my hand and
there's boiling water in it and as a
cover if I take the cover off the steam
goes up and if I let it go the cup goes
down so why does the steam go up and the
cup go down well there had been an
answer for millennia literally they're
going to their natural place end of
story steam goes up cup goes down
galileo and others of his period allowed
themselves to be puzzled about that
actually really the first time and when
they allowed them to be puzzled they
found that it's not obvious and first of
all your intuitions about how it works
are just wrong as soon as you begin to
investigate it well that willingness to
be puzzled is typically a first step
towards understanding if you don't just
say look it looks obvious and finished
then maybe get some understanding well
efforts to solve the puzzle the kind
that i just mentioned
about maj motion they led to a mode of
explanation that was given a name it was
called the mechanical philosophy
philosophy just met science so
mechanical science the mechanical
philosophy had a goal that wanted to
dispense with the kind of mysticism of
the Neo scholastic science philosophy
forms flitting through the air
sympathies and antipathy Zand other
occult ideas and it wanted to keep to
what is firmly grounded in common sense
understanding and intelligible the
common sense understanding and the there
was a conception the conception was that
something is intelligible to us if you
can give an account of it in terms of a
mechanical construction where mechanical
means the kind of thing that a skilled
or isn't could construct and that's what
the world is something that in fact a
super skilled artisan did construct so
now we have to give explanations in
terms of mechanical constructions that
we can provide all of this was
stimulated by the technology of the time
this is a period when they were very
complex mechanical clocks being made or
models of duct digesting or the gardens
the Royal Gardens we could walk through
and the voices spoke to you and statues
stood up all kind of amazing things
happen in fact these the stimulus of the
artifacts at the time is not unlike the
stimulus today from what's done by
computers kind of stimulates the
imagination and can lead you astray both
cases
well the mechanical philosophy and
clinical science provided a criterion of
intelligibility if there's no mechanical
explanation there is no understanding
now quote one of the leading Galileo
scholars Peter matcha mer he says that
by adopting the mechanical philosophy
and initiating the modern scientific
revolution Galileo had forged a new
model of intelligibility for human
understanding with new criteria for
coherent explanations of natural
phenomena based on the conception of the
world as just an elaborate machine where
again machine means something that an
artisan can construct and for Galileo
and in fact other leading figures of the
early scientific revolution a true
understanding requires a mechanical
model that's a again a device that an
artisan can construct and we could take
apart so intelligible to us Galileo
tried throughout his life to achieve
this goal and mostly failed he rejected
traditional theories of the tides
because he said we cannot duplicate them
by means of appropriate artificial
devices and at the end of his life his
inability to find mechanical
explanations for cohesion attraction
other simple phenomena it led Galileo to
quote in to reject the vein presumption
of understanding everything and even
worse he finally concluded there is not
a single effect in nature such that the
most ingenious theorist can arrive at a
complete understanding of it meaning an
intelligible count and mechanical terms
actually that turned out to be true in a
deep sense that he didn't anticipate
well scientists didn't give up at that
point the founders of modern science
continued to try to seek intelligible
explanations
famous and important was Descartes
thought of as philosophers primarily
physicists and biologists and so on he
no distinctions among the sciences in
those days he believed that he had
succeeded in fact he claimed to provide
a mechanical account of all phenomena in
nature almost he noticed that some
aspects of the world remained
recalcitrant but in particular human
higher mental faculties and what
Aristotle long before it told the
rational soul and the facts that the
case that Descartes found most
convincing was a normal use of language
what's sometimes called the creative
aspect of language use in normal
language use we produce new sentences
freely and without awareness of any
novelty they are not caused by
situations circumstances but they're
appropriate circumstances which is a
crucial difference not understood but
quite a crucial difference there it goes
on indefinitely there's no limit to it
they're intelligible to others who
realize that they could have expressed
the same thought themselves and this a
collection of properties descarte argued
correctly in fact the lies beyond
mechanism now in the substance
philosophy of his day that may he then
followed normal scientific principles
and here's something that doesn't fall
within mechanism so we need new
principal kind of a creative principle
and in the substance philosophy that
meant we need new substance we need
what's called thinking substance race co
viet nam's which is alongside the
extended substance substance is just
something that can exist independently
other things so we have a material
substance extended substance that we
have a thinking substance that's and
then the next problem is to find out the
properties of the thinking substance the
properties of mind and to show how it
links to the other substance to the
material world actually explored those
topics some of it survives not much so
we don't know exactly what he achieved
because he destroyed a lot of it after
he learned about the fate of Galileo
worry about it so we don't really know
what a lot of what he said were found
what he said and well they were this
post a lot of other tasks incidentally a
very serious problem that arose right at
the time was that this was the rising
period of empire and explorers were
finding all sorts of strange creatures
like orangutang xand the Native
Americans and it wasn't obvious which of
them were humans that it was extremely
it's extremely important point because
if you human you have an immortal soul
and if you're not human you're a machine
so it's quite significant to determine
which of these creatures are fall into
which category and there's great deal of
debate and discussion about this my
favorite actually my fav bed when
there's a very good Descartes scholar of
late Harry Bracken he presented some
quite interesting arguments that these
so-called rationalist assumptions that
provided a barrier against racism you
couldn't be a rationalist and a racist
because you either have a soul or you
don't have it you can't have half a soul
so there's no gradations among humans
there's just a break between humans and
machines
well given the crucial role that
language played in these concerns it's
there was another crucial question to
these creatures have a language like
ours there are a lot of debates about
this action one of my favorites was
suggestion by Louie Racine's son of the
playwright he suggested that Apes he had
a proof that apes are really more
intelligent than us and the reason is
they don't talk because and there's a
reason for that too they know that if
they did talk we would enslave them so
they keep quiet more seriously they
carts followers so called minor
Cartesian devised interesting
experiments to try to determine if some
other creature has this capacity as the
linguistic skills these tests which are
kind of interesting our precursors to
what today is called the Turing test
named after one of the great 20th
century mathematicians and computer
scientists the Turing test is generally
regarded as a test to determine whether
a machine can think Turing himself
dismissed the question of whether a
machine can think is in his words to
meaningless to deserve discussion it's a
short paper eight page paper he wrote
which is the basis for all of this and
that's one line in it unfortunately
nobody paid attention to it and the
failure to pay attention to his
conclusion i think has led to a huge
amount of wasted effort and discussion
but it's enough to point out that the
rather similar 17th century precursors
we're dealing with a much more serious
complication tests kind of of the Turing
test type but they were dealing with a
much more serious issue and not just how
to apply the word think
but what are the constituents of the
world to metaphysical question what's
the world native well the framework of
early modern science did give rise to a
significant and meaningful mind-body
problem so the material world could
presumably be explained by mechanical
science but their aspects of the world
that could not like creative aspect of
language use so you have to postulate
mind soul same thing along side of body
investigate its nature and investigate
the interactions of the through systems
this point of view this kind of picture
has it does accord pretty well with
their kind of common sense picture of
what things are like and its course as
much earlier origins in different terms
the Galilean revolution took the long
tradition about these of these debates
and reconstructed it within a serious
scientific framework at the same time
laying the basis for modern science well
unfortunately it didn't last very long
all of this was shattered by the end of
the century Isaac Newton much to his
dismay and disbelief refuted the
mechanical philosophy that's what his
great work was he showed that nothing
falls within its range that is there are
no machines there's nothing physical
there's nothing material even the most
elementary phenomena of nature the
planetary orbits motion of the tides
that can't be explained in mechanical
terms so to account for the phenomena of
the world it's necessary he our code to
appeal to what were considered occult
forces the same kinds of mysticism that
early modern science tried to expunge
you know
sympathy's antipathy is and so on it was
necessary to appeal to mysterious forces
of attraction repulsion and the like
which are literally unintelligible as
intelligibility was understood and also
as intelligibility sundar stood in terms
of our common sense understanding Newton
regarded these conclusions as
unconcerned utter absurdity so absurd he
said that no serious scientist could
entertain them for a moment and in fact
he spent the rest of his life trying to
find a way around the dilemma he failed
many other great scientists of the day
and later tried as well also failed and
finally the task was just abandoned was
never solved was abandoned the the and
with the abandonment of the task went
the only coherent notions of machine and
matter body physical any of that array
of concept so the standards of
intelligibility for science were lowered
instead of trying to find to develop a
and intelligible theories of the world
an intelligible account of the world the
task of early modern science there's a
much more limited goal namely to develop
intelligible theories theories that we
can understand even if we can understand
what they're about and that's actually
modern science that's a far different
matter from early modern science and a
much more limited goal and I think this
should be regarded as a very significant
shift in the history of thought by the
time we get to the modern thinkers
people like say Bertrand Russell who
knew the sciences very well the modern
sciences he dismisses the very idea of
an intelligible world as his words an
absurdity and when you read what he
writes about this he constantly places
the word intelligible in quotes to
highlight the
the quest well though Newton himself
regarded his great conclusions as an
absurdity others understood that they
had enormous significance David Hume
described Newton in his history of
England as the greatest and rarest
genius that ever arose for the ornament
and instruction of the species his
greatest achievement was that while he
seemed to draw the veil from some of the
mysteries of nature he showed at the
same time the imperfections of the
mechanical philosophy and he thereby
restored nature's ultimate secrets to
that obscurity in which they ever did
and ever will remain that's a pretty
far-reaching claim and I think an
accurate one but very commonly denied
it's commonly claimed we can understand
everything if we just try it was
understood in the 18th century what I
can't be true well there were other
leading thinkers at the time who reached
somewhat similar conclusions sometimes
on different grounds John Locke for
example he observed that motion has
effects which we can in no way conceive
motion able to produce as Newton in fact
had demonstrated shortly before and so
we went on since we remain in incurable
ignorance of what we desire to know
about matter and its effects therefore
no science of bodies is within our reach
and we can only appeal to the arbitrary
determination of that all-wise agent who
has made them to be and to operate as
they do in a way holy above our weak
understanding to conceive that's lock
well if you apart from the kind of
resigned invocation of the deity the
conclusions are now commonplace among
serious historians of science so
alexander quiere when a leading modern
historians of science and physicist he
pointed out that Newton demonstrated
that a purely materialistic pattern of
nature is utterly impossible and a
purely materialistic or mechanistic
physics is utterly impossible to
mathematical physics requires the
admission into the body of science of
incomprehensible and inexplicable facts
facts and quote suppose imposed upon us
by what we observe and discover well
what then happens to the mind-body
problem there's a standard contemporary
view of this it was articulated clearly
by the influential Oxford philosopher
that Gilbert Ryle in his famous book
sixty years ago I called concept of mind
if I can add another personal note that
was virtual Bible when I was a grad
student in philosophy at the time Penn
and Harvard Ryle dismissed the concept
of mind as with ridicule he assured us
that modern science had gotten rid of
the mystical belief that there is what
he called a ghost in the machine you
know mind inside the machine just the
machine no ghost well what actually
happened was almost the opposite that
Newton had exercised the Machine he
didn't touch the ghost he left the ghost
intact so des cartes work on the mind
was untouched and undisturbed by
Newton's critique but his mechanical
count account of what was considered the
physical world that was demolished and
not just his account but any possible
account because he should there is no
physical world so there can't be any
improvement at least as the concept
physical material collection related
concepts at least they were understood
in early modern science which is pretty
much in accord with intuition
furthermore these concepts have not been
replaced by new notions so we're still
in the dark about what any of them mean
they're used so people talk about
physical material and so on but they're
kind of honorific terms they rien
further whatever we take seriously in
our efforts to understand the world just
as we sometimes talk about the real
truth you know not implying that there's
no other kind of truth it's now often
remarked that 20th century physics
compels us to accept notions that are
hopelessly counterintuitive curved
space-time a quantum entanglement the
beginning of time much more but the fact
is that the fundamental problem goes
back much earlier goes back to the early
days of modern science as was very
clearly understood at the time and later
forgotten as the absurdities were just
kind of absorbed into our familiar
science well as locked and Hume and
others recognized at once intuition and
common sense understanding are not
reliable guides and in fact can leave a
lead us completely astray and
furthermore with the collapse of
cartesian science that's science as it
was understood in the modern period it
came to be understood that in empirical
matters we cannot hope for certainty
only plausibility so we search for the
best account we can we can find we know
that however well confirmed it is it may
turn out to be wrong so there are no
firm foundations for empirical knowledge
no foundationalism of any kind that was
understood in the 17th century and since
it was so well understood then I must
say I find it a little odd these days to
read critiques of foundationalism in
contemporary literary theory and
cultural studies as if such a position
that could be upheld it can't at least
in the empirical world it's been known
for centuries maybe in mathematics and
logic but even there it's understood
that the reach is very limited well with
the mercer machine exercised no more
machine now what is there to say about
the ghost lock actually had quite a
sensible proposal it's known as lock
suggestion in the history of philosophy
you simply have to assume that the
constituents of the world whatever they
are have the capacity of thought
alongside of other capacities that are
unintelligible to common sense
understanding like action a distance
action to that contact the way lock put
it back to the theological framework
just as God had added to the world
inconceivable properties of motion he
might have super added to the world a
faculty of thinking this is lux idea of
thinking matter it was pursued
vigorously through the 18th century
culminated and quite sophisticated work
by a great chemist philosopher Joseph
Priestley he developed in some detail
his conclusion on quote him that
properties termed mental reduced somehow
to the organic Allah of the brain that
similar conclusion had been stated by
human others later by Darwin and it's
almost inescapable after the collapse of
the mechanical philosophy mechanical
science its way if you to restate blocks
conclusion without the theological
trappings explorations of the mental
aspects of the world should proceed
along side of exploration of chemical
optical mechanical and other aspects of
the world it's only in this sense that
the concepts of mind and
and matter remains far as I can see well
there has been a persistent goal of the
general project of the sciences and you
can ask why but it is a persistent goal
to try to unify inquiries into various
branches of science to show to take what
has always been the most crucial case to
show how chemistry and physics are
related problem that goes back centuries
it was it throughout this whole period
it was taken for granted that this
unification of chemistry and physics
would have to proceed by reduction of
chemistry to physics that is by showing
that the laws of chemistry that can be
expressed in purely physical terms in
terms of physics well in no way was ever
found to do this and well into the 20th
century that was interpreted as by the
most prominent scientists as showing
that chemistry isn't really a
substantive science it's just a mode of
copulation it provides merely
classification Buhl's that summarized
the observed course of a reaction
quoting a standard contemporary history
of chemistry America's first Nobel Prize
winner in the 1920s chemist he dismissed
talk about the real nature of chemical
bonds as what he called metaphysical
twaddle there are nothing more than a
very crude method of representing
certain facts about chemical reactions a
mode of representation only and the
reason is that can't be expressed in
terms of physics in 1927 a Bertrand
Russell observed quite directly that
chemical was cannot at present be
reduced to physical laws the phrase at
present because he took for granted that
the explanatory gap as it's called in
the philosophical literature would be
overcome as
understanding preceded by reducing
chemistry to physics well that belief
proved to be incorrect the chemistry was
never reduced to physics and the reason
was that the physics of the day the
1920s was wrong it was soon radically
modified by the quantum theoretical at
that point of virtually unchanged
chemistry was in fact unified with the
new physics but that's not reduction
that's unification something quite
different if you look at the debates by
leading scientists and philosophers
about the status of chemistry as
recently as 80 years ago they're
strikingly similar to debates today
about the status of mental entities and
properties so some argue commonly that
the principles of mind and the entities
postulated are modes of representation
only and will not be part of science
until the crucial explanatory gap is
overcome by reducing the theory of mind
to the neurosciences there's a kind of
standard slogan philosophy psychology
that the mind is just the neurological
at a more abstract level and so we'll
get it down to we explain it in
neurophysiological terms and today right
now you read if the thesis of what's
called the new biology that thing's
mental indeed minds are emergent
properties of brains though these
emergencies emergencies are produced by
principles that we do not yet understand
I'm quoting distinguished neuroscientist
Vernon mountcastle he's summarizing the
guiding themes of the decade of the
brain the decade that ended the 20th
century
devoted to the brain that's what they
finally concluded well the phrase we do
not yet understand that might well
suffer the same fate as Russell's
similar comments about chemistry 70
years earlier other prominent
contemporary scientists and philosophers
quoting have presented essentially the
same thesis as what they call an
astonishing hypothesis of the new
biology a radical new idea in the
philosophy of mind the bold assertion
that mental phenomena are entirely
natural and caused by the neurologic nor
physiological activities of the brain
opening the door to novel and promising
inquiries and a rejection of Cartesian
mind-body dualism and so on in fact all
of these reiterate in virtually the same
words formulations of centuries ago
after the traditional mind-body problem
became unform you'll with the
disappearance of the only coherent
notion of body physical material and so
on for example joseph priestley
conclusions in the 18th century which
encoded before virtually the same words
the today's repetitions of the
conclusions of two centuries ago have
much less repetition and justification
for one thing because of the repetitions
the same same thing another is that
they're forgotten precursors had a basis
for their beliefs a solid basis namely
Newton's demolition of the mechanical
philosophy and another reason is that
you'd think that we ought to be able to
understand that reduction is just one
form of unification surely after the
recent history of chemistry well let's
turn to the modern study of language
during the past 60 years sometimes
called the generative enterprise it's
actually recapitulated a lot of this
history
without as much awareness as it should
have had and should have today in my
opinion so much as in the early days of
the modern scientific revolution the
generative enterprise began with a
willingness to be puzzled by what appear
to be simple and obvious phenomena like
the examples I mentioned earlier and it
was very quickly discovered just as in
the early scientific revolution that
these are all over the place and that's
almost always the case if we allow us
our selves to be puzzled by what seems
to be simple and obvious I think it's
fair to say that that that step that
willingness to be puzzled is the opens
what opens the door to a serious inquiry
that goes beyond the surface just as it
did in the early modern sciences the
generative Enterprise also adopted they
carts observations about the creative
aspect of language use at first without
awareness since the history of these
matters had long been forgotten and when
even mentioned was just typically
dismissed as old-fashioned mysticism
without understanding it the actual unit
scholarly literature pretty scandalous
left to see the the generative
enterprise took as its primary task to
discover the mechanisms that enter into
this remarkable ability creative aspect
of language use which does seem to be
one crucial foundation for what
distinguishes humans from other
organisms but notice that the discovery
of the mechanisms it's very challenging
scientific task in itself but even if
you discover them which is a long way
off that would still leave us very far
from understanding how they're put the
use in a creative way that's a question
that's barely even on the horizons of
inquiry well thanks to discoveries in
the formal sciences logic and
mathematics that were just coming to be
understood sixty years ago it was
possible for the first time to develop
quite substantial proposals to show how
the design of language could satisfy
might satisfy some fundamental
conditions that trace back to classical
antiquity such as the fact that language
somehow links sound with meaning and in
fact does so over an unbounded range
again a very obvious fact which doesn't
seem to have been recognized for
centuries in fact until the early modern
scientific revolution I can't find any
reference to it primarily by Descartes
but also indirectly by Galileo shortly
before him this means that every
language has must be consists of a
finite that's in the brain finite
computational system that yields an
infinite array of structured expressions
each of which provides instructions for
other organic systems of the sensory
motor system for externalization as
sound or sign or some other modality and
the the systems of thought
interpretation planning and the like
well by now a fair amount has been
learned about how such systems are
constituted and how they function and
most important about the limited range
of options that the mind makes available
and even sometimes why there are such
limits these are results that will go
into it that provides some solutions to
puzzles of the kind that I mentioned at
the outset that which again are all over
the place well there are many further
tasks one is unification with the brain
sciences that might turn out to be
reduction although very few people
should
be surprised if the course turns out to
be rather like chemistry worth bearing
in mind that physics a century ago was
way more advanced than the brain
sciences are today and yet it had to be
radically modified before it would be
unified with chemistry now there's quite
important work underway in
neurolinguistics difficult promising
field but i think that few doubt that
unification is pretty remote prospect
well still another task is to inquire
into how the language capacity might
have evolved oddly this is a very
popular topic there's a flow of books
and articles pouring out regularly and
it is very odd if you think about it for
many reasons that one reason is that far
simpler questions are barely studied
because they're understood to be much
too difficult for example the evolution
of the varied communication systems of
hundreds of species of bees a second
reason why it's odd is that the methods
of evolutionary biology are not
available in the case of language you
can't do comparative work of course you
have no fossil record that's been
forcefully argued by prominent
evolutionary biologists were just
ignored another even more fundamentally
reason why it's odd is that the
evolution of some system say call it X
any system X it can proceed only as far
as you've told us what X is okay so you
can't study the evolution of the eye if
you don't know what an eye is it sounds
kind of simple but if you take a look at
the numerous publications the real
libraries on evolution of language then
I mean they almost barely try to say
what languages beyond the most
superficial aspects in fact a careful
look shows that with very rare
exceptions
they're not even studying the evolution
of language they're studying the
evolution of communication speculations
about the evolution of communication
totally different matter and though I
won't pursue it here i think there's
good evidence that communication is a
secondary aspect even of language use
and not a significant factor in language
design well despite these problems i
think there's at least something to say
about these matters and we can hope that
in the future there will be more if the
topic is seriously pursued well another
topic in this case very actively and
productively pursued particularly in the
past few decades is acquisition of
language how does a child acquire its
language it's actually quite a
remarkable feat there's a lot to be
puzzled about their to only barely
beginning to be investigated even the
very first stage is remarkable so think
of a newborn infant it's immersed in
what William James famously called the
blooming buzzing confusion Justin
massive unorganized data somehow the
newborn infant manages to extract out of
this confusion data that bear on
language of course reflexively and
almost instantaneously in part
prenatally we now know how that's done
is largely unknown and it's only very
recently you can become a topic of study
seems pretty clear that it's not a
property of the human auditory system
and one reason is that other sensor
sensory modalities seemed to work just
as well another reason is that it's
recently been discovered that the higher
Apes appear to have essentially the same
auditory system as humans even attuned
to the same phonetic features that enter
into human sound systems but they don't
detect anything about language of course
so there must be some form of in
all computational processing involved
from the very first instant and the
course of growth and development from
that point on also are quite remarkable
when study closely as has been done in
recent years for the first time okay
well I'll have to stop at that point it
should be obvious that this is only the
bare sketch of some of the prospects for
the study of language mind and body as
they're reconstituted if we pay some
attention to what has been discovered in
recent centuries and if we pursue John
Locke's modest ambition quote him to be
employed as an under laborer in clearing
the ground the little and removing some
of the rubbish that lies in the way to
knowledge
okay so we're going to take questions
for a half hour I think there are two
sets two microphones here if someone
wants to ask a question please line up
and I'll call you on you to please speak
clearly into the microphone so everyone
can hear okay thank you go ahead ooh
okay everyone hear me I'm not going
anywhere hi thanks for your talk so as I
understand it you're talking about
Locke's modest modest proposal to as I
understand it answer the house of life
and not necessarily the wise so you know
that's that's kind of a departure from
what a lot of us think of that science
can really do for us you know tell us
everything and I think what we what you
discuss kind of shows us that we can't
know everything from it so I'd like to
you know ask what you personally take
from the study of science what is it
really worth to you why do you do it
well first of all it's you're quite
right it's very commonly believed that
we can in principle understand
everything there's that can give you
references if you like but it's a very
standard thesis in the sciences and in
philosophy of science by meeting people
that's a very strange thesis because it
was understood centuries ago that it
can't be true Humes object all the
people who make these statements also
worship david hume as one of the kind of
founders of modern thought but he very
clearly pointed out as I quoted that
while Newton did remove some of the
mysteries of nature he left other
mysteries in
where they will always remain mysterious
to us and he had reasons for it often
it's argued that on evolutionary grounds
we have simply evolved so that we can
answer every possible question that's
part of you know natural selection
selected us to answer questions I mean
that goes back a long time charles
sanders peirce argued that and all the
way to the present but totally crazy I
mean hunter-gatherers did not evolve to
solve problems of mechanics you know our
little own quantum theory so this is
nothing to that and that's we're stuck
with there are things we can understand
there are limits to understanding and we
can we might even in principle discover
what the limits are it's not
contradictory it's hard but it's not
contradictory to think that inquiry into
the nature of human intelligence might
explain why it can deal with some things
and not deal with other things but to
take a crude and oversimplified but
maybe not false example we can humans
can deal with determinacy a lot of
science deals with determinacy can deal
with randomness a lot of work on randoms
but maybe there are things that don't
fall within randomness and determine see
like for example the creative aspect of
languages which doesn't seem to be
determined by circumstances and
obviously isn't random but is
appropriate to circumstances and is
understood to be and what that gap is is
pretty obscure we recognize it all the
time you know but it doesn't mean we can
understand it maybe it falls beyond the
bounds of human science that's possible
but and incidentally this extends to
choice generally not just its dramatic
in the case of language that was the
courts point but so what's the point of
science to understand as much as you can
we want to understand as much
as we can about the nature of things it
seems worthy objective hi can you hear
me oh hi mr. Chomsky what a pleasure um
so I know a few languages and one of
them is a American Sign Language and
you're talking about infants and it's
been shown that even before they can
develop the ability to speak they can
actually learn to sign and understand
quite a few signs so I'm wondering how
does sign language factor into this have
you I mean when you study stuff
languages and and so when you're fluent
in a language I find that when I don't
think I can sign more fluently than when
I actually try to think and formulate
what I'm trying to say so how does that
factor into it well let's go back with
another personal reflections and so it
has to do that where this stuff all
began about 60 years ago there were it
was actually three students at Harvard
three grad students who didn't believe
anything that was going on and started
trying to think about alternatives one
was Eric Lana Berg who went on to found
biology of language we were all friends
Eric started studying thing he actually
it was interested in the language of the
linguistic achievements of people kids
were deaf and blind so he went to the
Perkins school of the line famous school
and in Boston where they teach deaf
children language at that time and for
long afterwards even still today often
there was a very strict oralist
tradition you had children who were deaf
had to learn to lip read they were not
allowed to learn sign and the logic was
that if they didn't if they learned sign
they wouldn't be able to integrate into
the general community so the teacher
would
now being drilling the kids in lip
reading and Eric notice that a Susan
teacher turned to the board the kids
would start going like this they'd
obviously invented a sign language that
we're communicating with each other
inside but when the teacher wasn't
looking you know familiar with that
phenomena but and that it was kind of
left hanging for a long time but in the
last since about the 1980s there's been
serious study of it has been discovered
that a sign language is just another
language so for example at my department
at MIT there's a course on that what's
called exotic languages meaning anything
but in the European language and it's
kind of meant in quotes and one year a
couple of years ago they just use
signing it's just another language the
acquisition is very similar to spoken
language the to the extent that the the
brain aspect the brains you know the
neural aspects are understood it seems
to be the same which was a big surprise
it was assumed by most people that sign
language that signing would be mostly in
the tech community registered in the
right hemisphere because it's visual it
turns out it's the list left hemisphere
same place of spoken language so some
kind of analytic system in there
somewhere that doesn't care what
modality it comes in and some of the
things are that pretty amazing but by
now it's just another language so this
nothing mercy yeah hi absolutely there
are many sign language yeah quite a lot
it's not just one night yeah oh thank
you for the talk so one question I had
was you talked very briefly at the end
about so the difference between the
general study of communication and just
language and so for those processes that
you would associate with actual true
language how separable
would you consider those from just the
general cognitive machinery that goes
behind the way don't pick one world the
cognitive review you know the overall
sort of cognitive framework you know if
you had some machine say that was able
to produce models of sensory data and
try to communicate them would you expect
some sort of you know are there certain
inevitabilities to the language process
in terms of useful transmission of
information or is it hard to say it's
like saying why do we assume that
there's anything special about the
visual visual system let me suppose we
the mammalian visual system I mean after
all if we had some computational
mechanism that was able to construct
models based on data in the world that
why shouldn't behave like the mammalian
visual system of course the insect
visual system doesn't you know and it's
kind of the same with language I mean
it's incidentally what you're saying is
a very common belief or again like in
the cognitive sciences I wouldn't say
it's an orthodoxy but it's very commonly
believed that there can't be anything
special about language it's just a
collection of an array of cognitive
processes you go back about 60 years and
the same view was held the language is
just a set of behaviors like all other
behaviors at that time it would be by
you know developed by conditioned
response and so on and now it's by
whatever cognitive processes are around
well you know it's conceivable just like
it's conceivable for the visual system
it's kind of interesting that it's not
entertained for the visual system and
the reasons we're not entertaining it or
at least as strong in the case of the
language system and if it's just a set
of cognitive processes of why doesn't in
eight of it you don't they have
cognitive processes
it's not the input system because
they've pretty much same input system
for a long time it was thought that it's
because they don't have an articulatory
system but they work on sign shows that
that can't be right the Apes can sign
they just can't do anything with that
data they're not designed for it but
just as we can't carry out the kind of
navigation that a bit an aunt get we're
not designed for so yes you can I mean
the thesis is common as far as i know it
has no evidence for it and it's highly
unlikely it's a if unless you believe
what movie rezian said that apes can
really do it but they're smart enough
not to because they know will enslave me
I can't think of any other organ so you
but yes it's common but there's not much
point proposing and it's a common in the
cognitive sciences and my view is it
ought to be eliminated I mean if you can
show how some capacity can be developed
by general mechanisms great we'll all be
excited just to say well maybe they can
I don't see any point in that in any
aspect of biology Thank You mr. Chomsky
um I'd like to touch on just kind of
going back to what he said about the
difference between communication and the
study of language and how you think
because as I understand it some
neurologists believe that a lot of
emotional communication comes from kind
of a musical expression in the right
brain well more data based communication
comes from language in the left brain
how do you think your concept of
language explains how language can
express emotion in communication well
you know it's kinda took another dogma
that language and communication are
about the same thing but if you think
about it it's extremely implausible but
for one thing almost any behavior you
carry out communicate something a
gesture the hairstyle
you know almost anything so sure
language behavior also communicated
something the first of all beyond that
almost all language is not involved in
communication and we all know that I
mean you can't go one minute without
talking to yourself and it takes a
tremendous effort of will not to be
doing whatever you're doing when what's
going on in your head well that's
plainly not communication you're doing
it yourself that's about ninety-nine
point nine percent of the use of
language now in fact when you really
think that's never been investigated but
if you introspect about it as it could
be investigated seriously you know from
kind of third person point of view but
hasn't been so you can only sort of
think about it yourself but I can I tell
you my introspections you can figure out
yours but my introspections are that
when I am thinking in language it's not
really language there's just like an
occasional Wordle little long and I know
what I want to say and then I can
express it somehow something sometimes
either internally or externally but if
it's the same for you then that suggests
that some kind of language is going on
in there that is amusing the articulated
language system and it's just kind of
hovering in there somewhere occasionally
bits and pieces come out and if you try
you can say them to yourself or say
about side and you know when you get it
right that which means that you must
have meant something and the
articulation that you produce can match
what you meant but what you meant is in
some internal language and furthermore
even if you take up if you look at the
part of language very small part that's
external you know like what we're doing
a very small part of that is
communication in a series in it I'm a
lot of it is just setting up social
relations telling jokes to your friends
you know passing time
it's not communication in a meaningful
sense of the word communication so I
think it's just a big mistake to
identify communication with language
first I want to say thank you for coming
here dr. Chomsky it's not her to have
you on you talked a lot about the the
limits of our understanding and I was I
was curious about we believe the
connection is between our limits of
understanding and as far as human
happiness goes specifically do you feel
that it's antithetical the more that we
understand to to us to be happy like on
an existential level on is hedonism not
compatible with us being comfortable
with our existence I mean I like is it
seasons necessary rather than
interrogating nature as far as it can
possibly go well I think these are
really important issues after a lot of
our lives way we act but you know their
way beyond the bounds of scientific
inquiry we can reflect about them think
about them maybe clarify some of the
ideas that are involved in them but you
know it's it's just you know science can
deal with simple things it doesn't get
anywhere when you get to more complex
things it's it's hard you know it's even
hard to deal with simple things and try
to explain them and when you do you find
all sorts of surprises that for example
you find that our only intelligible
concept of the world is wrong yes
returning to the issue of language and
communication it seems to me anyway less
likely that the same you made would be
true that 99% of community of languages
in fact not communication and that might
be the case today but I would see that
more is kind of a social bright
by-product that maybe we have more time
for introspection we live in a society
where speaking is I guess less common
less necessary but it seems however that
language would have developed
as a means of communication and that
earlier humans in whom language was
developing wouldn't have spent would
have spent more time speaking to each
other because it seems like that would
be one the the most instant form of
interaction and entertainment and
they're just be less time for
introspection so I just wanted to see
how you would feel about have a
hunter-gatherer tribes far as me know
they're just like us remember language
hasn't evolved at all for 50,000 years
since humans left africa a small group
left Africa spread over the world and
we're all basically identical if you
take a an infant from an Amazonian tribe
that hasn't had other human contact for
20,000 years and bring it up in
Baltimore it'll speak street baltimore
english end up here studying physics no
and conversely so there doesn't seem to
be there are individual differences
among humans we don't see any
significant almost detectable group
differences so nothing's happened for
about fifty thousand years if you go
back about fifty thousand years before
that there isn't really any evidence
that there was language I mean in that
you know of course we're beyond as I
said you know you don't have you know if
comparative evidence you don't have
fossil evidence but you do have
artifacts and in fact there was a big
kind of creative explosion that took
place somewhere in that window and say
maybe thirty five thousand years ago a
sudden explosion of symbolic
representation complex social structures
observations parent observations of
astronomical events all kinds of things
just suddenly happened in general it's
usually assumed you know we don't
directive it is that this must have been
connected with the sudden emergence of
language and notice that it's very
sudden in evolutionary times now you can
double or triple the numbers it's still
a flick of an eyelash and evolutionary
time so somewhere in a very small window
something happened and then nothing
happened afterwards that part were
pretty pretty sure of well what would
have happened whatever happened unless
there's some mechanism that biology
hasn't discovered yet whatever happened
would be some rewiring of the brain some
mutation that caused a rewiring of the
brain and that rewiring of the brain
would have given this mechanism this
computational mechanism that allows
these things to happen but a rewiring of
the brain a mutation takes place in an
individual not in a group okay that's
obvious so this happened to somebody you
know some person and some small
hunter-gatherer group underwent this
change that person had the capacity to
do what we all do internally but without
the externalization because there was
nobody to talk to there's no reason to
think it was externalized at all just
that whatever is going on in our heads
that is pre-linguistic that we get bits
and pieces of it when we think about
that would have been available for one
person well you know if there's any
selective advantage to that say ability
to plan and so on it could have been it
could proliferate in a small group there
over generations it could be enough
people who had that so it would make
some sense to interact but then at that
point you get you would get
externalization but external ization is
a very tough process there's this
internal thing in the head which
developed without any external pressures
okay because there were no selection
impressions on it almost by definition
so it's kind of like a snowflake you
know something that just develops
because that's the way nature works you
have this thing in the head you have a
sensory motor system which has been
around for hundreds of thousands of
years and has nothing to do with it I
have to match them up that's a
complicated process in fact that's where
correctly as far as we know that's where
all the components all the complexity of
languages when you learn a language
that's what you learn a child is
acquiring a language that's what they
acquire but nobody teaches you you don't
learn the kinds of things I've mentioned
the beginning which are probably just
part of the way the snowflake works so
what's then of course once you have the
externalization you could have some kind
of communication so you know even from a
from the minimal evolutionary
speculation and of course it's all
speculation it looks like a plausible
scenario it incidentally has looked that
way to some of the leading evolutionary
biologists to it's hard to think of an
alternative in fact so yeah it does kind
of sound intuitive that people ought to
be communicating all the time well so
they need language were but like a lot
of obvious things when you look at it it
just doesn't seem to be true I don't
have to do this but I think we're going
to take two more questions because we're
running up against time constraints in
this room so one and two and I'm sorry
to disappoint the rest of you but that's
the way life is okay one again I wanted
to thank you for coming today it was
very informative um I'd another question
about when you were talking about the
limits of the human mind um I study
environmental science here and outside
of any of my science course is one thing
I've kind of taken from that is that
there's to me I don't really believe in
a limit to what we can do to become a
more sustainable people of humanity so
to me I really don't see a limit in the
actions that we can take towards that
and I've kind of apply that to other
in life that really as humans we don't
have a limit in what we can do so when
you said that there were that you there
might be some sort of limit to the human
mind my first thought was I don't like
that and agree but um as I thought about
it more I thought it was an incredibly
good point and I started think more
about like if the actions we take our
necessarily completely limited by what
our mind can do and basically what I'm
trying to ask is if there is a limit to
the human mind can do and can comprehend
does that limit human action but with
for right now and in the future well
we're assuming no evolution you know
that we say this organism not some other
organism and the time scale of evolution
is too long to worry about will help
destroyed ourselves before that so
assume that we stay this organism we
know perfectly well there are limits to
what we can do physically like we can't
fly like Eagles say okay and if there
are also limits to our cognitive
capacities that really shouldn't
surprise anyone it would just say we're
biological organisms not angels
furthermore instead of being unhappy
about it you should be happy about it
now because if we weren't constrained
suppose there were no constraints on
Intelligence it would be as if there
were no constraints on physical growth
if there were no constraints on the way
of fetus could develop that you couldn't
get any organization or structure you
get some kind of amoeboid creature that
couldn't survive or do anything and it's
exactly the same with cognitive
capacities if there were no constraints
you couldn't learn anything couldn't
acquire anything you couldn't discover
anything these be flailing around
randomly so we ought to be very happy
that their constraints because there's
kind of a logical connection between a
scope and limits if you don't have
limits you also have any scope you can't
same with you know physical growth it's
because the fact that there are certain
limits on what you can be
enables you to become what you did
become there weren't any limits you know
the germ cell could grow anyway be
anything nothing ah hi dr. Chomsky
thanks I'm a english as a second
language teacher and i was wondering
what you think about this pertaining to
second language acquisition like
language versus communication and with
your first language it's really easy to
know when a person knows it it seems
like one of those obvious and simple
things but when would you say somebody
knows a second or third language I mean
is it when they can communicate or can
they say ungrammatical things that a
native speaker wouldn't say and they
still know a language first of all it's
very hard to know what saying I child
knows in his first language it's very
hard to discover I mean it turns out
that kids know a great deal beyond
anything their exhibit ii that's been
shown over the years of study of child
language acquisition the we don't know
exactly how much it is but certainly an
infant knows far more than anything it's
exhibit ii you can show that by careful
experimentation lilac Lightman and other
people have done this and there's even
some evidence it's not very powerful and
you can't really investigate any further
but there's some evidence that by the
age of about maybe 18 or 20 months a
child may know virtually the whole
language the reason for believing that
is cases of the Helen Keller tight Helen
Keller got a perfect fluency extremely
fluent she lost sight and hearing at
about 20 months and she invented for
herself we now know this is a recent
discovery from old pictures and video
tapes as she had discovered for herself
a method of teaching the deafblind that
was later invent
did and used for teaching the deafblind
it's brought the doma it's a system
where the person puts their hand their
hand on somebody's face like this and
the fingers feel but you know the
motions of the facial musculature and
the thumb feels the vocal cord that's a
miniscule amount of information but it's
enough to acquire in Helen Keller split
case essentially perfect fluency well
that's been studied a little now
systematically and there aren't a lot
there's an interdimensional results have
come out which haven't been published
because there aren't enough cases
actually my wife was did the main work
on this at MIT the there are they found
that they have pretty there are cases of
very great success for people who lost
sight and hearing roughly about Helen
Keller's age but not that about it would
not say if it was 16 months when they
lost it they get no recovery now there
aren't a lot of cases so you can't be
sure and fortunately there aren't going
to be any more cases this was all spinal
meningitis which is now curable but you
know that's what it looks like there may
be more indirect ways to investigate it
but it's at least suggested that the
children very young children have a
tremendous capacity and there's
experimental evidence work so I wouldn't
say that in the case of first language
learners we know what they know you know
we it's hard like most of these things
in the case of Second Language Learners
I think there's a practical question
that concerns you what are you trying to
achieve in second language acquisition
if your goal is get them to be able to
communicate well of course you'll test
ability to communicate
thank you very much
you
