well there is of course the connection I
mean Silicon Valley wouldn't exist
without massive government spending and
in fact initiative Silicon Valley after
all feeds off of the existence of
computers the Internet to the IT system
satellites the whole micro electronics
and so on but a lot of that comes
straight out of the state sector of the
economy
I mean Silicon Valley develops but
didn't they expand it they turned it
into commercial products and so on
but the innovation is on the basis of
fundamental technological development
that took place in places like this you
know on government funding so of course
there's at least and that it continues I
mean the Silicon Valley also benefits
from as all of industry from highly
protectionist policies patent policies
and things like that which come out of
the government that's part of what was
involved in the SOPA conflict you know
so there's an intimate relationship with
the cultures completely different I
think that Washington basically works
for the corporate sector and Silicon
Valley's least technically is supposed
to sponsor initiative and creativity
whether it does or not it's another
question
well
that since its publicly created ought to
be publicly controlled it's you know
after all the internet originated around
1960 wasn't privatized until 1995 that's
35 years in the public domain during the
hard creative development period and it
should be publicly controlled but of
course Washington is not a system of
public control it's mainly a system of
corporate control so god nice we ought
to have a free internet but that means
having a free society and there's
fundamental questions there I I don't
know what it means to say that the
internet ought to have a voice in
Washington the Internet is something
created largely by public funding what
does it mean for it to have a voice in
Washington
you
well
technology provides means for expression
and interchange and so on but yes they
it should be free and open but there are
a lot of constraints on how it's used
and we should not want to permit
providers for example to have any
control over access I take Google today
you know and I can use it you can use it
anyone else can use it but we all know
that it's designed so that it a private
private power can influence
significantly how you access it so the
first things that you see when you look
up something on Google could be
dependent on you know the amount of
advertising or something else it's not
it's of course it's going to be since it
is a profit-making institution it's
going to reflect the interests and
concerns of those who fund it which is
advertisers and so you don't and you're
you know you can go to the 50th thing on
a google list and maybe that's the one
you want but the ones you're going to be
directed to or the big funders
well
the similarity is that concentration of
capital influences virtually everything
that goes on it influences the the way
the media function influences very
powerfully influenced the way government
works and it of course influences the
way corporate sectors elements like say
Google or Amazon present materials that
reach the public so yes there's a kind
of a you know in a in a society that has
very high concentration of capital
narrow sector of the population that's
going to lose everything in different
ways
well III think it
Jools have a right to privacy but that
ought to include the right to prevent
the private institutions from monitoring
what you do and building up a personal
profile for you so they can direct you
in particular ways by their control of
the effective control over the Internet
and that doesn't happen of course the
private companies can make a personal
profile direct you to things that
they'll say that you'd be interested in
but it's their choice not your choice
and I think that has a lot of dangers as
does government surveillance which is
way to lie so yes there's I think
they're all kind of intrusions into
private rights that are the make use of
contemporary technology I mean the
technology can be used that way it can
be as in other ways technology can also
be used so that individuals will private
individuals will have access to the way
centralized decisions are being made so
it takes a WikiLeaks
I mean WikiLeaks is a democratizing
force it's giving individuals access to
decisions and thinking by their
representatives and that democracy that
ought to be reflexive but on the
contrary WikiLeaks is being heavily
under heavy attack by by the government
and corporations are participating in
that like by closing down their website
so that's but you know the Julian
Assange should be the subject of grand
jury hearings he should be given a medal
he's contributing to democracy
you
I think it's just hatred of democracy
I mean you know I've spent a lot of time
long before the technology revolution
liver there was declassification of
documents and I've spent quite a lot of
time studying Declassified internal
documents and written a lot about them
in fact that anybody who's worked
through the Declassified record can see
very clearly that the reason for
classification is very rarely to protect
the state or the society from enemies
now most of the time it's to protect the
state from its citizens let so they
don't know what the government is doing
so it's a kind of internal defense which
raises a question should we even have
the classification system why shouldn't
these things be open I mean there are
things that you know want to keep secret
like the characteristics of your latest
fighter plane or something like that but
most of what's done I think is kept
secret so the public won't know yeah and
I think the same is true of whatever
WikiLeaks exposed what WikiLeaks is
exposing is kind of superficial in a way
you know they like say the Pentagon
Papers that's material that went make
much deeper that went to internal
government planning back for 25 years
and those are things that the public
should have known about they in a
democracy they should have known what
leaders are thinking and planning about
a major event a major enterprises like
the Vietnam War was kept secret from
them WikiLeaks is providing information
on you know what ambassadors are sending
to Washington things like that I mean
maybe some of that has a right to some
kind of secrecy but there's a heavy
burden and I think it'd be pretty hard
to meet I'm gonna
everything from wickedly to play any
mannish but the parts that I've read and
seen I think I think so the public
should know it seems so there's a
difference in content in what WikiLeaks
would be yielding with the Pentagon I
was totally different
and but what the medium was different
because I know you were involved in
publishing I was not as well yeah but
also I had them in advance and I could
write about them actually when Dan
Ellsberg was underground I was one of
the people there were a number of people
who were giving out materials to the
press do you see it different in the way
that they were distributed and that
itself being a kind of threat I've been
the content so much yeah it's different
but I think it's basically the same
threat the threat is that the public
will know what the government's up to
and that's you know and any system of
power is going to want to keep free from
public surveillance that's natural
it shouldn't be but it's very natural
you
it's worse than that they should help
drift
sites you know they refuse to let their
own sites be used for distributing and
things or even for payment at the
beginning so yeah I think that's a kind
of a contradiction if you like I mean I
don't think it's hard to explain there
in both cases supportive of US
government positions pretty much
it's the other way around
any rule and majority limited rights
fact that you know set up that way if
you read the framers of the Constitution
like James Madison he was pretty clear
about it you look at the minutes of the
Constitutional Convention which we have
Madison who was the main framer felt
that and proceeded to develop a system
in which as he put it power would be in
hand in the hands of the wealth of the
nation the more responsible set of men
the men who recognized the need to
protect the rights of property owners
that's why in the constitutional system
the most powerful part of the whole
system is the Senate the Senate was
wealthy people and it was not responsive
that wasn't elected you know it was
chosen through legislators or
legislatures which themselves are under
private influence powerful influence and
they were remote from the population and
that's where the power was supposed to
reside the and Matt Madison was the
House of Representatives which was
closer to the population had much less
power the executive was more or less an
administrator not an emperor like today
and and the reason for it was a fear of
democracy and it was pretty Frank so for
example Madison pointed out and the
discussions that the Constitution
debates the Constitutional Convention
that democracy would be a danger he used
England of course as the model I said
suppose that in England you had everyone
had the right free right to vote as well
in that case the the poor property lists
people who were the great majority would
use their voting power to take
the rights of property owners to carry
out what we would call land reform to
say obviously that would be unjust so
therefore we can England shouldn't have
the real freedom of vote and we
shouldn't either
because as he put it that one of the
primary goals of government is to
protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority to make sure that
the opulent maintain their rights and
the constitutional system was structured
so as to ensure that outcome no of
course plenty of battles about it the
last couple hundred years have been
struggles about this I mean even the
like the 5th amendment the Constitution
fifth and sixth amendments that talk
about personal rights you know right to
a speedy jury trial and so on and so
forth but what did they mean by person
well it certainly didn't mean individual
of flesh and blood like Native Americans
obviously weren't persons they don't
have any right blacks no rights in fact
they were 3/5 human according to the
Constitution in order to give slave
owners more voting rights so that's you
know african-americans that women didn't
have rights affected the women were
covered were the common law which was
kind of taken over under British common
law that women were property a woman was
the property of her father or her
husband and that remained true through
right into the 20th century
not a one until 1975 that women had a
guaranteed right to serve on federal
juries so and where White's didn't have
rights you know kind of property you
know
strictures on voting so person meant
relatively well-off free white man white
man you know over the years of course
that's extended but that's in many
complex ways the 14th amendment after
the Civil War and principal gave former
slaves they were considered they brought
into the category of persons
theoretically but if you actually look
and most of all most of all the cases
brought for personal rights under the
Fourteenth Amendment were by
corporations freed slaves couldn't
couldn't do it in fact they were you
know they were pretty much driven back
into something like slavery by a North
self compact that allowed the slave
former slave states to criminalize black
life which made a criminal force that
was basically used as a forced labor
force up until until the 1930s I mean
you know so yes in theory there's you
know this is kind of like a formal
democracy but and in many ways these
were real achievements it was an
improvement over the feudal system and
more advanced than anything else in the
world but not nothing that we ought to
call it democracy
you
well you know like most
nology the Internet is as mixed effect
I'm it's a neutral instrument the most
you know technology can be used to
liberate or to enslave hammer doesn't
care whether it's used by a torturer or
carpenter you know and the internet is
kind of like that I mean it's very
values it all the time I'm sure you do
it gives you an enormous access to
things you're looking for but it's you
know it's kind of like let's say the
Library of Congress I mean you can go
into the Library of Congress and find
information about know just about
anything but that doesn't do you much
good unless you know what you're looking
for I mean if you want to become a
biologist let's say it doesn't help to
be able to go into the Harvard biology
library and all the information is
therefore you have to know what to look
for and the internet is the same just
magnified you know this huge mass of
information but what what is it that
matters what doesn't matter what makes
sense what doesn't make sense you have
to have a framework of understanding and
of interpretation in order to even make
use of the information and you know our
whole educational and cultural system is
not designed to provide those
intellectual tools so people are often
lost and the internet often becomes a
kind of a cult generator you know people
get strange I you know somebody puts up
some weird things somebody else thinks
it's yeah maybe think that's way things
were increasing you have some coke going
that it's not the fault of the internet
it's the fault of a system of it's its
fault of a social cultural system that
doesn't educate people properly and in
fact on purpose they don't want to
educate people
problem
no it's different of course but if you
look at I just take ease of interchange
among people I mean the the internet of
course your email is faster than letters
right on the other hand the transition
from sailing ships to Telegraph was far
greater than the shift from the postal
service to email you know that was a
fabulous change it meant instead of he
sent a letter to England instead of
waiting a couple of months for a
response
you got it instantly that's a huge
change and every one of these changes of
course increases opportunities also
increases means of control and
domination so it is kind of like a
hammer no of course it's different but
the technology itself it doesn't you
know it doesn't determine how it's used
depends on the social cultural economic
context in which the technologies made
available
superficially very superficially so take
social media and take a look at the way
they're used I'm a lot of the way
they're used is very constructive a lot
of things are done that couldn't be done
before on the other hand a lot of the
effect of social media is to set up
extremely superficial contact among
people so there are people I mean I
thinking of actual cases of you know
adolescents let's say who think they
have 500 friends because there are 500
people on their Facebook account but
these are the kind of friends whose
relation to you is that if you say you
know I'm loris and which they say that
it tastes good you know that's a kind of
interaction but very different from
having a real friend know some of you
can actually talk to and I think so it
has it's a mixed story I mean I don't
you know cause it's bad but it makes
things very different actually I can see
it you know I don't use the social media
but I can see the effects and my own
correspondent so I got a ton of
correspondence used to be hardcopy now
it take a look.this very very limited
amount of hardcopy you know actual
letters and people write so it's all
it's mostly email recently I didn't
notice it but they've pointed out to me
because she you know passes the through
her before it reaches me she cuts out a
lot of junk she pointed out that a lot
of the letters that are coming in there
a lot of my queries or comments or
something a lot of them are one sentence
long and she concluded he's probably
right that these are from Twitter and if
you look at the nature of those one
sentence letters you can see most of the
time it's something that yeah came to
somebody's mind if somebody's
walking down the street never thought
send it out if they thought about it for
two minutes they wouldn't have sent it
very commonly I get queries you know
somebody they saw somebody saw something
a mine on YouTube but it didn't of
course if there's a talk on YouTube than
they're a footnote say one no you know
why'd you say this well you know if
they'd bothered to look up something in
print they would have seen why I said
that
and I often when they asked for source
for evidence I said we'll just take a
look and mention somebody can read that
usually ends the conversation the idea
that you might want to read something
like that's too much can't do that yeah
I'll often get questions from them say
high school students saying you know I
have to write a paper next Thursday on
French Revolution whatever it may be
which I say and usually I tell them well
you know here's something you could look
up and the next question routinely comes
back how can I find it on the Internet
and if I say sometimes these come from
like prep schools you know places with
good libraries educated students
privileged students I say well you know
walk across the street to the school
library and look it up I don't have time
you know I want to be able to get it
instantly on the internet and not have
to think about it well there's that
phenomenon as well I mean I'm not
offering this as a particularly Internet
it's just that there are a lot of
factors involved that's just it it does
offer plenty of possibilities it also
has it can have a kind of a cheapening
effect and I think both exist and it's
true of everything say the same about
the printing press
you
well my own feeling is that a
corporation has no right to have any
political or social influence why should
it you know it's I'm gonna happen to
agree with the anti-government you know
the anti dictatorship policies but it's
I don't think it's the role of General
Electric to support them or oppose them
now they do of course but I don't agree
with
you
they're different they're involved in
producing different products there are
different kind of people running them
but you know it's there is but but but
the principle is the same a corporation
it is not shouldn't be have the right I
mean under American law as it's
developed over the past century
corporations do have personal rights but
I think that's a very negative
development corporations are corporation
is a state created institution
state-supported institution to
concentration of private power there's
no reason why I should have the rights
of persons I mean there are questions
whether it should even exist like what
who should corporations be responsive to
the management of the corporation I mean
theoretically they're responsive to the
shareholders but why not to these
so-called stakeholders the workforce and
the community I mean perfect nothing in
economic theory opposes that those are
social political decisions
yeah I don't think I mean it's true that
contemporary technology permits forms of
decentralization it also permits
centralization it's depends how you use
the technology and there look I mean
contemporary technology could be used
for example to eliminate ownership and
management of corporations could be used
to provide citizens let's say Apple
computers in principle information
technology could be used to provide
direct information to the workforce you
know on the ground so that they could
democratically decide what the
corporation would what the company would
do what the business would do
eliminating the role of management could
be used for that and people aren't
developing technology for that purpose
it could be now there are groups that
are talking about this the participatory
economics groups for example but those
are possibilities for technology which
don't you know don't tend to be used
because of the way power is concentrated
so kind of possibilities including for
coercion like in China technologies used
to control and coerce through to an
extent off to that extent
no it's not false the same
true for the printing press printing
press had a very liberatory effect it
meant that individuals small groups
could produce radical pamphlets could
use them for organizing the Levellers
you know in England 17th century were
made use of the praying praying press
opportunities that weren't available
elsewhere at desktop publishing was big
innovation it meant that small groups or
even poor societies could do their own
publication without the capital
investment involved in major printing
presses that's a big difference and the
same is true of more advanced technology
can offer plenty of Liberatore
possibilities can but whether it does or
not or whether it serves for coercion
that depends on socioeconomic decisions
well a mixed story I mean some people a
lot of Association on the Internet is
highly constructive it's people
interacting that are changing ideas
making plans coordinating activities
take any of the popular movements
they're all a lot of the organization
now is through the internet we're going
to have a demonstration we want to have
a meeting done through the internet on
the other and I think that's all to the
good
on the other hand a lot of the inter
probably you know thought of the
percentage but I'm sure the great mass
of Internet use is at its pretty
superficial interaction among people
which is not necessarily a bad thing I
mean you know teenager wants to talk to
her friend that's fine
but it does it I think it probably
contributes to atomization which is a
threat to the society there's a big
difference between tweeting to your
friend about some of this happening and
having a real personal relationship with
people and I think it probably has the
effect of weakening personal
associations one of them one of the real
problems of the society now is it's far
too atomized what sociologists call
secondary associations groupings that of
people get together think things through
you know come out with plans and so on
like unions or true political
organizations they
disintegrated and people tend to be
atomized it's a get down to a society of
social units based on an atom atomic
element which consists of a person and
it's their computer it's not a society
that's going to be able to function
freely and democratically the tendency
is there doesn't have to be but it's
something to worry about
