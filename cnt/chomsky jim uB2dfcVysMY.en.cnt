is it good think so yeah okay I would
drive back here no it's good no well dr.
Chomsky I'm mom I'm not Jim could see
nasai mom I'm a veterinarian and I'm
also I've become a sort of a politically
awakened person and I've been wanting to
meet you since 2006 when uh when I Iran
I came from Greece because I was very
upset about what was going on and I it
was sort of a protest type of thing and
I ran on an impeach bush platform in
Connecticut where I'm a veterinarian and
I actually got five percent of the vote
as an independent I think the fact that
that joe lieberman was also running
there and he was saying everybody look
at the independence at the bottom and I
see so I think it helps so I I wanted to
meet you since then and you're a you're
a role model to me as a you know for
activism and I I just never had the you
know the opportunity to come in and meet
you and the reason that i have this now
is because of this initiative on on
world peace that i'm trying to promote
and the case for for space is what i'm
trying to say that basically i'm
thinking with this the therm own that
the problem of the you can't unbent
uninvent thermonuclear weapons and it's
impossible i think to really expect one
nation to disarm because the other
nation even if they do it bilaterally or
there's the problem of cheating and
there could be per set
section of well maybe you know they can
get a first strike in and then we won't
be able to respond so it seems that
because it's such a serious issue i mean
the the the Doomsday Clock is only it's
a 12 minutes now or something I don't
know that the i think that the only
thing that that needs they need to be
dismantled or just to become obsolete
and the only way that I can really think
of it or being obsolete is a sort of a
you know a World Federation of states
and in order to hasten this I have
thought that we the only way to do this
is to enlist the industrial complex in
wanting to this to happen and the only
way that they'll want it to happen is if
they can make money off of it so if they
can sort of it change their there- say
destructive the humans are not their
humans are not completely rational we've
got irrational aggressive tendencies and
and and these tendencies of this livid
over this energy needs to go somewhere
right in it if we could put it into
space then it's I think it would might
hasten the the and maybe we'll have time
to so I thought that it would be good
because it would it people can make
money by by going into space and
diverting energies from war or basically
money that's being spent on on on
defense and use that in space and if you
could even sort of make the argument
that we need to to get into space in
order for defense somehow so that you
can use the same sort of
reasoning that they're using now to for
this massive military buildup which is
probably I mean in my view it's
unnecessary I don't know I know that's
why I don't want to talk a lot you're
here and you know I want to get I wanted
to get your views on that reminds me of
something that Jerry Wiesner said about
50 years ago he's Jerry Wiesner was the
director of the research level ektron
exterior president of MIT but in the
interim he was at john f kennedy's a
science advisor and he pointed out once
he was very active and working on
disarmament he said the only way we'll
ever get disarmament as if there's more
money to be made in disarmament than an
armament so he was there for quite
interested in developing techniques for
underground testing and so on and so
forth but there are many things that
money could go into that are much more
significant in my opinion than going
into space so for example we're probably
going to be wiped out by environmental
catastrophe before we are by nuclear
weapons or at least possible and that
has to be overcome and that requires a
substantial technological development
ultimately it probably means harnessing
so solar energy in some fashion which is
a serious technological problem playing
plenty of effort can go into it the u.s.
is a laggard in this both the advanced
work is mostly being done in China and
Germany but that's a natural and this
plenty of other possible development
that can use enormous amounts of capital
that would have a constructive impact on
developing things we need like that
something as simple as say
weatherization or high-speed rail or
again the u.s. is way beyond
to the world you can take a high-speed
train from China to Kazakhstan but not
from Boston to New York know all of
these things are capital intensive
constructive actions that can be taken
to divert funding away from the military
complex I think space is a dubious one
because that's being used for them by
the military so the military is quite
happy to affect developing you take a
look at the reviews for the even the Air
Force mainly of their plans a lot of it
is developing space-based attack systems
you know Hydra sonic hypersonic planes
that can be computer controlled and have
surveillance over the world and drop rod
nuclear weapons anytime anyplace in
correctly no time a lot of surveillance
to surveillance system so precise they
hope that they can see it personal
walking across the street and so on and
so forth well these things are much more
sophisticated drones and so on these are
all being developed and pressure
pressing for more space oriented
activities is almost certain to be they
were diverted into these directions my
feeling i think the logic of what you're
saying makes sense but it seems to me
that it ought to be it would all be
targeted and focused is a production and
technological development and domains
that are really needed badly needed or
we're going to be in real trouble yes
like dealing with climate catastrophe
The Young and the reason that I'm I
understand it that doesn't really I mean
another objective here is if if we're
going to be avoid getting wiped out I
mean as
as humans we need to get colonies going
in other areas that's I guess I am I
mean and in this in this wooden hasten
it by it wouldn't hasten world
government either so I guess
extraterrestrial colonies
extraterrestrial colonies well I'm the
specialist no no spittle by is I hope my
understanding is that that's very far
very far way and by the time anything
like that happens we'll have killed
ourselves hello with global warming so I
think we ought to be focused on things
that will you know be done right now
okay right now I because we don't have a
lot of time and the same store of
nuclear weapons I mean I you know I
think see of course you can never be a
hundred percent sure that they'll never
have any cheating but you never one
hundred percent sure of anything you're
not a hundred percent sure that the
world won't be hit by an asteroid but i
think the probability of detection of
cheating is very high now technology for
detecting potential explosions the
technology for surveillance is already
very high and can be substantially
improved so i think that cheating is not
a major problem yes it's never a hundred
percent but nothing is the that
technology is either there or imminent
and in fact there are countries that
have abandoned nuclear weapons brazil's
got to develop them South Africa already
had developed them and abandoned them
Japan is one of many countries that has
nuclear capability they can develop them
with it no like turn of a screw is easy
but they're not doing it and I think the
thing to do is to move towards reducing
tensions and conflicts and introducing
systems of control which will reduce the
likelihood of their use and that's very
feasible in fact there's something right
this minute
that can be done and I mean what's that
well impot introducing nuclear
weapons-free zone and in fact the most
crucial area is the Middle East this a
lot of claims about its claimed in the
United States and much of Europe that
the greatest threat the world pieces you
ran the rest of the world doesn't agree
with that but that's a Western obsession
so okay let's say it's true threat is
Iran something very straightforward to
do about it move towards establishing a
nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle
East now it turns out the entire world
is in favor of that including around and
it's very feasible there was a
international conference scheduled
supposed to be this right now December
and Helsinki to take substantive steps
towards the moving in this direction the
US called it off well there's no way of
protesting that unless you know about it
and on this the US press has been
approximately a hundred close to a
hundred percent obedient they don't
report it so nobody knows about it you
take a survey you'll see it's almost
unknown unless you're a arms control
addict you don't know about it and
virtually no one knows that a couple of
weeks ago Obama call that off Wow the
reason was Israel refused to attend Iran
agreed to attend but Israel refused so
we got to protect desert you know and
well there's very concrete steps can be
taken and if there was mass public
pressure they would be taken and the
wood intend you know a crisis but it
would reduce it significantly definitely
that there are other nuclear weapons
free zones in the world which if
implemented would make a difference they
reduce the threat they'd reduce the
kinds of tensions that might lead to
the happening one is in Africa and
others in the Pacific and they're almost
ready to be implemented but this one
barrier Washington the United States
refuses to relinquish its nuclear bases
in Diego Garcia island in the Indian
Ocean that's claimed by Africa and until
the u.s. does that the African zone will
be implemented on the Pacific the u.s.
refuses to abandon its nuclear bases in
the Pacific Islands so that one's not
implemented but you know these are steps
that are could be taken if people knew
about them yes and there's other things
like that actually the UN General
Assembly just passed strong resolutions
a couple of days ago and calling for
actually calling for the conference on a
series on the Middle East which US had
blocked but also calling for all
countries to join the non-proliferation
treaty the three countries objected the
u.s. i don't i think abstained three
countries voted no North Korea India and
Israel well both India and Israel are
supported in the in their nuclear
weapons programs by the US yes so the
things we can do right here really not
not far fetched them straight forward
you know no no no utopian proposals just
simple not going to end everything but
they these things have a kind of a self
supportive effect if you get something
done it leads to something else as a
step to step which gets people to
realize what this problem we can do with
it let's go on and what do you think
about
I mean how can people get information
then I mean if if it's so if it's so
controlled I mean it's our it's hard I
mean I've now you can get it it's a you
know you don't get put in jail for
publishing you know I've been writing
about it for years writing about it
right now I lectured about it but so you
don't get tossed into the gulag you know
I just ignore it you can read about it
in some to some extent and professional
arms control journals if you really do a
major research effort on the internet
you can find the proposals and so on but
you know almost nobody has they is in a
position to do that that's what activism
or for activists and organizers are
supposed to be able to bring this kind
of material to a large general public
like you were doing in your political
campaign that's what that's our task you
know if we can't succeed because we
haven't tried hard enough so
in order to lets him have more people
become activists because I I became an
activist it was sort of it was a it was
a decision and I I actually i'll tell
you i i i had read one of your books and
i really couldn't understand it i could
not understand what you were talking
about and i'm not surprised and then it
and i have friends are teaching good
universities you know top-flight
universities who have who used to use
some of these books in their classes but
now can't because students are just not
used to reading it's just not a skill
that people have mastered you look at
the youtube no I get it tonight when I
go home and look at my email there's
going to be hundreds of letters a lot of
them asking questions and they and most
of the sources that people are using our
YouTube were you you know it's useful
but you can't really learn things on
YouTube hunting this you know things are
informal I mean there's no sources cited
you know it's things aren't precisely
stated you know we look next and you
just can't pick things up in a
discussion that you can pick on the page
but the culture has shifted
significantly enough so that the young
people these days just don't worry
that's really serious yeah definitely
but again that's what organizing is
about it's hard I mean like running your
campaign resort things ever yeah a lot
of people aren't going to put in the
effort unless they can see some hope for
achieving something and you know again
that's one of the always been one of the
main tasks of activism is a abolitionism
I'm people wouldn't join the struggle
against slavery unless they thought
there was some possibility of achieving
something which would overcome the costs
involved and there's always costs
involved just that you know just the
time it takes let alone the reactions
you get for trying to do something as
I'm sure
you discovered you know yeah I
discovered and the hard way yeah but
that's the way it's always been you know
as far back as you go go back to
classical Greece you know as a guy who
was forced to drink the hemlock was the
one who was challenging doctrine not the
flatterers at the court you know their
don't get into trouble yeah yeah okay I
think our time is up and I wanted to
thank you very much okay good to talk to
you it's good talk to Terry get our rush
off
