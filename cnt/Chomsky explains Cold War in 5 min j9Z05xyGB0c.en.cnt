on the one hand there's the question of
what kind of society the Soviet Union is
and I think we would I doubt if either
of us would disagree in any serious way
with what Marshall just said you know
it's a highly repressive society which
has a kind of social contract that puts
a floor under certain kinds of suffering
okay that's the kind of society it is
separate question is what kind of a
threat it poses those are separate
tirely separate questions I mean you
could have the most brutal murderous
Society internally which just wouldn't
happen to be a threat out outside you
have the freest it's in fact it through
history there has been no correlation
between that I can detect between the
internal freedom of the society and its
violence and aggression abroad for
example England was the freest country
in the world in the 19th century and in
India it acted like the Nazis did you
know the United States is the in my view
the most open politically speaking for
getting social issues and so on it's the
most open and free society in the world
and it also has the most brutal record
of violence and aggression in the world
now these things are just uncorrelated
now if you look at the Soviet Union
it seems to me yes it is a repressive
and that you know dissent is suppressed
and it's my view to dungeon kind of a
dungeon with a certain degree of social
services now it is also a threat it's a
threat to it to the government it's a
threat to its own population it's a
threat to in fact anyone within its
reach but its reach doesn't happen to be
very long I mean it reaches far shorter
than we claim it to be so it for the
population of the Soviet Union for
Eastern Europe for Afghanistan the
Soviet Union is a real threat
and I don't see anybody can question
that on the other hand the United States
has created the image of a Soviet threat
just for the same reason that they
create an image of an American threat as
a way for us to justify intervention and
aggression in our own bill Maynes
and in fact if you look over the history
of the Cold War I think this is
transparent take any incident of the
Cold War you know from the American
intervention in Greece in 1947 up to
today in the garage WA and you will find
that every single time a Soviet threat
has been created and usually fabricated
to justify American intervention and
incidentally they play precisely the
same game I think many people believe
you can't trust the Russians
never they never abide by treaties they
never keep their promises they're really
not a nation like other nations they're
not part of the community of nations
they're there especially in this the
Russians don't keep their promises
because they are a nation like other
nations in fact the fact is anyone who
believes the promises of any
nation-state is out of their minds or
just doesn't know anything about history
and that includes us and every other one
thinks so I mean you know States follow
their promises if it's in their interest
to do so and the the point is to try to
create a system of shared interest which
will bring about a certain degree of
observance to international agreements
the Russians in their international
behavior behavior very much like of any
other power including us I mean every
Power greater small tries to extend the
influence of its the extent of its
degree to coerce and control and
penetrate markets and so on and so forth
get resources we happen to be the
world's most powerful force in the early
post-war period we were overwhelmingly
the world's most powerful force and
therefore the United States did in fact
we can easily document this both in the
documentary record of the historical
record the United States did in fact set
forth on a policy of global domination
and it succeeded to a surprising extent
since that period the and the Russians
did so also in their much smaller sphere
every society perceives itself or tries
to make its public perceive itself as
benevolent I mean the British were
carrying the white man's burden and the
French had a civilizing mission and the
Russians are doing their international
was duty when they entered when they
invade Afghanistan and the United States
is preserving democracy and all of this
I mean we are as much interested in
democracy as the Russians are interested
in socialism in fact we you know over
and over again have overthrown
democratic regimes if they didn't do the
kind of thing we wanted them to do I
mean there has study after study has
revealed the obvious namely that
Americans support and aid correlates
with essentially with improvement of the
investment claim if a country is willing
to open itself to air penetration and
control our access to resources allow
our corporations to repatriate profits
and so on we will support them doesn't
matter what kind
the United States is opposed naturally
to any attempt on the part of any
society to use its resources for its own
purposes instead of to integrate itself
into what we call an open world system
which means a system that's open to
American economic penetration and
political control if any society
deviates from that whether it's
capitalist fascist communist the you
know democratic or whatever the United
States will be opposed to it actually
there are two as far as I can see there
are two forces in the world that are
attempting to carry out the in my view
quite ludicrous attempt to identify the
Soviet Union with communism one is the
Soviet leadership itself which is trying
to exploit the the positive image of the
of the egalitarian communist tradition
for their own benefit and the other is
the United States the American
propaganda system which is which also
would like to undermine that egalitarian
vision by associating it with Russian
totalitarianism
