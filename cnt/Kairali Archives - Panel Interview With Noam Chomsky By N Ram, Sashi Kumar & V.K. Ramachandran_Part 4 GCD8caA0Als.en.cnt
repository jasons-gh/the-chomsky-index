do you think challenges before the next
moment the challenges and the worst case
Thank You dr. Mario thank you we have
the question we have the question thank
you
first I would strongly suggest that you
not pay too much attention to what you
read in the newspapers and here on
television actual support actual
attitudes in the United States are much
more mixed and complex than what you
might expect from what you hear people
are of course outraged frightened angry
fearful they correctly regarded as an
atrocity and think that something should
be done about it if they are asked and
say polls should we strike at the
terrorists and destroy them most people
say yes so it looks as if there's a lot
of support on the other hand when people
are asked should we carry out a
retaliation in which innocent civilians
will be harmed
the numbers go way down and if
unfortunately this is not asked because
people are not supposed to think about
it but if the people were asked do you
think we should be driving large numbers
of people into starvation and death
virtually no one would support it that's
one of the reasons why these issues are
deflected in the media are not discussed
as for the challenges to the left
well one challenges
the usual one a breakthrough the pattern
of propaganda control help people
understand what is actually happening if
they understand what is actually
happening I have no doubt that there'll
be massive popular opposition beyond
that the challenges are not new they're
old remember every time there's a crisis
it can be an earthquake or a war or
anything else the battle that is
constantly going on a kind of class war
that's constantly going on one
participant continues without a stop in
fact uses the opportunity relentlessly
to pursue their agenda and that's true
now to the you know the privileged and
powerful sectors are using the sense of
crisis in order to implement projects
that they know they could never carry
out because of public opposition a whole
range of them from cutting corporate
taxes to granting the president the
authority to make executive agreements
to increasing the missile defense system
and so on these are all being pushed
through rapidly while the general
population is told you have to be
patriotic and quiet and acquiescent and
call off your protests and don't you
have to disappear from the conflict we
will continue even more strongly than
before well the task of the left is to
resist that and to continue to face
exactly the old challenges I don't even
call it the left I mean so for example
in the international economics
agreements what's going on in Doha the
so-called trade agreements the
overwhelming majority the population is
opposed to them and the task of the left
is just to clarify and organize and
sharpen and turn that protest into
something constructive that's passed
before it's a task now same on issues of
militarization
the public doesn't want to have huge
amounts of money spent on the military
systems which will in fact be harmful
United States as well as to everyone
else task of the left is to same thing
to be a spark to help organize and turn
those natural and proper concerns into
something useful and constructive beyond
that it's to to organize people to
dismantle the system of control and
oppression both in the economic system
and the social system and elsewhere
hello hello yes who's speaking yes
yesterday cut what is your question yes
[Music]
thank you living in India you can tell
me much more about the problems of
poverty and deprivation than I can tell
you there's a takes a food there are
ample supplies of food in the world but
they are not going to the people who
need them in India for example there are
huge supplies of food rotting in
storehouses and maybe being eaten by
rats but not going to the people who
need them and that's true worldwide
that's a it's it's not a food problem
it's a social problem it's a problem of
society and its organization and the
same is true of other forms of
deprivation there are billions of people
in the world who do not have clean water
that's the worst probably the worst
health problem that exists it's easily
within the capacity of contemporary
available resources to overcome that I'm
for you know what amount to trivial sums
these major problems could be overcome
they're probably during the time that we
are talking there are several thousand
children around the world dying from
easily treatable diseases like diarrhea
that takes a little you know a little
hydration
many of them in India affect a large
percentage of them in India well there's
no certainly available resources to
overcome that the fact that we don't
overcome it is a choice it's a crime a
major crime on the part of the
privileged sectors of the world
including India the privileged sectors
here and and the West and elsewhere the
problems can be overcome these the term
silent genocide actually was used by the
director of the United Nations World
Food Programme just a few days ago on
World Food Day when he described the
problem of starvation throughout the
world as what he called silent genocide
that's a good term it's a genocide that
can be stopped and it extends in all
sorts of ways to in the United States
the this very rich country the problems
are there but they're by no means as
severe as they are in South Asia but
they're there I mean there are people
living not far from where I live not far
from where I live right in you know the
center of the the world's educational
center that peak educational center
Harvard University Harvard Square where
is it located you can walk around the
area there are homeless people sleeping
in the streets sleeping in the streets
in Boston is not so simple in the that
means sleeping in temperatures that are
well below freezing overnight with snow
with in rags with no food some of the
people used to sleep on grates that are
used for heating pipes from which heat
comes out the university removed them
because it's unsightly to have people
sleeping there they should people sleep
where it's freezing there are the United
States has the among countries where
there are meaningful statistics it has
the highest percentage of the population
in jail in the world
that's a neoliberal achievement that
wasn't true in 1980 that's a consequence
of the last 20 years of
groans which have rapidly increased the
number of people in jail those are
mostly poor black and poor Hispanic
people tossed into jail because they're
superfluous in the in this form of
society you know the neoliberal
societies you can find the kinds of
deprivation and poverty that you find
massively in South Asia which is
probably the worst part of the world in
this respect you also find in the rich
countries but less dramatically because
they're richer and they're criminal no
matter where they are
hello yes you have been traveling and
expressing your views regarding
ompletely stickered : : lipstick
attitude of the US government assistance
my question is that as an American
citizen your you have the right to
express the older without much objection
but as far as India is concerned the
indigenous people suffers so many types
of competition regarding the freedom
open now you are doing helping
intolerant towards the that keeps many
population because which were against
freedom of Education given by the bold
police and curtailing the freedom of
education in front of me seem to be
contradiction they were producing to be
contradictory I think it is I want to
know about thank you thank you
the United States has achieved over the
centuries a high degree of protection
for freedom of expression in fact it's
unique in the world in this respect it
was not given as a gift I mentioned
earlier in the program
that the leading figure in US labor
Eugene debb's was in prison because he
was critical of the First World War
well that's not freedom of expression in
fact during any period of crisis not
serious crisis the freedom of expression
has been sharply restricted on the other
hand by comparative standards it's quite
high
however freedom of expression it's a
right but remember this is a kind of a
capitalist semi capitalist society
meaning that everything becomes a
commodity one of the things that's a
commodity is freedom a lot of it is
available in principle and you have as
much of it as you can buy and so if
you're relatively privileged you have a
lot you know I think one of the reasons
freedom of expression is protected
because the rich and powerful are the
primary beneficiaries of it on the other
hand if you're a poor black child and
the ghetto and you may technically have
freedom of expression but if the police
pick you up and throw you in jail
there's nothing you can do about it
though you had freedom of expression
indigenous people it's the same they you
know they technically have the right to
speak but the opportunities are not
there and harsh repression can come
without anybody noticing it if they go
too far I'm in a black there's a lot of
everyone's heard of Watergate you know
terrible crime Watergate is considered a
terrible crime it was very minor event
actually because the people who were
under attack in Watergate were rich
powerful people and they had minor
difficulties and that's considered an
outrage at the same time as Watergate a
black organizer one of the leading black
organizers Fred Hampton that was
murdered by the police and the FBI and
I'm in a raid that could have been run
by the Gestapo you know four o'clock in
the morning the police broke in with FBI
assistance and murdered him in dead well
you know that's not considered a crime
you didn't hear about that one I'm sure
the that was at the same time as
Watergate so yes there's freedom of
expression and it's an important thing I
don't think it's insignificant it took
centuries to achieve it
I mean it wasn't until about 30 years
ago in the context of the civil rights
movement that the courts actually
recognized freedom of expression as a
right for the first time that's recent
and it was the result of a lot of
struggle and it's a wonderful
achievement on the other hand we should
recognize as you said as I think you're
saying that it's it's a formal right
which is beneficial to those who are in
a position to use it and isn't available
much less to those who live under
conditions of oppression and domination
and I'm sure in same is true in India
but in a more extreme form hello hello
hello yes hello who's people yes yes yes
yes you're quite right that the events
of September 11th Illustrated the
irrelevance of national missile defense
to any defensive purpose but that in
fact had been known before it was well
understood that there are all there much
more if anyone wants to set off say a
nuclear explosion in the United States
they're not going to send it by a
missile and I guess they have a an urge
for massive self-destruction I mean if
you want to say set off a nuclear
explosion in the United States what you
would do is take a 15 pound the
plutonium bomb and put it in a suitcase
sneak it across the Canadian
we're somewhere and the blow up New York
City that can't be stopped
that no one will send a missile the
national missile defense program has
essentially nothing to do with defense
when the word defense is used you should
hear
offense so every country has a Defense
Department which is designed for
offensive purposes and the same is true
of national missile defense it's an
offensive weapon and it's in fact part
of a much broader system of
militarization of space which the United
States has been pursuing and that you're
you're right India was the first country
to enthusiastically indicate support for
it although the foreign minister backed
off and said he had been misinterpreted
so I don't know exactly what India's
position is but this program there is an
outer space treaty signed in 1967 which
has been enforced
nobody's violated it it it's clear to
the world now it eliminates it it bans
any military weapons in space it's clear
to the world that the United States
intends to violate that treaty therefore
it has come up at the United Nations for
the last few years for a vote and ever
it's been a unanimous vote in favor of
it except for the United States and
Israel which have abstained they don't
want to vote against it but they haven't
reformed because the u.s. intends to
violate it and is
goes along maybe India will go along
next time it is there are programs in
place to try to place offensive weapons
in space that's part of the net what's
called the national missile defense
program maybe I should make a technical
point if anybody believed in national
missile defense seriously they would
understand the dilemma that arises
missile defense program relies on
satellites
it relies crucially on satellite
communication in order to control it
it's very easy to shoot down satellites
that's a lot easier than shooting down
missiles you know where they are they
all move around and so on so
anti-satellite weapons are the poor
man's weapon in any country with some
technical capacity can develop them
therefore if the United States wants to
have a missile defense system it's going
to have to prevent anti-satellite
weapons from working which means it has
to have such overwhelming dominance of
space and the world that no country can
even use the poor man's weapon that's
even if he believed in the missile
defense over and above that their goal
and they say it very clearly it's not a
secret public is to develop space
weapons which function exactly the way
navies functioned in the past so in past
years the British Navy was used was
developed to protect British commercial
interests investment access to resources
control over the countries and so on
that was the purpose of the British Navy
was a lot of the background reason for
the conquest of India was for Britain to
get a opium monopoly which it used in
fact the reason of the revenue from it
was used to support the British Navy to
control the Empire now the u.s. intends
to carry that forward the day maybe's is
over
we're now in the days of space so we
want space forces to protect us
interests investment resource access and
so on worldwide that is explicit policy
on this quoting from high-level planning
documents and they expect this to be
even more necessary in the future than
it is now because of the effects of what
they call globalization it is assumed
that the form of globalization that
they're instituting through the World
Trade Organization and others is going
to lead to a widening divide more poor
people more poor people and a small
number of rich people so that's
predicted and if there's a growing mass
of impoverished people around the world
they're likely to become unruly and
disruptive and the
you know do things that the powerful
don't want so therefore we need powerful
forces space-based military forces which
will control them just the way armies
and navies and the Air Force controlled
them in the past this is the next
frontier for controlling the world
it's completely open and overt if people
don't everyone doesn't know about it
it's because the media and the
intellectuals choose not to let the
population know there's no secret about
these documents they're publicly
available the highest level documents
and the programs are being implemented
it's called defense but everything's
called defense that's the national
missile defense program so it's
perfectly true to get back to your point
that the September 11th attacks wouldn't
have been stopped by this but nobody
cares because that's not what it's for
it's for a different purpose that's why
it's immediately escalated in the window
of opportunity given by the fear and
concern of the public when resistance
doesn't is subsides hello yes what is
your name where are you speaking from
Suresh Babu from Co team yes go ahead
and ask your question well first of all
Osama bin Laden in fact did not admit
anything at least what was reported was
that he described the actions at on
September 11th as legitimate and he said
that when we carry out terror to defend
ourselves the Muslim lands and people
that's legitimate air
but when others attack us that's
illegitimate terror that's not taking
responsibility for anything it's
possible that he's involved it's
possible that he's not involved and we
know nothing more about that than we
knew yesterday the position that should
he be killed that should someone who
says that terror is legitimate be killed
well if you really believe that there
are a lot of people are going to have to
be killed I mean I have to start with
George W Bush and then go to Tony Blair
and then go to your own government
they're all gonna have to be killed
because they all say exactly what Osama
bin Laden says mainly terror is
legitimate if we carry it out so the the
people who are saying that the right now
that the attack on Afghanistan is just a
legitimate and maybe regrettable but
necessary they're all saying that
massive terror is good it's fine as long
as we're carrying it up so if the
principle is that someone who claims
that terror is legitimate has to be
killed
we can start right here we don't have to
worry about Osama bin Laden first and
furthermore they're talking about much
worse terror the atrocities on September
11th were bad enough but what the world
leaders with India support are doing to
the people of Afghanistan is far worse
in terms of numbers and scale and
disaster and so on furthermore the
people who are leading this crusade
happened to be the world's leading
terrorists remember the United States is
the only country in the world only
country in the world
that has been condemned by the World
Court for international terrorism
ordered to desist and then dismiss the
or her and went on it's the only country
in the world that will had vetoed a
Security Council resolution calling on
it to observe international law when
Donald Rumsfeld comes to India and talks
about crushing terror remember he he was
part of a government he was a official
in a government the Reagan
administration which was condemned for
international terrorism by the World
Court and then continued it and
escalated its war against Nicaragua so
the war
terrorism is being led by some of the
leading to may be the leading terrorists
in the world and they regard terror is
legitimate including the terror they're
now carrying out well let's take the
specific case of Osama bin Laden if he
is responsible for terrorist acts
there's a way to deal with it the way to
deal with it is through there's a there
are legal measures to deal with a
criminal so suppose somebody take a
small problem suppose somebody Rob's my
home and I think it's problem I know who
it is I think it's someone on the other
side of the city who probably did it am
I supposed to take an assault rifle and
go murder everybody in his neighborhood
and is that the right way to respond to
the fact that I think he's responsible
no the white right way to respond is to
use the system of justice that's
available find evidence if you can get
legitimate evidence try to get the
person who's involved bring him to
justice and look into the background
grievances that led to the robbery in
the first place they're always there
that would be the right approach in this
case - why is the United States not
following that approach well several
reasons for one thing they don't have
the evidence for another thing they do
not want authorization well the United
States is not going to the Security
Council and saying give us authorization
to carry out a military attack they
could get that authorization from the
Security Council but they don't want it
they don't want it because they want to
retain the authority to act unilaterally
without authorization that's what it
means to be a terrorist State you do not
want to authorize a ssin you know if
you're the head of a criminal gang
you don't want authorization from the
police to do what you do you want to do
it on your own because you don't need
authorization so yes the criminal states
want to act violently on their own and
therefore are not pursuing the
legitimate means that are available and
they are available other countries have
used them so take say Nicaragua small
country it was under attack by the
United States 24 10 years that attack
was very serious killed tens of
thousands of people practically
destroyed the country may never recover
they did not respond by setting off
bombs in Washington which they could
have done they responded by going to the
World Court with a case saying the
United States is attacking us carrying
out an international terrorist attack
against us we want you to order them to
stop the World Court which is the
highest judicial body in the world
listen to their case except that it
rejected the US response ordered the
United States to terminate the
international terrorist attack well of
course the u.s. dismissed that and
escalated the attack Nicaragua went to
the Security Council which tried to pass
a resolution but the u.s. vetoed it well
ok at that point Nicaragua couldn't do
anything it's a small weak country if
the United States pursued the legal
course nobody would stop it in fact
everyone would applaud but as I say it
doesn't want to do it because it does
not want to have the authorization like
any criminal it wants to be to have
everyone understand that I'm going to
act without authorization you better be
afraid of me if there were a concern to
say extradite Osama bin Laden it could
probably be done we don't know for
certain but the Taliban did offer to
negotiate they offered to negotiate the
question of extradition of bin Laden in
fact what they said is present us with
some evidence and we will consider
extradition that's exactly what any
other country would do I mean someone
came to India let's say and said that
you you're you have someone in India who
I think is a criminal so send them over
to me and I'll take care of them would
India do it of course not
they'd say ok present us with your
evidence and we'll consider it then if
it looks legitimate
yeah we'll extradite him but the u.s. it
doesn't want to pursue that course when
the Taliban offered to negotiate and
asked for evidence that George Bush
stood up on television and said you know
we aren't going to pay any attention to
you we'll bomb you we don't want to
give you evidence none of your business
we say given us so given us well you
know that is a way of demonstrating that
they do not want him extradited they do
not want to solve the issue by peaceful
means would it have worked where the
Taliban serious well you know we really
don't know there's only one way to find
out and that's to pursue the offers
which the US didn't want to do so yes
there might well be a way to deal with
Osama bin Laden by legal proper
procedures but the West doesn't want to
follow it for one reason because they
don't want they don't have the evidence
and for another because so they want to
everyone to understand that they have
the authority granted by themselves to
act violently without it without any
authorization yes what is your name
where are you calling from good movie
what is your question go ahead thank you
well the anthrax problem is quite real
someone is sending anthrax which is a
deadly poison to people in the United
States
it's it's in the FBI the criminal
investigation system has been working
spending all of its resources trying to
trace this they cannot find out who did
it they have no idea who did it
somebody's doing it probably somebody
inside the United States they don't know
why they don't know who they know where
it's coming from and people are
frightened which is perfectly legitimate
the number of people killed happens to
be small it's a handful but people are
afraid that tells you something a mad if
they cannot find inside the United
States with all of the police resources
available the source of a letter that is
mailed from they know the
post office from which it was mailed and
so on and so forth imagine the
difficulty of finding out who was
responsible for these September 11th
bombing you know it's true that they
can't find it find out who but that's an
immensely more difficult problem and
they can't do it even the simply anthrax
threat has not been identified with all
of the country's resources being devoted
to it and it's internal to the United
States
so yes the fear is very real it and
understandable and they do not know the
answer is it blown out of proportion
with I don't know people are afraid and
rightly afraid it's true that a handful
of people have been killed but you never
know whether the next piece of mail
you're picking up is going to have
anthrax spores in it and that is enough
to frighten people of course in most of
the world they're facing threats far
beyond that you know but this is a
threat a real threat that rich and
privileged people are facing who aren't
used to threats they're used to threats
being somewhere else I think one of the
ones he implied in the question by
Moroni was what is this linked to is the
ant XK linked to September 11th and
whatever it is any idea the FBI doesn't
know the CIA doesn't know nobody knows
so your guess is as good as anyone elses
the current assumption is it's probably
something in the United States may be a
reaction to September 11th but it could
be some crazy person somewhere who
decided to react to September 11th by
frightening people you know that kind of
thing happens unfortunately thank you
for en we have to end this program now
and I would like to thank two panelists
and Raman Shashi Kumar for their
participation in it and I'm sure the
dementia she joined me in thanking
professor Chomsky but it's very special
opportunity and conversation thank you
know
you
