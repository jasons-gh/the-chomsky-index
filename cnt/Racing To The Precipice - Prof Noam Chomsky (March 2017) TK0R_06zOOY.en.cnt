I know you're not clapping for me but
anyway on behalf of the MIT Center for
International Studies I'm Michele a
director of public programs and would
like to welcome to today's star forum
which I'm delighted to see that everyone
got the memo and first however I'd like
to mention a few housekeeping items we
have several upcoming events that we
hope you're able to attend the most
recent one will be on April 6th with the
former foreign secretary of the UK Jack
Straw he will speak on brexit Europe and
Trump on April 11th yes we've got a lot
of good events in store for us on April
11th we have an event on digital
innovation and Africa which will explore
the consequences of Africa's leapfrog
into new technologies and on April 12th
we have a book talk with ambassador
Celso Amorim he's Brazil's former
minister of Foreign Relations his book
is entitled acting globally memoirs of
Brazil's assertive foreign policy
details for these talks and others are
available on our web site or you can
pick up a flyer on your way out today's
talk will conclude with a Q&A from the
audience for those asking questions we
really need you to line up behind the
mic and we also ask that you are
considered of time and of others who
want to ask questions because this is a
question-and-answer session not a
personal statement session
[Applause]
finally it's truly an honor to introduce
a man who needs no introduction please
join me in welcoming Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
[Music]
first question as always as can you hear
me yeah okay for quite a few years I've
been intrigued by an interesting debate
that took place about 25 years ago
between two great scientists Carl Sagan
Ernst Meier they were discussing the
likelihood of finding intelligent life
extraterrestrial intelligent life and
Sagan who looked at it from the point of
view of an astrophysicist calculated the
number of planets more or less like
Earth and concluded that the chances are
quite high
Meyer looking at it as a biologist said
look we have only one test case namely
Earth which has had about 50 billion
species and we can raise the question
whether what are the criteria for
biological success on earth with 50,000
50 billion cases to look at and he
pointed out that there is a striking
regularity the species that are
successful but a lot of them around
basically are those that mutate quickly
like bacteria or those that have a fixed
niche like beetles and they just stay
there no matter what happens and as you
move up the scale of what we call
intelligence a biological success
declines so they're not many mammals
they're very few Apes the only reason
there's a lot of cows is because we
domesticate them but by and large
biological success declines as
intelligence increases humans look like
an exception but that's a statistical
blip just tiny moment of
evolutionary time lasts a couple
thousand years actually so his
conclusion is that I'll quote him the
history of life on earth refutes the
claim that it is better to be smart than
to be stupid it should what it shows in
fact is it's much better to be stupid
than smart that's the conclusion he also
points out that the average lifespan of
a species is about a hundred thousand
years we've doubled it we're about two
hundred thousand so we're a little
beyond the expected extinction point
well that's the question I want to
consider today is it better to be smart
than stupid was addressed recently by a
very good Indian writer amitav Ghosh has
a book called the great derangement
climate change and the unthinkable and
in fact our failure to address the most
awesome challenge of human history with
the possible exception of nuclear
weapons is indeed a true arrangement and
painful evidence for the plausibility of
Myers thesis that it's better to be
stupid than smart well these are the two
existential challenges that overwhelm
anything else completely overshadow all
other discussions and their severity and
their imminence is illustrated
graphically by the famous Doomsday Clock
of The Bulletin of American scientists
was initiated in 1947 right at the dawn
of the nuclear age in 2015 and again in
2016 it was moved the hand was moved
forward midnight means were finished the
hand was moved forward to three minutes
to midnight that's the closest that had
been to midnight since the early 1980s
when there was a major war scare the
early Reagan years
the reasons that they gave were the
mounting threat of nuclear war and the
failure to deal with climate change I'll
quote what they said is at the time the
probability of global catastrophe is
very high and the actions - needed to
reduce the risks of disaster must be
taken very soon
that was 2016 at the outset of the trump
term they found on quoting the danger to
be even greater the need for action more
urgent and they moved the clock to two
and a half minutes to midnight the clock
is ticking global danger looms that's
the closest to terminal disaster since
1953 when the United States and Russia
exploded their H bombs well there is an
important difference between these two
extension threats if by some miracle we
escape nuclear disaster and anyone who
looks at the shocking record will
realize that it's a miracle that we've
gotten this far but if by some miracle
we do escape at least we know in
principle how to end the plague get rid
of the scourge global warming is
different
it's inexorable we might pass a point of
no return when the damage that we've
done is simply uncontrollable
irreversible and it might not be far off
well the human species is right now
undertaking an experiment to answer to
determine the answer to eric's myers
question is it better to be smart than
stupid and to examine what i'd like to
do now is to examine the course of the
experiment just by picking a few dates
so let's start with today could be any
day but we'll start with today
if you looked at this morning's
newspapers you see a report on how we're
dealing with two existential crises one
on the nuclear threat
Christopher Ford the National Security
Council senior director for weapons of
mass destruction and counter
proliferation under the Trump
administration he advises that we should
reconsider the unrealistic goal of a
world without nuclear weapons that has
been advocated among others by
extremists Peak snicks
like Henry Kissinger George Shultz Sam
Nunn and William Perry and the reason
for abandoning this unrealistic goal of
these utopians is Russia's increased
aggressiveness which is incidentally a
charge that's dismantled quite
effectively in the current issue of
radical rag that's worth reading now and
then foreign affairs the main
establishment journal on global warming
today this morning the National snow and
ice data center reports that the Arctic
has less sea ice at winters end now than
ever before that means more dark ocean
hence more absorption of solar energy
more warming and we're in a feedback
loop and you know what that means
the mean temperature for November was 23
degrees above normal and at some points
in the last couple of months it went to
more than 35 degrees warmer than normal
well that's today's good news let's go
back to yesterday quote from the
Washington Post water temperatures at
the surface of the Gulf of Mexico and
near South Florida are on fire
they spurred a historically warm winter
from Houston to Miami in the Gulf the
average sea surface temperature
never fell below 73 degrees over the
winter for the first time on record
Galveston Texas has tied or broken an
astonishing
33 record highs since November 1st while
neighboring Houston had its warmest
winter on record both cities have
witnessed precious few days with below
normal temperatures since late fall and
on and on
will I apologize if this is unfair but I
can't refrain from quoting one of the
comments by a reader on this news report
he says the Republicans have all this
under control the plan is to have Jeff
Sessions and Ted Cruz's dad stand at the
shoreline with Bibles in hand as as the
sky darkens and the water rises they
will raise their left hand holding the
Bible and command the Seas to settle and
if that fails plan B is to run like hell
and to blame Obama which
couldn't say it's better it's a classic
and it captures the spirit of the times
very accurately well there was a second
report yesterday in the business press
of Bloomberg Businessweek
the headline was the oil boom is back
and all quoted the number of oil and gas
rigs drilling in the United States has
almost doubled since bottoming out at
the lowest level in more than 75 years
of records while two dozen nations are
coordinating to cut oil production and
rein in the gold global supply glut US
producers are moving in the opposite
direction over the last four months
output increased by half a million
barrels a day and if that rate of
expansion continues the shale boom will
break new production records by summer
the US now produces 9 million barrels a
day we're way in the lead well this
illustrates a very crucial fact of
current history the world outside the
United States is taking steps halting
steps but steps towards facing the
existential challenge to survival
meanwhile the United States virtually
alone is racing towards destruction with
enthusiasm and dedication which is quite
a remarkable fact now of course the oil
industry has plenty of help and helping
and moving as quickly as again to
destroy the chances for survival the IMF
reports that the fossil fuel industry
extracts a 700 billion dollar annual
taxpayer subsidy which is not in the
crosshairs of Mike Mulvaney I'm sure and
the industry doesn't take chances in
2016 it spent 117 million in campaign
contributions
while fielding 720 lobbyists in
Washington to make sure that Congress
gets the message and apparently it does
it's a recent Washington Post article
which reports that many Republicans in
Congress do recognize the severe threat
of climate change but they won't talk
about it
because of funding pressures from the
fossil fuel industry that's particularly
true since citizens united open the
floodgates even wider for a flood of
corporate political funding which means
you toe the corporate line or you're out
well that's yesterday these reports are
quite typical of the daily fare pick
almost any day and find similar things
well let's continue to review the
experiment that humans are undertaking
I'll just pick a few recent dates from
the last few months so start with
November 8 that was an important day in
history for several reasons several
events took place on November 8th one of
them was very important second one was
extremely important and the third was
absolutely astonishing the very
important one was the election in the
United States plenty of coverage of that
so I don't talk about it the extremely
important one took place in Morocco in
Morocco on November 8th of the about 200
countries were gathering in it's called
cop 22 the international conference to
try under UN auspices to try to deal
with the problem of global warming the
that with the goal of the conference was
to put some teeth into the Paris
negotiations the year before cop21
December 2015 that conference had aimed
to establish a verifiable treaty
but it couldn't do it for one reason the
Republican Congress would not accept any
binding commitments so therefore the
world had to settle for something less
namely informal agreements and cop 22 in
Marrakech Morocco was supposed to carry
this forward well on November 8th
conference began on November 8th the
World Meteorological Association
delivered a report which in their words
confirms that 2016 was the warmest year
on record
a remarkable 1.1 degrees centigrade
above the pre-industrial period sharply
above the previous records at the year
before and in fact approaching the
desired limit that was set in Paris as
the gold on other dire reports which I
won't read but you can pick them up on
the internet if you want well that was
the World Meteorological Association but
then the deliberations essentially ended
the election results came in from the
United States the conference essentially
person stopped nothing more to discuss
the only question was whether would be
possible to salvage anything from the
wreckage with the world's most important
country the richest most powerful
country in world history did declare
having all three branches of government
committed to racing to destruction what
could be done and there was some hope
they looked at one country as the
possible Savior namely China that was
November 8 the extremely important event
on November 8 the conference went on but
concluded without issue well the third
event was absolutely astonishing namely
the leader of the free world is leading
the world to disaster the world is
looking to China to save it and what's
the reaction silence not a word about it
pick up the newspapers on
November 9th listen to BBC on November
9th and the days and followed and you
see nothing about this there's one of
the most astounding events in history
the world's most powerful country most
powerful country in history
extraordinary advantage is incomparable
racing to lead the world disaster and
the world is hoping that maybe China can
somehow save us can you think of an
event like that in history not a word
about it that's the astonishing fact of
November 8th well that's November 8th
let's move forward to March first talk
about both the world and the United
States in the world a study was released
showing that tens of thousands of miles
of permafrost in Northwest Canada are
rapidly melting along with accelerating
decline of permafrost in Alaska Siberia
and Scandinavia and it pointed out that
this could lead to massive huge release
of greenhouse gases co2 and methane
which is accelerated of course by the
unprecedented Arctic heat wave which
gets radically worse every year that's
the world in the United States the Trump
administration on March first decided to
help the process along by rescinding the
so called methane rule which limits
release of methane from oil and grass
dillings drilling sites on federal lands
so that's a way of accelerating the oil
boom and increasing the flow of methane
into the atmosphere methane is far more
dangerous than co2 even though it's
short-lived there was also on March 1st
announcements of sharp cuts and the
Environmental Protection Agency staff
and programs and also an edict banning
research we don't want to learn about
these things that was March 1st
turn to March 16th the world
a new study was released on the damage
to the Great Barrier Reef one of the
world's greatest living structures which
is damaged that's quite intensifying and
the report said that it's by moat by far
the most widespread and damaging of
recent mass bleaching zuv coral reef
since 1998 with wide-ranging disastrous
effects that most of you know about well
that was the world the United States on
March 16th the Trump budget was released
Environmental Protection Agency is
virtually dismantled it's now pretty
much run by Senator Inhofe and his
associates in ho' four years has been
the leading climate change denier in the
Senate he's an extreme fundamentalist
and his position is that if God is
warming the earth so be it it would be
sacrilegious to interfere with God's
will that's the view in the most
powerful advance the sophisticated
country in the world and that's the
least of it for action and research on
climate of the EPA is actually a small
actor a far more important is a
Department of Energy it's now in the
hands of a guy who had decided to get
rid of it a couple of years ago before
he learned that it controls nuclear
weapons so we'd better keep it but not
entirely the Office of Science according
to the budget is in the Department of
Energy is scheduled to lose 900 million
dollars that's nearly 20 percent of its
budget it's 300 million ARPA energy
program is eliminated completely that's
along with deep cuts and research
programs at the EPA and the
NOAA the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and also a 5%
cut to NASA's earth science budget well
the budget generally is of unusual
savagery even for the Paul Ryan wing of
the Republican establishment which is
effectively running the show now behind
the Trump Spicer Twitter facade that's
designed to grab the headlines every day
the budget if you look at it as a
vicious attack on working class and the
poor lavish is even more gifts on the
wealthy on the corporate sector and
along with a process that you can only
describe I think as the colonization of
America an accord with the Bannen
sessions the voz ideal of a society
which they've described based on
judeo-christian tradition a white
supremacy destruction of the humanities
arts public schooling and on the side
medical research that's the goal towards
which were aiming at home while we race
towards destruction internationally well
at practically every issue of science
journals provides more grim forecasts
those of you who read the science
journals regularly are familiar with
this so one recent paper in atmospheric
chemistry and physics by James Hansen
eighteen other scientists carries out a
comparison between today's climate and
the climate of 120,000 years ago which
had approximately the same temperatures
or slightly warmer temperatures than
today that led 120,000 years ago to a
sea-level rise of 20 to 30 feet when
much of the polar ice disintegrated the
paper predicts in the near future near
future killer storms stronger than any
in modern time
disintegration of large parts of the
polar ice sheets leading to melting of
huge glaciers that's taking place
rapidly especially in the Antarctic
which the most dangerous and they
predict a rise of sea a sufficient to
begin drowning the world's coastal
cities before the end of the century
Hansen says we're in danger of handing
young people a situation that's out of
their control with precipitous rises in
sea level not too far down the road
other dire consequences there are other
studies that indicate that climate
change is occurring faster than at any
time over the last hundred million years
by some estimates far faster last year
as you probably know atmospheric co2
past the symbolic level of four hundred
particles per million that's considered
a crucial danger point that's the first
time in four million years and possibly
irreversible well that's only a small
sample of many such reports they're
constantly in the major science journals
sometimes making it to the media
meanwhile the Republican wrecking
machine is systematically dismantling
the institutions that offer some hope
for decent survival and it's not just
Trump it's the whole Republican Party
leadership at the national level and
also at much of the local level so in
North Carolina for example a couple
years ago there was a scientific study
commissioned by the Coastal Resources
Commission and it estimated that the sea
level will rise by 39 inches by the end
of the century there was a response by
the Republican run state legislature
they passed a law that barred state and
local agencies from developing
regulations or planning documents
anticipating a rising sea level rational
reaction there was a pretty good comment
on it by Stephen Colbert he said this is
a brilliant solution if your science
gives you a result you don't like pass a
law saying the result is illegal problem
solved that captures quite well the
mentality of the Republican Party
leadership a few years ago Bobby Jindal
the Republican governor who succeeded in
sinking Louisiana even deeper into the
abyss
he warned Republicans that they are
becoming what he called the stupid party
the respected conservative political
analysts Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein
of the right-wing American Enterprise
Institute they described the party or
maybe the former party as a radical
insurgency that has abandoned the
parliamentary democracy perhaps a
simpler characterization is the utterly
outrageous charge that they're the most
dangerous organisation in human history
dedicated to the prospects to ending the
prospects for human survival that is
outrageous no doubt but the more
interesting question is whether it's
wrong leave that to you to think about
well I already mentioned the Paris 2015
cop21 Marcos 2016 those are two crucial
examples the 2016 primary campaign was
quite remarkable in many respects
primarily those that weren't discussed
namely the attitude of the candidates to
climate change which barely got a word
of commentary every single candidate
denied that what is happening is
happening with the exception of the
civil moderates like Jeb Bush who said
it's uncertain but we don't have to do
anything because we're producing more
natural gas
thanks to fracking or John Kasich who
was supposed to be the adult in the room
who did at least agree that global
warming is probably happening but he
said he's governor of Ohio he said we're
going to burn coal in Ohio and we're not
going to apologize for it that's the
sensible guy the meat as far as the
media were concerned they ignored it it
was almost nothing mentioned about this
after all it's only the most important
issue in human history and you can't
really blame the media for this because
they're following a concept of
objectivity that's taught in journalism
schools objectivity means reporting
accurately what's going on within the
beltway in Washington circles so you've
got a report actually accurately what
they're saying there if you talk about
something else
it's bias or opinion or something but
it's not genuine reporting
so since what's going on within the
Beltway including the Democrats
incidentally is denial or written or
ignoring or in the case the Republicans
flatly denying what's happening is
happening then you know report it
because it's not within the Beltway it's
not objective well even a sea-level rise
that's much more limited than what's
anticipated is going to inundate coastal
cities and more significantly coastal
plains like in Bangladesh where there
will soon be tens of millions of people
fleeing probably in the fairly near
future these are flat planes which are
going to be inundated many more later
that's going to make today's refugee
issue a tea party the chief
environmental scientist in Bangladesh
says that these migrants should have the
right to move to the countries from
which all these greenhouse gases are
coming
millions should be able to go to the
United States that just fits the current
mood and what has long been the richest
and safest country in the world and also
the most terrified and those who think
it's better in Europe can turn to a
recent poll showing that a majority of
Europeans want a total ban on
immigration from Muslim majority
countries so the idea is first we
destroy them then we punish them for
trying to escape from the ruins that
we've created and we have a name for it
we call it a refugee crisis well
thousands of people desperate people
drown in the Mediterranean fleeing from
Africa where Europe has a certain
history with which you're not unfamiliar
in fact the and the same is true of the
United States and Central America of
course and the Middle East and in fact
the so called refugee crisis is actually
a serious severe moral and cultural
crisis in the West well these two
existential crises are related
the Himalayan glaciers are melting and
in the not-too-distant future that could
threaten the water supplies in South
Asia which already at dangerously low
levels so 300 million people in India
are reported to lack adequate drinking
water right now that could very easily
spark conflict between India and
Pakistan two nuclear-armed States
constantly at the brink of nuclear war
right now in fact a nuclear war would
destroy Indian Pakistan but much worse
than that could very well lead to
nuclear winter meaning global famine
which pretty much ends organized human
life on work on earth which is not very
removed if you think it through well
that leads us to one final date to look
at one of the most important dates of
human history namely the end of World
War two it was a moment of joy but also
of horror with the dawn of the nuclear
age I can remember very well my own
feelings on August 6 horror at the
events and their constant implications
their import an astonishment that so few
people seem to care about it either
about the enormity of what had just
happened or about the fact that we had
entered into what they will be the final
era of human existence the nuclear age
the moment when human intelligence had
succeeded in developing the means to
instantaneously destroy a soul in 1947
shortly after the Doomsday Clock was
instituted and the hand was said then at
7 minutes to midnight we're now remember
at 2 and 1/2 well we have not only
entered the nuclear age but also the so
called anthropos in a new geological
epoch in which human activity is
dramatically changing the environment
there have been debates about the
improper date - for the inception of the
Anthropocene but the world geological
society has made its decision it settled
on 1950 as the beginning of the
Anthropocene that's partly because of
radioactive elements that were
dispersed across the planet by the
nuclear bomb tests and other
consequences of human action including
the sharp increase in greenhouse
emissions so the nuclear age and the
Anthropocene basically coincide
these are epochs of the post-world War
two period we are also now well into
what's called the sixth extinction it's
expected to be similar to the fifth
extinction that was 66 million years ago
when a huge asteroid hit the earth
destroyed 75% of species ended the age
of the dinosaurs it opened a way for
small mammals to survive and to expand
and evolve and ultimately become us
about 200,000 years ago for a long time
the humans had fairly limited impact but
by now in the post-war period we've
succeeded in becoming the next asteroid
destroying species at an enormous rate
perhaps ourselves not too far in the
distance there are careful studies of
species extinction and they have some
interesting results they show that this
extinction is different from its
predecessors in an interesting respect
of the earlier ones where species
neutral species just disappeared across
the board this one is different
it's mostly larger animals that are
disappearing disproportionately and that
actually runs through the history of
protohumans our human ancestors early
human ancestors back around a million
years as they expanded their territory
large mammals declined and of the many
species closely related to us only one
survives which raises some questions
that you might ponder and that includes
the lingering question
Myers is it better to be smart than
stupid now we have a few years to answer
this question not many so how are we
answering it well one step was george w
bush's abrogation of the ABM Treaty
followed now under Obama Bush and Obama
Obama followed by ABM installations
right near the Russian border allegedly
for defense against non-existent Iranian
nuclear missiles you can believe that if
you believe the tooth fairy
which Russia doesn't they have good
reason to regard it as a first strike
weapon as strategic analysts understand
missile defense to be on all sides the
next step was offering NATO membership
to Ukraine Ukraine is the Russian
geostrategic Heartland that was George
Bush but the efforts have been pursued
by Obama and Clinton
well the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
would at least end nuclear tests which
would be a considerable step forward but
it can't go into force until it's
ratified by the few holdouts three are
crucial the nuclear weapon states that
refused to ratify it China Israel and
the United States the major nuclear
powers US and Russia at overwhelming
preponderance of nuclear weapons are
both expanding modernizing their
Arsenal's in quite dangerous ways that
includes tactical nukes that can be
scaled down to battlefield use under the
command other low-level command could
easily lead to very rapid escalation if
there were any conflict and any conflict
between Russia and the United States is
essentially terminal for everyone that's
pretty obvious the flash points are
becoming more serious
that the Russian border noticed the
Russian border not the Mexican border
that's a fact worth considering and it's
a result of expansion of NATO right
after the collapse of the Soviet Union
this was in violation to verbal promises
to Mikhail Gorbachev verbal promises
that NATO would not expand the phrase
was one inch to the east that meant East
Germany know what he was thinking about
anything beyond NATO would not expand
one inch to the east
if Gorbachev agreed to unification of
Germany and Germany a unified Germany
joined joining NATO a hostile military
alliance it was a pretty remarkable
concession in the light of the history
of the past half century when Germany
alone had practically wiped Russia out
two times well that was the agreement
but verbal NATO at once expand expanded
the East Germany than beyond under
Clinton right to the Russian border
there's recent archival work by
University of Texas young historian
Joshua Shaffer Anson was published in
the MIT Journal international security
worth looking up he it very strongly
suggests that President Bush number one
the Statesman Bush and Secretary of
State James Baker with the negotiators
Ivan strongly suggests they were
consciously deceiving Gorbachev
pretending to make an agreement which
they intended to violate and were very
careful not to put anything on paper so
when Gorbachev complained he was told it
was just a gentlemen's agreement and the
implication unstated implication was if
you're stupid enough to accept leaving a
gentlemen's agreement with us it's your
problem not ours well there was a
Gorbachev did propose a vision of what
he called a common
European home Brussels to Vladivostok
security system with no military
alliances that's a fading dream George
Kennan and other senior statesman had
weren't warned right away that NATO
expansion is what they call the tragic
mistake
policy error of historic proportions
that's kenan and it's now leading to
rising and serious tensions on the
traditional invasion route through which
russia was virtually destroyed twice
during the past century by germany alone
the risk of terminal nuclear war is not
slight and that's one of the two reasons
why the hand of the Doomsday Clock is
moving so close to midnight well with
some Justice European historian Richard
takwa writes that NATO's prime concern
now is to manage the risks created by
its existence which is quite accurate I
think and it bears on Eric's Myers
conclusions that's how we're dealing
with one of the two crises what are the
others how about global warming
well we're answering Meyers question by
unilateral withdrawal from the world's
efforts to address the crisis not just
withdrawal but replacing their efforts
with a dedicated race to the precipice
even more rapidly by sharp increases in
fossil fuel use that includes coal and
refusing the promised subsidies to
poorer countries to develop renewable
energy and dismantling the regulatory
apparatus so that profits can boom along
with threats to survival and we can't
stress too strongly the enormity of the
fact that the United States
alone in the world in this respect since
November 8 and the no less astonishing
fact that this extraordinary development
barely registers in the so-called
information system should have regular
screaming headlines and be the most
prominent issue in the academic and
intellectual world which is more
evidence about the great derangement and
no less astonishing is the fact that
while the richest and most powerful
country in world history with
incomparable advantages is leading the
effort to intensify the likely disaster
while that's happening efforts to avert
the catastrophe are being led worldwide
by what we call primitive societies the
First Nations in Canada tribal and
Aboriginal societies elsewhere so for
example Ecuador which has a large
indigenous population short aid from
European countries rich European
countries to allow it to keep its oil
reserves underground where they ought to
be even at a cost of considerable profit
the aid was refused Ecuador revised its
constitution in 2008 to include what are
called the rights of nature having
intrinsic worth the same in Bolivia with
an indigenous majority and quite
generally the countries with large and
influential indigenous populations are
well in the lead and seeking to preserve
the planet while the countries that have
driven indigenous populations to
extinction or extreme marginalization
are racing towards destruction which is
perhaps something more to think about
well outside of the world center of
devastation and destruction which is
right here some things are being done
not enough by any means but not
negligible and an indication of what can
be done
so Denmark is aiming to reach a hundred
percent renewable electricity within 20
years and in all sectors by 2050 Germany
which is the most successful state
capitalist economy has tripled renewable
energy for electricity in the past
decade aims to increase it by almost
half by 2025 more than 80 percent by
2050 and by then to have reduced
greenhouse gas reductions to 80 or 90
percent of 1990 levels China which is
still a huge polluter is well in the
lead in production of solar panels and
also development of advanced solar
technology claims to be phasing out
Seoul coal plants in the United States
Hawaii passed a law mandating that all
the state's electricity will come from
renewable sources no later than 2045 and
right here several Massachusetts
Democrats have filed a bill that's SD
1932 if you want to look it up which
requires that the state use a hundred
percent renewable energy by 2035 and
mandates elimination of all fossil fuels
in the state by 2050 so 100% renewables
San Diego is the first large city to
have plan to run on a hundred percent
renewable energy and cut greenhouse gas
emissions in half by 2035 and that's
incidentally a bipartisan effort the
Republican there endorsed the climate
action plan
that was unanimously approved by the
democrat-controlled City Council in
December that's San Diego so and in fact
at a period when the federal government
is in the hands of bulls in the china
shop states and cities can still do
quite a lot and the federal government
could also do so in the right hands so
one of hillary clinton's programs was to
shift all households to total renewable
energy in four years it's quite feasible
would create many jobs along with
weatherization and other forms of
conservation and federal regulations in
recent years have had some positive
effects unfortunately counterbalance by
support for greater fossil fuel
production there is a final assessment
by the Obama administration it was
published in science the journal Science
a couple months ago
it reports that by 2050 in 2015
total energy consumption was 2.5 percent
lower than it was in 2008 while the
economy grew by 10%
now the reduction is by no means enough
but it does remind us that growth is not
in itself a menace to the environment
depends on what kind of growth so for
example development of a rational mass
transportation system or development of
renewable energy or growth in education
and R&D they can all that's growth and
it can all improve prospects for
addressing the crises while also
significantly improving lives the Obama
assessment reports that about 2.2
million Americans are employed in the
design installation manufacturer of
energy
efficiency products and services as
compared with half that number employed
in the production of fossil fuels and
they're used for electric power
generation and the current oil plume
which I mentioned earlier creates almost
no jobs because it's almost all
automated well again it's nowhere near
enough but not insignificant then more
important an indication of what can be
done and there's good reason think it
can Harvey Michaels is research director
of energy management that Sloan Sloan
School here he's shown I think
persuasively how ambitious but feasible
measures beyond those now contemplated
internationally that's internationally
apart from leading Republican us such
measures could meet the goal of keeping
global temperatures below two degrees
centigrade that's considered the major
danger point the Ernie Moniz now back at
MIT has produced figures about declining
costs for clean energy technologies that
lead him to conclude on quote him that
climate change may have inspired the
energy revolution but price makes it
inevitable and maybe even in time at
least with enough effort
well replacing fossil fuels by renewable
energy is the major issue but it's not
the only one the UN economic program
summarizing recent scientific studies
estimates that industrial meat
production contributes about 10 to 25%
of total greenhouse gas emissions
not so much co2 as methane and nitrous
oxide both greenhouse gases the
variation and the estimates depends on
whether the figures take into account
deforestation and other land use
changes associated with livestock a
livestock is about 80% of agricultural
emissions this is mostly industrial meat
production which is quite vicious as you
know it's designed the maximize profit
with animals treated as efficient
production elements awful effects on
animals but also a significant increase
in greenhouse gas emissions actually
pre-capitalist animal agriculture didn't
have those problems quote from the UN
report under natural conditions which
were maintained for thousands of years
and still widely exist around the world
there's a closed circular system in
which some animals feed themselves from
landscape types which would otherwise be
of little use to humans they thus
convert energy stored in plants into
food while at the same time fertilizing
the ground with their excrements
although not an intensive form of
production this coexistence and use of
marginal resources was and still is in
some regions and efficient symbiosis
between plant life animal life and human
needs but capitalist industrial
production aimed at profit maximization
has changed all that well I mentioned
that with the federal government now
turned into a wrecking machine states
and cities can do quite a lot and that
same is true for every one of us there
are major issues of education and
organizing that have to be faced and
again some of these are unique to the
United States in the developed world one
of them is the extraordinary power in
the United States of fundamentalist
religious doctrines so about 40% of the
population dismiss the threat of global
warming on religious grounds
they regarded as either certain or
highly probable that within a few
decades the Second Coming will put an
end to the problem well it's important
to remember in this connection that the
United States is a kind of a cultural
outlier in some respects prior to the
Second World War of the United States is
by far the most powerful economy but it
was not a major center of scientific or
general culture so if you wanted to be a
physicist you'd go to Germany and you
want to be a writer and artist go to
Paris and so on I personal experience
with the residue of this when I was
appointed MIT in 1955 one of the
teaching assignments was to help
scientists and engineers fake their way
through reading exams in French and
German that was a residue of the fact
that before the war that's where the
scientific literature was took a while
for this to be phased out by that time
was almost all in English but by 1950s
was an anachronism the changes are very
real but they've affected on the part of
the country it's a much of the
population is still pretty much where it
was pre-world War two and that's a major
task for the educational system and the
prospects right now at least don't look
good not with the devotes sessions
Bannen conception of education the Trump
administration has to do something for
its huge evangelical popular base that
involves driving the United States even
farther off the spectrum of the modern
world with the Taliban ization project
that's now underway well there are major
challenges no doubt there are also quite
a few rays of hope I mentioned some of
the measures that
being taken by state local governments
even national governments around the
world to address the crises not enough
but not negligible indication of what's
possible and there are other reasons for
optimism one of them has just been
reported by of all places FoxNews as
they ran a poll on popularity of
political figures and in first place
where a huge margin was Bernie Sanders
even more among the young who are the
hope of the future there are ample
opportunities which you have to grasp
them and all this takes us back to Ernst
Meyers question is it better to be smart
than stupid it's a question for you to
ponder and like it or not for you to
answer and without too much of a delay
[Applause]
myk's for your questions
hello thank you very much professor
Chomsky with all these sort of
existential crises on if you if you were
to put yourself in the body of a
twenty-something year old growing up
today
how would that shape your serve life
decisions with these two crises if I was
20 years old yeah pretty much the way it
did when I was what was it 7 to 16 years
old on August 6th 1945 I happened to be
a junior counselor in a summer camp the
news was reported in the morning you
know broadcast everyone comic bomb wiped
out Hiroshima you know
everyone went on to their next activity
you know baseball game whatever it was I
didn't know how to react I just left
went off into the woods sat there for a
couple hours thinking what does all this
mean and afterwards decided lefty just
has to devote your life for this and I
think that's we're in a worse situation
now and there's plenty that can be done
the opportunities are far greater now
than they were in the past
thanks to what's been done by people
like you in earlier years like MIT say
you could never get an audience like
this 20 or 30 years ago in fact in the
1960s MIT was a very conservative campus
almost nothing was going on
about a dozen undergraduates just change
the place enormous Lee and it's been
very different ever since and that's
happened all around the country which
means that you have a legacy that you
can build on plenty of challenges with
plenty of opportunities and the question
is do you decide the grassman or not so
yeah so thank you I'm wondering Noam how
much emphasis you would place on the
possibility of finding solutions
addressing the problems you've laid out
outside the framework
the current political system in the
United States and how much emphasis you
would give to the need the the necessity
of taking this political system head-on
and and changing it and what would what
do you think we we need to do to change
the system to open up the possibilities
that you're talking about well I think
there are good grounds for changing the
nature of the political system pretty
radically I'm in a system of
organization of production let's say
just keeping to that which is geared
towards profit maximization not use is
inherently destructive a system of
institutional organization in which the
basic functioning institutions are
totalitarian like a business top-down
control you know fit somewhere and it
take orders from above given below at
the bottom you rent yourself that's
inherently I think humanly and socially
destructive so there's plenty of changes
that could be made and we can think
about them and in fact you can try to
build within the existing society pieces
of what might be a more democratic and
humane future society it's even being
done but you can't change the political
system radically unless the great mass
of the population comes to a recognition
that we're in a situation where the
changes that have to be made can't be
made and will be resisted within the
current system and we're nowhere near
that so I don't think the question
arises as a practical question it does
arises a question to have in mind and
choosing tactics and strategies
um hi professor um so as we all leave
this lecture hall today what do you want
us to take away from your talk I mean I
know you let les does this one question
to ponder about but beyond that and the
reason in the last two months there have
been many talks on climate change on the
political climate here speakers
including former Secretary of State John
Kerry and also a Nobel laureate Mario
Molina who discovered CFCs but beyond
discussions in terms of actions what do
you want what do you want all of us and
also people watching through Facebook to
do I came from a city called Duisburg in
Germany and it used to be part of the
heartland of the German coal and steel
industries until recent also passed a
couple years ago they implemented new
energy policies to basically shut down
all of these factories that were harming
the environment to such a radical degree
and even though it practically crippled
the German economy in terms of coal and
steel production ultimately the
environment benefited a lot from that
from the from the energy policies that
crippled the economic force which was
coming from the steel and coal
industries in Germany in West Germany
near the vines of war but here in
America even though we're having so many
discussions about you know what can we
do in terms of the kind of lots of I
feel like we we have if it's more of a
question of balance how much do we want
to sacrifice in our economy in order to
save the environment but then some of us
it's just not a matter of actually but
more of a matter of discussing things
and talking about it and I just know
yeah I guess the question is is what can
we do exactly like what is the bigger
point of your lecture other people here
what can you do all sorts of things I
just mentioned in fact a number of them
take say for example the bill that's
pending in the Massachusetts state
legislature if it was passed could have
a big impact it could put the state on a
direction in the near future towards a
hundred percent renewable energy what
San Diego's already moving towards and
San Diego's not exactly a bastion of
liberalism
if that can be done there can be done
here it's not going to happen unless
it's plenty of pressure for it I think
there are three legislature legislators
who put it through and virtually nothing
is known about it so one thing that
people can do out of thousands is try to
work to get measures like that passed
not only in the state but even in say
Cambridge like San Diego another thing
you can do is move very directly even
simple things like replacing light bulbs
with LED bulbs has a pretty significant
impact on energy production and that can
be done takes to do it on a significant
scale takes organization and activism
but that's one thing you can do the two
that as I mentioned the most popular
candidate and the political figure in
the country happens to be Bernie Sanders
overwhelmingly among young people that
popularity is he calls his position of
revolution but that's an indication of
how far the country has shifted to the
right in fact his policies would have
been quite acceptable to Eisenhower in
fact if you go back and read
Eisenhower's comments on the New Deal
said anyone who questions New Deal
policies doesn't belong in the political
system that's just about everybody by
now except Sanders is calling for New
Deal policies Eisenhower's comments on
the significance of huge unions labor
unions are almost unimaginable to
correct and that's the right wing in
1950s so yes we can shift the spectrum
back to the days when Social Democratic
policies were considered legitimate and
you can go way beyond that there is an
election coming up in 2018 the Democrats
among their failures have been
essentially the Obama Democrats
basically destroyed the party
there's nothing almost nothing left
except at the presidential level the
greens have the same fallacy they've
focused on the presidential you know the
quadrennial extravaganza haven't built
the party at the local level school
board's state legislatures or City
Council's the governor's the whole
system which has to be in place if
anything's going to happen the Koch
brothers understood this the right wing
has understood it and in fact built such
a system
even on a minority base hasn't been done
on a majority base but it certainly can
be
there's the beginnings of establishing
say cooperatives or work around worker
owned enterprises run by their own
members that's these are things that not
only can be done but are being done
there's a whole range of possibilities
that can be pursued if you choose them
if you choose to do it there's just no
shortage of things it's in a minute
pleasure to listen to you
I'm a little bit off-topic but I don't
think I would have a chance ever to
after that what do you think about the
madelung rush that the Kremlin in our
election surrounded
today the madelung of Russia the Kremlin
in our 2016 election I'm sorry
I don't owe the meddling of Russia in
our elections that has most of the world
cracking up and laughter you know it's
just a trick I mean literally I'm
suppose every charge is correct let's
say the most severe charges are correct
it's not even a joke as compared with
what we do constantly just take a minor
example what we do with Russian
elections in the early 90s when Yeltsin
was Clinton's favorite he was supposed
to be the you know the DRI the hope for
the future when he destroyed the
Parliament and overthrew the formal
democratic system he was strongly
supported by the United States in 1996
when he was extremely unpopular for
pretty good reasons because the the
shock treatment the sort of free-market
policies imposed by American advisers
just wiped out the economy and led to
the death of millions of people it was
highly destructive I led to the rise of
you know the oligarchs many of them
former operatic sand the communist
system who stole the resources it was a
total disaster and Yeltsin was a symbol
of it Clinton moved in very extensive
quite openly there was nothing secret
about it very openly with everything
from loans to advice to direct
involvement to try to make sure that our
fair-haired boy one that's nineteen
ninety six and these are minor examples
I'm the kind of thing we do constantly
just overthrow the government
you know Institute of military
dictatorship but not in the distant past
and it just happened under Obama in 2009
in Honduras
there was a mildly reformist government
the you know the tiny a lead of
super-rich who run the country didn't
like it he was kicked out in the
military coup the United States is one
of the very few countries that supported
it and the claim that the election taken
place under a military dictatorship was
legitimate
it's basically supporting a military
coup to overthrow parliamentary
government is that meddling in the
election you know it just goes on and on
like this that's a so as I say this is
just making the United States kind of a
laughingstock in the world even if every
single charge is correct most of them
have no basis thank you thank you
so the silence in the media right now
regarding climate change an existential
threat to humanity is pretty deafening
and you provide an explanation for that
in your book manufacturing consent that
there are certain filters that limit the
range of acceptable political discourse
I'm wondering though it seems like in
this recent election cycle that maybe
some of those filters are being
circumnavigated by increased use of the
internet and more democratic social mass
media do you think that the election of
Trump the insurgent primary of Bernie
Sanders and the sudden outcry from major
media outlets about fake news and the
end of truth are a sign that maybe these
this propaganda system is breaking down
and if so what does that mean for the
ability to sort of break the silence
regarding these existential threats that
we face I think that's very important if
I have to take a look at the Sanders
campaign I mean it hasn't been discussed
discussed as much as it should be but it
was a pretty astonishing achievement I
mean for well over a century American
elections have been pretty much bought I
mean the evidence is just overwhelming
the person has done most of the work on
this
Tom Ferguson political scientist at
UMass Boston used to be at MIT it's got
a book called golden rule which studies
the role justice simply of campaign
funding on outcome of elections and
policies going way back into the 19th
century right through the New Deal and
so on and it's a startling results he
has a recent paper that came out a
couple months ago looking at
congressional elections from about 1980
up til the present and just comparing
campaign funding with electability it's
kind of like a straight line you don't
get results like that in the social
sciences well and it's nothing new I
mean back in 1895 there was a great
campaign manager than a mark Hanna and
he was asked once what's necessary to
run a successful political campaign he
said well you need two things the first
one is money and I've forgotten what the
second one is that's it that was 1895
it's gotten way more extreme since and
by now it's out of sight okay after over
a century of this somebody comes along
who nobody ever heard of he uses a scare
word socialist you know he has no
funding nothing from the corporate
sector and nothing from wealthy people
immediate totally against him almost
either ridiculing and were dismissing
him he could easily have won the
Democratic Party nomination if it hadn't
been for the party shenanigans to keep
them out it's a pretty amazing
development and what it shows is that
the institutions are they look powerful
but they collapse as soon as the
population becomes engaged they're
basically very weak actually that's an
insight that goes back hundreds of years
one of the first modern works on
politics is by David Hume one great
philosopher founder of classical
liberalism he has a study called I think
Prince of first principles of government
and he opens it by saying that there's
strange paradox in governments this is
in every government whether you know
military run more or less popular like
England at the time this is the strange
thing people obey their rulers and why
do they because power is in the hands of
the governed and if they want they can
take it and he says by what miracle is
this achieved this is only by control of
opinion if he can make people feel that
they're powerless and hope and
everything's futile and they can't do
anything
okay then they'll obey if not they don't
have to obey and that's much more true
in pretty free countries like ours than
say a military dictatorship but it says
but the paradox is real and it's in
people's hands to overcome it and the
Sanders campaign is one dramatic
illustration of that and what you say
about alternative media is can be too if
it's properly done also affects the
major media because they have to respond
to it so this the institutional
structure is basically quite weak and
can easily be changed thank you hi I
want to be hopeful about our our major
institutions our systems of governance
and higher education in particular in
its ability to to grapple with the
immense challenge of climate change and
its and its like but sometimes I wonder
if we really need something dramatically
different when I think about higher
education the world that I live in
mostly
do you think that there's you know
completely new structures or approaches
that we should be trying to create in
order to deal with this because
incrementalism maybe isn't doing so hot
well you know I think any of us could
sit down at a you know a coffee shop and
think of much better ways to run the
world you know better institutions were
democratic ones were just ones and so on
but thinking of that doesn't really help
you have to get the great mass of the
population to be committed to creating
and you can only do that incrementally
you have to work within the system that
exists you can do a lot of things within
it you can have a vision of the future
which people can take as a guideline for
further action and maybe leading and as
I mentioned before you can construct
institutions of a future Society within
this one like cooperatives for example
like work around enterprises if they
would extend they would be it would
change the society enormous Lee and
those are things that arise constantly
if you're willing to grasp the
opportunity so it takes a the 2008 crash
the one of the things that happened then
which was pretty interesting was that
the government essentially nationalized
the auto industry basically just bailed
it out it was going to disappear so the
government meaning the taxpayer bought
out the auto industry and then there
were a couple of choices that could have
been made that one choice is the one
that was made without discussion namely
you turn it back to the former owners
may be new faces but pretty much seeing
the same banks and so on so essentially
to turn it back to the former owners and
have it go on doing exactly what it was
doing producing cars there was another
possibility
turn it over to the workforce let them
run it democratically and have it
produced with the side he needs which is
not more cars but rational mass
transportation that was another
possibility about in order for it to be
implemented you had to have mass popular
support for it that was essentially none
so didn't happen and things like that
happened even right locally in this
neighborhood so a couple of years ago
there was a small plant and Taunton nice
suburb of Boston which was quite
successful a plant making sophisticated
parts for aircraft it wasn't making
enough profit for the multinational who
owned that could keep it going so they
decided to put it out of business the
Union progressive Union you we offered
to buy the plant and have it run by the
workforce which probably would have been
profitable for the multinational but for
class reasons they don't like that kind
of thing if there had been popular
support they could have won
there wasn't any so they didn't win
things like that are happening all the
time these could lead to major changes
in the society are they incremental in a
sense but they're they're long-term
consequences could be very very and
that's true of all kinds of things thank
you so go grab some of those
opportunities
I think we have time for one more
question hi everyone I have few
questions for everybody who is here
actually thank you so much the first
question is how many of you have a car
in this room sorry how many of you have
a car in this room and how many of you
run your car at least five minutes to
warm up while you're getting ready how
many of you use paper or plastic plates
and how many of you replace their cell
phones every year
so being environment friendly require
being aware of mistakes that we do and I
would like to remind everyone here
change only comes in baby steps of
people who cares
let's show that we care about the
environment and let's rethink about what
we buy and what we spend on I'm sorry
but right there was no question I guess
for you and well on behalf of the Center
for International Studies I would like
to thank everyone for attending this
event and please join me in thanking
Noam Chomsky
