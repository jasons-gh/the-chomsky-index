hello everybody and welcome my name is
Leanne Gillooly and I'm the president of
the Boston University anti-war coalition
we are a coalition formed as an alliance
of students United in support of an end
to Wars and a non-violent methods of
social change our main purpose is to
raise awareness through education and to
advocate and develop a legislative
agenda that promotes our established
goals I would like to start off the
evening by sharing some thoughts with
you it is no secret that we live in an
extremely complex world and everyday
society spawns new issues that become
increasingly difficult to solve
as technology booms in our collective
intelligence expands limits are replaced
with innovations to the likes of which
our parents could have never dreamed
progress has led to an intricately run
consumer based mass production society
that is showing those signs of slowing
down
yet in our current state of affairs you
do not have to look far to see our
economic slowdown increasing
unemployment or lackluster medical care
the incarceration rate in the United
States is among the highest in the world
while energy prices sky sky rock are
skyrocketing and our ignorance of the
looming climate crisis continues and of
course there's the quagmire that is Iraq
which everybody seems to recognize as a
blunder yet nobody can seem to find a
way out of information about Iraq has
been styled from the beginning the
mainstream media effectively blacks out
gruesome pictures of war and the many
actions of the anti-war movement while
simultaneously mister directing the
public with lofty rhetoric and
distracting them with breaking stories
about Britney Spears there are over
4,000 dead American troops and estimates
of anywhere from 80,000 to over 1
million deceased Iraqis the majority of
them civilians with this war our
government has carried out an assault on
our civil liberties from legalizing and
justifying torture of innocent people to
openly spying on our citizens while all
along the military-industrial complex is
turning out profit in many different
arena arenas and top government
officials personally profit from
government contracts that serve the
private companies such as the prime
example of vice president Cheney's
Halliburton this is all topped off with
the mind-numbing redundancies of the
presidential campaigns complete with
media distractions personal attacks at
platforms that leave half our citizens
feeling disenfranchised considering that
this country was founded upon the
concept of for the people by the people
it is dismaying that the public interest
in the in US policies has drastically
fallen over time while the detrimental
effects these policies have in the rest
of the world have exponentially grown
how many more transgressions well our
unchecked government commits before
people get mad what does it take for
those not awake to the urgency of our
distress to finally see it and what does
it take for those who are conscious of
our ills to feel obliged to fix it some
argue that it takes a tragedy
yet with tragedy bound to every page
sort of the newspaper people are
desensitized to it the lack of outrage
at the war in Iraq and our burgeoning
domestic issues most notably from my
generation is due to viewing these
issues as distant abstractions society
desperately needs to be dislodged from
the complacent back seat of American
politics our methods of government are
punctuated with rudimental grievances
that our politicians attempt to mend
with band-aids being anti-war means a
lot more than just desiring an end to
this war what we are really fighting is
a system that has led to massive
destruction on a global scale and will
continue to without up people of our
ideology and a restructuring of our
political system that is why undeniable
parallels between the wars in Iraq and
Vietnam can be drawn and why the social
movements of the 60s are used as a
paradigm for today's revolution and that
is why hate has been perpetuated instead
of unqualified love the great
enlightenment of our generation will
come but it will not look like it did in
the 60s we the current students of
America are faced with a difficult task
of having to run this place in the
future some say that there's simply
nothing anybody can do to fix it that
the powers that be are too overwhelming
to counter that public dissent is a
thing of a past here I like to invoke
Margaret Mead who once said don't ever
tell me that a small group of thoughtful
people could not change the world indeed
it's the only thing that ever has we
must work within the confines of the
structures of society for in the end it
is simply a game of power politics and
social status that when wives be
manipulated can be utilized to put
someone of good intention into power yep
is ultra concentrated powers undeniably
tainting and the real challenge lies in
combating the culture of greed bigotry
ignorant and intolerance that permeates
the United States because these plates
are not identify
by our increasing increasingly
unbalanced media we turn to the unsung
heroes who have been the voices of
dissent the forefront of innovative
philosophy and the ones bold and brave
enough to question reality I will never
forget the day I first discovered Noam
Chomsky I had Inklings that there was
something off about this society I've
been living in for 18 years especially
considering the war we had begun in Iraq
feeling overwhelmed in an attempt to
locate some facts I was sifting through
media and I came across an article
professor Chomsky wrote in December of
2002 and my mind was cracked wide open
part of the article entitled a modest
proposal Illustrated a persistent
pattern of policies that had been
occurring for decades and showed no
signs of changing It was as if I had
been staring straight at something for
years yet I was actually seeing it for
the first time mr. Chomsky's work is
like a precision laser whittling down
the cumbersome ideologies indoctrinated
into the social psyche exposing and
contending their flawed underbellies a
true renegade professor Chomsky has
remained one of the most celebrated and
highly demanded voices of revolution
since he first took a stance in the 60s
although relentlessly sought after by
international media sources he is often
criticized at home in the u.s. most
widely recognized for his groundbreaking
contributions in the field of
linguistics undergrads cannot take a
course in evolutionary psychology
computer science or international
politics without encountering the works
of professor Chomsky his tall intellect
is conditioned with a social
consciousness that gives purpose and
depth to his works his flame has been
ignited minds and hearts for decades
especially at his beloved school of MIT
where he has taught for the past 53
years his wisdom is adorned with
experience and professed with clarity
above all else
his in devout individuality is marked by
his unique positions for he has never
allowed anybody to put him in a box
refusing to reside along the established
plane of party politics he has added a
dimension to the otherwise horizontal
political spectrum he has taught to
dispel preconceived notions ignore
propagandistic headlines tune out sound
bites fight off their self-serving
tendencies and instead of sharpening
differences between one another
recognize the commonalities of man and
the potential for justice and peace that
exists with within each being he has
taught to question everything about the
reality to criticize and debate those in
power to find a more human response to
the challenges posed by globalization
his ability to think in different modes
has allowed for life-changing
revelations and has inspired my thinking
and it is my hope that you all be
inspired as well the future that is at
stake is our own and I believe with
intelligent reasoning and original
thought the answers to all these
questions can be discovered so without
further ado I am honored to introduce to
you the brilliant author empowered
lecturer multi-talented adoring father
and doting husband he's received
honorary degrees from over two dozen of
the top universities on the planet he
has been called by the New York Times
arguably the most important intellectual
alive and he is among the eight among
the eight most cited scholars in history
I could go on for hours about all the
college credentials literally but ladies
and gentlemen the one and only professor
Noam Chomsky
well I don't anticipate living up to
that but I'll try I've been asked to
talk about modern-day American
imperialism that's a rather challenging
task in fact the talking about American
imperialism is a little bit like talking
about triangular triangles the United
States is the one country that exists as
far as I know and ever has that was
founded as an empire explicitly
according to the founding fathers when
the country was found that it was a
nascent Empire that's George Washington
modern day American imperialism is just
a later phase of a process that has
continued from the first moment without
a break going in a very steady line so
we're looking at one phase in a process
that was initiated when the country was
founded and has never changed the model
for the founding fathers have borrowed
from Britain of that at that time was
the Roman Empire then they wanted to
emulate it I'll talk about that a little
even before the Revolution these notions
were very much alive Benjamin Franklin
25 years before the Revolution
complained to the British that they were
imposing limits on the expansion of the
colonies and he objected to this
borrowing from Machiavelli
he admonished the British and quoting
him that a prince that acquires new
territories and removes the native the
natives to give his people room will be
remembered as the father of the nation
and George Washington agreed he wanted
to be the father of the nation his view
was that the gradual extension of our
settlement will as certainly caused the
savage as the wolf to retire both being
beasts of prey
of a different shape I'll skip some
contemporary analogues that you can
think of Thomas Jefferson the most
forthcoming of the founding fathers I
said we shall drive them the savages we
shall drive them with the beasts of the
forests into the stony mountains and the
country will ultimately be free of blot
or mixture meaning red or black wasn't
quite achieved but that was the goal
furthermore Jefferson went on our new
nation will be the nest from which all
America north and south is to be people
displacing not only the red the red men
here but the Latin the spanish-speaking
population to the south and anyone else
who happened to be around there was a
deterrent to those glorious aims mainly
Britain and Britain was the most
powerful military force in the world at
the time and it did prevent the steps
that the founding fathers intended
attempted to take in particular it
blocked the invasion of Canada the first
invasion of Canada attempted invasion of
Canada was before the Revolution and
there were several others later but was
always blocked by British force which is
why can it exists the United States did
not actually recognize Canada's
existence until after the first world
war another goal that was blocked by
British force was Cuba the again the
founding fathers regarded the taking
over of Cuba as essential to the
survival of the nascent Empire but the
British fleet was in the way and they
were too powerful just like the Russians
blocked john f kennedy's invasions the
however the they understood that it
would sooner or later would come the
great grand strategist john quincy adams
the sort of intellectual father of
manifest destiny he pointed out in the
1820s that we just have to wait and I
said that Cuba will sooner or later fall
into our hands by the laws of political
gravitation just as an Apple falls from
the tree what he meant is that over time
the United States would become more
powerful that Britain would become
weaker and the deterrent would be
overcome which in fact finally happened
and we should not ignore these early
events they are very much related to
current history that's made very clear
by scholarship on current affairs so the
major scholarly work on the Bush
Doctrine george w bush doctrine the
pre-emptive war doctrine major work is
by John Lewis Gaddis who's the most
respected historian of the Cold War
period it's on the roots of the Bush
Doctrine and he traces it right back to
John Quincy Adams who is his hero the
great grand strategist in particular to
Andrew Jackson's invasion of Florida
which conquered Florida from the Spanish
and that was strongly approved by then
Secretary of State Adams
in a famous state paper in which he
advocated the principle of pre-emptive
war on the basis of the thesis that
expansion is the path to security so if
we want to be secure after all we want
to defend ourselves we have to expand at
that time expand into Florida we were
being threatened by what we're called
runaway slaves and lawless Indians who
were in the way they were threatening us
by their existence by barring our
expansion and as Gaddis points out
there's a straight line from that to
George Bush and now expansion is the
path the security means we take over the
world we take over space take over the
galaxy there's no limit to how
you have to expand to guarantee security
and that's been the principle from the
beginning
Gaddis is a good historian and he cites
the right sources on the so-called
Seminole War the Jackson's conquest of
Florida but he doesn't bother telling us
what the sources say and it's worth
looking at what they say they describe
it as a war of murder and plunder and
extermination driving out the indigenous
population there were pretexts made but
they were so flimsy that nobody paid
much attention to them it was also the
first executive war in violation of the
Constitution setting a precedent which
has been followed ever since there was
no congressional authorization it's all
like Adams lied through his teeth to
Congress I mean it's all very familiar
so Gaddis is correct it is the model for
the Bush Doctrine he approves of both of
them but that's a moral judgment but his
analysis correct yes what's happening
now traces right back to the wars of
extermination and plunder and murder and
lying and deceit and so on executive
Wars of that John Quincy Adams was the
great spokesman for Adams incidentally
later in his life regretted this he
after his own contributions were well in
the past he condemned the Mexican War as
an executive war and a terrible
precedent wasn't a precedent he'd
established the precedent and he also
expressed remorse over what he called
that hapless race of Native Americans
which we are exterminating with such
mercial merciless and perfidious cruelty
they know what they were doing
contemporary history likes to prettify
it but if you read the descriptions and
the observations by the people who are
involved they know exactly what they
were doing he expressed regret for it
but of course his own role was long past
well the it's commonly argued that
American imperialism began in 1898
that's when in 1898 the u.s. did finally
succeed in conquering Cuba and what's
called in history books
liberating Cuba namely intervening in
order to prevent Cuba from liberating
itself from Spain and turning it into a
virtual colony as it remained until 1959
setting off hysteria in the United
States which hasn't ended yet the also
conquering taking over Hawaii which was
stolen by force and guile from its
population Puerto Rico another colony
soon moving to the Philippines and
liberating the Philippines also
liberating a couple of hundred thousand
souls to heaven and the process and
again the reverberations of that extend
right to the present with ample state
terror and the one corner of Asia that
hasn't undergone a high development
something we're not supposed to notice
but the the belief they're old that the
Imperial thrust started in 1898 is an
example of what historians of Empire are
called the salt water fallacy the belief
that you have an empire if you cross
salt water in fact if the Mississippi
River were as wide as the Irish Sea the
Imperial thrust would have started much
earlier but that's an irrelevance I mean
expanding over a settled territory is no
different from expanding over the waters
so what happened in 1898 was just an
extension of the process that began when
the nascent
Empire as it saw itself was formed in
its first moments the and the extension
to Beyond was again a lot of this starts
right in New England with New England
merchants who wanted to know very eager
to take over the Pacific trade the
fabulous markets of China which were
is in their minds which meant conquering
the Northwest's so you can control the
ports and so on kicking the British out
and others out and so on that went on
from right here the goal was the William
Seward Secretary of State in 1860s
pointed out that the central figure in
American imperialism that we have to
gain a command of the Empire of the Seas
conquered the continent we're gonna
settle take it over
Montreux doctrine was a declaration that
will take it over everybody else keep
out and the process of doing so
continued through the 19th century and
beyond until today but now we have to
have command of the Seas and that meant
when the time was ripe 30 years later
when the apple started to fall from the
tree given relative power proceeding
overseas to the overseas empire but it's
basically no different than the earlier
steps the leading philosophical and
period imperialist Brooks Adams he
pointed out that was 1895 were just on
the verge of moving overseas extensively
that all Asia must be reduced to our
economic system the Pacific must be
turned into an inland sea just like the
Caribbean had been and there's no reason
he said why the United States should not
become a greater seat of wealth and
power than ever was England Rome or
Constantinople well again there was a
deterrent the European powers wanted a
piece of the action in East Asia and
Japan by then was a becoming a
formidable force so it was necessary to
explore more complex modes of gaining
command of turning the Pacific into an
inland sea and going on and that was
lucidly explained by Woodrow Wilson who
is one of the most brutal and vicious in
menace in American history the probable
permanent destruction of Haiti is one of
his many accomplishments those of you
who study international relations theory
or read about it know that there's a
notion of Wilsonian idealism the fact
that that notion can exist is a very
interesting commentary on our
intellectual culture and scholarly
culture if you look at his actual
actions fine words are easy enough but
these are some of his fine words which
he was smart enough not to put into
print he just ripped them for himself I
said since trade ignores national
boundaries and the manufacturer insists
on having the world as a market the flag
of his nation must follow must follow
him and the doors of the nations which
are closed against him must be battered
down even if the sovereignty of
unwilling nations be outraged in the
process no useful corner of the world
may be overlooked or left unset left
unused that's nineteen seven there's a
current version of that a crude version
by Thomas Friedman who says that
McDonald's cannot flourish without
McDonnell Douglas meaning the US Air
Force
well that's crude version of Wilson's
point they got about better down the
doors by force and threat and no corner
of the world must be left unused no
useful corner there was a watershed in
this process at the time the Second
World War at the time of the Second
World War the u.s. already had by far
the largest economy in the world and had
for a long time but it wasn't a major
player in world affairs Britain was the
leading player of France second the
United States lagging it controlled the
hemisphere you know had made forays into
the Pacific but it was not the leading
player however during the war the u.s.
planners understood that the world was
going to end with the u.s. the world
dominant power
however it turned out other competitors
were going to destroy themselves and
each other and the US would be left
alone at it comparable security in fact
the u.s. gained enormous ly from the war
industrial production virtually
quadrupled the war ended the depression
New Deal measures hadn't done so the
u.s. ended at the end of the war the US
had literally half the world's wealth
and competitors were virtually
distributed either damaged or Syria or
destroyed and incomparable security
controlled the Western Hemisphere
controlled both oceans controlled the
opposite side of both oceans just
nothing remotely like it in history and
during the war planners understood that
something like that was going to turn
out it was obvious from the nature of
the war from 1939 to 1945 there were
high-level meetings regular meetings of
the State Department State Department
planners and the Council on Foreign
Relations the sort of main external
non-governmental input into foreign
policy and they laid careful plans for
the world that they expected but to
emerge it was a world they said in which
the United States will hold unquestioned
power and will ensure the limitation of
any exercise of sovereignty by States
that might interfere with u.s. global
designs and certainly I'm not quoting
neo-cons
you know I'm quoting the Roosevelt
administration the peak of American
liberalism the they called for what they
called an integrated policy to achieve
military and economic supremacy for the
United States and bar any exercise of
sovereignty but anyone who would
interfere with it and they would do this
in a region that they called the grand
area well in the early part of the war
1939 the 1943 the grand area was defined
as the western hemisphere routinely the
former British Empire which
u.s. would take over and the Far East
that would be the grand area they
assumed at the time that there would be
a German led world the rest so to be a
non German world that's us in the German
world as the Russians gradually ground
down the Nazi armies after 1942 it
became pretty clear that there wouldn't
be a German world so the grand area was
expanded to be as much of the world as
could be controlled the limitless that's
simply pursuing the old position that
expansion is the path to security for
the nascent Empire of 1776 the these
policies were laid down during the war
but then they were implemented right
after the war in fact the you know that
we have available in the Declassified
record the planning documents of the
late late 1940s it turns out they're not
very surprisingly very similar to the
wartime planning well the one of the
leading figures was George Kennan it was
head of the state department policy
planning staff he wrote one of his many
important papers in 1948 PPS 23 if you
want to look it up noted that the United
States has half the world's wealth but
only 6% of its population and our
primary goal in foreign policy must be
as he put it to maintain this disparity
and in order to do so we must put aside
all vague and idealistic slogans about
democracy and human rights those are for
public propaganda and colleges and so on
but we must put those aside and keep to
pure power concepts yet no other way to
maintain the disparity and then in the
same paper and elsewhere he and his
staff went through the world assigned to
each part of the world what would be
what they called its function within
this
a global system that in which the US
would have unchallenged power
unquestioned power so Latin America and
the Middle East the Middle East
obviously would provide the energy
resources that we would control
gradually pushing out Britain throwing
out France immediately and pushing out
Britain slowly over the years and
turning it into essentially a junior
partners the British Foreign Office
ruefully described their role at that
time the Latin America we simply control
that's our little region over here which
has never bothered anyone that's a
Secretary of War Stimson said while the
US was violating the principles it was
establishing by setting up a regional
organization in violation of the UN
Charter and so on so Latin America we
keep at least we control Southeast Asia
would be its function was to provide
resources and raw materials to the
former colonial powers meanwhile we
would purchase them - that would send
dollars there which the colonial powers
would take not the population and they
could use those too Britain France
Netherlands could use the dollars to
purchase US manufacturers it's called a
triangular trading arrangement which
would allow the US had the only really
functioning industrial system in the
world had a huge excess of manufacturing
products and there was what was called a
dollar gap of the countries we wanted to
sell it to who didn't have dollars
that's Europe basically so we had to
provide them with dollars and the role
of function of Southeast Asia was to
play a role in that
hence the support for French colonialism
and recapturing its into Chinese colony
and so on it's a there was various
variations but that's the basic story
the and so cannon went through the world
and signed them its function each part
when he got to Africa he decided that
the United States really didn't have
much interest in Africa that
and therefore we should hand it over to
the Europeans to exploit its his word to
exploit for their reconstruction he said
it would also give him a kind of a
psychological lift after the damage of
the war and while we were taking over
all of their domains well you could
