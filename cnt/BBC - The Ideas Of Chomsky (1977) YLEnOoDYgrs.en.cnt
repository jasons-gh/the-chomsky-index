Noam Chomsky has made two international
reputations in unrelated or apparently
unrelated fields the widest is as one of
the national leaders of American
resistance to the Vietnam War the
deepest is as a professor of linguistics
who before he was 40 years old had
transformed the nature of his subject
he's something of a joker in the pack as
far as philosophy is concerned many
professional philosophers would insist
quite sincerely that he isn't a
philosopher at all that linguistics is
simply a different discipline albeit a
neighboring one well I'm not going to
argue about that it's little more than a
question of definition anyway the fact
is he was trained as a philosopher his
work has enormous implications for
philosophy and in the writings of
philosophers today I should say his name
probably occurs as often as that of any
living person the central point really
is this
if one problem more than another has
dominated much of twentieth-century
philosophy it's that of the relationship
between language and the world MIT can
stand to give no more than a single
instance was in thrall to this problem
throughout his life well now along comes
the linguist Chomsky and argues that the
way we actually acquire the use of
language and therefore its relationship
to experience and therefore its
relationship to the world are radically
different from what the anglo-saxon
tradition in philosophy has always
maintained he first he first put his
ideas forward in the late 1950s as part
of the critique of behavioral psychology
it's not too unfair to say that the
behavioral psychologists have tended to
talk as if the human individual came
into the world as an undifferentiated
lump of malleable stuff which was then
molded and shaped by its environment
through processes of stimulus and
response they said penalty and reward
the reinforcement of rewarding responses
and the association of ideas the
individual developed to learn
including the learning of language now
Chomsky argued that this could not
possibly explain how virtually all human
beings regardless of their intelligence
do something as fantastically difficult
as master the use of a language even
when they're not deliberately taught it
as most people probably aren't and they
do this at such an extraordinary young
age and in such an extraordinary short
space of time he argued that for this to
happen at all we must be genetically
pre-programmed to do it and therefore
that all human languages must have in
common a basic structure that
corresponds to this pre programming now
this also has some very important
negative implications the chief of these
is that anything that can't be
accommodated to this structure anything
so to speak that can't be caught in the
mesh of this particular network is
linguistically inexpressible and
unintelligible to us so the general
principles common to all languages set
vital limits to our capacity to
understand the world and communicate
with each other put like that it sounds
like a translation into linguistic terms
of some of the basic ideas of Immanuel
Kant and I must say that's always how
it's looked to me
but even if so its Chomsky was carried
it out and no one else and it's proved
an enormous Lee stimulating and fruitful
thing to do a professor Chomsky one of
the difficulties about discussing your
ideas is that in an obvious sense they
are hybrid in part their linguistics in
part their philosophy and in part their
biology and in fact you yourself first
put them forward in what was really a
dispute with biologists with with
behavioral psychologists how did you
come to start at that starting point
well the reason was the that this
picture of the nature of language and
the way in which language is acquired
was of such enormous prevalence over
quite a wide spectrum of thought
including not simply psychology but but
philosophy and linguistics as well the
view that was dominant say at the time
when I was
students 2530 years ago the dominant
picture of language was that it is
essentially a system of habits or skills
or dispositions to act and that it is
acquired through extensive training /
training through repetition
perhaps through procedures of induction
or a generalization or Association and
that one's knowledge one's system have
had this the system of habits the one
developed simply grows through accretion
incrementally has experience is
subjected to these processes of
generalization and analogy and in fact
this this picture which plainly is a
factual assumption was presented as if
it were virtually an a priori truth
which it certainly is not I mean it's
obviously not necessary that language is
a system of that sort or that it's
acquired and anything like that way one
thing that you pointed out which is in
fact very obvious once it's pointed out
is that most people probably aren't
actually taught language at all that is
to say that most parents don't give any
systematic instruction of any kinds of
their children if the children
nevertheless learn well I wouldn't want
to even go beyond that I think it's
certainly the case that languages in
only the most marginal sense is taught
and the teaching is in no sense
essential to the acquisition of language
but in another in a certain sense I
think we might even go on to say that
language isn't even learned at least if
by learning we mean any process that has
those characteristics that are generally
associated with learning for example the
press of the the characteristics that I
mentioned it seems to me if we want a
reasonable metaphor we should talk about
growth language seems to me to grow in
the mind rather in the way that familiar
physical systems of the body grow we
begin our interchange with the world
with our mind in a certain genetically
determined state and through an
interaction with experience with an
environment this state changes until it
reaches a mature state which we call a
state of knowledge of language this
kinds of changes from the
genetically-determined initial state to
the final state in which we really have
a quite complex system of mental
computations this series of changes
seems to me very much analogous to
growth of organs and in fact I think
it's not inappropriate to regard the
mind as a system of mental organs the
language faculty being one each of the
structure determined by a pair of
biological endowment with interactions
also generally determined by the nature
of our biological endowment growing
through the triggering effect of
experience which shapes and articulates
the organs as they develop in the
individual through the relevant period
of his life so as I said it seems to me
that not only is it wrong to think of
languages being taught but it's at least
very misleading to think of it as being
learned if we carry with the notion
learning the association's that
generally go along with it in other
words we are pre-programmed to learn a
language in the same way as we are
pre-programmed to grow arms and legs and
reach puberty in our early teens and all
sorts of other sometimes delayed
processes of growth yes and reaching
puberty is a good example since that's a
case of biological development of auto
genetic development that's plainly
pre-programmed in essence but takes
place after birth and in fact we might
say that something that even death for
that matter is genetically determined
that is it we are biologically
constructed so that at a certain time
our life processes stop but and in fact
the fact that some development takes
place after the organism has begun an
independent existence in the world has
nothing to say it tells us nothing about
whether it's a genetically determined
development or not now one thing that
follows from your view is that if if we
set out as you have done in the course
of your professional life to investigate
the language Faculty of human beings
then what you are investigating is as
much a biophysical system I mean
something that actually exists
that's in stuff in human tissue as would
be the case if you were investigating
human vision or human digestion or the
circulation of the blood well I think
that that's certainly true in least we
believe it to be true in principle we
are not at a stage now where in the
study of the neural basis for higher
cognitive processes where it's possible
to identify physical structures that are
involved in these operations
correspondingly the the actual study of
this organ remains at an abstract level
that is we can try to investigate the
principles by which it functions but
there's very little to say right now
about the ways in which these principles
are physically realized in structures of
the brain quite correspondingly one
might study the visual system let's say
as was done for a very long period
knowing say nothing about how it's
physically how the principles that we
are led to attribute to this system the
let's say analyzing mechanisms that we
are led to attribute to the system
knowing nothing about how these may be
physically realized in our neural
structures and I think it's quite
appropriate to think of the contemporary
study of language as being analogous to
a study of a vision at a period when
it's remained impossible technically or
through the limitations of understanding
technique and so on it was impossible to
determine the actual physical elements
that entered into these systems which
could be studied only in an abstract
fashion there seems to be a special
difficulty I mean we accept the fact
that I can't by introspection however
hard I try say observe the workings of
my own liver
I can't observe it in the act of
secreting bile or whatever it does
and similarly presumably I can't observe
these these language formation
faculties of mine at work but
nevertheless there is an important
difference because if we want to if we
want to investigate the workings of the
liver
we couldn't observe other people's I
mean you can bits of life people's or
the whole of dead people's or animals
livers you can experiment with different
inputs and see what difference they make
to the output and so on and so forth but
we can't do that with animals as far as
their language using faculty is
concerned because they haven't got
language using faculties now doesn't
that shut off from us what is in fact
the chief mode of Investigation with all
the other biological faculties that we
have it does very definitely set a stop
a very natural mode of Investigation
that is we are not for ethical reasons
we do not conduct
intrusive experiments with human beings
so for example there are very natural
modes of investigation that suggests
themselves at once suppose for example I
propose that language has some general
property and that every human language
must have this property as a matter of
biological necessity if we were dealing
with a defenseless organism that we were
allowed to study say the way we study
monkeys or cats what we would do is
employ the method of concomitant
variation that is that we would design
an artificial environment let's say in
which this principle was violated and
asked whether the system develops in a
normal way under those conditions first
to take one case well that we can't do
in the case of humans we can't design
artificial contrived environments and
see what happens to an infant in them
just as we don't conduct the ablation
experiments with humans and this it's
important to recognize that this
limitation imposes no raises no
philosophical issue it what it means is
that we have to be clever in the kind of
work we do because a number of modes of
inquiry are simply excluded there being
as far as we know nothing analogous to
the language faculty in the case of
other organisms but that doesn't mean
that we can't study the problem we can
have to study it more indirectly we
often can't directly move to the
experiments that would give us
and precise answers the questions that
we raised but if you think about the
model that I put forth that is that the
model of a of an organ beginning in a
genetically determined initial state and
growing to a mature state of knowledge
then it's obvious that that mature state
of knowledge will be determined by
really by two factors one the initial
genetic endowment and secondly the the
impinging experience so when and as far
as the final state of knowledge is
concerned what's called the grammar of
language the system of rules and
principles that determines what is a
sentence and what it means and how it
sounds and so on that's as far as that
system is concerned we really can get
tremendous amounts of evidence in fact
every utterance that's produced is an
experiment if you like every reaction of
a person to an utterance is an
experiment so there's no shortage of
information concerning the matura state
of knowledge achieved if we can with it
if we can then discern in the mature
state of knowledge principles and
properties which are in no way presented
in the experience that is present that
is available it's very plausible to
propose those as properties attributable
to the initial State
the main thing I want to do in this
discussion professor Chomsky is go into
the implications of your work for
philosophy I don't want to go pursue you
into the nature of the work itself
because that's highly technical
obviously and it's not really feasible
to discuss it you know in a television
program of this kind
let us now as it were assume the truth
of your theories and start looking at
the wider implications of them because
this I'm sure is what will interest our
our audience most one consequence of
your theories is that we are as human
beings very very rigidly pre-programmed
there are certain things we can
understand certain things we can
communicate and anything that falls
outside that we simply can't is that so
that's certainly correct so I mean in a
way this is a rather alarming doctrine I
mean it it it certainly contravenes the
way we want to feel about us
well that may be an immediate reaction
but I think it's it's not the correct
reaction in fact well it's true that our
genetic program rigidly constrains us I
think the more important point is that
the existence of that rich of that rigid
constraint is what provides the basis
for our freedom and creativity and the
reason to mean it's only because we're
pre-programmed
that we can do all the things are and
exactly the point is that if we really
were plastic organisms without an
extensive pre-programming then the state
that our mind achieves would in fact be
a reflection of the environment which
means it would be extraordinarily
impoverished fortunately for us we are
rigidly pre-programmed with extremely
rich systems that are part of our
biological endowment correspondingly a
small amount of relative degenerate
experience allows a kind of a great leap
into a rich cognitive system essentially
uniform in a community and in fact of
roughly uniform prism which would have
developed over campus evolutionary ages
through the basic system itself
developed over long periods of
evolutionary development we don't know
how really but for the individual its
present as a result the individual is
capable of with a very small amount of
evidence of constructing an extremely
rich system which allows him to act in
the free and creative fashion which in
fact is normal for humans we can say
anything that we want over an infinite
range other people will understand us
though they've heard nothing like that
before we're able to do that precisely
because of that rigid programming but
short of that we would not be able to at
all what account are you able to give of
creativity if we are pre-programmed in
the way you say then how is creativity
and possibility for us well here I think
one has to be fairly careful I think we
can say a good deal about about the
nature of the system that is acquired
the state of knowledge that is obtained
we can say a fair amount about the
biological that the basis the the basis
in the initial state of the mind for the
acquisition of the system but when we
turn to a third question namely how is
this system used how are we able to act
creatively how can how do we decide to
how can we decide to say things that are
new but not random that are appropriate
to occasions but not under the control
of stimuli when we ask these questions
we really enter into a realm of mystery
where human science at least so far and
maybe in principle does not reach we can
say a fair amount about the principles
that make it possible for us to behave
in our normal creative fashion but as
soon as questions of will or decision or
reason or a choice of action when those
questions arise human science is at a
loss it has nothing to say about them as
far as I can see these questions remain
in the obscurity that in which they were
in classical antiquity would you also
accept this or not that that having
arrived at our present situation across
millions of years of evolution we must
have been going through us a continual
process of innovation and new adaption
and development of new abilities
dispositions organs etc might we not
still be as it were plastic at the edges
might we not still be developing and
evolving genuinely evolving if only on
the margin well I think one has to be
again very cautious here because well
it's true at a very in a very vague
sense to say it's correct to say that
the systems that we now have have
developed through evolution and through
natural selection it's important to
recognize how little we are saying when
we say that for example it is certainly
not necessarily the case that every
particular trait that we have is the
result of specific selection that is
that we were selected for having that
trait in fact there are striking
examples to the contrary at least
apparent examples to the contrary say
take for example our capacity to deal
with abstract properties of the number
system and that's a distinctive human
capacity as distinctive as the capacity
for language
any normal human fact found of
pathological levels can comprehend the
properties of a number system and can
move very far and understanding their
deep properties but it's extremely
difficult to believe that this capacity
was the result of specific selection
that is it's hard to believe that people
who were a little better at proving
theorems of number theory had more
children let's say that didn't happen in
fact through most of human evolution in
fact essentially all of human evolution
this capacity wasn't it would have been
impossible to know that this capacity
even existed li contingencies that
allowed it to be exercised never arose
nevertheless the trait is there the
capacity is there the mental organ if
you like has developed presumably it has
developed as a concomitant of some other
properties of the brain which may have
been selected for example we can
speculate say that you know that the
increase in brain size was a factor in
differential reproduction it's an
evolution and it may be that for
physical law because of physical laws
that we presently don't know that an
increase in brain size under the
specific conditions of human evolution
simply leads necessarily through a
system which has the capacity to deal
with properties the number system well
then that's a matter of physics
ultimately and then the mind that
evolves the brain that evolves will have
this capacity but not because it was
achieved through selection no I think
it's it's at least likely that something
of the sort is true of human language
and I mean surely if it were
dysfunctional it wouldn't have been
maintained it's obviously functional but
it's a long leap to claim that that the
specific structures of language are
themselves the result of specific
selection is elite that I don't think is
particularly plausible what you say
there about the limitations that this
imposes on this promise in me the
following thought we're all very used I
think to the idea that in social life
each one of us as individuals tends to
construct a picture of the world around
his own experience and indeed we it's
difficult to see how we could do
anything else we're bound to do that
got no alternative but it does mean that
each one of us forms a systematically
distorted view of the world because it's
in because it's all built up on what
accidentally happens to be the
particular and really rather narrow
experience of the individual who does it
now do you think that something of that
kind applies to man as a whole because
of the reasons implicit in your theory
that is to say that the the whole
picture that mankind has formed of the
cosmos of the universe of the world must
be systematically distorted and what's
more drastically limited by the nature
of the particular apparatus for
understanding that he happens to have
well I think that is undoubtedly the
case but again I would question the use
of the word limited which carries
unfortunate suggestions that is I assume
that one of our faculties one of our
mental organs if you like is let's call
it a science forming capacity a capacity
to create intelligible explanatory
theories in some domain and if we look
at the history of science we discover
that time after time when particular
questions were posed at a particular
level of understanding it was possible
to make very innovative leaps of the
imagination two rich explanatory
theories that presented an intelligible
picture of that sub domain of the
universe often long theories as we later
discovered but there's a course that's
followed and this gives this could have
been the case only because we do have
and we in fact share across the species
a some kind of a science forming
capacity that is that limits us as you
say but at the same in the same but same
token provides the possibility of
creating explanatory theories that
extend so vastly far beyond any evidence
that's available I mean it simply
important to realize that should be
obvious say but it's worth saying that
when when it's when a new theory is
created and I don't necessarily mean
newton of them even a small theory what
the scientist is typically doing first
of all he has very limited evidence the
theory goes far far beyond the evidence
secondly much of the evidence that's
available is typically disregarded that
if it's put to the side in the hope that
somebody else will take care of it
someday and we can forget about so at
every stage in the history of science
there's even the normal science not you
know kuhnian revolutions there's a high
degree of idealization that jousan so
the selection of evidence the distortion
of evidence creation of new theory a
confirmation or a refutation or
modification of that theory further
idealization these are all very curious
steps now we're capable of nevertheless
we can often make them and make them in
a way which is intelligible to others
doesn't look like some random act of the
imagination and where that's possible we
can we can develop intelligible theories
we can gain some comprehension of the
nature of this aspect of the world now
this is possible only because we are
rigidly pre-programmed again because we
have somehow developed through evolution
or however the specific Faculty of
forming very particular theories of
course it follows at once sir please
follow it's reasonable to assume that
this very faculty which enables us to
construct extremely rich and successful
theories in some domain may lead us very
far astray and some other domain for
example there may be some you know again
I'm a Martian scientists looking at us
and observing our successes and errors
from a higher intelligence let's say
might be being used to discover that
whereas in some domains we seem to be
able to make scientific progress in
other domains we always seem to be
running up against a blank wall because
our minds are so constructive that we
just can't make the intellectual
leaflets required we can't formulate the
concepts we don't have the categories
that are required to gain insight into
that domain do you think that if our
study of language forming capacity and
hence our cognitive capacities as you
call them our abilities to know and
understand and learn if these studies
the jaw pioneering result in an enormous
amount of increased knowledgeable
beliefs human faculties do you think
it's at all likely that that increased
knowledge will enable us to change and
indeed expand the faculties that I think
is extremely unlikely because I think
the faculties are a biological given we
may study the structure of the heart but
we don't do so because we think it's
possible to replace the heart by another
kind of pump would say which might be
more efficient similarly here I think if
if we ever did gain a real comprehension
of the mental organs we would not we
might that might help us in cases of
pathology marginal cases in other words
but I wouldn't see how that could be of
any way at least with our present
science so for no plausible science of
modifying these capacities what we might
do however is games I mean at least it's
in theory imaginable that we might
discover something about the limits of
our science forming abilities we might
discover for example that some kinds of
questions simply fall beyond the area
where we are capable of constructing
explanatory theories and I think we even
maybe now have some glimmerings of
insight into where this delineation
might be between intelligible theories
that fall within our comprehension and
areas where no such theory is possible
well the case that we discussed before
maybe one take take the question of if
you go back to the you know take back to
the early histories of science history
of science early origins of science
speculation and people were raising
questions about say the heavenly bodies
and about the sources of human action
well we're asking exactly the same
questions now about the source of human
action there's been no progress we have
no idea how to approach this question
within framework of science we can write
novels about it but we can't construct
even forth scientific theories about it
we still have nothing to say when we
asked look for the question how does a
person make a decision
in a certain manner and not some other
manner when it's a free decision we just
have no way of dealing with that issue
on the other hand the history physics
let's say has had substantial advances
and very it's very likely I think that
that should the secret of massive
difference in progress and one domain
and an affluent blank wall when another
reflects the specific properties of our
science forming capacities we might even
be able to show that someday if it's
true so far we've been rather talking in
those discussions if all organized
thinking is done in language but of
course that in fact isn't serviced and I
mean one can take all kinds of examples
in music is one that appeals to me very
much if you get a composer like
Stravinsky conduct composing a
fantastically complicated and original
and indeed revolutionary score like that
of the Rite of Spring for an enormous
Orchestra then he's celebrating at an
original and complicated and very
sophisticated level and he's probably
celebrating in as elaborate way as
anybody else's who's doing anything and
what's more he's creating a structure
which is publicly articulated and so on
and yet words don't come into this
process at any point as far as one can
gather does that fact and other facts
like you lose any threat to your
theories well not really I mean in fact
quite the contrary my assumption is that
the mind is not a uniform system that
it's a highly differentiated system in
fact like the body it's essentially a
system of faculties or organs and
language is simply one of them I don't
it we don't have to go to the level of
Stravinsky to find examples of thinking
without language I'm sure that everyone
who introspect who thinks about what he
himself is doing will know at once that
much of his thinking doesn't involve
language or say well the thinking of a
cat that's a plan that doesn't involve
language there are other modes of
thought there are the faculties and I
think that the musical faculty is one
one which is particularly interesting I
think because it's extremely likely in
fact it here's an area in a sense like
physics that is where very rapid and
rich development took place in a way
which was over a long period of
say Western history in a way which was
very intelligible to others I mean not
immediately that after a short period
and strikingly well there is a striking
feature of the 20th century in this
respect that is with the the the musical
creation of the 20th century I think is
qualitatively different from that of say
the 18th century in that it lacks that
that immediate axis or short-term access
that was true of the past I one would
have to do an experiment to prove it but
I have no doubt that if we took a child
of today two children of today let's
hear two groups and taught one of them
say Mozart Haydn and Beethoven and what
the other one Schoenberg and question
Bergen music that it would be very
substantial difference in their capacity
to comprehend it and deal with it and
that may reflect in fact if that's
correct it would reflect something about
error innate musical capacities points
of this maker have been discussed for
some time I remember Paul Hindemith the
about twenty-five years ago I think
getting lectures argued that to violate
the tonal principle and music would be
something like an effort to violate the
principle of gravitation I take it he
meant by that that it was an innate
problem well we might say in his breath
I don't pursue the musical analogy too
far because I was using that really only
as an illustration what it illustrates
is the fact that you think we are
pre-programmed in fact a lot of things
don't you I mean no doubt to use gesture
or recognize faces or common sense view
of the world and so on
well every area of human existence that
even worth studying is worth studying
because rich and complex structures are
developed in a uniform way otherwise
it's not worth studying and those are
precisely the case is where we expect to
have would to discover pre-programming
that makes possible these great
achievements so in other words you think
that everything that we do makes
manifest our pre-programming
games institutions the way we dress the
way we eat everything well here again I
think some caution is necessary for
exempted games I'm speculating obviously
but it seems to me reasonable to suppose
that games
are designed so as to be in a sense at
the outer limits of our cognitive
capacities we don't make up games that
are in which we are as skilled as we are
in using words let's say that wouldn't
be an interesting game everybody can do
too much what we do it we make up games
like say chess which is an
extraordinarily simple game that is its
rule system is utterly trivial but
nevertheless we're just not we're not
very good at it as in the case of using
language we're all extraordinarily good
and we're essentially undifferentiated
to something like chess which I assume
is at the borders of our cognitive
capacity then individuals a very similar
intellectual makeup will nevertheless
diverge very significantly in their
ability to deal with these exotic
problems that's what makes it an
interesting game and in fact I think
there are also tasks that can be
constructed that are really outside our
cognitive capacities and in fact I think
there's even a field that's devoted to
the developing such tasks it's called
psychology much of modern psychology has
been concerned to discover tasks which
would yield species uniform laws that is
laws that are essentially hold across
number of species or to construct good
experiments that is experiments that
have slow learning curves with regular
increments and so on and so forth and
there are such tasks a maze running in
which rats are about as good as humans
and both are quite terrible and these I
think are in fact precisely tasks that
do lie outside of our cognitive capacity
so we do proceed by trial and error and
by induction and so on but centrally
your whole approach represents a
rejection of the empirical tradition in
in philosophy it doesn't it because I
mean the very fact that you think that
the empiricists are wrong about how we
learn must mean that they're wrong about
knowledge and the nature of knowledge
and the nature of knowledge has been the
central problem in the whole empirical
tradition of philosophy well the
classical empiricist tradition which I
think was the traditions represented
let's say presidents highest worn by
Hume seems to me to be a up to that
tradition of it's true
importance in that a particular theory
of the origins of knowledge fact of the
science of human nature in human phrase
was put forth an empirical theory and I
think Hume for example would regard it
as an empirical theory did regard it so
when we investigated I think we discover
that it's just completely false that is
that the mechanisms that he discussed
are not the mechanisms by which the mind
reaches states of knowledge that the
states of knowledge attained are
radically different than the kinds that
he discussed for example for Hume the
mind was in his image a kind of a
theater in which ideas paraded across
the stage and we it therefore followed
necessarily that we could introspect
completely into the contents of our mind
if an idea is not on the stage it's not
in the mind and the ideas may be
connected and associated in fact he went
on to say there isn't even any theater
there's just the ideas and that respect
the image is misleading well that's a
that's a theory and in fact it's a
theory that has had a an enormous grip
on the imagination throughout most of
his to my knowledge most of history of
Western thought for example that that
same image dominates the rationalist
tradition as well where it was assumed
that one could exhaust the contents of
the mind by careful attention you know
you could really develop those clear and
distinct ideas and their consequences
and so on and in fact even if you move
to someone let's say like Freud with is
a vocation of the unconscious still I
think that a careful reading suggests
that he regarded the unconscious as in
principle act accessible that is we
could really perceive that theater and
stage and the things on it carefully if
only the barriers of repression and so
on could be overcome well if what I've
been suggesting is correct that's just
that's radically wrong I mean even wrong
as a point of departure
there is no reason at all that I can see
for believing that the the principles of
mental computation that enter so
intimately into where action or our
interaction or our speech to believe
that those principles have are at all
accessible introspection any more than
the
analyzing mechanisms of our visual
system or for that matter the nature of
our liver is accessible to introspection
it seems to me that over and over again
you come back to the same point that is
to say that many of the particular
problems discussed and theories put
forward by philosophers in the main but
also psychologists and you just
mentioned Freud and in your writing as
you mentioned many others are in fact
theories about physical processes they
are therefore open to checking by
investigation and when you check my
investigation you'll find out that the
theories are wrong and therefore you are
as it were radically subversive of a lot
of very well-established theories in our
tradition it seems to me that what you
put forward in their place over and over
again in fact does parallel the
rationalist tradition I said in my
introduction to this program that what
I'm always reminded of by your work is
the theories of Comte you seem to me to
be almost redoing in terms of modern
linguistics what Kant was doing do you
accept any truth in that well right not
only accept truth in it but I've tried
to bring it out in a certain way however
I haven't myself specifically referred
to Kant but rather to the primarily to
the 17th century tradition of the
Continental Cartesians and the British
neoplatonist
who developed many of the ideas that are
now much more familiar in the writings
of Conte for example the idea of
experience conforming to our mode of
cognition or the well particularly in
the British platanus Cudworth for
example there are I believe is a rich
mine of insight into the organizing
principles of the mind about which
experience is structured in fact I think
problem that some of the richest
psychological sorts of psychological
insights that I know I and that's the
one it's this tradition that I think
that can be fleshed out and made more
explicit by the kinds of empirical
inquiry that are now possible of course
I think we also have to diverge from
that tradition in a number of respects
I've mentioned one namely the belief
with the contents of the mind or open
introspection similarly we there's
certainly no reason to accept the
metaphysis
of that tradition to believe that
there's a dualism of mind and body I
mean you can see why the Cartesians were
led to that it was a rational move on
their part but it's not a move that we
have to follow we have other ways of
approaching that question another thing
that I say I mentioned in my
introduction with the fact that you've
made two international reputations the
other one besides linguistics being as a
political activist and it does seem to
me that there is a connection between
these two careers of yours and I want to
put this to you really in the form of a
question
liberalism grew up in the history of
European thought in very close
relationship to empirical philosophy and
scientific method the battlecry really
in all three was don't accept anything
on the say-so of established Authority
look at the facts and judge for yourself
this was revolutionary in politics
science and philosophy and because of
this liberalism has always been regarded
in the Western tradition as the main
anti-authoritarian political Creed but
just as you've rejected empiricism
you've also rejected liberalism and you
now say in your writings that whatever
may have been true in the past
liberalism has now become the ally of
authority would you accept that there is
this underlying connection between your
work in linguistics and well to put it
dramatically your opposition to the
Vietnam War well this raises quite a
welter of questions let me begin by
saying something about liberalism which
is a very complicated concept I think
it's correct
surely that liberalism grew up in the
intellectual environment of the
empiricism and the rejection of
authority and Trust in the evidence of
the senses and so on however liberalism
has undergone a very complex evolution
it has a social philosophy over the
years if we go back to the classics or
at least what I regard as the classics
say for example on both limits of state
action which inspired nil and is a true
libertarian liberal classic it was like
the the world that humbled was
considering which was partially an
imaginary world but the world for which
he was developing this political
philosophy was a post futile but
pre-capitalist
that it was a it was a world in which
there is no great divergence among
individuals in the kind of power that
they have and what they command let's
say but there was a tremendous disparity
between individuals on one hand and the
state on the other consequently it was
the task of a liberalism that was
concerned with human rights and equality
of individuals and so on
it was the task of that liberalism to
dissolve the enormous power of the state
which was such a an authoritarian threat
to individual liberties and from that
you develop a classical liberal theory
and say Humboldt Urmila sense well of
course that is pre-capitalist he
couldn't conceive of any era in which a
corporation would be regarded as an
individual it's a or in which such an
enormous in which enormous disparities
and control over resources and
production would distinguish between
individuals in a massive fashion now in
that kind of a society to take the
Humboldt in view is a very superficial
liberalism because while opposition to
state power in an era of such divergence
conforms to Humboldt's conclusions it
doesn't do so for his reasons that is
his reasons lead to very different
conclusions in that case namely I think
his reasons
lead to the conclusion that we must
dissolve the authoritarian control over
production and resources which leads to
such divergences among individuals in
fact I think one might draw a direct
line between classical liberalism and
the kind of libertarian socialism which
I think can be regarded as the as a kind
of an adapting of the basic reasoning of
classical liberalism to a very different
social hero now if we come to the modern
period here liberalism has taken on a
very strange sense if you think of its
history now now the realism is
essentially the theory of state
capitalism of state intervention in a
capitalist economy well there's very
little relation to classical liberalism
in fact classical liberalism is what's
now called conservatism I suppose but
this new view I think really is it in my
my my view at least highly authoritarian
position that is it's one which accepts
a number of centers of authority and
control
State on the one hand agglomerations of
private power on the other hand all
interacting with individuals as
malleable cogs in this highly
constrained machine which may be called
democratic but given the the the actual
distribution of power is very far from
being meaningfully democratic and cannot
be so so my own feeling has always been
that to achieve the classical liberal
ideals for the reasons that led to them
being put forth in a society so
different we must be led in a very
different direction
oh it's superficial and erroneous to
accept the conclusions which were
reached for a different Society and not
to consider the reasoning of it led to
those conclusions the reasoning I think
is very substantially I'm a classical
liberal in this sense but I think it
leads me to be a kind of an anarchist
all right an anarchist socialist and
well I'd love to pursue you down that
road mr. Chomsky but that would be a new
discussion of the new program so I think
we must laugh in there thank you very
much
